    <p>  To minimize such risks, before concluding a CASCO agreement, it is worthwhile to carefully study the reliability rating of insurance companies. </p><h2>  How important is the financial position of the UK </h2><p>  When compiling any <span>rating of insurance companies</span> for CASCO payments, regardless of whether it is popular or conducted by licensed agencies, it takes into account how insurer is financially stable.  In this case, you must pay attention to the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  what capital does the <span>insurance company have</span> ; </li><li>  the volume of insurance obligations of the company may not exceed the assets of the organization of the insurer; </li><li>  any self-respecting and reliable insurance company always has reliable partners; </li><li>  tariff policy should be as open as possible. </li></ul><p>  In addition, when compiling insurance company ratings for CASCO payments, a huge number of other nuances are taken into account, including the year the organization was founded and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Standard designations in ratings </h2><p>  In order to make it more convenient to form IC positions, a conditional system for determining the reliability of firms is provided.  The highest is the Latin letter A. Firms that are least trusted have a rating of D. </p><p>  In addition, after the letter designation, the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign is often placed, which indicates that this SC has great advantages. </p><p>  When compiling a rating of insurance companies for CASCO payments, the level of quality of the services provided is simultaneously taken into account, how profitable are the organizations' tariff plans and many other parameters. </p><h2>  Ingosstrakh </h2><p>  The authorized capital of the company today is 74.9 billion rubles.  At the same time, IC received a rather high mark of reliability A ++.  If we talk about the level of payments for hull insurance, it is 74.5%.  Only 1.8% of customers receive failures when an insured event occurs. </p><p>  This company is considered one of the best in the <span>rating of insurance companies</span> for CASCO payments today.  Ingosstrakh appeared back in 1947 and during that time became the most popular in Russia. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the peculiarities of insurance of this company, now it is possible to apply for CASCO under the Premium program, which includes rather favorable conditions for customers.  For example, the possibility of reimbursing the cost of evacuating a car from the scene of an accident.  In addition, the client does not have to visit the office in order to record an insured event.  All procedures can be performed remotely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the premium on the CASCO policy exceeds 80 thousand rubles, then the client can receive VIP status.  This means that the insurance holder will be able to use the services of an emergency commissioner and will receive directions for cash payments or auto repairs directly at the scene of the accident. </p><h2>  Rosgosstrakh </h2><p>  This organization ranks second in the rating of insurance companies for CASCO payments in the insurance market.  Its authorized capital today amounts to almost 123 billion rubles.  Rating of this COP A ++.  At the same time, Rosgosstrakh customers receive refusals to pay extremely rarely (no more than 1% of all applicants). </p><p>  This company was organized back in 1991, becoming the successor of the State Insurance of the RSFSR. </p><p>  If we talk about the benefits of CASCO in this insurance company, then it is worth highlighting: </p><ul><li>  round-the-clock customer service; </li><li>  the possibility of receiving compensation for tow truck services (not more than 3 thousand rubles); </li><li>  Loyal attitude to drivers with a short driving experience. </li></ul>

    <p>  In addition, after applying for payment, the UK does not require the submission of documents from the traffic police or other competent authorities. </p><p>  VIP service can be obtained subject to an insurance premium of more than 75 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  RESO </h2><p>  If you focus on the top best <span>insurance companies</span> by rating on CASCO payments, then this organization is in third place.  Today its authorized capital is 58 billion rubles.  The reliability assessment is stably kept at A ++.  However, at the same time, 2.7% of those who applied for insurance claims receive refusals. </p><p>  The company appeared in 1991 and today offers customers a standard package of services. </p><h2>  "Al insurance" </h2><p>  This company takes the 4th position in the rating of insurance companies for CASCO payments.  Its authorized capital today amounts to 52.8 billion rubles.  When assessing the reliability of A ++, this insurance company refuses payments in 2.6% of insured events.

    <p>  If we talk about CASCO services, then today the organization offers 3 types of insurance: </p><ul><li>  "Naked Alpha".  When contacting the company, you must provide information from the traffic police.  In case of unlawful actions on the part of one road user in relation to the holder of the insurance policy, damage is paid only after a criminal case has been instituted. </li><li>  "Business".  In this case, there is no need to submit certificates.  If the cost of a car is more than 1.6 million rubles, then the services of an emergency commissioner are provided. </li><li>  "All inclusive".  No inquiries.  <span>An emergency commissioner is</span> provided regardless of the cost of the car. </li></ul><h2>  VSK </h2><p>  In fifth place in the rating of insurance companies for CASCO payments is IC, founded in 1992.  The authorized capital of this company is slightly more than 38 billion rubles.  The reliability rating of VSK is the same as that of other rating leaders.  If we talk about refusals of payments, then they receive no more than 2.1% of applicants.  This is a pretty low rate. </p><p>  If we talk about the standard CASCO package of this company, then in addition to round-the-clock customer service, all policyholders can use free tow truck services regardless of the person‚Äôs territorial location. </p>

    <p>  Certificates from the traffic police are not required if the damage does not exceed 5% of the agreed insurance amount.  There is also the possibility of free collection of documents in the traffic police if the premium on the policy is more than 25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Sogaz, Soglasie, Alliance and VTB are distinguished by good reliability indicators.  All of them also received an A ++ rating for reliability.  At the same time, firms are distinguished by impressive authorized capitals and favorable conditions for customers. </p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that if one or another company is not in the rating of insurance companies for CASCO payments in the market, they can still successfully exist and carry out their activities within the framework of the law.  Therefore, when choosing an insurer, it is worthwhile to independently study reviews about it and clarify the level of its reliability. </p>
