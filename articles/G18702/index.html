Phnom Penh is not only the capital of Cambodia, but also one of the largest cities. </p><p>  For a long time it was considered one of the most beautiful Asian capitals, however, after the revolution and war, many buildings of historical importance were destroyed.  Now the city is completely restored and turned into a metropolis with modern architecture. </p><h2>  City features </h2><p>  Not far from the banks of the Mekong River is the vibrant capital of Cambodia - Phnom Penh.  It was once considered the most beautiful city built by the French before the war.  The city attracts tourists with its local architecture. </p><p>  Phnom Penh Airport closes at 2 a.m. and opens at 6 a.m.  This must be taken into account when planning your trip.  The easiest and quickest way to get from the airport is by taxi.  Its cost is 10-15 euros, it all depends on the area.  Right in the parking lot, you can rent a tuk-tuk for 6-7 euros or a scooter for exactly the same price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of Cambodia" class="if uuid-3214074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3214074.jpg"></div><p>  Not everyone knows where Phnom Penh is located.  First you need to find Cambodia on a map, and then find the largest city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Major Attractions </h2><p>  The city has a lot of interesting places to visit.  One of the most famous sights of Phnom Penh is considered a monastery.  It is located on a hill near the Sisovat promenade.  The cost of visiting is about 1 dollar.  Also, tourists are offered to rent an elephant.  The cost of a walk is 15 dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="centranahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night city" class="if uuid-3213396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213396.jpg"></div><p>  Another attraction of Phnom Penh, which is popular with tourists, is the palace and pagoda.  However, to inspect them, you need to dress so that your shoulders and legs are covered.  If the clothes do not fit, then right at the entrance you can rent things, leaving only 1 dollar as collateral.  You should also visit Wat Botum Temple, located near the King's Palace. </p><p>  Among the main attractions of Phnom Penh, there are many museums.  They feature many different exhibits.  In the national museum, the most important is the statue of King Jayavarman VII in a meditation position. </p><p>  The Tole Slang Genocide Museum has a very tragic history.  Once this historic building was the most ordinary school, which the Khmer Rouge during the revolution turned into a prison.  Several thousand people were kept in this place for several years, and all of them were killed.  Only 8 people managed to get out alive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  It is located in the heart of the city right on the Tonle Sap promenade.  This is the main residence of kings and the most valuable monument of architecture.  The Royal Palace of Cambodia contains all the most important historical sites.  A special place is occupied by Buddha monuments carved from precious wood, and monolithic stone blocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveller.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palace" class="if uuid-3213399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213399.jpg"></div><p>  The territory of the palace is known for its garden of amazing beauty.  It resembles the design of the Tuileries and Versailles parks.  Everyone who falls into this amazing place will forever remember this atmosphere of calm and silence. </p><p>  Sightseeing should begin with a visit to the Royal Palace.  Here, ceremonial and official state events are still taking place.  If you're lucky, you can even see with your own eyes the crowned persons.  You need to remember the dress code.  Be sure to keep your shoulders and knees closed. </p><h2>  Pagoda </h2><p>  This is just an incredible sight that you can not miss.  The floor of the silver pagoda in Phnom Penh is lined with silver bars, thanks to which it got its name.  She will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mekongdragonhotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver pagoda" class="if uuid-3213400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213400.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the tomb of the king, the imprint of the Buddha, many statues of the deity in full growth, as well as a pavilion for ceremonies.  Fancy golden roofs, snow-white walls and massive stairs will allow tourists to make many unique photos. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  National Museum </h2><p>  The terracotta buildings, made in a traditional style, look simply grandiose.  The National Museum of Cambodia has 14 thousand exhibits, namely items: </p><ul><li>  culture; </li><li>  life; </li><li>  religion. </li></ul><p>  The fenced area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex leaves no one indifferent.  Here you can walk for hours.  Tourists admire the ponds with sparkling fish, gardens with gazebos, shady trees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="angkorfocus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National Museum" class="if uuid-3213408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213408.jpg"></div><p>  The most valuable exhibit of the collection is an impressive collection of sculptures, which occupies 4 rooms.  It is best to start the excursion from the last pavilion and at the same time move clockwise to examine all the objects in the chronological order of their appearance. </p><p>  The first exhibit is considered part of the statue of the god Vishnu, which was discovered during excavations in the twentieth century.  Only the head, shoulders and arms of the deity have survived.  Another exhibit that deserves attention is the ship of the royal family, which served as a means of transportation along the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers. </p><p>  Many are struck by the design and beauty of the casket designed to store betel.  It has the shape of a bird‚Äôs body with a human head.  The National Museum of Cambodia is open daily from 8:00 to 17:00.  Adults can enjoy the sights for just $ 5, and for children under 12 years old admission is free. </p><h2>  Museum of Genocide </h2><p>  From 1975 to 1979, when the dictator Pol Pot ruled, it was a very difficult time.  Then brutally tortured and killed a huge number of people.  The exact death toll is still unknown. </p><p>  Supporters of the dictatorship for a long time hid the burial places of the victims.  The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum was previously an ordinary school, and then it was rebuilt in prison.  According to scientific research, more than 20 thousand prisoners were tortured in the territory of this institution.  They were all shot before and after the torture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": Keri Oberly, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Genocide" class="if uuid-3213412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213412.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Now a museum has been opened at this place.</span>  <span>As exhibits on the walls of the former prison hung photographs of people killed.</span>  <span>In addition to local residents, foreigners from New Zealand, Australia and the United States were held in prison.</span> </p><p>  When the revolution reached its peak, it began to gradually destroy itself.  Generations of executioners who worked in prison were killed by their successors.  About 100 people died daily.  At the time of liberation from the dictatorial regime of Phnom Penh, only a few prisoners were found alive.  And in the interior and the courtyard were found the bodies of 14 prisoners, tortured to death.  Their burial in the yard is also part of the exhibition. </p><p>  A visit to the museum is not for the faint of heart, as simple school buildings, a playground and a quiet courtyard are adjacent to rusty beds, portraits of prisoners and instruments of torture. </p><p>  For those who are interested in the history of the country, this tour will be very useful.  This will allow you to find out the details of terrible times and better understand the features of amazing local culture.  This nightmare will forever remain in the memory of local residents and gives a difficult lesson to humanity. </p><h2>  Independence Monument </h2><p>  This is one of Phnom Penh's most vibrant and famous attractions.  The Monument is located on the side of the Tonle Sap promenade, not far from AEON Mall.  The monument was erected in 1958 in honor of the fifth anniversary of independence. </p><p>  Now this building looks quite eclectic against the background of nearby buildings under construction.  This is a very popular place with foreign tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": Peter Stuckings, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Independence Monument" class="if uuid-3213415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213415.jpg"></div><p>  The monument was erected in the form of a Khmer stupa-lotus.  To some, it looks more like a pineapple.  The style of this amazing building was not chosen by chance, as it resembles the great temple of Angkor Wat and many other historical buildings. </p><p>  During the most significant public holidays, this monument becomes the main object, around which all local residents and foreign visitors gather.  Inside the pedestal, members of the royal family and senior government officials light a festive fire. </p><h2>  Friendship Monument </h2><p>  This monument is made in the spirit of the Soviet Union.  The monument of friendship between Cambodia and Vietnam is a pedestal on which Khmer and Vietnamese soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder, guarding a woman. </p><p>  The monument was erected in 1979 and commissioned by the Vietnamese communists in memory of the good, friendly relations between the two countries, which were established immediately after the overthrow of the tyrant Paul Pot and his dictatorship. </p><h2>  Wat Phnom </h2><p>  In the northern part of the city there is a majestic temple, of which not much is known, although it is this amazing monastery that the locals consider the main religious building.  It is located on Wat Phnom Hill. </p><p>  Here, a person literally plunges into another world, since the atmosphere of peace, tranquility, silence and spirituality completely deprives negative thoughts about everyday worries and problems.  Man forgets about fatigue and everything else.  The soul is literally filled with peace, harmony and positive emotions. </p><p>  Wat Phnom is a fairly popular tourist destination in Cambodia.  Here you can take walks with children in the fresh air, learn more about the history of the city, get inspired by painting and participate in the process of offering spirits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wat Phnom" class="if uuid-3213417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213417.jpg"></div><p>  To fully enjoy your vacation in this unusual place, it will take at least 4 hours, but they will fly by.  The temple looks quite unusual in the evening, as lighting is lit near the rooms and sculptures. </p><p>  The entrance to the temple is on the east side.  An original staircase leads to the main gate.  The railings are bronze snakes, and the walls are decorated with beautiful, mysterious, mystical paintings of dragons.  The entrance fee is symbolic, only 1 dollar. </p><p>  In the very center of the temple is the sanctuary of the Buddha Stupa, where bronze figurines are located, which, according to legend, the widow Stump once found.  Locals still come here to pray. </p><h2>  Death fields </h2><p>  The policy of the dictatorial regime was not only the complete destruction of the traces of power, but also all those who were related to it.  The future prisoner was initially given a warning, then he was taken to prison, and all this ended with the execution of the prisoner. </p><p>  Confessions of imperfect crimes, as well as revolutionary thoughts, were knocked out of people in various ways.  Then they were sent to Tuol Sleng, where painful torture continued and executions were carried out.  People were dying in terrible torment. </p><p>  Not everyone was executed, many died of hunger and exhaustion, intestinal infections, wounds and torture.  There were a huge number of dead.  Every week, the bodies were taken out by truck and buried in very deep pits.  The largest mass grave is the death fields of Choeng Ek. </p><p>  After some time, a temple was erected on this site in memory of all the victims.  Its transparent walls are filled with skulls that were found in common graves. </p><p>  Getting to the death field is not easy enough and you can do it only by taxi, since this burial is located 15 km from Phnom Penh.  The road will take about half an hour.  The museum complex is open daily.  Tourists are offered a free viewing of a short documentary as part of the tour.  Taking pictures indoors is prohibited.  On the territory of the death field are previously uncovered the general burial of prisoners, and untouched graves. </p><h2>  National park </h2><p>  This is the largest park in the country.  It occupies approximately 3300 square meters.  km  The vast territory of the Virachey National Park is still not fully understood, therefore, scientists here are constantly conducting their research. </p><p>  Visitors can take a walk even a few days, therefore, on the territory of the park you can meet entire tent cities.  In the Virachey National Park, you can plunge into the unique forest flora, try to get through the jungle, stroll through sunny meadows and swim under the waterfall. </p><p>  The local fauna simply surprises visitors, as leopards, elephants, bears, tigers live in the park.  You need to be very careful and go around the places of their congestion marked on the map of Cambodia.  All tourists must visit it. </p><h2>  Lotus temple </h2><p>  Wat Botum is located on Okhan Suor Srun Street and is a large complex consisting of several separate buildings, including a school and stupas.  The facility is located on the west side of the park. </p><p>  The Blooming Lotus Temple was built by the direction of King Ponhoe Yat and is one of the most important and original pagodas in Phnom Penh.  It got its name from the fact that a lotus pond was located at this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cambodia-tourism.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus temple" class="if uuid-3213420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45410/3213420.jpg"></div><p>  For hundreds of years, high-ranking dignitaries, politicians and monks were buried in stupas on the territory of the complex.  The monastery and pagoda were made in a modern style in 1937, and in the 70s of the twentieth century were closed by the Khmer Rouge, but they were not destroyed.  In 1979, the pagoda was again opened and until today is used for its intended purpose. </p><p>  On the outside of the attraction there are several fairly visible and significant statues.  To the left of the main entrance is a large stupa, which is guarded by snakes and giants with daggers in their teeth.  Inside the temple is decorated with scenes from the life of the Buddha. </p>
