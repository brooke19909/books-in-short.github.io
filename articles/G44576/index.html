Top 10</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The year 2016 is drawing to a close, which means that most of the flagship presentations of various IT companies have already died down.  Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Samsung - the long-suffering Galaxy Note 7, LG showed the V20, Meizu presented the Pro 6. </p><p>  And if there are no more new flagships that can excite the minds of the public and specialized publications, then we can distinguish leaders in different categories from all the new products in 2016.  For example, in cameras.  Shooting modules over the past two years have stepped up significantly in color rendering, image quality and smoothness.  Therefore, you can try to answer the question: "What is the best camera on a smartphone in 2016?" </p><h2>  TOP 10 best camera phones 2016 </h2><p>  In the sections that follow, ten smartphones of this and last year, which can rightfully be called flagship camera phones, will be highlighted, their main features and advantages over competitors will be highlighted.  Opinion may not coincide with generally accepted, because people evaluate the quality of photos and videos.  And how many people, so many opinions.  So, we present to your attention the top 10 smartphones with the best camera in 2016. </p><h2>  Tenth place </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Z5.  Despite the fact that the line of flagship Z smartphones from Sony has already ceased to exist, last year's flagship Z5 still shows a good photo and video shooting result in picture quality that is not much inferior to what the 2016 flagships can offer.  This can be confirmed by the high ratings of the profile publication DXOMark.  The numbers speak for themselves: the auto focus time is 0.03 seconds, and this is on a 23-megapixel matrix!  We can say that the Xperia Z5 is a smartphone with the best camera, however, in 2015. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ninth place </h2><p>  Meizu MX5.  The MX line, once considered flagship, lost this title to the Pro-series, and, accordingly, the technical equipment became slightly worse.  Nevertheless, the Meizu MX6 with its Sony IMX386 camera module with excellent software optimization is still able to deliver excellent photo and video quality in all conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Eighth place </h2><p>  LG G5.  A great camera has always been a feature of LG's flagships.  This happened with the G5, with the only exception that the smartphone was introduced for a long time, and its technical equipment had become outdated.  But this does not mean at all that the quality of the shooting has worsened.  Not at all.  In fact, now the LG G5 takes pictures and shoots videos that are comparable in quality to the work of budget ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù.  However, we emphasize that many amateur photographers note that the G5 has the best camera on a smartphone.  Well, that's their opinion. </p>

    <h2>  Seventh place </h2><p>  <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6S / 6S Plus.  Even despite the fact that the Cupertin company updated its flagship smartphone lineup, the devices of the previous generation, due to excellent optimization and correctly selected software, are removed at the level of some of the flagships of 2016.  Both the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are clear evidence of this.  Branded iSight cameras always remain relevant for quite some time, even after the release of a new generation of devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sixth place </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Note 5. The flagship of the phablet line of the South Korean company was released somewhat later than the super-successful Galaxy S6, which means it received more modern equipment.  Thanks to the main camera with 16 megapixels, the device is capable of recording video in 4K format.  It is also worth considering that the camera software allows the user to customize it to fit their needs and requirements.  For many, to this day, the Galaxy Note 5 is a smartphone with the best camera. </p><h2>  Fifth place </h2><p>  Huawei Nexus 6P.  The latest generation of Nexus smartphones from Google, which were replaced by devices from the Pixel line, greatly pleased users with their characteristics, design, and quality in general.  Especially Huawei Nexus 6P.  The Chinese have equipped the smartphone with a camera with high photosensitivity and high-quality matrix at 12.3 megapixels.  But megapixels do not solve everything.  The optimization and software of the camera module are of decisive importance.  And with all this, the Nexus 6P is flawless.  Many netizens even now ask a question: ‚ÄúWhich smartphone has the best camera?‚Äù  unequivocally answer: "At Nexus 6P". </p>

    <h2>  Fourth place </h2><p>  Samsung <span>Galaxy S7 / S7 edge.</span>  The latest generation of smartphones from a South Korean company shows the quality of the level of shooting, comparable to semi-professional cameras.  Why is it only the fourth place, because many say that this is a smartphone with the best camera?  The answer to this question will be given a little later.  Suffice it to say that buying the <span>Galaxy S7 / S7 edge</span> just because of the excellent camera will be more than justified.  This device combines the qualities of not only an excellent working device, but also a first-class ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among other things, selfie lovers say that the S7 / S7 edge is a smartphone with the best <span>front-facing camera.</span>  It is difficult to disagree with this, especially considering that the front-end flagship module from Samsung takes pictures and shoots video of a quality that the main cameras of some smartphones do not reach. </p><h2>  Third place </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Despite all the failures that haunt the seventh <span>Galaxy</span> Note <span>model</span> , the smartphone is one of the best representatives of the segment in its characteristics.  You can verify this by watching only a couple of photos or videos taken with this device.  Their quality, detail and stabilization (for video) will say it all for themselves.  Although in fact the camera module installed in Note 7 is not much different from the one that the S7 and S7 edge are equipped with. </p>

    <h2>  Second place </h2><p>  Apple iPhone 7. Predictable?  Still would!  Almost every specialized publication considers it their duty to highlight the revolutionary iPhone 7 camera. And the most interesting thing is that this is quite true.  Tests have shown that the camera of the new iPhone 7 is indeed an order of magnitude higher than all its predecessors: both the iPhone 6S, and especially the iPhone SE.  But is the quality of pictures and video on the new generation iPhone so different from the flagships of Samsung? </p><h2>  First Place: Apple iPhone 7 Plus </h2><p>  A whole year there were rumors that the company from Cupertino will present a new flagship with a camera, which had not yet been in smartphones before.  Rumors turned out to be true.  The best camera on a smartphone, perhaps, is installed in the new iPhone.  The plus version of the seventh model makes surprisingly realistic shots, the quality level of which is not much lower than on professional "SLRs". </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that the last four positions cannot be called sustainable.  For example, the Galaxy Note 7 could well take the first place. This smartphone deserves it in the same way as the Galaxy S7.  The eternal struggle between Samsung and Apple in the smartphone segment has also made itself felt here. </p><p>  This does not mean that the seventh generation iPhone is bad.  Not.  They are in no way inferior to the seventh generation of flagships from Samsung, like the Galaxy line, in turn, is no worse than the new iPhone.  This means that there is no fundamental difference between the flagships of the Cupertinians and Ezhnokoreans.  They all can claim first place.  And which one to choose is a matter of taste only, because the technical characteristics in all four devices are at the highest level. </p><p>  It turns out that a definite answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhich smartphone has the best camera (2016)?‚Äù  not. </p><h2>  Oneplus 3 </h2><p>  But this is someone who is much more suitable for the fourth position: the third model of the flagship killers - OnePlus 3. The good ‚Äúhardware and A-class camera modules from eminent manufacturers allow the Chinese‚Äú monster ‚Äùto create masterpieces that are not just embarrassing to show to friends or acquaintances, but it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to print, paste in a frame and hang on the wall. </p><h2>  Huawei P9 </h2><p>  What to say about the flagship of 2016 from the largest Chinese manufacturer of smartphones?  Specialists of the Celestial Empire, together with the engineers of the famous German company Leica, were able to develop such a dual camera, which - with the necessary skills and knowledge in the field of photos and video - can take shots of the level of the new iPhone and Galaxy Note 7. So the third position in the top of smartphones with the best cameras can rightly get the Huawei P9.  We can say that the P9 is a Chinese smartphone with the best camera. </p><h2>  Mid-budget cameraphon </h2><p>  The above smartphones, although they have excellent specifications and excellent cameras, but, nevertheless, can not afford some users.  And everyone wants to take good pictures and record high-quality videos.  Just for such people, there is an average segment of smartphones. </p>

    <p>  Surprising as it may seem, the most inexpensive smartphone with a good camera is also the brainchild of Samsung.  The Galaxy A (2016) line of devices at relatively low cost (compared to the flagships) is equipped with excellent camera modules that shoot in a resolution sufficient for everyday use.  A good example to prove this fact is the Galaxy A3 (2016) smartphone. </p><p>  By the way, not only Samsung make excellent camera phones of the middle price segment.  Meizu and Xiaomi also succeeded in this (these companies, in general, succeeded in the entire smartphone market).  Meizu M3 Note and MX4 Pro, as well as Xiaomi Mi4c and Mi4i are able to compete with smartphones of the South Korean manufacturer. </p><h2>  Low budget camera phone </h2><p>  However, for some, to give 15-18 thousand rubles for a smartphone that will be good to take off is also a waste of money.  And for such people there is a budget segment of devices.  Their maximum price is 11 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And the cheapest smartphone with a good camera, according to many network users, is the ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KL.  Now it is available for purchase for about ten thousand rubles.  And for this money, the user gets devices with a 13-megapixel main camera, which has a 2.0 aperture, equipped with laser autofocus. </p>

    <p>  Although an excellent alternative to a smartphone from ASUS may be the Chinese competitor Meizu M3S.  Thanks to the excellent 13-megapixel main camera with phase-locked autofocus and aperture of 2.2, the device produces good quality images and videos for a low-budget smartphone, which is quite enough for publication on Instagram or other everyday purposes. </p><h2>  Chinese camera phone </h2><p>  It is worth noting that smartphones are divided not only by price, but also by country of origin.  This is due to the fact that each country has its own characteristics of smartphone manufacturing.  In America, emphasis is placed on strict corporate design and high performance devices through software optimization, in China - on high technical equipment. </p><p>  For example, the best camera on Chinese smartphones is installed in Meizu Pro 6 - the company's current flagship.  Immediately after the release of the device, many specialized publications around the globe unanimously claimed that it was a smartphone with the best camera.  Meizu devices traditionally have excellent shooting modules.  What can we say about the flagship line.  In terms of image quality, the Pro 6 is ahead of its closest competitor, Xiaomi Mi5. </p>

    <p>  Although Xiaomi Mi5 can also claim this title.  And all thanks to a 16-megapixel camera with excellent optical stabilization comparable to the iPhone 6S.  It allows users to capture all the moments of life in highly detailed frames and widescreen videos with excellent picture quality. </p><p>  Moreover, Xiaomi Mi5 can be bought at a relatively low price for the flagship - about 25,000 rubles, while Meizu Pro 6 costs at least 20,000 rubles.  Such prices for flagship smartphones are a rarity.  Especially when you consider that both companies make high-quality devices. </p><p>  The Huawei sub-brand, Honor, by the way, flagship smartphones are also equipped with high-level camera modules.  An example is Honor 7. For about the same 20-25 thousand, the user gets an excellent device with a 20 MP main camera that produces amazing photo and video quality comparable to 2015 devices, such as the Sony Xperia Z5, for example, or last year‚Äôs flagship killer OnePlus 2. </p><p>  In fact, a huge number of smartphone models of all price categories with excellent cameras are being created and produced in China.  True, with "formally" excellent.  For example, it's no secret that all the flagships of UMi or Oppo are equipped with the latest hardware available on the market.  Very often, for example, you can see smartphones from Chinese manufacturers of the B-class with 6 gigabytes of memory and other "features".  In fact, they work worse than the iPhone 6, where there is only 1 gigabyte of RAM.  The same problem with cameras.  Paradoxically, the modules are supplied by Sony, and as a result, the picture quality is at an average level.  So Xiaomi and Meizu are one of the few companies, so to speak, "rays of light" engaged in the release of a quality product, not mediocrity.  Lenovo and Huawei can be attributed to this category.  But this is not surprising.  This is a business.  A very merchantable business through which huge financial flows pass.  And in order to direct these flows into your ‚Äúpocket‚Äù, you need to be somewhat different from competitors.  And first of all - the quality of products or services. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Thus, it turns out that in the already past 2016, companies launched a huge number of smartphones with amazing cameras that can create real masterpieces in just one click on the screen thanks to modern photo and video processing technologies.  Naturally, the leading market players - Samsung, Apple and Huawei succeeded in this.  But even smaller companies did not lag behind and proved that they can also create real camera phones in the literal sense of the word.  Who knows, maybe the day is not far off when a small device in your pocket can completely replace people with cameras and cameras.  And not only them, but also a personal computer, and many other devices, without which it is now impossible to imagine modern human life. </p>
