The fortification complex is in poor condition, but still there is something to see.  These are the fortress walls with a length of about 2 kilometers, the ruins of the building and the pyramids, and across the road - the church. </p><p>  The fortress complex is an early monument of Russian manor architecture, in style similar to pseudo-Gothic, which is characteristic of the second half of the 18th century. </p><p>  Only 4 towers managed to survive, and even not completely, to two powder cellars, a pyramid.  The first floor of the theater remained. </p><h2>  Owner and builder </h2><p>  Saburovsky fortress (Oryol) was built by Count Kamensky Mikhail Fedorovich (1738-1808).  Construction ended in the second half of the 18th century, when the field marshal returned from the war.  The count was the hero of two wars with the Turks and had deserved fame.  According to some reports, even Suvorov himself considered him the main rival in military affairs. </p><p>  Kamensky was an educated person, had knowledge not only in military affairs, but also studied the exact sciences and literature, even wrote poetry. </p><p>  In 1808, he published the first book in Orel, it was the story of his family.  Earlier, in 1778, a poem entitled "Darling" was received by the publisher.  She was dedicated to his dependents. </p>

    <h2>  Fortress after construction </h2><p>  The count wanted to create a family estate similar to a Turkish fortress.  The walls of the complex were a fence (4 meters high), and the towers were intended for household needs.  A regular park and two estates were laid out behind the walls, of which only the foundation remains today.  A theater was also erected, where theatrical and opera productions took place, there was an orchestra and choir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before the entrance to the estate, 2 pyramids were erected, which were located symmetrically and served to store food, being glaciers. </p><p>  In the territory inherited from the father of the Saburov fortress, the Michael-Archangel Church was already erected.  She stood in the highest place, from where the winding Tzona River could be seen.  The temple was built by the father of Michael back in 1755.  To date, it has lost the bell tower and the two-story trapezoid.  The church belongs to the architectural style of Baroque. </p><p>  At the time of construction, a huge area turned out to be outside the walls of the estate, approximately 400x450 meters. </p><p>  Hundreds of serfs worked in construction. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saburovskaya fortress eagle" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2165485.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  "Fate" of the fortress after the death of the count </h2><p>  After the death of the owner of the Saburov fortress - Count Kamensky, the estate was transferred to his son Sergei.  However, he could not keep the fortress, he went bankrupt and sold it.  Subsequent owners did not want to invest in the complex, they simply did not know what to do with it.  Gradually the estate fell into decay.  In the 19th century, the Count‚Äôs house was burned down, and to this day only the foundation and entrances to the cellars are in this place. </p><p>  The history of the Saburov fortress in Soviet times was not rosy.  All buildings were taken under state protection only at the end of the 40s of the last century.  But no restoration work was carried out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the early 50s, the local historian Kaplinsky M.V. achieved the opening of the exhibition in one of the towers.  It was possible to find out the history of the estate.  The local historian even received positive reviews about his work from colleagues from <span>Moscow, Orel</span> and Leningrad.  But in the near future the tower was given for storage facilities. </p><p>  After about 25 years, the regional department of culture initiated restoration work.  But, as always, there was not enough money.  Building materials were finally stolen, right down to floorboards, and that was it. </p><p>  The descendants of the count in the mid-90s reburied the ashes of Michael and Nikolai, the two greatest commanders of their time.  In honor of this, memorial plaques were installed on the temple wall, which also disappeared over time. </p>

    <h2>  Temple </h2><p>  It is believed that the temple was built in 1755 by Fedot Kamensky and his sister Maria Brylkina.  Mentions that the Archangel Church existed in the village of Samburovo are still in the letters from 1721.  There is even a version that the temple was built in the XVII century. </p><p>  The parish was the largest in the <span>Oryol province</span> and amounted to more than 257 yards. </p><p>  Multiple restoration work almost erased the original appearance of the building, whose architectural style was Baroque.  The church has two thrones: </p><ul><li>  St. Michael the Archangel, who was consecrated in 1755; </li><li>  of the holy Prophet John the Baptist, whose consecration took place in the same year. </li></ul><p>  In 1789, the building was badly damaged by fire.  Overhaul of the temple was made several times, in 1823, 1875, 1888 and 1892. </p><p>  The bell tower had 6 bells.  One of them was poured out of a Turkish cannon.  The building was fenced with an iron lattice fence. </p><p>  Field marshal and his son were buried in the walls of the temple.  Modest white tombstones were installed over the graves, even without any inscriptions. </p><p>  Since 1900, a parish school was opened at the church. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  The church of the Saburov fortress was closed in 1930.  And just then the complete destruction of the structure began.  Burials were opened and plundered.  The bell tower and the refectory were dismantled for building materials by local residents. </p><p>  The church was returned to the faithful only in 1995.  Reconstruction has begun, which continues to this day. </p><h2>  Holy waters </h2><p>  Not far from the temple and the fortress itself is a holy spring.  It is located near the banks of the Tsong River.  There are 10 keys that are consecrated and fenced. </p>

    <h2>  Pyramids </h2><p>  However, not only the holy places and the Saburovskaya fortress in Orel are attractive.  Photos of travelers confirm this, all visitors are interested in the question of why the pyramids were erected here. </p><p>  In fact, everything is very simple.  Earl really built a fortress in the likeness of the Turkish.  And in the pyramids, the Turks set up gunpowder warehouses, but Kamensky changed their purpose a little - they served as refrigerators for food (only one survived to this day, and then in a deplorable state).  Before placing food there, in summer or spring, the floor was covered with ice, which was cut down in the winter on the Tson River. </p><p>  There is another version that the pyramid has a secret Masonic mission.  Some contemporaries of the count considered him a freemason, because he was an educated person, had a good upbringing and mysteriously died. </p><p>  Some visitors note certain anomalies in the Saburov fortress, photos in the house near the pyramid are not obtained, the video camera turns off.  It is noticed that the grass is always dry near the pyramid. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  There are two main ways to get to the Saburov fortress.  The first way can be used by both motorists and backpackers.  You should take the bus number 7 (or other minibuses that follow in this direction) to the stop "Possovet".  Immediately from the stop you can see Bear Mountain, on which the fortress stands. </p><p>  The second option is also suitable for backpackers and cycle enthusiasts.  By tram number 1 or number 3 you need to get to the final stop "Himmash".  Further towards the Sakhanskaya station, along a partially paved road.  Then there will be a dirt track along the left bank of the Tson River to the village of Saburovo and the fortress.  This path is longer than the first. </p><p>  If you move on a vehicle, you can get to the village of Znamenka (along the Kromsky highway).  You should drive almost to the end of the village, and near the sign "Training center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" turn right.  Further, about 6 kilometers, following the signs, to the village of Samburovo.  Coordinates: latitude: N 52 ¬∞ 54.554 ', longitude: E 35 ¬∞ 54.048'. </p><p>  I would like to believe that in the near future the open-air museum will be restored and become a real guide to the military history of Russia, attracting many tourists and pilgrims. </p>
