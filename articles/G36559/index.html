    <h2>  Tsaghkadzor - the "star" of Armenian tourism </h2><p>  The unequivocal winner of the nomination "The Best <span>Ski Resorts of</span> Armenia" is Tsaghkadzor.  Reviews of skiers leave no doubt that this is the most developed resort in the country.  More than 30 km of slopes cover the slopes of Mount Teghenis, at the foot of which the city was built.  Modern lifts quickly and comfortably deliver to the slopes of different difficulty levels.  During the ascent, a panorama of most of Armenia opens before the eyes.  In the warm season, Tsaghkadzor is surrounded by flowering meadows, for which it received the name "Valley of Flowers". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tsaghkadzor is located just 50 km from Yerevan, so it is easiest to get to the resort through it.  Major airlines such as Aeroflot, Armavia, S7 and Ural Airlines regularly fly to the <span>capital of Armenia</span> .  You can overcome 75 km from <span>Yerevan airport</span> to Tsaghkadzor by bus, minibus or taxi, it is possible to order a transfer.  The fare on the bus and minibus does not exceed 100 rubles, while the car will have to pay one and a half to two thousand.  The roads in the country are excellent, the trip will be easy and quick.  If you travel independently, focus on Hrazdan, from it to the resort only 5 km. </p><h2>  Tsaghkadzor for skiers: slopes and ski lifts </h2><p>  The resort attracted the attention of skiers from all over the world after the broadcast of the Soviet team on the slopes of Teghenis was shown.  This was an excellent indicator that the ski resorts of Armenia are in no way inferior to more popular destinations.  With the growing number of people wishing to get acquainted with the culture of the country and personally check the routes of Tsaghkadzor, the resort attracted more and more attention.  In 2004, Lightner, one of the leading companies in the production and installation of cable cars, began to implement its project in an Armenian resort. </p>

    <p>  The Austrian-Italian company in five years installed five lifts with a total length of more than six kilometers.  You can climb them to the highest point (to a height of 2819 m), from which you can see the entire gorge, Lake Sevan and even neighboring Ararat.  A big plus of the new chairlift - the seats are soft and heated, giving maximum comfort even in cold weather.  The lower station is located at a level of 1966 m above the sea.  If you choose the longest route, you get a height difference of 850 m. The cable car from Leitner is designed for the maximum influx of tourists and so quickly delivers them to the tracks that there are almost no queues at the stations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ski resorts of Armenia are suitable for both beginners and experts in skiing and snowboarding.  In Tsaghkadzor, tracks of blue, red and black colors are distinguished (depending on the level of difficulty).  Those who are not confident in their abilities will be helped by instructors from local ski schools.  The longest route of the resort is about eight kilometers in length.  Professionals can ride the sports trench and the former bobsled track.  This will give a lot of vivid impressions and even more adrenaline. </p><h2>  Sights of Tsaghkadzor </h2><p>  Fans of not only <span>skiing,</span> but also an excursion program should visit the ski resorts of Armenia, Tsaghkadzor in particular.  During respite from the dizzying slopes, you can visit one of the attractions to your taste.  The most popular is Kecharis - a complex of churches and chapels in which monks still live.  The first church was built back in 1013 and named after St. Gregory, whose relics are stored in one of the chapels. </p>
