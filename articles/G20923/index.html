And Penza is no exception.  The building of the Gostiny Dvor in Penza looks very beautiful.  It was redeveloped several times, survived two difficult wars, and the facade was not damaged at all.  The building is located in the center and is one of the oldest in the city. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Gostiny Dvor is located at ul.  Moskovskaya, 91. It is the central pedestrian street of the city, there are many banks, offices and shops.  Within walking distance from the business complex is located the <span>central Penza market.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="gost-dvor58.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the street Moscow" class="if uuid-2356138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78205/2356138.jpg"></div><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Today the building of the Gostiny Dvor in Penza is a shopping complex.  However, this was not always the case.  The building was built back in the 1860s and has a very rich history.  Initially, the house belonged to the merchant and vowel of the Penza City Council Fedor Ivanovich Ershov.  In 1890, the building was purchased by Alexander Afanasevich Yakushev, it was he who attached the third floor to the building.  So the estate turned into a hotel "Russia", which was considered elite in the city.  The local rooms were richly and tastefully furnished, not everyone could afford to stay here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Soon everything changed.  Yakushev the eldest died, and his sons Victor and Konstantin Yakushev in October 1910 opened the Edison movie theater in which they showed silent cinema.  Later, during the First World War, the evacuation center was located in the building. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.1992489" data-lng="45.01894319999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/2/2/1822.png"></div><p>  In April 1918, in the future "Gostiny Dvor" of Penza, the political club "International" worked.  Part of the building was occupied by the Penza city committee of the Bolshevik party.  Later, the house was handed over as a hostel. </p><p>  During World War II, an evacuation center and an infectious diseases hospital were located here again.  When the war was over, the building was redeveloped.  It again became multi-family, apartments were surrendered by a veteran of the party, the revolutionary movement and the civil war.  On the ground floor there was a restaurant. </p><p>  Only in 1998 the building turned into a shopping complex. </p><h2>  Complex shops </h2><p>  There are several shops in the Gostiny Dvor Penza: the Zephyr confectionery, the Karavan grocery chain store, the Marco, Tofa and Ka Shoe Gallery shoe stores, as well as the Familia various goods store.  It also houses the Bierhaus restaurant and the Yogurt Hall adult and children's development studio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the guest house" class="if uuid-2356143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78205/2356143.jpg"></div><h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  The working hours of the ‚ÄúGostiny Dvor‚Äù of Penza <strong>are</strong> from 9:00 to 21:00 daily.  This place is worth visiting not even for the sake of shopping, but in order to see the old buildings located in this part of the city. </p>
