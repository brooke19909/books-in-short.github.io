    <h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  Professionals who, by their nature of activity, are associated with radio measuring equipment, need to get basic knowledge about how the RLC meter or the immitance meter works.  The fact is that these devices are widely used in laboratories, in repair shops and in factories, where with their help they obtain data on the complex conductivity of circuits and their resistance.  Very often, the RLC meter is used to test alternating current sources. </p>

Such devices perceive only fixed frequencies. </p><p>  Meters using Ohm's law relationships have simpler schemes for technical self-realization and automated output of measurement results.  The principle of their operation is based on the analysis of the passage of a sinusoidal test signal through the measured circuit with a given frequency.  In this case, the operating voltage is supplied from the internal generator to the measurement object.  It is to be determined in a selected section of the circuit, where the phase shift and current are simultaneously analyzed.  The data obtained are used in the calculation of the necessary parameters. </p><h2>  The main purpose </h2><p>  Currently, there are a wide variety of immitance meters that have different technical characteristics from each other, as well as an indication type, which, in addition to performing their basic functions, can also determine such parameters as: </p><p>  - phase angle (shift) between voltage and current; <br>  - the performance of the indicator coil; <br>  - the value of the tangent of the loss angle; <br>  - resistance parameter, which is determined on the basis of the obtained data on current strength and voltage; <br>  - some other parameters. </p><h2>  Varieties and specifications </h2><p>  Immitance RLC meters are divided into: </p><p>  - switch; <br>  - digital; <br>  - combined. </p>

Moreover, the error of its measurements is only 0.01-0.002%. </p><h2>  Portable appliances </h2><p>  Manufacturers of RLC meters offer small-sized devices that have autonomous (battery) power.  These devices have less functionality, weight, dimensions, as well as cost.  The error of their measurements is about two percent. </p><p>  For example, the modern portable RLC meter is offered to be acquired by the American company Agilent Technologies Inc.  This manufacturer introduced to the market a new line of hand-held devices that allow specialists and engineers to determine the necessary parameters with maximum speed, accuracy and convenience.  This includes the U1733C.  U1732C and U1731C.  The innovation of these devices is their ability to measure frequencies of up to ten to the fifth power of Hertz, while ensuring a measurement error of only 0.2%.  In addition, in the U1730C model of this line, there is a function due to which the automatic identification of components is performed.  The result of this work is to display on the screen the type of device, as well as a detailed analysis of the obtained parameters. </p><p>  The Belarusian plant "Caliber" released a portable meter E7-18.  It operates in a wide range of frequencies, ranging from 20 to 1000 Hz.  The measurement error of the model is 0.08%. </p><h2>  Virtual devices </h2><p>  By this variety of devices it is customary to understand devices that are based on a PC.  It is the computer that provides the control functions, the processing of the received data, as well as the graphical presentation and display of information.  To date, such devices are not commercially available.  The only such device is a virtual meter, created by the Moscow Institute of Control Problems.  Trapeznikov Russian Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  The device has several modifications and is used in a number of universities and research institutes.  Its working frequency range is in the range from 10 to 2x10 in the sixth degree of Hz, providing the measurement of the complex resistance in the range from ten to minus the third to ten in the ninth degree Ohm.  The measurement error in this case is within 0.2%. </p><h2>  Problem Oriented Devices </h2><p>  Omsk LLC ‚ÄúNTTs Transport‚Äù produces a digital meter RLC ‚ÄúImmeter‚Äù.  It allows you to clarify the parameters of the inductance of direct current resistance and quality factor that exist in the coils of automatic signaling of locomotives, which is also used in subways.  In addition, with the help of this device, it is possible to clarify the magnitude of the induced EMF, as well as the current resistance of a constant value.  The device can measure the parameters of objects at a sinusoidal voltage.  In this case, both parallel and sequential two-element equivalent circuitry is possible, which is in the frequency range from 20 to 1000 Hz.  The measurement error of such a device is 0.06%. </p>

    <p>  Recently, the technique of measuring immitance in this area has received its widespread use in connection with universality and reliability.  So, using the BacTrac 4300 instruments, two parameters can be registered.  One of them is the medium immitance (M-parameter), and the second is electronic (E-parameter).  These two indicators can be taken into account both in combination and separately.  Such a measuring system exhibits high sensitivity to microbial metabolites, allowing you to determine the necessary parameters even in selective nutrient media. </p><h2>  RLC E Series </h2><p>  Models of this brand are produced by both domestic and foreign industry.  Earlier, back in the days of the USSR, immitance meters of the E7-14 and E7-5 models were widely used.  What is known about them? </p>

    <p>  The values ‚Äã‚Äãof the main parameters in the amount of 5 instructions of the RLC-meter E7 14 indicates the following: </p><p>  - operating frequency of 100 Hz, as well as 1 and 10 kHz; <br>  - 0.1 mOhm - 1 GOhm; <br>  - 0.001 pF - 1 F; <br>  - the possibility of self-calibration; <br>  - implementation of microprocessor control. </p><p>  The weight of this model is 10 kg. </p><p>  The RLC meter E7 5 gives the following characteristics: </p><p>  - 1 mOhm - 20 Mom; <br>  - 0.1 pF - 20 mF; <br>  - the presence of two measurement frequencies - 1 kHz and 100 Hz; <br>  - the ability to control the processor; <br>  - 0.1 mH - 16 kH. </p><p>  What else can be said about the device?  The instructions for the R7 meter E7 5 notes that the weight of this model is 5 kg. </p><p>  Currently, in connection with the release of new, improved devices, the RLC E-14 and RLC E-5 meters are no longer available.  Of this line of instruments, specialists most demand meters of later designs with a large number of functions and capabilities. </p><h2>  E7 22 RLC meter </h2><p>  This portable device has a fairly wide range of functionality.  Which of them are considered the most valuable?  For specialists, the functions that make it possible to carry out tolerance control for various parameters are important. </p><p>  So, the RLC E7 22 meter: </p><p>  - It is able to work at a measurement frequency of 1 kHz or 120 Hz, as well as with a serial or parallel equivalent circuit; <br>  - has an automatic selection of limit measurement boundaries and the ability to fix a pre-selected limit; <br>  - has two indicators - to indicate the main and auxiliary parameters; <br>  - has the ability to select indicators and measure the quality factor, loss tangent, as well as ohmic resistance; <br>  - fixes the maximum, average and minimum values; <br>  - has the function of access control; <br>  - determines the average value from the received data array; <br>  - conducts relative measurements; <br>  - equipped with software compensation for idle and short circuit. </p><p>  The RLC E7-22 meter has some features and functionality that have no analogues among even more complex and expensive RLC devices.  It was this moment that made the device very popular for a wide audience.  It is used not only by amateurs, but also by professionals working in the field of development of electronic equipment. </p><p>  In its work, the E7-22 RLC meter uses a variety of measurement frequencies.  In this case, the device is able to automatically select the measurement limits.  Such a function is used when the necessary parameters are in the widest range, and also when the value of the measured indicator is unknown.  It is in such situations that the need arises for the correct choice of the limiting boundaries of measurement.  In those devices where manual selection is provided, the study time is significantly increased.  However, even when the result is displayed, one cannot be sure of the correct determination of the measurement limit.  A consistent enumeration of these boundaries is necessary until it is impossible to verify the reliability of the result.  The minimum measurement time will take with the automatic execution of this function. </p><p>  Another useful feature that the E7-22 RLC meter has is to record the maximum, average, and minimum values.  A similar feature is widespread in digital multimeters.  In RLC meters, it can be found very rarely.  What are the advantages of this device? </p>
