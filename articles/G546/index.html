    <h2>  Upland near Sevastopol </h2><p>  From the north-east to the south-west stretch the mountains of the Crimean peninsula, comprising three ridges.  The most external of them begins with a hill near Sevastopol and is called Sapun-Gora, in Tatar - "soap".  From it, the hill stretches to the city of <span>Old Crimea</span> and is a natural rampart that encloses the coast of the peninsula.  It was these geographical features that contributed to the creation of good conditions for the defense of naval bases from land. </p><p>  This height was key in the battles for the city of Sevastopol in the Crimean War and World War II.  Just a few minutes of getting up by car is 231 meters above sea level, but this hill provides dominance over the southern side of the city and viewing the road from Yalta to Sevastopol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today this place is actively visited by tourists.  A special advantage for them is that Crimea, Sapun-Gora and other attractions provide the opportunity to combine outdoor activities in beautiful nature, aesthetic enjoyment of stunning views with informative excursions and a touch of history. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  In 1941-1942, with heavy losses, German troops managed to capture Sevastopol after a 250-day siege.  The main battles took place on Sapun Mountain, where many German soldiers were killed.  The soldiers of the Fifty-first and Primorye armies retreated to Chersonesos, but they knew that they would return to these places.  I had to wait almost two years.  In 1944, Soviet troops drove the Nazis from their native land, and they were about to liberate the Crimea.  And again, the peak in front of Sevastopol was used, but already by the enemy, as a natural basis for creating a three-echelon line of fortifications.  Here the most fierce battles unfolded, which determined the success of the entire offensive operation and the complete liberation of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Hope of the enemy </h2>

In March 1944, Soviet troops appeared on some sections of the border.  All this meant that the liberation of their native land was nearing.  But the enemy’s resistance has become even more fierce.  German bases in Crimea were blocked, but continued to fight.  Hitler believed that their abandonment would entail a withdrawal from the <span>war of the Balkan</span> allies, which could not be allowed.  The Germans in Crimea, in fact, were doomed to defeat, but their task was, as far as possible, to restrain the forces of the Soviet armies.  For this, Sapun-Gora was fortified with three lines of defense.  They were equipped with an extended trench strip, long-term firing points of various types, both earthen and reinforced concrete.  To take the height by storm was incredibly difficult.  But the domestic troops gained rich fighting experience, took more than one height, the command prepared the penultimate battle of the offensive operation for the Crimea.

Therefore, almost a month's preparations for the assault began.  The command planned to launch an offensive on May 5 through secondary forces through the Mikenseev Upland and reach the city from the north.  This maneuver was supposed to be predominantly distracting. </p><p>  After a day, the main forces will begin the offensive from the left flank.  Their goal will be Sapun-Gora, Sevastopol from the south.  Several weeks remained to prepare the troops.  Recruits were dispersed among experienced soldiers and trained to take the fortifications created here for training.  Suvorov’s <span>science of winning</span> came in handy in full measure: ingenuity, an eye, roundabout maneuvers and careful actions without unnecessary risk.  The soldiers were especially taught to see the battlefield, to distinguish between enemy fortifications and to take them purposefully.  These days had to work and intelligence.  Thanks to her efforts, even before the main offensive, several enemy firing points had revealed themselves, and the “tongues” taken gave a full breakdown on equipment and the number of troops. </p><h2>  Fight for Sapun Mountain </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Map Sapun Mountain" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/446504.jpg" width="482"></div></h2><p>  At 9 a.m. on May 7, 1944, a powerful artillery bombardment began, which was to precede the advance of the Soviet troops.  Aviation and Katyusha bombed the ground with their volleys, covering enemy firing points.  For an hour the sound of fire did not cease, all that could be done to facilitate the offensive was done.  At 10.30 a red rocket signaled an infantry advance on the front line of enemy fortifications.  And although the fighters acted extremely smoothly, the six-tier enemy defense with minefields, barbed wire and hidden firing points did not allow them to immediately capture the front fortifications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An hour later, the movement stopped, sappers under enemy fire were still able to make several passes through the wire and <span>minefields of the</span> Germans.  Soviet soldiers moved into the trenches of the enemy, but were rebuffed.  For another hour and a half, the trenches changed hands several times, until, finally, on one of the flanks, our soldiers captured the front line of the Nazi defense. </p><p>  Ahead was a steep climb.  Sapun-Gora moaned from explosions of mines and grenades, machine-gun fire.  And in this mess, step by step, clinging to every pebble, a Russian soldier advanced.  By 2 p.m., the first position of the German defense was captured along the perimeter of the entire height.  This advance in formal terms was only 50-100 meters.  But in less than an hour, the second line of defense was broken. </p><h2>  Sapun Mountain taken </h2><p>  So little was left to the top, but it meant very little.  If we stop the advance, then with a high degree of probability all our troops will simply slide down.  You can’t stop.  Overcoming enemy fire, using the skill acquired in training, the soldiers moved forward.  At the very top was a sacrament that was no longer seen by observers from the command post.  Only grenade explosions and machine gun lines.  Soon, hand-to-hand combat began.  The artillery ran out of shells, the aviation had a supply of bombs.  By 20 o’clock on the crest, the long-awaited red flags flashed, the battle on Sapun-Gora came to an end along with such a difficult, intense and long day. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fight on Sapun Mountain" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/446484.jpg" width="560"></div></h2><h2>  Enemy counterattack </h2><p>  Having lost their positions on the top of the mountain, the Germans were not ready to surrender the city.  Hoping that the Soviet troops exhausted over the past day would not be able to repel new attacks, they prepared a counterattack on the morning of the next day.  But our command managed to strengthen and replenish the front lines with new units overnight and accordingly prepare for repelling the attack.  Over the course of the day, our soldiers carried eleven new attacks of the enemy, withstood and held the defense of an important height.  How many soldiers died on these summits during these two days!  The capture of the Sapun Mountain cost our troops the lives of 80 thousand Soviet soldiers.  The Germans lost 30 thousand.  Well, those who go on the assault always lose more.  May 9, 1944 (isn't it an interesting date?) Sevastopol was liberated from Nazi invaders. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

For ten years, except for the scarlet fiery poppies, nothing grew on top.  The battles for the liberation of Europe continued, the hydra of fascism was not destroyed, and two obelisks were erected on the slope of the Sapun-Gory in honor of the fighters of the Primorsky Army and the 51st Army, who stormed the heights.  In May 1945, a museum began to operate, in which the first exhibits appeared - witnesses of the great battles in these places.  After 15 years, the museum was reconstructed, a new building was built in its place, in which there was a battle diorama on May 7, 1944.  20 years after the fighting, the obelisk of the Primorsky Army was modernized and a modern memorial complex was laid.

    <h2>  Diorama "Sapun-Gora" </h2><p>  Years of terrible war are farther from us.  It’s harder to imagine what happened on the battlefields in those distant times.  Diorama, as a form of modern art, helps to plunge into the atmosphere of battle and feel, at least in part, the smell of gunpowder, fear and pain at the sight of dying comrades, the cruelty of what is happening.  The drama “Sapun Mountain, May 7th Assault” is one of the largest of its kind in the world.  Its size is twenty-five and a half meters by five and a half.  With the help of technical means, painting techniques and the subject foreground, the effect of the presence of the spectator during the battle was achieved, he becomes a witness to the exploits captured by the painters.  The creators of the diorama - the artists of the studio of M. B. Grekov, Petr Maltsev, Georgy Marchenko, Nikolai Prisekin - carried out a great search and research work.  Their work is not just fiction, it is a capture of real events according to the words and descriptions of eyewitnesses. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Diorama Sapun Mountain" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/446499.jpg" width="300"></div>  Park near the memorial of fame </h2><p>  After watching the diorama, visitors go to the balcony and see the real place of the battle, guess the places shown by the artists.  This further enhances the impression of the battle.  Not far from the museum there is a park.  His landing was an incredibly difficult job because stony soil prevailed there.  It created an exhibition of military equipment from the time of the Great Patriotic War.  Self-propelled guns, tanks, glorious combat "Katyusha".  Nearby are captured German guns that have retained even their own color.  Closer to the road are ship guns and other military equipment.  On some tourist sites of Crimea, the map "Sapun-Gora" shows all the memorable places and the route for tourists who prefer to independently explore all the sights. </p><h2>  Temple chapel </h2><p>  It so happened that each generation has contributed to preserving and honoring the memory of the dead.  Sapun-Gora - photos taken before 1995 and after have changed thanks to the construction of a small chapel.  Within a few months this religious building was erected.  An angel with a cross on top of a truncated cone, a mosaic icon at the entrance, the image of St. <span>George the Victorious</span> inside is a continuation of the traditions of Russian architecture in combination with new modern trends.  The chapel is an active temple, in which services are performed in memory of the deceased soldiers - defenders of the Fatherland. </p><h2>  Celebrations at the Memorial </h2><p>  For the past fifteen years, ceremonies have been taking place dedicated to the Great Victory Day and the liberation of the city of Sevastopol at the Sapun-Gora memorial.  How to get there these days? </p><p>  Veterans bring special vehicles, reconstruction of military vehicles and motorcycles of the 40s.  Other people who want to see these places can get there on routes Nos. 107 and 71. In addition to the usual holiday regulations, the action “Banners of Glory” is held at the memorial near the obelisk of the Primorsky Army.  Solemnly carry to the monument the banners of those military units and ships that defended Sevastopol in 1942 and liberated the city in the spring of 1944.  At the foot of the obelisk, veterans lay flowers in memory of comrades who did not return from the battle.  In the afternoon, motocross competitions are held on the slope of Sapun-Gory. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sapun Mountain Assault Reconstruction" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/446500.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Historical reconstruction </h2><p>  It is gratifying that young people also pay tribute to the heroic past.  The reconstruction of the assault on Sapun-Gory, carried out by youth public organizations and historical <span>clubs of Sevastopol, has</span> already become traditional <span>.</span>  On Sunday, the closest to the date of May 7, grenades again explode on the side of the mountain, machine guns are scribbled and Soviet soldiers go hand-to-hand against the “Fritz” who have settled in the trenches.  The story comes to life.  Thousands of spectators gather here every year who experience these memorable events and can see firsthand the heroism and courage of the soldiers, capturing the heights of the memorable spring of 1944.  And, although the battle lasts only half an hour, this is enough to plunge into history and remember forever that our freedom and peaceful sky are fully paid for by the blood of the great-grandfathers who have stained this land with it.  Anyone can take part in the reconstruction.  An important condition is early registration and self-provision of form and attributes. </p>
