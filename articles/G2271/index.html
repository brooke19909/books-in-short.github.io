Even in the folk tale of W. Tell, this place is mentioned.  Tourist activity in the city unfolded in the second half of the XIX century.  The writer Mark Twain has been here.  In one of his essays, he left a call to stimulate the development of the souvenir business in Lucerne, which happened later.

    <h2>  Occurrence </h2><p>  The city has a rather long history, since researchers claim that the foundation of the settlements took place under the rule of Ancient Rome, and possibly earlier.  A monastery called St. Leodegar named after Gough opened in the first half of the VIII century.  The first mention in the annals of this church dates back to 840. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Roisbr√ºcke Bridge connected it with the farms located a little lower.  Here a trading center developed, playing an important role for the entire region.  In 1178, the village passed into the jurisdiction of the authorities of Lucerne.  Historically, this date was accepted as the beginning of the life of the city at approximately the borders that are preserved today.  Saint-Gotland is a pass opened here in 1220. A wall was also erected around the village and towers with fortifications, which increased the level of protection and security. </p>

    <h2>  Position reinforcement </h2><p>  Another important date is the year 1332, when equality was established between villages and cities.  For the development of the cantons, this was a rather important step.  The power of the city only grew stronger, and after some time it gained the status of a city-state. </p><p>  In 1386 there was a liberation from Austrian oppression, due to the victory at Zempach.  In the XVIII century, the power of the patriciate was established here, which included 29 genera.  In the <span>Swiss Confederation,</span> Lucerne, as its first member, was also given a privileged position. </p><p>  In addition, its favorable location was taken into account.  He had every chance to become the capital of the state, however, this role went to Bern.  In the 19th century, the influence of the village decreased, but later on it became an important tourist destination and <span>cultural</span> center <span>of Switzerland.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Anyone who looks here will really have something to see.  An amazingly fascinating place is Lucerne.  Its sights can leave indelible and wonderful memories. </p><p>  Walking is an excellent way to conduct excursions, since in the Old Town, as a rule, movements are carried out just like that.  Many people walk here without a guide.  The houses have beautiful frescoes and paintings, from which you can learn about the purpose and history of the building. </p><p>  One of the most interesting places is the tower called Wasserturm, as well as Kapelbr√ºcke - a wonderful bridge.  Even without leaving the station, you can become a visitor to the Center for Culture and Congresses, which is located nearby.  The building was completed in 1999. The construction process was carried out by J. Nouvel, a renowned architect from France.  Thanks to this talented man who received the <span>Pritzker Prize, the</span> building became the standard of high design and architecture. </p><p>  Here you can visit the art museum, which is famous for the city of Lucerne.  The reviews of tourists also indicate that it is very beautiful in the center, on the square and on the beautiful promenade, where exhibitions, festivals and concerts are often held.  Sculptor Thorvaldsen from Denmark created the sculpture ‚ÄúThe Dying Lion‚Äù, which is known throughout the world.  The monument is dedicated to the soldiers of the Swiss Guard who died during the assault on the Tuileries 10.08.1792.  Thus, they defended the life of the king of France.  The statue did not ignore M. Twain.  He expresses himself about sculpture as the saddest and most moving creation of stone, which is in the world. </p>

    <h2>  Timeless </h2><p>  A piece of the Museuggmauer remained intact - a wall built around 1400, whose length is 870 m. There are eight towers of great height.  Three of them have access.  Some watches ring, one minute ahead of the rest in the city. </p><p>  Thanks to these surviving ancient elements, Lucerne is a particularly exceptional place.  The reviews of its guests indicate that it is extremely interesting for people to look at medieval monuments of architecture, which there are not so many around the world. </p><p>  Being near the Jesuit church, you can approach the Knight's Palace, which was also previously owned by the participants of the order.  In 1804, the city administration founded its residence here.  Beautifully in the local courtyard, which stylistically resembles the buildings of Italy.  There are many Catholics here, which is quite interesting, given that in neighboring cities there are more Protestants. </p><p>  Another attraction that tourists who visit here are advised to take a look at is the museum, which is entirely dedicated to transport, which is the largest in Europe among institutions of similar subjects. </p><p>  There is no need to worry especially about accommodation, as the hotels in Lucerne are numerous.  There are about 90 of them. For each, there is a living area to the liking and needs.  There are hotels, hostels, villas and apartments for every pocket. </p>

This gives Lucerne a special mysticism in the eyes of visitors.  Although there are other interpretations of the origin of the name of the mountain, many people like this, the most mysterious.  A steep railroad also attracts attention.  So, according to those who have been here, the city really deserves attention.
