    <p>  The city has an ancient and rich history.  It was founded in 1594.  This is one of the oldest cities in Siberia.  There are many cultural monuments and attractions that are especially interesting to see today. </p><p>  Surgut boasts not only ancient history, but also economic and industrial development.  For example, GRES-1 and GRES-2 power plants are located here, which are practically the most powerful in the world.  In addition, oil and gas are extracted and refined here, as well as many light industry enterprises. </p><h2>  From Moscow <span>to Surgut:</span> how to get </h2><p>  Such a trip can be difficult.  The fact is that these cities are quite far from each other.  The distance from Moscow to Surgut is 2 137 km in a straight line.  If you look at the distance along the highway, then it is much larger - 2,895 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get from Moscow to Surgut in any convenient way.  Many people prefer air transport, because this is the fastest way.  There is such an opportunity.  You can also hit the road by car or train. </p><p>  When choosing a mode of transport, it is important to consider what time of year you are traveling, as well as the condition of the roads, since in winter it often worsens. </p><h2>  Moscow - Surgut by plane </h2><p>  The fastest way to get to Surgut from the capital is through <span>air transport.</span>  They often fly by plane in order to save time and money, since air tickets often end up being cheaper than train tickets. </p><p>  There are both direct flights and transfers with the Moscow ‚Äì Surgut route.  A direct flight lasts about 3‚Äì3.5 hours.  A flight with transfers takes much longer, it can last from 7 to 11 hours, depending on the place of transfer and its duration.  Transplants are made in St. Petersburg, Ufa, <span>Tyumen, Yekaterinburg</span> and Kazan.  Aircraft are accepted and departed at Surgut International Airport.

    <h2>  Train ride </h2><p>  From Moscow to Surgut can be reached not only by plane, but also by rail.  Every day, an average of 2-3 trains depart from the Kazan and Yaroslavl stations of the capital in this direction.  Travel time is almost 2 days, depending on the train.  Usually it is 1 day and 22-23 hours.  Ticket prices depend on the season, as well as on the type of seats.  Prices for travel in the reserved seat start at 5,299 rubles.  You will have to pay a little more for a ticket in a compartment, from 7,557 rubles.  The most expensive tickets for luxury seats, their prices start at 16,135 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the direction of Surgut - Moscow, trains depart daily.  There is also a Tyumen branded train, the final destination of which is the city of the same name.  This composition has increased comfort: it has air conditioning, televisions, bathrooms, and cleaning is often carried out.  To go 2 days in such a train is quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Is it possible to get there by car </h2><p>  Looking at the distance, you might think that it is impossible to get to Surgut from Moscow by car.  However, many prefer to travel by car, and they are not stopped by long distances.  Travel time without stops is about 45 hours 49 minutes.  Of course, it all depends on the time of year, the current condition of roads, repair work and many other factors. </p>

    <p>  The road passes through many large cities: along the way are Yaroslavl, Kostroma, <span>Kirov, Perm,</span> Khanty-Mansiysk.  Therefore, if you are traveling with stops, there will be no problems with an overnight stay.  In any major city you can find a suitable hotel. </p><h2>  What to see in Surgut </h2><p>  Going to Surgut, you need to think in advance what sights are best to visit.  Since there are a lot of them in the city, it is worth choosing the most interesting. </p><p>  The first thing I would like to draw attention to is a monument to the pioneers of Siberia.  The monument is located in the very center of the city and is dedicated to its founders.  The height of the monument is about 15 meters. </p><p>  Another interesting attraction is the bridge over the Ob River.  Surgut is the largest suspension bridge in the world.  Its average span is supported by only one pillar.  A museum is also dedicated to the construction of this bridge. </p>

    <p>  20 km from the city there is a unique object - Barsova Gora.  It is a natural and archaeological park.  Here is a tract that has been inhabited for 7 thousand years.  The park stretches for 8.5 km along the river. </p><p>  This is not all that can be seen in Surgut.  In fact, the list of attractions is much larger.  It is worth coming here to get to know this beautiful city better. </p>
