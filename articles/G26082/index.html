  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hansa cookers: reviews and features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can often find Hansa washing machines and stoves in home appliance stores.  Feedback from sellers indicates that first of all, buyers are attracted by the affordable price and attractive design of these models.  Indeed, the range of gas and electric stoves is very wide, among them there are both very simple and inexpensive options, so sophisticated and expensive.  Let us consider in more detail several gas and <span>electric stoves</span> and compare their pros and cons.  For example, a gas stove Hansa FCGW50000010 is one of the most popular models of this brand.  It cannot boast of abundance of functions - a gas oven with backlight, 4 burners, one of which is large in diameter, inside the oven is covered with easy-clean enamel, a drawer for storing baking sheets and baking dishes, a removable oven door. </p><p>  If not features, what attracts customers to this Hansa stove?  Customer reviews suggest that it attracts with its appearance: neat, with comfortable handles, smooth lines, it looks much more profitable than many economy-class clatter plates. </p><p>  For comparison, you can take the model FCMI68263080 - one of the most expensive of this brand.  No man can pass this Hansa stove.  Reviews about her are heard only enthusiastic - beautiful, reliable, luxurious, comfortable, with a beautiful oven.  She will deservedly occupy a central place in the kitchen.  First of all, it attracts the design of the model, in which the mirror surfaces are skillfully combined with stainless steel, giving the plate an unusually sophisticated look.  Secondly, the stove contains the most modern and necessary ‚Äúlotions‚Äù: one-handed electric ignition, full gas control, catalytic cleaning of the oven, electric oven with display, rotisserie, grill, convection, removable guides and much more.  Of course, the price of this model is appropriate, but, according to customers, it is worth it! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to gas, Hansa <span>electric cookers</span> are sold.  Reviews about these models are also mostly positive.  There are traditional electric stoves with ‚Äúpancakes‚Äù and enamel on the surface, there are modern ones with glass ceramics.  Traditional ones are cheaper, but they heat up much more slowly.  Glass ceramics are heated to the maximum in a few seconds, while it is much easier to care for, but it will cost more.  Among simple models, the Hans FCEW51001011 electric stove is in great demand.  Main characteristics: 4-burner model, 2 burners with a power of 1.5 kW, and two burners with a power of 1.2 kW, standard sizes 50 * 60 * 85 cm, backlight.  Three control programs in the oven: you can turn on the upper and lower heating elements individually, or both at once.  In fact, this is a simple budget option, equipped with the very minimum of necessary functions. </p><p>  As for plates with glass ceramics, the Hansa model FCCX58236030 is in great demand.  The stove is made of stainless steel and is equipped with a multifunctional control panel that allows you to program the oven to turn off, select the type of heating (top, bottom, convection, etc.).  The hob, on which one of the burners comes with a double contour, also attracts attention.  This means that if necessary, you can put on it a small saucepan and a wide frying pan.  If you cook on a large burner in a small cooker, some of the electricity will be wasted, but if on the contrary, the burner is small and the dishes are wide, the dish will cook more slowly.  The oven is completed with a lattice and three baking sheets (one deep and two flat) and removable guides.  ‚ÄúReliable, comfortable, practical,‚Äù is what they say about the Hansa technique.  At the moment, the products of this company are not very widespread in the Russian market of household appliances, but every year more and more buyers opt for it. </p>
