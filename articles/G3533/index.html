    <h2>  Documents for applying for a visa </h2><p>  To obtain a visa to Malta, you must submit to the embassy a full package of documents, otherwise you will be denied entry.  For citizens of Russia the following package of documents is required: </p><ol><li>  Passport of a citizen of Russia with copies necessary for applying for a visa. </li><li>  Valid passport. </li><li>  Photo size 3.5 * 4.5 cm - 3 pcs.  Pictures must be signed on the back with a pencil.  The face of the applicant should occupy 70-80% of the photograph. </li><li>  Application form for a visa to Malta, completed in English by typing. </li><li>  Medical insurance for the entire duration of the trip. </li></ol><p>  It is also required to have documents confirming financial guarantees.  Those who cannot provide such guarantees for any reason need to present the sponsor's documents with their confirmation or a sponsorship letter.  In addition, you must provide a student ID, a <span>pension certificate,</span> certificates from school, university, copies of birth certificates of children, marriage or divorce.  All certificates must be received no later than two weeks before the submission of documents. </p><h2>  Visa Application Dates </h2><p>  Documents should be submitted to the embassy approximately two weeks before the date of the planned trip.  But it should be borne in mind that in the midst of the tourist season in visa centers there can be a large number of applicants, and, accordingly, the time for considering documents during this period can significantly increase.  Documents are considered in a period of four to five days.  The time for issuing an urgent visa is much shorter. </p><h2>  Malta visa cost </h2><p>  Basically, the amount that you have to spend when applying for a visa to Malta consists of several items of expenses.  This is a tour purchase, payment for a flight, and so on.  In addition, the applicant must pay the service fees for the services provided by the visa center.  If you are doing paperwork yourself, then most likely your expenses will end there.  If a special agency, travel agency or any other intermediary company is engaged in obtaining a visa for you, then the cost will increase by the amount that you pay to your assistant organization for the services rendered. </p><p>  Please note that in case of refusal to enter Malta, most agencies return the money paid for their services.  But the funds paid as a service and <span>consular fee are</span> not returned to the client. </p>
