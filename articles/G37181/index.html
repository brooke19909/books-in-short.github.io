It is here that the highest concentration of entertainment and people per square meter.  Prices for food and housing can be found on any wallet.  However, according to reviews, Patong beach is not the best place for swimming, it is better to choose the nearby Karon, which can be quickly reached by motobike or tuk-tuk. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Patong Beach gained popularity back in the distant 80s of the last century and as a result turned into a real tourist Mecca.  It represents three kilometers of sand and a small town at the end.  It is here that the most famous clubs, bars, hotels and shops are concentrated. </p><p>  On December 26, 2004, Patong, along with the entire western coast of Phuket, was destroyed by the waves of a powerful tsunami and suffered much more than other areas.  The element claimed the lives of vacationers and staff, destroyed almost all coastal institutions.  To date, the beach has almost fully recovered and regained its former appearance.  This is indicated by numerous colorful photos and reviews of Patong Beach in Phuket. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate in Phuket is tropical, and the year is divided into periods of wet and dry season, while the temperature fluctuates slightly, in winter up to +30 ¬∫, in summer +34 ¬∫, the night is cooler by only 3-4 degrees.  However, these are indicators of meteorological centers, and they do not take into account many additional factors, for example, heated asphalt and roofs of houses or, conversely, cool after rain.  Therefore, you should not strongly believe in forecasts that unanimously say that in winter it is more comfortable and cool, in fact, because of rains, the opposite is true. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unlike other islands of the Gulf of Thailand, protected from all sides, Phuket is completely open to the elements, therefore it is characterized by heavy rains and high waves at sea. </p><p>  The rainy season here lasts from May to November, rainfall every day, and quite strong and noisy.  The peculiarity is that the rain does not last long and begins suddenly.  It can start five times a day and last only ten minutes, and it is almost impossible to predict the appearance of a new thundercloud. </p><p>  In September, according to reviews, Patong Beach, like in October, is not the best place to relax.  High waves, strong undercurrents that make swimming difficult, are added to the changing weather, and make it dangerous for children and inexperienced swimmers.  A more comfortable month for relaxing on Patong Beach is November.  According to reviews, there is already quite a bit of rain, and if they begin, they will soon bring a pleasant coolness, not irritation. </p>

    <h2>  Water in the sea </h2><p>  Patong is washed by the waves of the Andaman <span>Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Indian Ocean.</span>  The entrance to the water is gentle, and the bottom is covered with sand.  There are special places for swimming, separated from technical areas. </p><p>  Water, according to reviews, on Patong beach near the shore is unclear and not as turquoise as on advertising booklets.  And due to the abundance of yachts, jet skis and boats, it loses its natural smell, acquiring a little specific in return. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, tourists are still happy to swim in the sea, the water is always warm, and if there are no strong currents that raise sand from the bottom, then it is transparent.  Water sports such as surfing and snorkelling are popular on the beach.  The amazing marine life is worth considering carefully and slowly. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Finding good and affordable accommodation in Patong is easy.  A condo will cost from 3 to 65 euros per day, and the price for a villa by the sea ranges from 170 to 400 euros.  It all depends on the location, living conditions, infrastructure of the area and personal agreement with the owner. </p><p>  There are a lot of offers, in addition to hotels and villas, you can rent apartments and condominiums, bungalows, a townhouse or rent a house in a cottage village, but the last option is an expensive pleasure. </p><p>  Whatever choice you make, it is important to consider that long-term rental is the most profitable.  The longer the term, the lower the price.  Sometimes the owners require a security deposit to ensure the safety of the property, it is returned at the end of the lease term. </p><p>  According to reviews of Patong Beach in Thailand, finding a suitable housing option is worth worrying in advance, you can already bargain on the spot and lower the price.  Wishing a lot all year round. </p>

    <h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Behind the beach stretches a shady area and a park for relaxation and leisurely walks.  Immediately behind them is a highway, crossing which you find yourself on a long alley of restaurants, tour agencies, massage parlors, shops and money exchange points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The legendary Bangla Road, originating from the beach inland, originates here.  On both sides there are many <span>bars, cafes</span> and discos.  With good conscience, Bangla Road can be called the partying heart of the whole island of Phuket. </p><p>  At sunset, this street is blocked from transport, making it completely pedestrian.  At the same time, most entertainment and drinking establishments open.  Outwardly, it does not look very presentable, but the food is tasty and inexpensive, and strong drinks flow like water.  According to reviews, Patong Beach in Phuket is an ideal place for those who love and do not get tired of having fun all night long. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  You can get from the airport to the beach by minibus, but you will need local currency.  In 2017, a ticket cost 180 baht (about 260 rubles), you can buy it at the desks in the airport building or on the street, but then you have to defend a long line. </p><p>  You can choose a bus, but then you have to do a transfer.  From the airport, he will first deliver to the capital of the island - Phuket Town, where he will need to transfer to another bus, which will take you to the beach for 30 baht.  It turns out cheaper, but if there is a lot of luggage, it is better to choose the first method.  This is evidenced by the numerous reviews of tourists about Patong Beach.  From the nearby <span>beaches of Kata</span> and Karon, Patong can be easily reached for 40 baht by bus.  By the way, this transport runs only until five in the evening, so there‚Äôs a great chance to simply not be in time for it.  In general, the whole island has pretty good transport links. </p><p>  If there is money, then you can choose a taxi or knock-knock, their price will be higher than five times, but comfort and speed too.  The island has the opportunity to rent a bike or car.  True, you need to prepare for the fact that traffic during the day can be very busy, and Thais often ignore the rules of the road. </p>

    <h2>  Currency exchange </h2><p>  Exchangers can be found almost anywhere in Patong.  They are small booths with the Exchange signboard, it is difficult not to notice them.  The course fluctuates, so you can walk through several, compare and choose the most profitable.  Dollars with a lower face value are exchanged at a lower rate.  There is no commission, after each exchange transaction a check is issued. </p><p>  Experienced tourists advise the airport not to immediately change a large amount, since there is always an overvalued rate. </p><h2>  sights </h2><ol><li>  Loma Park. </li><li>  Buddhist temple Wat Suwan Kriri Wong.  It is located at the very exit of Patong, so to get to it, you will have to walk a bit or use public transport.  It is difficult to drive past the temple, as it is perfectly visible from the road. </li><li>  Mosque Masjid Nurul Islamiyah. </li><li>  Boxing Stadium. </li><li>  Cabaret show of transvestites "Simon". </li></ol>

It is located near the main street of Bangla Road, so finding it will be very simple. </p><p>  The center itself includes not only retail outlets, but also two food service areas, one of them on the ground floor, and the second in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Most of the positive reviews about Patong Beach in Phuket are focused on its nightlife.  It is considered the most noisy, dynamic and vibrant in the whole country, there are real legends about it.  There are all kinds of nightlife here: discos, bars and pubs, go-go shows, billiards, even prostitution, which, despite the ban in all of Thailand, is officially allowed here. </p><p>  It is on this beach that Simon, the largest transvestite show cabaret in Asia, works: incredible costumes, music, reincarnation skills, the most popular genre among Thais - a parody. </p><p>  Evening Patong is a shopping Mecca, dozens of merchants gather here to sell to tourists everything that their soul desires: cosmetics, traditional clothes, souvenirs.

    <h2>  Ten Gift Ideas </h2><p>  Reviews about Patong Beach are full of tips for buying souvenirs and trinkets.  There are really a lot of them.  Aromatic boats, carvings of geckos and turtles, small boats and tuk-tuks.  Prices are affordable, the choice is huge.  Everyone will be able to find a present to their liking.  For those who are not sure what it is worth bringing, there are some great tips.  Among the ten gift ideas, there is one that is right for you: </p><ol><li>  Jewelry.  It is not for nothing that Phuket is called the pearl of the Andaman Sea, because it is from its shores that the best pearls are extracted.  In addition to it, craftsmen use emeralds from Colombia, chrysolites, opals, topazes, diamonds from South Africa and garnets to make beautiful jewelry. </li><li>  Coconut oil nourishes and softens the skin, it is better to buy it in large shopping centers, in the edible oils department. </li><li>  Batik.  T-shirts, pareos, scarves, skirts and bags made using this technique combine bright colors and unique Thai style.  You can also purchase a solid canvas that can fit into any interior. </li><li>  Ceramic products, acting simultaneously as a household item and interior decoration. </li><li>  Wooden utensils - ladles, mugs, pepper shakers. </li><li>  Clothing.  In Phuket, you can find real designer items at affordable prices, there are almost all famous brands here: Ecco, Lacoste, Levis. </li><li>  Thai mask is not a very expensive original product, usually depicting the characters of myths or Buddha.  These products are cut out and painted by hand.  They cost around $ 10-20 per joke and are used to protect the house from evil spirits. </li><li>  Bags.  According to reviews, on Patong Beach you can find a bag made from anything: <span>crocodile leather,</span> papyrus tree, coconut fibers. </li><li>  Buddha figurines are made of a variety of materials - wood, stone.  You can find any shape and size, the price varies from ten to one hundred dollars.  Factory ones cost a minimum, but manual work is quite expensive. </li><li>  Souvenirs - magnets, charms, carvings and much more.
