  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to draw a chessboard and its figures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A chessboard is an integral part of the table sport process.  Its presence provides the possibility of the game itself, and a beautiful appearance gives aesthetic pleasure to the participants.  From time immemorial, the playing field was wooden, but with the development of technology and human imagination, the chessboard acquired a new look and material. </p><h2>  What should be a chessboard </h2><p>  Before you draw a chessboard, you should know what it represents externally.  The field consists of 64 two-color cells, the color of which changes sequentially.  Cells are arranged in 8 rows, each of them has 8 cells arranged vertically.  The horizontal row is denoted by Latin letters from A to H, and the vertical row from bottom to top with numbers from 1 to 8. As a rule, the first cell H1 is light in color.  From it begin the arrangement of the figures.  It must be remembered that cells of the same color can in no case be adjacent to each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tex.stackexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess board" class="if uuid-3065696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3065696.jpg"></div><h2>  What pieces should be in chess </h2><p>  Like a chessboard, figures should also be drawn with a pencil on a separate sheet of paper.  As a rule, they also come in two colors - white and black.  The player on each side owns two bishops, two knights, two rooks, one queen, one king and eight pawns.  For easier perception of the game, each figure is denoted by the usual way for players: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The king is the most important figure on the field.  It is usually taller than others and stands out with a crown on top. </li><li>  The queen is the second most important figure, albeit the strongest.  It is usually smaller than a king and has a small ball on top. </li><li>  The rook is usually depicted in the form of a tower and smaller in size than the above. </li><li>  The elephant is depicted in the form of a dome or a drop - just like that, in the European manner, the figure has a decoration in the form of a priest. </li><li>  The horse is often depicted in the form of a rider or horse. </li><li>  A pawn is usually the smallest piece and does not attract attention, only its tip has a rounded shape. <div class="photo" data-original="villains.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess pieces" class="if uuid-3065721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3065721.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to draw a chessboard on paper </h2><p>  1. To get started, you should acquire such necessary tools as: </p><ul><li>  Sheets of paper (to draw the necessary elements). </li><li>  Ruler (for drawing accuracy). </li><li>  Pencil (felt-tip pen, pen). </li><li>  Scissors (chess pieces will need to be cut). </li><li>  Adhesive tape (for gluing two opposite sides of the field and other elements). </li></ul><p>  2. First you need to attach 2 sheets of paper to each other as carefully as possible with adhesive tape to draw a chessboard.  Then cut off the excess part to get the correct square, the middle of which is at the junction of two sheets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  3. Before drawing a chessboard, make appropriate marks on the resulting square sheet of paper with a pencil.  The square should be divided into 64 identical cells.  To do this, it is best to mark 9 points on each side of the sheet and connect the opposite points with lines.  All points on one side should be at the same distance from each other.  As a result, you should get 64 cells that need to be painted over in accordance with the above rules. </p><p>  4. Other pieces of paper will be needed to draw the chess pieces.  Like sheets of a chessboard, each sheet should first be marked with dots from two ends on the same level with a pencil, and then connected.  The resulting rectangles will serve as the basis for the figures.  Each rectangle should be bent in two places to form 3 equal parts.  Both ends of the rectangle should be connected.  You will get a triangle, on the edges of which you should draw figures. </p><h2>  What happens </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.printchess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess board" class="if uuid-3065692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3065692.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, in just 30 minutes of simple work, the chessboard and figures will be ready in a beautiful design.  For a more durable service, you can laminate the board and figures, which will make them even more durable. </p>
