Various reasons make Russian tourists eagerly want to spend their long-awaited vacation on this unimaginable tropical patch of the Earth.  The many-sided and ambiguous Thailand attracts different categories of tourists: demanding wealthy travelers, Bounty-style vacationers, budget party-goers, extreme travelers, safari and diving enthusiasts, pilgrims, shoppers, sightseeing tourists, spa lovers or courageous sex tourists.  It seems that there is no entertainment that can not be tested while relaxing in Thailand. </p><p>  The regionalization of Thai resorts exactly coincides with their tourist specialization.  The colorful metropolis of Bangkok attracts business travelers, lovers of shopping and bustling city breaks, as well as pilgrims.  Phuket and Samui seem to be created for the discerning lovers of luxury relaxation, with a selected spa program, delicious food, tropical landscapes, white sands, flat beaches and clear sea.  And young, not broad-pocketed, but cheerful, unpretentious and gambling tourists invite bright Pattaya. </p>

    <h2>  About the colorful resort of Pattaya </h2><p>  Pattaya is the most full-blooded and crowded <span>resort in Thailand.</span>  However, at the same time and the most budget.  Established regular and charter flights between the airports of Russia and Pattaya created the preconditions for an even greater concentration of tourist flows to this already crowded resort.  It is a few hours drive from the main capital <span>Suvarnabhumi Airport,</span> which serves most of the international scheduled flights.  However, Pattaya also has its own regional air gate - U-Tapao Airport, where many charters from eastern Russian cities fly in the summer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For all its brightness and attractiveness, Pattaya is hardly suitable for lovers of a classic beach holiday.  The sea in this area can hardly be called "clean as a tear," and most of the beaches are very crowded.  But for lovers of nightlife, diving, shopping, dating, gastronomic adventures, Pattaya is ideal.  To match the entire resort, hotels here are also mostly budget. </p><h2>  How to choose a hotel in Pattaya? </h2><p>  When choosing a property in Pattaya, you should pay attention to its location, price, reviews of tourists and a range of services.  The logic of official stellar accreditation in Thailand, or rather the absence of this same logic, puzzles many travelers.  In addition, the declared category of the hotel may not be true, to put it mildly, you must be prepared in advance.  For example, the Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya 3 * hotel has an official 3 * category, but surpasses many 4 * and higher hotels in the selection and quality of services. </p><p>  The wrong hotel can spoil any vacation, so when choosing a hotel, you should arm yourself with skepticism about the star category and not take the time to collect reviews on specialized portals or from friends who have vacationed in Thailand. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The question of the location of the hotel, each tourist should analyze individually in accordance with their own preferences.  Hotel Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya) is located near the resort center, noisy and crowded, but the specific place where the hotel is located is quiet and pleasant.  The territory of the hotel complex is surrounded by tropical gardens, green areas, a picturesque park.  But such a necessary tourist infrastructure is very close: </p><ul><li>  Pattaya resort center - 7 km; </li><li>  only 30 minutes by car to Utapao Airport; </li><li>  Pattaya Floating Market - 3 km; </li><li>  the famous Buddhist temple Wat Wat Khao Phra Bat - 3.7 km; </li><li>  Walking Street, the most famous tourist pedestrian street, is 4.1 km away; </li><li>  Jomtien Beach is 2.1 km away (there is a free shuttle service). </li></ul><p>  Also within walking distance of the hotel are the Pattaya Park Tower, Alangkarn Theater and the popular Aquarium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most of all, staying at a hotel with a location such as the Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya is suitable for dynamic young people who prefer to combine many pleasant activities on vacation: going to the beach, excursions, visiting attractions, shopping, shopping streets, restaurants, as well as sports, SPA  Tourists who like to relax, cruising along the modest route bar-beach-restaurant-pool, definitely need to look at other hotels. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya 3 * has a very beautiful well-groomed territory.

    <p>  Such a food system is very logical, although it is often incomprehensible to tourists who wholeheartedly stuck to All inklusive.  The fact is that this hotel is aimed at tourists who do not spend a day on its territory, but travel through Thailand, go to interesting places in Pattaya.  It is assumed that they will also eat on the ground.  In addition, most travelers consider it a sacrilege to come to the resort, which is so famous for its cuisine, seafood, culinary traditions, and eat only standard food at the hotel. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has a total of 28 rooms of various categories.  The tourist can book apartments in the main building or in the villa.  There are rooms with one or two bedrooms, family rooms, deluxe.  A wonderful view of the garden and park opens from all rooms of the Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya.  Photo numbers will help to finally decide on the selection of the appropriate category. </p><p>  All apartments have a minibar, individual air conditioning, an electric kettle, soundproof windows, a furnished balcony or terrace, a hairdryer, and toiletries.  The family rooms also have a kitchenette with a stove, microwave, refrigerator, and dishes. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Good service, as you know, is in the details.  Even those who in ordinary life do not particularly pay attention to them, relaxing in the hotel, become attentive and pretentious.  Such are the paradoxes of spa life.  So, when evaluating the service at the Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya 3 * hotel, you should go through the quality of basic services in detail. </p><ol><li>  There is free high-speed Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. </li><li>  The hotel has 24-hour security (which is very useful, considering how close the hotel is to the large noisy and very alcoholic center of Pattaya). </li><li>  24 hour reception. </li><li>  Late Arrival / Departure Service. </li><li>  There are services for business travelers: a meeting room and a business corner with a printer and fax. </li><li>  Room service, cleaning (daily change of towels, change of bed linen 2 times a week). </li><li>  Laundry service. </li><li>  Free shuttle to the beach. </li><li>  Press delivery. </li></ol><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  It should be noted that of all the resorts in Thailand, Pattaya is the least suitable for families with children.  This is the patrimony of bustling youth, alcohol, shopping and nightlife.  But for older children or teens, Pattaya may be more interesting than Phuket or Samui. </p><p>  Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya has a children's pool and a large garden where you can have fun with your kids.  But there is no children's animation, children's clubs, playgrounds, cots or highchairs in the hotel. </p><p>  Hotel accommodation options for children: </p><ul><li>  Children under 7 years old can stay at the hotel for free, but in this case they will not be provided with an extra bed. </li><li>  Supplement for children over seven years old is THB 500 / day.  In this case, the child is provided with an Extra bed. </li></ul><h2>  Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel - this is the most subjective unit, which should be guided when choosing an overnight stay.  However, reviews in many cases turn out to be very useful, you only need to soberly evaluate the information provided by their authors.  For example, about Icheck Inn Jomtien Pattaya 3 *, reviews can be found both positive and negative. </p><p>  Tourists who visited this hotel note the excellent hotel accommodation, proximity to shopping centers and attractions, large, clean rooms, good service, a large well-groomed green area, fast free internet throughout, low cost of living. </p>

    <p>  The authors of negative reviews rightly point out some problematic aspects of the rest: the beach is quite far away, the coast itself is dirty, the sea is muddy, Jomtien beach is crowded with tourists, the food in the hotel is not very diverse.  But the negative reviews that Pattaya is a very noisy resort, that the local motorcycle taxi is completely uncomfortable, that Thai girls are not at all beautiful, the local food is spicy, and there are too many tourists, it should be taken indirectly, because they are not directly related to the hotel . </p>
