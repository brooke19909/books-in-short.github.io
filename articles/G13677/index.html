Of course, after the tedious work and not too favorable environmental conditions of big cities, I want to rather soak up the sun and swim in the azure waves of the Mediterranean, Black or Red Seas.  I want to run away from human fuss and the so-called benefits of civilization.  However, you only need to visit the ski resorts - at least once, and the opinion about a quality and good rest will immediately change. </p><p>  Relaxing with health benefits?  Easy </p><p>  Ski tours are a great option for outdoor activities, the main advantage of which is physical activity in the fresh and clean mountain air, which strengthens your health and improves your mood.  Many people who write reviews about ski resorts in different countries note the fact that winter vacations often come out much more useful and more pleasant than summer ones. </p><p>  Of course, vacationing in the <span>snowy resorts of</span> Europe can seriously hit the budget - after all, you go there not just to look at the slopes, but to try to get on the skis or hone your skills, take a tour of the cable car or sit in a cozy cafe, waiting for the snow to fall.  All these activities require financial investments - some to a greater extent, and some to a lesser extent.  The way out of this situation is simple: you need to go to such ski resorts, which are considered budgetary, but give a lot of positive emotions and fabulous impressions. </p><p>  An ideal place for an active winter holiday in terms of combining price and quality can be considered two areas: resorts in Eastern Europe and resorts <span>in Western Europe.</span>  Eastern European have some advantage - their rather low status and lack of prestige ensures that there will be no influx of tourists even in the midst of the season.  In addition, in Romania, Slovenia or the Czech Republic, guests are waiting for very convenient inexpensive hotels, restaurants and sightseeing tours.  For some reason, it is generally accepted that this part of Europe cannot offer tourists a high level of service - but this should not be a problem for those who come here for adrenaline, a healthy vacation and new sensations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Western ski resorts guarantee the availability of well-equipped slopes, expensive hotels, upscale restaurants and the highest level of service.  Their advantage is safety and stability, and slightly more affordable prices can be found in not too popular resort towns in the foothills of the Pyrenees or the Alps. </p><p>  Give preference to one thing </p><p>  So, the most interesting budget options are: </p><p>  - French ski resorts: Brides-les-Bains, Cotres and Saint-Gervais.  These are wonderful places to relax, in which there are high-quality <span>skiing</span> and snowboarding trails, a rich nightlife, excellent hotels and hotels, and Saint-Gervais also has the opportunity for an amazing spa vacation; </p><p>  - towns in Andorra: Soldo and Pas de la Casa - very small, hidden from prying eyes, but having the best ski area in the western part of Europe, the latest equipment and new ski lifts.  And most importantly, their advantage is the presence of a small number of other tourists; </p><p>  - Slovenian resort Bohinj - a paradise in which <span>skiing</span> trails are located near the picturesque local lake, and the town of Vogel, located so high in the mountains that you have to get to it only with the help of a ski lift; </p><p>  - many affordable and interesting resort corners in the High and Low Slovak Tatras: Jasna and Poprad, very modern by the standards of Eastern Europe, interconnected by a complex system of <span>cable cars</span> and lifts; </p><p>  - Gothic and memorable town of Poiana Brasov, located in Romania.  Here the rest will not be complete if guests do not visit the famous Transylvania, the birthplace of the famous vampire <span>Count Dracula,</span> celebrated by Brem Stoker <span>.</span> </p>
