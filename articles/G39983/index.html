If this is your goal, then ancient Athens, whose beaches are world famous for their cleanliness and well-being, will give you many unforgettable moments. </p><h2>  When is the best time to relax in Athens? </h2><p>  Greece is suitable for an all-weather holiday, but if you prefer to spend time on the beach, then you should wait for the summer months.  It is believed that the high season begins in May, at which time the weather in Athens is wonderful, the air temperature reaches a pleasant twenty-five degrees Celsius.  The heat does not bring stupefying stuffiness, and a fresh breeze pleasantly blows tourists who want to take a walk before bedtime. </p><p>  In winter, Greece is also quite attractive, snow rarely falls on the coast, and the weather in Athens only pleases.  The thermometer does not fall below ten degrees Celsius.  This allows you to enjoy the sea air and make long walks while exploring the sights of the beautiful Greek capital. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Athens beaches" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1581067.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Athens beaches: features </h2><p>  Athens is considered an ideal place for a beach holiday.  Judge for yourself, there are three hundred sunny days a year and several hundred beaches that are incredibly beautiful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All beach areas are divided into wild and private.  The first in Athens and in the suburbs is a huge number.  They are located in secluded bays and surrounded by pristine nature.  Sometimes around such recreation areas you can find the ruins of temples or monasteries, which are available for inspection five days a week. </p><p>  Private beaches in the Greek capital are well equipped.  Of course, you will have to pay an entrance fee, but you will not see the level of service that Athens provides anywhere.  The beaches in private hands have not only sun loungers and umbrellas, but also a lot of entertainment that can diversify the rest.  Those wishing to try the famous Greek cuisine receive food directly to the sun lounger from the nearest restaurant.  There is also a soft drink delivery service. </p><h2>  Refined beaches: Glyfada </h2><p>  Athens is well known for its suburbs, where you can relax perfectly in the vicinity of the capital.  Most areas are within twenty kilometers of the ancient city and have their own beaches with lots of attractions. </p><p>  Glyfada is a luxurious city on the shores of the Saronic Gulf.  It is only fourteen kilometers from Athens, which is successfully used by tourists who prefer a measured beach holiday during the day, and in the evenings want to get an impression of entertainment in the capital. </p>

    <p>  The suburb is famous for its beaches, most of them are awarded the highest rating for cleanliness and amenities.  Since the beginning of the 2000s, almost all the beaches of Glyfada have been given to private owners.  This allowed to increase deductions to the local budget and raise the level of tourist services.  Even those travelers who choose Athens as their vacation destination, the beaches of Glyfada do not pass by.  Everyone seeks to soak up the sandy shore with a gentle entrance to the water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Several public transport routes run from the center of Athens to Glyfada; they cover the distance in thirty minutes.  In addition, the suburbs can be reached by taxi or by transfer from the hotel. </p><h2>  Votsalakia - a beach between two bays </h2><p>  Many tourists, arriving in Athens, always spend one day visiting Piraeus.  It is located only ten kilometers from the capital, but is considered an independent city.  Almost the whole of Piraeus is a huge port, distinguished by its beauty and perfect match with the historical face of the capital.  There are many attractions here, it is difficult to see them in one day.  But the beaches are clearly not enough. </p>

    <p>  Tourists can only recommend Votsalakia beach.  It is located within the port and is free.  The beach is successfully located in a picturesque lagoon between two bays and stands out for its amazing purity of water, which is not at all characteristic of the port area. </p><p>  Due to the proximity to the port infrastructure, you can have time to sunbathe and visit several museums.  The prices in local cafes will pleasantly surprise the tourist with cheapness, and the food will taste great. </p>
