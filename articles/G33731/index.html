The ancient culture of Montenegrins, the city of Budva, founded during the Roman Empire, incredibly beautiful landscapes, mild climate and the azure Adriatic Sea attract new travelers every year and attract those who have already visited here to return. </p>

    <p>  Compared with other Montenegro resorts, Budva will seem a little expensive pleasure, but this is the only minus that vacationers indicate about it in their reviews.  In fact, if you book accommodation in advance, you can choose a fairly inexpensive room in a hotel or villa, for example, Villa Monte Royale 4 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This mini-hotel is worth a visit if only for stunning views from its windows that look at the mountains and the city lying just below.  Budva itself is beautiful - the walls of small houses, most often two- or three-story ones, are painted in light colors, so the red tiles of their roofs look so impressive. </p><p>  He "drowns" in green under a bright blue sky, and it is amazing when it comes to understanding that he looked just as romantic and peaceful one hundred and three hundred years ago. </p><h2>  Villa Hotel </h2><p>  It is very important to see Budva today, while it is not ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù by new buildings, which are beginning to stubbornly appear on its outskirts in the form of five- and six-story buildings.  The construction boom in the fashionable and fairly expensive resort is inevitable, but it is hotels like Villa Monte Royale that are his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù. </p><p>  As vacationers note, it has the most advantageous location.  It is located in a quiet part of Budva, where nothing will disturb your peace, but at the same time it is only 10-15 minutes walk from the Old Town and the bustling center.  You will have to walk 400 meters to the sea, but they are difficult for some guests of the hotel, since the path lies past cafes that meet everyone with the incredible aroma of coffee, restaurants and shops.  If you believe the tourists, it takes a lot of willpower to walk 400 meters to the beach and back without diving into any institution along the way. </p>

    <p>  This villa of three floors, painted in light pastel colors traditional for Montenegro, attracts customers by the fact that, even for a while, they become good neighbors for each other, not disturbing each other's peace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The small territory of Villa Monte Royale is a parking lot, a lawn with flower beds and palm trees behind an openwork fence.  Friendly staff, a cozy lounge and luxurious views complete the overall impression of this small hotel. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  What can Villa Monte Royale offer its customers?  The description of the rooms will not take much time, since there are only 10 of them: </p><ul><li>  Two standard double rooms with a balcony with a view of either the garden or the mountains. </li><li>  Six studio rooms for two + one person. </li><li>  Two rooms are four-room two-room apartments. </li></ul>

    <p>  Upholstered furniture in the rooms is above all praise, but they are united not only by this: </p><ul><li>  All apartments have a small kitchenette with a fridge and utensils. </li><li>  Parquet or tiled floors shine with cleanliness. </li><li>  Air conditioning is associated with an oasis on especially hot days. </li><li>  A TV with satellite and cable channels. </li><li>  Shower and toilet with necessary accessories. </li></ul><p>  At Villa Monte Royale, the service is such that towels are changed and cleaned daily, and bed linen is changed twice a week. </p><p>  Since the hotel has a Russian-speaking staff, there are no problems communicating on accommodation issues.  This is another plus, which is mentioned by guests in their reviews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  There is no restaurant <span>at Villa</span> Monte Royale, but you can pre-book a guesthouse or half board, and then food will be delivered to your room from the nearest restaurant.  Experienced travelers do not recommend this, as the national cuisine and local flavor can be found only by sitting in the pub or cafe of the city. </p><p>  What should I say?  Meat lovers in Budva are more lucky than those who do not eat it, since it costs an order of magnitude cheaper than the same fish.  National Montenegrin cuisine is a ‚Äúmixture‚Äù of seafood, as it should be in any coastal town, and a large selection of meat dishes.  With the first there are no restrictions in quantity: mussels, squids, fish of different varieties, and all this with delicious sauces, fried or grilled. </p>

    <p>  Of the meat dishes, the tourists in their reports most note the stewed lamb and ‚Äúprshut‚Äù - a ham according to a special local recipe. </p><p>  Rakia and local grape and fruit wines will brighten up lunch and dinner, which, by the way, in the most expensive restaurant in the old part of the city will cost 60-70 ‚Ç¨ for two, while a full breakfast can be for 6-8 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  Lunch in a cafe rarely exceeds 30 ‚Ç¨ for two, but those who prefer not to spend a lot of money on food are waiting for numerous pizzerias, stalls with shawarma and burgers and trays with local delicious cakes, pies and sweets. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to local cheeses - from Brynza to elite varieties that are made here simply masterfully. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The pride of Budva is its coast.  It is not for nothing that the beaches of the city and its environs repeatedly receive the Blue Flag for ecological cleanliness and well-being.  There are six of them only in the city, and the total length is almost 11 km. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of Villa Monte Royale, the Slavyansky beach is pebbly and sandy, with good entry into the sea.  It is considered the largest in length and inexpensive, for example, two sun loungers with an umbrella will cost vacationers only 6-8 ‚Ç¨ per day. </p><p>  The only drawback, as some fastidious hotel guests say, is the large number of people on the Slavyansk beach during the season, but the rest claim that there is enough space for everyone there and no one is sitting on each other‚Äôs head. </p>

    <p>  If you do not like the beach near the hotel, which you can walk to in a leisurely 7-10 minutes, you should stop at Mogren.  It has its pros and cons: </p><ul><li>  From Hotel Villa Monte Royale it is about 20 minutes walk. </li><li>  It is covered with small pebbles, but sand is also found. </li><li>  Clear water and a good bottom, but you should be prepared for the fact that the depth here comes sharply.  It is better for parents with children to choose ‚ÄúGuvanets‚Äù in the eastern part of the city, on which the sand is covered, and the entrance to the sea is gentle. </li><li>  This is one of the most picturesque places of Budva.  The coast is divided by a rock into two parts and a passage is made in it.  The rock itself is very attractive, as it is covered with dense greenery, and seductive for those who like to climb higher. </li><li>  The disadvantage of the beach, many guests at Villa Monte Royale consider the overpriced prices for services, as two sun loungers with an umbrella will cost here 15 ‚Ç¨. </li></ul><p>  In general, the transport runs so well, and the weather in Budva favors sunbathing, so you can choose any of its beaches and enjoy your vacation. </p><h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><p>  Another of the reasons why you should choose Villa Monte Royale (cat. Lux) for your vacation is its convenient location.  Just a couple of minutes from it is a bus stop going to the Old Town and to other attractions. </p><p>  The main place of tourist "pilgrimage" is the ancient citadel.  Built in the distant 840 as a defense against the attack of the Turks, it still impresses with its tall walls of two meters thick. </p><p>  It offers stunning views of Budva and the Adriatic Sea, and once formidable, today the citadel is an open-air museum that often hosts festivals and concerts.  To complement the experience, experienced tourists strongly recommend visiting a small restaurant in the castle and combining the beautiful view from the tower with delicious local cuisine. </p>
