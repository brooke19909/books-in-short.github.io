The inhabitants of the monastery, as well as the parishioners of the adjoining settlement, are characterized by chronicles as quiet and peaceful people.  However, there are facts that suggest that they were able to fend for themselves.  For example, at the beginning of the seventeenth century they sent a complaint to the Synod, speaking out against the tavern opened near the Trinity-Sergius Monastery.  No matter what income the drinking establishments promised, they listened to the residents of Pokrov - and closed the ‚Äúcircle yard‚Äù.  Over time, the settlement was attacked by the Poles.  It was burned to the ground, but quickly rebuilt. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who visited Pokrov?  Museums, attractions. </p>

    <p>  What other attractions were built then (Veil)?  Near the gates of the monastery was built a wooden church of the Prophet Elijah.  Of course, the island on which the Orthodox shrines were built became a place of pilgrimage.  For those who wanted to offer prayers to the Lord, a monastery hotel and a dining room were built, the stay in which was free.  But laymen could be in them no more than three days. </p><p>  After the communists came to power, the monastery, like other religious buildings, suffered a bitter fate.  The cathedral was not destroyed, but its inhabitants were dispersed, and the premises were transferred to a children's labor colony.  In the nineties of the last century, the buildings were again transferred to the Orthodox Church.  And if before the revolution there was a working monastery, then in our time it has become a monastery for women.  Its territory is striking in its abundance of picturesque places.  This is a wooden bridge, and well-kept flower beds in the garden, beautiful descents to the water.  In addition, travelers will undoubtedly be pleased to contemplate the refined and austere beauty of the restored monastery. </p><p>  In addition, travelers will be amazed by the luxurious nature around the Black and White lakes.  Mighty pine trees frame their shores.  And on Lake Black there are healing mud. </p><h2>  Holy Protection Church </h2><p>  What else is interesting Pokrov?  Sights, photos of which are presented in the article, captivate tourists with their history and appearance.  For example, in Pokrov itself there is an ancient shrine, a temple, near which several centuries ago a settlement first formed, and then a city.  This is the Holy Protection Church, which first belonged to the same Anthony desert, and was wooden.  Then they built a beautiful building with gilded domes. </p>
