    <p>  Tourists come here on sightseeing buses, and the time to travel from Yerevan in their car will not take more than an hour and a half.  Part of the road, about 8 km, stretches through the gorge, along the river bed.  Here the heartbeat stops from fear and delight when you drive among steep red rocks and sharp turns.  Amazing places are often found along the way, where you want to stop and go out to enjoy the scenery. </p><p>  The monastery has a quiet, spiritual atmosphere.  The nearest Eden Cafe is a 5-minute drive away. </p><h2>  The history of the complex </h2><p>  Noravank Monastery in Armenia, located 120 km from Yerevan, owes its history to Bishop Hovhannes, who chose this amazingly beautiful place for his episcopate in 1205. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Previously, an old church already existed here, from which by that time there were only ruins.  The name of the complex is translated as ‚Äúnew monastery‚Äù. </p><p>  Everyone who visits him feels a special energy and grace of this place where prayers have been offered to God for many centuries. </p><p>  The next two centuries since its foundation were a period of prosperity and development.  The royal dynasty of Orbelian, who ruled at that time, founded his residence here, made the monastery a center of spiritual and cultural life, built a kind of crypt here.  The monastery had strong ties with Gladzor University and other educational centers of the time. </p><h2>  The role of Noravank in the history of Armenia </h2><p>  Since ancient times, the <span>Armenian Church</span> has played an important role in the development of the cultural and political life of the country, in the spiritual life of the people.  She kept records, many manuscripts were translated and copied in churches.  The ancient Noravank monastery in Armenia, like many others, is a unique monument of medieval architecture, is a testament to the Christian life of the Armenian people in ancient times. </p><p>  Noravank was a real cultural center of Armenia, it was chosen as the place for life and work by the best Armenian figures of the Middle Ages, who were subsequently buried here.  Among them is the outstanding politician and religious leader Stepanos Orbelian, known for his books, the architect of the Momik monastery. <em></em></p><h2>  Monastery construction </h2><p>  Armenia at the beginning of the 13th century was attacked by the Mongols.  As soon as the monastery was rebuilt, it was completely looted.  And only due to the fact that Prince Elikum Orbelian was able to conclude a truce with Agu Khan, there came a time of relative rest before the next attack of Timurid. </p><p>  Earthquakes and wars repeatedly destroyed the churches and architectural structures of the complex, which over the centuries have invariably been restored. </p><h2>  Buildings and churches of Noravank complex </h2><p>  Here is the small church of Surb-Karapet (St. John the Baptist), which was first erected in the monastery.  It was built in the twenties of the thirteenth century under Prince Liparit Orbelian.  Its dome several times collapsed due to earthquakes, it stood in ruins for a long time.  She is famous for the unusual image of God the Father.  Now the church has been restored at the expense of donors.  Later, the chapel Surb Grigor (St. Gregory) was attached to the church. </p><p>  During the reign of Prince Burtel in Noravank Monastery in Armenia, by 1339, the church-tomb of the Orbelian clan Surb Astvatsatsin (Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary) was built. </p>

    <p>  It has two floors, and if you climb a narrow staircase without a railing up, which not everyone risks, then it will lead to a chapel with a bell.  Above the entrance are beautiful bas-reliefs with images of the Blessed Virgin with a baby and archangels, on the portal of the second floor - with Jesus.  It is interesting for its engineering solution: the dome in the form of a cone rests on 12 columns. </p><h2>  Khachkars </h2><p>  Noravank in Armenia is famous for khachkars of extraordinary beauty, some of them were carved by Momik and his students.  His works were created under the influence of Gothic and Middle Eastern traditions.  They are dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ, Mother of God, holy martyrs. </p><p>  Khachkars in Armenia play a special role.  This is a kind of iconography on a stone: they are made with the image of St. George to give courage to the soldiers, and the Virgin Mary with the baby Christ blesses the house and motherhood.  In addition, they are also erected as monuments. </p><p>  The word "khachkars" means "cross" and "stone" in translation.  Crosses and holy images were carved on them, and the entire surface was decorated with ornaments and patterns that turned the stone into lace.  Skilled carvers glorified their country, many khachkars are monuments of world significance. </p><h2>  Noravank and Momik </h2><p>  The great artist and architect Momik, who wrote his name, which means ‚Äúcandle‚Äù, into the history of Armenia with magnificent works of art, made his invaluable contribution to the history and development of the monastery. </p><p>  He was born in Vayots in the Dzorm region.  Bishop Stepanos Orbelian drew attention to the talents of Momik and invited him to participate in the construction and design of the monastery complex.  In 2010, the Armenian government decided to create the Momik Museum in Noravank for its 750th anniversary. </p><p>  As a student of the monk Ovasap, Momik had extensive knowledge of religion, knew Greek. <em></em></p>

    <p><em> </em>  As a result of the works of Momik Armenia, skillfully carved cross-stones, bas-reliefs, sculptures above the narthex appeared in Noravank. </p><p>  He was an architect and artist of the church of St. Astvatsatsin.  Many of his works are stored in Yerevan in Matenadaran. </p><p>  In Noravank, the memory of Momik was honored with the establishment of a cross-stone, but his fans keep it in their hearts, ‚Äùhe created so much beautiful for his life, working on the creation of a monastery complex in Noravank. </p><p>  The turbulent once-life in Noravank has long ceased.  The silence and singing of birds is broken by the voices of tourists, pilgrims and restorers.  But its uniqueness and beauty, the work and love that the creators put into it, find a response in the hearts of contemporaries.  They continue to visit and admire the Noravank Monastery in Armenia with great interest. </p>
