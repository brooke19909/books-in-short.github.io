How to fund your Beeline account with MTS?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All mobile operators have long launched the function of transferring money from one number to another.  Subscribers considered this a very convenient innovation, because it allows in a critical situation to transfer funds from one number to another within the same operator.  But it happens that it is necessary to send, for example, money from MTS to Beeline.  Is it possible?  Do mobile operators provide for such an exchange?  Let's get it right.  In this article, we will consider how money can be transferred from MTS to Beeline.  In fact, this is nothing complicated.  We also learn how to replenish Beeline with MTS.  It will not be amiss to consider ways of transferring money within the framework of the numbers of one mobile operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money from pay to beeline" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/359764.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  Standard <span>money transfer</span> between Beeline numbers </h2><p>  The Beeline money transfer service allows you to transfer <span>funds</span> from the account of one subscriber to the account of another.  The Mobile Transfer service is available to all Beeline users, it does not require activation.  Its convenience lies in the fact that at any time of the day, if the necessary amount of money is available on the mobile account, the subscriber can transfer funds to any other Beeline communication user in need, whether it is a relative, friend, just a friend or even a stranger.  But money is not transferred from one mobile account to another instantly.  To do this, you need to send a request to the operator, and then confirm the money transfer operation.  To perform the operation, it is necessary to enter the following combination on the keyboard: “*”, then indicate “145” and again “*”, enter the recipient's phone number, press “*” again, indicate the transfer amount, then press “#” and the call key .  The phone number must be indicated without the number "8" or "7", and the amount must be an integer, regardless of what currency is provided in your tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recharge beeline with pay" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/359762.jpg?1395730148071" width="370"></div>

The operator set a limit on the amount transferred - a maximum of 300 rubles.  If you need to send more, you can create a repeated similar application.  As in the case of a transfer to Beeline, the amount should be indicated as an integer (for example, 200 rubles).  After sending the request, you should receive a message with the operation confirmation code.  To complete the transfer, we create a request: “*”, then 112, again “*”, specify the confirmation code, press “#” and the call button.

    </li><li><p>  MTS has an option for subscribers called Direct Transfer.  It (transmission) can be regular or one-time.  Under the terms of the first type of this service, the subscriber can establish a regular transfer of money to another subscriber (once a day, week, month - the timer allows you to choose any frequency).  To activate regular transmission, you need to dial on the mobile: “*”, then 111, again “*”, number 7, press “#” and the call button.  As a result, a window with menu items will appear.  Press “more”, select “regular replenishment”, enter the recipient's number, select the frequency of transfer (1 - daily, 2 - every week, 3 - every month), indicate the transfer amount, send a request.  Soon a message should come with information about the confirmation of the operation or with the reason for the refusal.  For a one-time transfer, the algorithm is similar, only in the menu you must select the "one-time replenishment" item. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  To transfer money to another MTS subscriber, you can send a message to number 9060. In SMS, indicate the number of the recipient and the amount of replenishment, separated by a space.  In the response message you will receive a confirmation code of the operation, which must be sent to the same number 9060. </p><p>  In order for the MTS system to allow you to transfer money to another subscriber, you must have on your phone account an amount exceeding the amount you want to transfer by 50 (and in some regions by 80-90) rubles.  It should also be noted that translation is possible only within one region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay transfer money to the beeline" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/359767.jpg?1395730260513" width="560"></div>

    </li></ol><h2>  How to transfer money from MTS to Beeline? </h2><p>  In fact, this is not at all difficult to do.  Money can be transferred from MTS to Beeline in several ways: </p><ol><li><p>  The easiest way to transfer money to a Beeline subscriber is to send the following command from the phone: “*”, then 115, “#” and the call button.  A menu will open where you need to select "Easy payment", then the category "Mobile phone", enter the recipient's number, consisting of ten digits, and also indicate the amount of transfer.  After completing the request, a message should be received from the number 6996. It is necessary to respond to this message within 15 minutes.  To confirm the operation, we send an SMS with any text to the number 6996. By sending a message with the text "0", you can cancel the operation.  Thus, money can be transferred from MTS to Beeline or Megafon.  The minimum balance after transferring money to the subscriber of another operator should not be less than 10 rubles, otherwise the system will refuse to carry out the operation.  It should also be noted that in some tariffs money cannot be transferred from MTS to Beeline for free - the transfer fee is 10% of the amount.  What kind of tariffs can be obtained from the operator. </p></li><li><p>  You can transfer money from MTS to Beeline or Megafon in another way - using the official MTS website.  To do this, go to the page “Payment for goods and services” on the company’s website, select “Beeline” (or “Megaphone”), indicate the recipient’s phone number and transfer amount.  On the same page, in the item “From the MTS phone account”, check the box and go to the “next” button to the next stage of the transfer.  In the new window, enter your phone number and click the "Get Password" button.  An SMS with a password will come to the phone, with which you can enter your personal account on the site.  Further, following the instructions of the system, you need to confirm the payment.  The commission will be 10% of the transferred amount. </p></li></ol><h2>  Money transfer from Beeline number to MTS </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer from mts to beeline" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/359766.jpg?1395730208785" width="600"></div></h2><p>  We already learned how money can be transferred from MTS to Beeline, now we will consider the reverse procedure.  It can also be carried out using several methods. </p><ol><li><p>  You can do this through the Beeline website by selecting the "Transfer funds" item, select "MTS" from the list of operators, indicate the recipient's phone number, transfer amount, click "Pay".  In the new authorization window, you must enter your Beeline number, enter the password in the corresponding field, which will be received in the SMS message.  Now, being already in your personal account, it remains only to confirm the payment. </p></li><li><p>  It is very convenient to transfer from Beeline to MTS by sending SMS to 7878. In the body of the message, indicate: mts, then put a space, indicate the recipient's phone number, again a space, enter the transfer amount.  In the response SMS there will be a confirmation code, which must be sent to the same number - 7878. </p></li></ol><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, mobile operators are now in a relationship of mutually beneficial cooperation.  And this, of course, is beneficial for their subscribers.  Transferring money from one operator’s number to another’s number is not difficult, which means that there is a way out of any situation! </p>
