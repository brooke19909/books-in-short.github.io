    <p>  And today, buying an ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù is a pleasure, as they say, not cheap.  Nevertheless, hundreds of millions of Russians acquire new cars every year.  Still, the car in modern conditions is becoming more affordable.  This is due to the fact that automakers are trying to produce models that would satisfy the needs of people with different income levels.  However, the situation is far from perfect, so a significant part of the citizens of our country is still forced to save money to become owners of the car.  Of course, they are intensely thinking about how to accumulate on the machine, as they say, quickly and without delay.  The recommendations below will undoubtedly be useful for those who dream of acquiring an ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù. </p><p>  So, let's move on to a practical consideration of the question of how to accumulate on a machine to everyone who so insanely wants it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Setting a clear goal </h2><p>  Naturally, you should understand that one desire to buy a car is not enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to save money for a car" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/389515.jpg?1399292494587" width="295"></div>  First of all, you must determine what kind of ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù you need, its brand, color, technical characteristics.  Decide in advance how much financial resources will be required to purchase a vehicle.  Remember, the more motivated you are to make a deal, the clearer the goal will be looming in your head about how to accumulate on the machine as quickly as possible.  If your desire to buy a car will be burning, then be sure that it will come true.

    <h2>  Plan your budget wisely </h2><p>  You must learn to control your family budget.  Analyze your own expenses.  Perhaps you have bad habits?  If you smoke, for example, 2 packs of cigarettes a day, spending from 150 to 200 rubles, then you should think about how to get rid of <span>nicotine addiction.</span>  This will significantly reduce the time to achieve your goal.  It is possible that at the end of the working week you are used to relaxing in the company of your work colleagues or colleagues for a glass of expensive cognac.  To solve the question of how to save up for a car without putting the matter back in the long drawer, you will have to cut this expense item as well.  Think about how you can optimize your other expenses.  If you manage to do this, then the free 15-20% of your income can be set aside for the purchase of a car.  At the same time, such a budget reduction will not be too burdensome for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Conservation and accumulation of funds </h2>

    <p>  Remember that any investment is fraught with certain risks, so if you are determined to do this, then use not all your money, but only part of it. </p><h2>  Car loans </h2><p>  Currently, those people who in the shortest possible time need a car, for example, to conduct business, are offered to issue it on credit.  Of course, if a person‚Äôs conditions are not overly burdensome, then this option of acquiring an ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù should not be ignored.  Compare among themselves offers from various banks and choose the most advantageous one from them.  You just have to contact a financial institution, draw up the necessary papers and car keys very soon will be on hand.  All.  You no longer need to solve the problem of <span>how to save money</span> for a car.  However, in return you will receive another - every month you will need to make a certain amount of money on time to repay the loan, with interest.  Which option is better to purchase a car - it's up to you. </p><p>  At the same time, employees of banking institutions themselves, giving tacit comments on the advantages and disadvantages of lending, say that you should not borrow money for a car that will start to fall in price very soon.  Otherwise, you risk paying him a double price.  In addition to this, you will be required to pay interest on the loan, draw up an insurance policy and other additional expenses. </p><h2>  What is the situation in European countries? </h2>

    <p>  Of course, Europeans, like Russians, like to ride in comfortable and high-speed cars.  However, they approach the purchase of vehicles more carefully than our compatriots.  Residents of the ‚ÄúOld World‚Äù always soberly assess their financial capabilities and do not undertake to make a purchase for an amount that exceeds their eight-month income. </p><h2>  How to become an ordinary student a car owner? </h2><p>  Today, a car is the ultimate dream for young people.  University students just sleep and see how they drive some kind of high-speed and maneuverable car.  But how can a student save up for a car and is it possible <span>?</span>  <span>Of course, this</span> is not an easy task, however, as you know, nothing is impossible in the world.  But young people will have to seriously limit themselves in their means and strictly control all their expenses.  Again, you need to start with setting a goal and determining a specific date when it really needs to be fulfilled. </p>
