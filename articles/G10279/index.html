The most significant of them are flags and coats of arms of the countries of the world, which were previously symbols of individual families, but are now aimed at demonstrating what <span>state power</span> is based on <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Coat of arms history </h2><p>  The very first prototype of the coat of arms in its modern form was the totemic image of patrons or animals that were used in the primitive world.  Immediate prototypes were signs of patrimonial and family distinctions, which were used both among the Slavs and among other nationalities. </p>

    <p>  Officially, the first emblems of the countries of the world appeared in the III millennium BC.  e.  They are considered emblems that were minted on ancient coins and medals.  One of the first was an eagle with a lion's head, which was a symbol of the Sumerians.  It is also known about the snake - the symbol of Egypt, the eagle - the symbol of Persia, which later became the sign of Rome.  And in Ancient <span>Greece</span> there were many <span>coats of arms</span> , for example, an owl in Athens, a winged horse in Corinth, a rose in Rhodes, a peacock in Samos, etc. It is noteworthy that the modern Russian symbol - the double-headed eagle - was borrowed from Byzantine culture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first clan arms </h2><p>  In Western Europe in the Middle Ages clan emblems appeared, which were subsequently modified.  Now they are the arms of different countries.  The first specimen is considered a shield on which six golden lions are depicted.  There are many versions regarding his appearance, but the most popular, although controversial, is that Geoffrey V received it after marrying Princess Matilda, daughter of the English king Henry I. </p><p>  The proliferation of such symbols was caused by the need to distinguish knights who were chained in armor.  Coats of arms were depicted on their shields and were an important factor for the identification of warriors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flags and emblems of the world" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/383963.jpg?1398683165383" width="479"></div>  Elements of patrimonial symbols served as components of knightly armament and uniforms.  The emblems quickly spread and became hereditary, and some of them became symbols of the monarchies, subsequently turning into emblems of the countries of the world.

    <h2>  Family Coats of Arms </h2><p>  There are several types: family, generic and personal.  <span>The family coat of arms</span> is a kind of patrimonial symbolism that carries the main values ​​of a certain kind, <span>social status</span> and serves as a reminder to posterity that <span>family traditions</span> must be respected <span>.</span>  The purpose of such an emblem is to maintain communication between the generations of the same dynasty and capture the achievements of all its members in order to remain the connecting link between all representatives. </p><p>  Sometimes the family coat of arms is called family coat of arms, this is not at all surprising, because the word "surname" in translation means precisely "family".  The holder of such symbolism can become the ancestor who will pass on to his heirs and all future generations the achievements and the values ​​promoted by him.  History knows cases when family heraldry became a symbol of state power, i.e. these symbols are now emblems of the countries of the world. </p>

    <h2>  Family and personal emblems </h2><p>  Generic symbolism, on the contrary, does not show personal symbols, it observes the main features of the dynasty, distinguishing it from others.  Such a coat of arms is inherited, most often from father to son, through many generations. </p><p>  There is also such a variation as a personal emblem.  It aims to display the specific traits of one person, his achievements and credo. </p><p>  Of course, the coats of arms of the countries of the world play an important role for the image of the state, and family - for the birth.  But such symbols are hardly important if the goals they pursue are violated.  Therefore, being the carrier, it is necessary to adhere to the principles that were established by previous generations. </p>
