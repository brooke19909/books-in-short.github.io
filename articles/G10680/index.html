  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sew the oven mitts and decorate the kitchen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each hostess spends a lot of time in the kitchen.  It is here where gatherings with friends, family meals and, of course, the preparation of a variety of dishes are held.  Therefore, the kitchen should not only be equipped with comfortable furniture and high-quality dishes, but also decorated with a variety of decor, among which textiles occupy a worthy place.  It‚Äôs enough to sew the gloves, the towel, the soft seats on the chairs and the curtains to make your kitchen sparkle with new colors. </p><p>  Textiles in the kitchen are a must.  It creates a special cosiness in the room and helps to increase comfort.  <span>You</span> can <span>decorate the kitchen</span> with your own hands or buy ready-made sets.  Using the numerous shreds that are available in each house, you can sew tacks.  They will not only decorate your kitchen, but also protect your handles from hot dishes. </p><p>  The technique of making such a necessary thing in the household is very simple.  You can sew tacks from two layers of fabric with a synthetic winterizer or batting layer.  If you are engaged in manufacturing for the first time, then use simple <span>geometric shapes</span> as a stencil <span>:</span> circle, square, oval or rhombus.  Make a cardboard template of the right size.  Iron the flaps of fabric and, laying a cardboard circle on them, cut out two parts.  We make the same detail from synthetic winterizer.  We put our blanks in the form of a sandwich. </p><p>  We fasten parts with needles to avoid movement during sewing.  We lay several lines along the entire tack area and one along the very edge.  To give the product a more aesthetic appearance, we process the edge of the tack with the help of an overlock, a zigzag stitch, lace or oblique trim.  Be sure to sew a loop, for which we will hang the finished product.  We sew oven mitts from various flaps and process them with an oblique banding of the same color.  In this case, we get a fun set. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Improving your skills, you can make patchwork tacks.  Patchwork technique is very popular in many countries.  It allows you to use all the remains of material and <span>unnecessary things</span> for the manufacture of a variety of household items.  Sewing tack from different shreds is not difficult.  We use our main template for this.  You can simply sew different pieces of fabric in random order and cut out the details of tacks from the resulting fabric.  Their further production is no different from the main version.  We layered the middle with a synthetic winterizer and process the edges. </p><p>  Beautiful products are obtained when compiling the canvas from small squares.  We take the main square-shaped template and divide it into 4 or 9 parts.  Having made small patterns, we use them to cut blanks from flaps.  From the finished squares we make a pattern and sew.  We iron each seam so that the surface of the tack is flat.  The resulting details are layered with synthetic winterizer and stitched several times.  We process the edges using a <span>slanting inlay.</span> </p><p>  A beautiful and simple version of the tack is obtained from the drape.  The material itself is quite thick and does not require an additional layer.  Therefore, it is enough to cut one or two parts and process the edges.  Beautiful potholders are obtained from drap in the form of cats.  Draw not very big cats on paper.  Cut parts from the drape.  Tie the edge with colored thread without a crochet and make a loop.  Embroider the face with thread and make eye buttons. </p><p>  An interesting version of tack is obtained by using simple forms and decorating them using applique.  Cut square blanks for the base.  For application we take, for example, an apple.  We cut out the fruit parts from multi-colored rags and, laying them on the main part, we adjust with a small zigzag.  If the fabric for the application is pulled strongly or thin, then pre-glue the details on the non-woven fabric.  Having firmly fixed the components of the appliqu√©, you can easily sew them, thanks to the gasket.  We layered the base with synthetic winterizer and process the edges with an oblique trim. </p>
