    <p>  The most important advantage that the system of mobile banking services has is that there is no need for an Internet connection to perform operations.  It is enough to send an SMS request to a short number, and the operation will be performed remotely.  Using this technology, you can use the services of the bank at any convenient time. </p><h2>  What are the advantages of a mobile bank? </h2><p>  Using mobile phones makes life easier.  Obviously, it saves a lot of time, since today almost all the bank's services are provided remotely.  Already, mobile banking can be compared to Internet banking.  The biggest motivator for the development of this service are smartphones that help make our lives easier. </p><ul><li>  Almost all banks provide this service for free and without additional fees. </li><li>  There are several services that allow you to use any phone.  This helps to make a mobile bank accessible to any client.  First of all, you can get passwords and balance information.  Some banks have created special applications for more convenient use of the service.  Also, devices with the Internet make it easy to download bank applications. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="register in the mobile banking system" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32614/1074814.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  All operations are necessarily encrypted.  This suggests that such transactions are much safer than wired communications. </li><li>  Information about the client is not displayed, due to which additional security is provided. </li></ul><h2>  What are the disadvantages of a mobile bank? </h2><ul><li>  Unfortunately, information from cellular providers is not always encrypted, which threatens data loss.  A professional hacker, if desired, can easily access the necessary information. </li><li>  Bank messages are not encrypted.  This suggests that they can easily be intercepted. </li><li>  In case of loss or theft of a cell phone, all information may be used by a third party; </li><li>  Cell phones that do not have antivirus software are very often hacked. </li></ul><p>  Due to the fact that every day the demand for smartphones is growing, and they have a high-speed Internet connection, a mobile bank is the next step in progress.  Undoubtedly, it makes it easy to access your accounts.  But security is still low. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What capabilities does the Sberbank mobile banking system have? </h2><p>  Today, the service has a simple and intuitive interface, which makes it easy to operate.  It is worth saying that Sberbank has a wide range of functions.  And over time, it gets bigger. </p>

    <p>  So, the mobile bank provides the following features: </p><ul><li>  Quick receipt of all information about transactions with bank cards by sending SMS or automatic notification. </li><li>  Replenishment of cellular communications by sending a request indicating the number and amount.  An important point is the ability to pay for any number. </li><li>  Receive alerts with the current account balance. </li><li>  The ability to block.  This feature will be very useful in case of loss or theft of the card. </li><li>  The ability to pay for various services. </li><li>  Making money transfers. </li><li>  Easy work in Internet banking. </li><li>  Quick repayment of loan payments. </li><li>  Disconnecting and connecting services. </li></ul><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that Sberbank's mobile banking services allow you to make money transfers.  To do this, just know the phone number of the owner.  In addition, the request indicates the amount, and the details of the recipient will be found automatically. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mobile Bank Features </h2><p>  Sberbank Mobile Bank has two different packages - full and economical. </p><p>  If you connect an economical package, then the client will not receive SMS notifications during operations.

But for this a monthly fee will be deducted from the account.  With the help of the service a mobile <span>bank, the client</span> has all the capabilities to be serviced remotely with comfort.  So, let's talk about each tariff in more detail. </p><h2>  Low cost mobile banking </h2><p>  As we already understood, the mobile bank service is used via telephone and has two tariffs.  What is an economical package?  No matter what tariff you choose when connecting the service, there will still be a lot of opportunities.  So, you can make payments, transfers and other useful operations without visiting a bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Undoubtedly, the system of mobile banking services at an economical rate will not work fully, but with some restrictions.  But with not too active use of online services, this will be enough.  Moreover, there is no monthly fee for it. </p><h2>  Economy Package Terms of Use </h2><ul><li>  Register in the mobile banking system with a new card, and the connection will be free for any type of card. </li><li>  If re-registration has occurred in the system, then when fixing the main card - the source of debit, the service fee will also not be charged. </li><li>  SMS notifications about receipt, debiting and other operations on this package are not provided. </li><li>  When requesting a balance on the card, making other financial transactions, the request will cost 3 rubles. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank mobile banking system" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32614/1074824.jpg" width="510"></div></li><li>  A card statement request for the last 5 operations costs 15 rubles. </li><li>  It is possible to block the card in case of loss or theft.  This service is free. </li><li>  Suspension of the service or change of package (free). </li><li>  Making payments, for example, utility or credit (free). </li><li>  When requesting information about which cards are connected to the service, no fee will be charged. </li></ul><p>  Be sure to consider the fact that the board may change at any time. </p><h2>  Full Mobile Bank Tariff </h2><p>  This tariff is perfect for those who actively use mobile Internet banking to constantly monitor costs and manage account balances.  When you connect this package, you can perform a huge number of actions at any convenient time - block cards, pay off debts, find out current information on the balance sheet and much more. </p><p>  When working with this tariff, you can perform any operation absolutely free of charge and without any restrictions.  But at the same time, a monthly fee will be debited from the client.  The size will depend on what type of card.  A mobile bank has a cost of 30 or 60 rubles. </p><h2>  Full rate terms of use </h2><ul><li>  Registration in the mobile services system using a new number and card, from which a fee will be charged (free). </li><li>  Re-registration in the service, that is, a change in the number of connected cards, including the main one (free). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card mobile bank" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32614/1074825.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Automatic notification of income, expenses and other operations on all available cards within the first two months after activation of the service (free of charge). </li><li>  Notification after two months - 30 or 60 rubles per month. </li><li>  Requesting information about the balance of a debit or credit card account is free of charge. </li><li>  Requesting the last five operations on a card of any type and level is free of charge. </li><li>  Card lock in case of theft or loss - for free. </li><li>  Payments to third parties. </li><li>  Request for information on cards connected to the service. </li><li>  Disabling or blocking a service. </li></ul><h2>  How to connect a mobile bank? </h2><p>  The mobile banking system is connected in several ways.  You can do this at a bank branch, at an ATM, or through a contact center. </p><h2>  Connection in the department </h2><p>  This method is used by almost all customers of the bank.  As a rule, this is carried out at the stage of issuing a plastic card.  The contract simply indicates the tariff and phone number to which the service will be provided. </p><p>  The service is also connected as part of a universal agreement, which includes services, products and capabilities of the bank. </p><h2>  ATM Connection </h2><p>  The system of mobile banking services can be connected in ordinary ATMs, which are found at almost every step.  First you need to insert a card and to access the menu, enter the pin code.  Next, on the screen, you need to click the "Mobile Bank" button and click "Connect." </p>
