    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  In the form 4-NDFL, the entrepreneur must indicate the expected income minus the costs.  Based on these data, the quarterly advance deduction will be calculated at the IFTS. </p><p>  If the income received during the reporting period differs significantly from the previously declared, an individual must re-submit the 4-NDFL declaration.  Information from it will be used to adjust advance payments. </p><p>  It must be remembered that, in addition to the 4-NDFL certificate, subjects also pass 3-NDFL. </p><h2>  Dates in 2017 </h2><p>  <span>Certificate 4-NDFL is</span> sent to the IFTS within five days after a month from the date of receipt of the first profit in the reporting period. </p><p>  For example, an entrepreneur began to use the general regime from January 1, 2017. He received his first income on January 18.  The 4-personal income tax certificate in this case shall be submitted no later than February 25: February 18 - the month from the moment of receipt of funds + 5 days (workers). </p><p>  The deadline for submitting a 4-personal income tax certificate in the event of a significant difference in the amount of income received from the declared earlier is not established in the legislation.  Accordingly, the fiscal authority is not entitled to fine the subject for failure to submit an <span>updated declaration</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 personal income tax return" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2186585.jpg"></div>

A deviation in excess of 50% is considered significant. </p><h2>  Sanctions </h2><p>  In case of failure to submit the initial declaration after receiving income, the measures applied in article 126 of the Tax Code are applied to the subject.  In particular, he was charged with a fine of 200 p. </p><p>  The application of the provisions of 119 of the Tax Code for the failure to submit 4-personal income tax is not allowed.  This is due to the fact that in this declaration the amount of actual income is not indicated.  The law prohibits the collection of foreclosures from estimated profits.  If, nevertheless, the fine was imputed, it is necessary to appeal the decision in pretrial order.  First, the application is sent to the Federal Tax Service, and then to <span>the Tax Administration.</span> </p><p>  It is also worth saying that the control body cannot impute a fine for non-payment of advances and charge penalties for their delay.  Blocking operations on accounts will also be inappropriate. </p><p>  Therefore, if the entrepreneur does not provide a report on f.  4-personal income tax, then the only punishment for him will be a penalty of 200 p. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="form 4 personal income tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2186554.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ways to provide </h2><p>  The entrepreneur must submit a declaration at the place of residence.  You can submit a report: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  On paper in person or through your representative.  In this case, 2 copies of the form are filled out (one of them remains with the individual with a mark of acceptance). </li><li>  Registered mail with inventory and notification.  The date indicated on the receipt issued at departure will be considered the day the report was submitted. </li><li>  In electronic form via telecommunication channels (through the EDI operator or from the Federal Tax Service website). </li></ul><h2>  Additional requirements </h2><p>  If a representative submits a certificate, he must have a power of attorney certified by a notary. </p><p>  When submitting a paper report, some tax authorities require: </p><ul><li>  Attach a document in electronic form.  In this case, you need to provide a disk or flash drive. </li><li>  Print on the declaration a special barcode in which information from the report is duplicated. </li></ul><p>  These requirements are not fixed in the Tax Code, but if they are not complied with by the tax authority, they may refuse to accept the declaration.  If this happens, then the action of the IFTS employee can be appealed.  At the same time, one should be guided by the provisions of the letter of the Ministry of Finance of 2014 No. PA-4-6 / 7440.  It says that the absence of a special (two-dimensional) barcode or an error in OKTMO is not a reason for not accepting the declaration from the applicant, if it is drawn up in the prescribed form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="form 4 personal income tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2186555.jpg"></div>
