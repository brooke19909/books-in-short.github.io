  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foil Crafts - A Great Decoration for Your Home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beautiful metallic luster of the foil and its special plasticity and suppleness became the cause of increased attention from lovers of folk art.  Moreover, moisture, temperature changes, dust and the bright sun are not terrible for a foil.  This ideal material for various crafts is used in many techniques and is the basis of a huge number of extraordinary and creative works. </p><p>  What foil crafts are popular today? </p><p>  At that time, when stainless cutlery was not really rusty yet, and in factory and school canteens, aluminum spoons and forks were abundant on trays, a foil roll could be taken out for free without much effort.  An exception to this rule was baking foil.  To date, the situation has changed dramatically, but at the same time there are alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks in iron cans.  They became the inexhaustible <span>source of inspiration</span> for the "foil" masters. </p><p>  The first place in the ranking of crafts takes chasing.  The art of extruding images on <span>thin metal sheets</span> originated a very long time ago.  But quite recently, the Chinese came up with a new coinage technique in beer cans.  This lesson does not require a huge amount of time, investment and tools, but at the same time the result will exceed all imaginable expectations, because such crafts from foil can not be found in any store. </p><p>  For those who want to try their hand at such an extraordinary art, you will need only a few things: an empty iron can for drinks, scissors, a non-writing pen, an awl or a toothpick and beads.  To get started, take a jar and carefully cut off both bottoms.  We cut the resulting pipe with scissors and get a rectangular sheet of foil.  The plot can be used absolutely any, depending on your tastes and preferences.  For example, you can turn to collections of fairy tales and try to reproduce a firebird or maned horse.  The selected image is superimposed on the foil and carefully pressed through with a toothpick or non-writing pen.  Where necessary, bulges can be increased with beads of different sizes, and finer details are pressed through a slightly dull awl.  Convex places are processed from the inside out, and concave ones are processed from the front side.  Finished foil crafts will look especially impressive if you carefully cut out all the details and stick them on a dark velor or velvet background. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Foil candlesticks will look very nice.  For such products, the material is ideally suited due to its fire resistance.  The easiest option for making will be a candlestick in the shape of a cozy house.  We take a rectangular piece of foil and divide in width into four identical parts - these will be the walls of the future home.  Making the roof: cut two triangles for the ends and one rectangle for the slopes.  You can give the sheet of foil for the roof the shape of a fish scale.  For maximum lighting effect, it is necessary to make many balconies, windows and glazed doors.  A lighted round candle is placed inside the finished house. </p><p>  Fine foil crafts are obtained using the quilling technique.  The term "quilling" means "feather of a bird."  Simply put, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãcreativity can be called paper-rolling.  Its essence lies in cutting strips of various widths and twisting them around a special thin awl.  The resulting curls are laid out in various patterns.  Instead of paper, you can easily use foil and make, for example, an intricate star or a beautiful flower.  The choice of image is limited solely by your imagination. </p><p>  Another way to make DIY foil crafts is through <span>decoupage technique.</span>  Painting on a sheet of foil is a very specific direction in art.  Often, the storyline is landscapes with an abyss of sky and a very thin strip of the coast.  If you decide to embody your <span>creativity</span> on foil, you should add a little dishwashing liquid to the paint to prevent it from rolling off the glossy surface. </p><p>  If a landscape painter has not woken up in you, then you can stick the top layer of a beautiful napkin on a sheet of foil and cover everything with acrylic varnish.  A translucent metallic luster will make the foil products pearlescent. </p>
