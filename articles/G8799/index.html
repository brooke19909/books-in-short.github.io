    <p>  Modest, but quite interesting, both historically and culturally, the town of Uman is located in the very center of Ukraine, in the Cherkasy region.  Not everyone, even the locals, knows that this corner is visited annually by hundreds of thousands of tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why?  What is the reason for this popularity?  The thing is that this locality, thanks to its fame, is in many respects grateful to the amazing masterpiece of landscape gardening culture - a national dendrological object called "Sofievsky Park". </p><p>  I would like to note that today this place is among the most beautiful territories of the world created by man.  It surprises and fascinates with its fabulous grottoes, amazing landscapes, mirror ponds and magnificent sculptures. </p><p>  Sophia Park (Ukraine) is a temple of nature, a beautiful monument of landscape art, one of the most romantic corners of the state, built in the name of love and serving as its symbol for more than 200 years. </p><h2>  How was this place created? </h2>

    <p>  I would like to note right away that Sofievsky Park in the form in which we can observe it today is the result of several generations at once. </p><p>  Initially, this masterpiece was laid in 1796.  Its founder was the landowner Stanislav Pototsky, who owned about one and a half million hectares of land.  The serfs, and according to documents that have reached us, the tycoon had about 150 thousand, were actively engaged in construction, successively replacing each other and freeing themselves from other types of work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a park come about?  The thing is that the landowner, already married, fell madly in love with the married Greek woman Sofia, whom he met on one of his many trips.  Despite the harsh laws of the time, lovers withstood all the lengthy divorce proceedings and received approval for the marriage of the Empress Katerina herself. </p><p>  After all the trials that fell out, the couple settled in one of their estates near Uman and began to look for a place to create a corner where they could completely escape from problems and worries.  The newlyweds chose a place where the two rivers merged - Kamyanka and Umanka, considering it the most successful for the realization of all that was planned. </p><p>  The first architect of the park, Metzel, developed the main idea and master plan.  Stanislav and Sofia wanted to recreate in this place an illustration for the ancient Greek poems Odyssey and Illiad. </p><p>  Of course, for all the work required a lot of hands.  Even according to the most rough estimates, Sofievsky Park was built by 800 workers who needed more than 10 years to do this. </p><p>  The park was first opened in 1800, but at that time its construction was not yet fully completed.  Work continued on the refinement of the ponds and the laying of alleys.  Unfortunately, Count S. Pototsky did not wait for completion, as he died in 1805, having spent more than 2.5 million tsar rubles on his brainchild. </p><p>  In 1830, the park became state-owned and received the name of the Tsaritsyno Garden.  Emperors of Russia took an active part in its further arrangement and visited it at the first opportunity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the 80s of the twentieth century, numerous <span>restoration work</span> began in the park <span>.</span>  Waterfalls, fountains, ponds, bridges, altanka and statues were restored. </p><h2>  How to get to Sofiyivka </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned above, Sofievsky Park, the history of which cannot fail to captivate even the most experienced traveler, is located in the Cherkasy region, in the city of Uman.  You can get to Sofiyivka in different ways and on any <span>type of transport.</span>  A lot of transit bus routes pass through this district center, so you can get here from almost all corners of the country without problems. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that the main entrance to the Sophia Park is located just opposite the main bus station of the city, so tourists definitely will not have to wander around the narrow streets of an unfamiliar city. </p><p>  You can also go to Uman by rail.  Three shuttle buses go from the station to the park gates with intervals of several minutes.  In this case, the journey will take no longer than 10 minutes. </p><p>  But if you want to get in comfort, you should use the services of a local taxi. </p><h2>  Sofievsky park.  Visit Prices </h2>

    <p>  Sofiyivka is rightly called the most romantic corner of Ukraine.  Why?  The thing is that the park actually embodies the song of Count S. Pototsky‚Äôs love for beautiful Sofia. </p><p>  There are white marble statues everywhere, wrapped in branches of exotic trees.  Shady paths are ready to give coolness even in the grueling summer heat.  Swans and ducks glide along the smooth surface of the mirror ponds, and the crystal clink of waterfalls merges with the singing of amazing birds. </p><p>  The atmosphere is really romantic.  No wonder Count S. Potocki often walked here with his Sofia.  Their favorite routes were paths along the Upper Pond, the Ionian Sea, Lake Acheront, the Cretan Maze and the Valley of the Giants. </p><h2>  The famous Kamyanka River and its attractions </h2>

    <p>  To date, a special site has been built on the Kamyanka River, which has the name Belvedere, which is difficult for a modern person, which in translation into Russian sounds like an ‚Äúamazing view‚Äù. </p><p>  At the bottom of the observation deck, you can see a slightly sloppy lying huge stone block called the "Death Stone".  Where did such a terrible definition come from?  There is a logical explanation for this.  When they wanted to raise the stone located above the Belvedere in order to move it to a more suitable place, according to the architect, it suddenly collapsed, crippling and even burying many serfs under it. </p><p>  Since then, a lump has been lying here, recalling the terrible events of past years. </p><h2>  Sofiyivka - a place where they declare their love </h2>

    <p>  Numerous travelers studying the culture of Ukraine, as a rule, ask the same thing: ‚ÄúWe are going to visit Sophia Park (Uman).  When is the best time to go to this place? ‚Äù  It is quite difficult to unambiguously answer this question.  Why?  The thing is that everyone finds something different here.  Someone like the abundance of birds, someone wanders along the paths with pleasure, and there are those who take courage and go on a trip along the <span>underground river</span> or climb stones, passing over or under waterfalls. </p><p>  One thing I would like to say for sure.  Those newlyweds who decide to go to Sofiyivka on the day of their wedding or during their honeymoon do not fail. </p><p>  Like the city of <span>Uman, Sofievsky Park</span> in spring, summer, autumn and winter is filled with views and landscapes of a fabulous, sometimes surreal beauty.  Even the air itself seems to be saturated with extraterrestrial feelings of passion and love - wonderful statues in the Greek style, picturesque rocks, cozy arbors, noisy waterfalls, boulders and hills covered with grass and flowers, shady alleys and cool grottoes ... </p><h2>  Legends and tales of Sofievsky park </h2>

    <p>  Believe in signs?  Then you definitely need to go to Sofievka as soon as possible.  There is simply a huge number of secluded places specially designed for the fulfillment of desires.  Touch the stone, lean against the rock, close your eyes while passing under the grotto, and your innermost will come true. </p><p>  For example, according to one of the legends, if you go dry out of the water under the Great Waterfall, your plan will be fulfilled.  By the way, we confirm from a personal example that it is not difficult to do this, since the passage under the waterfall allows you not to get wet. </p><p>  The second story relates to the Calypso Grotto.  She tells that if an unhappy person enters the grotto, he will become happy, and if happy, he will certainly become even happier.  In order for all dreams to come true, it is necessary to walk around the stone column in the middle of the grotto with closed eyes three times.  Also in the corner of the grotto flows a small fountain into which tourists throw a trifle for good luck. </p><p>  Another legend tells of the miraculous healing by the waters of the Diana Mirror Grotto at the foot of Venus Falls.  Every year sick people come here.  They say that the source actually helps many. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna of the old park </h2>

    <p>  Starting a walk in Sofievsky Park from the main entrance along a wide alley, the first thing you should pay attention to is Flora Pavilion, made in the Doric style.  By the way, this is also a favorite area of ‚Äã‚Äãlocal swans, who simply adore eating grapes abundantly growing here. </p><p>  In front of the pavilion, on the left side, three fountains hit at once.  According to legend, if you drink water from the middle, you will become beautiful, and from the extreme - healthy and rich, respectively.  Are you afraid to mix it up?  Try water from all at once, for sure! </p><p>  Further along the way, tourists will surely meet an 18 meter high fountain with its originality. It is called the ‚ÄúSerpent‚Äù, and the corresponding form will not allow it to be confused with any other. </p><p>  Bypassing a huge number of natural monuments, it is worth getting to the Upper Pond on the island of Anti-Circe.  This is the very heart of the park, where ladies in hats and puffy dresses and gentlemen in luxurious suits are walking.  Surprised?  All these outfits of different eras and styles can be rented right there on the spot!  Try to imagine yourself as a kind of time traveler.  The board, by the way, is very symbolic. </p><p>  In general, Sofiyivka has everything that your heart desires: amazing landscapes, stone grottoes, antique statues, rocks, clear lakes, murmuring waterfalls, mysterious ponds, various cascades and many other interesting places, without visiting which you should not leave the park. </p><h2>  Hungry?  Where can I eat? </h2>
