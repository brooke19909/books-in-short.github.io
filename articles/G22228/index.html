It so happened historically that if the smartphone is Chinese-made, then this is far from the best choice.  But now this situation has changed dramatically.  One of the most striking examples is this device, which appeared copies with worse filling and lower quality. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Options Xiaomi Red Rice 1S causes some complaints.  This is primarily the documentation.  <span>Warranty card,</span> as usual, is.  But the user manual from the cardboard envelope is quite modest.  For experienced users, this is not a problem, but for beginners it can be an unpleasant surprise.  Also missing is one of the accessories - headphones.  They will have to be bought separately for an additional fee.  It is also worth noting the box of the device, which is made of recycled paper.  Due to this, less damage is caused to the environment.  The rest of the delivery is quite ordinary: </p><ul><li>  Smartphone. </li><li>  2000 mAh battery. </li><li>  MicroUSB - cord. </li><li>  Charger. </li></ul><h2>  Smartphone hardware </h2><p>  A 4-core production platform is at the heart of this gadget.  We are talking about the MCM8228 chip from the company, the developer of Qualkom, which belongs to the Shapdragon 400 family.  Its peak frequency can reach 1.6 GHz.  A similar decision by Chinese development engineers provides an excellent level of performance for Xiaomi Red Rice 1S.  A review of the complete documentation indicates the presence of a graphics adapter - Adreno 305.  Based on all the above, we can confidently say that its hardware platform is enough to solve any problem.  All programs, including the most demanding games, will go without problems on this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Graphics and cameras </h2><p>  4.7 inches is the screen size of this smart phone.  Its resolution belongs to the class ‚ÄúHR Di‚Äù, that is 1280 x 720. It is also capable of processing up to 10 touches of the touch surface immediately.  It is difficult to say in which cases such functionality may be needed, but it is nevertheless implemented in this device.  The matrix that underlies the display is made using one of the best technologies today - IPS.  Now about the cameras that are installed on the Xiaomi Red Rice 1S.  An overview of the technical parameters of each of them is impressive.  The sensor element of the main camera is based on an 8 megapixel matrix.  There is an automatic image stabilization system, autofocus and LED flash.  All this ensures the impeccable quality of photographs.  The second camera, brought to the front of the device.  She has a more modest 1.6 megapixel matrix.  But for making video calls, its capabilities are quite enough.  The quality of the transmitted image is not satisfactory. </p>

    <h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  The ideal memory subsystem for Xiaomi Red Rice 1S.  Smartphone <strong> </strong>  equipped with 1 GB of RAM standard DDR3.  This is quite enough to run any programs.  The built-in drive has a capacity of 8 GB, of which about 2 GB is occupied by pre-installed software.  Everything else can be used by the user for his needs.  If this is not enough for you, then you can increase this amount to 64 GB.  You only need to install an external flash card.  The MicroSD format is supported, and the corresponding slot is located next to the SIM card installation locations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  Despite the rather impressive dimensions (137 x 69 mm), the device in the hands does not look like a "shovel".  All buttons are correctly grouped.  Some of them are displayed on the right edge of the gadget (switching on and the sound control swing), and part - harmoniously fit under the screen (three classic touch buttons).  The front panel is made of tempered glass "GorillaGlaz" 2nd generation.  This material is resistant to scratches and problems with maintaining its appearance should not be.  The sides are made of matte plastic.  To ensure that your smartphone does not quickly lose its original appearance, you need to buy an additional accessory such as a case.  Xiaomi Red Rice 1S is a smartphone model so popular at the moment that there should not be a problem with this. </p>

    <h2>  But what about autonomy? </h2><p>  The weak point is the battery of Xiaomi Red Rice 1S.  A review of its technical characteristics shows a battery rating of 2000 mA / h.  Let's be objective: for such a diagonal and similar hardware resources, such a capacity will not be enough.  If you use the smartphone only for calls, then one charge is enough for 2 days.  In reality, with more intensive use of the device, it is only 8-10 hours.  The problem can be solved either with an external reinforced battery, or with a second internal similar battery.  In any case, you need to buy an additional accessory to increase the autonomy of the device.  Otherwise, it may discharge at the most inopportune moment for this.  Moreover, the most practical solution is an external battery, which can be connected to the MicroUSB connector at any time. </p><h2>  OS and other software stuffing </h2><p>  The situation with the system software of Xiaomi Red Rice 1S is quite complicated.  The firmware installed in the initial state includes only English and Chinese.  Accordingly, for the Russification of the gadget will have to install additional software.  At least this is true for smartphones purchased in China.  In domestic stores, devices with Russian language support are sold.  But the indisputable advantage of this device is the proprietary shell MIUI from ‚ÄúXiomi‚Äù.  In addition to the usual set of utilities from Google and social services, it includes many programs: antivirus, a set of browsers and a text editor.  In general, right out of the box, this smartphone is ready to go. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The impressive communications set of Xiaomi Red Rice 1S.  It has everything you need and there is nothing superfluous.  To exchange data with the global web, it is best to use Wi-Fi.  It is suitable for all occasions: from modest startups and social networking to movies and online videos.  If necessary, it can be replaced by a 3rd generation mobile network.  Of course, the speed will be slightly lower, and the tariffs of mobile operators are not entirely modest, but it also allows you to work with any amount of information.  If the smartphone works in an FSM network, then the speed will be significantly lower (up to 0.5 Mbps), and this will only allow you to communicate on social networks or view small sites on the Internet.  There is also ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, the main task of which is to transfer small files to smartphones or mobile phones.  An excellent situation with this unit with a navigation system.  There are all standards: A-ZhPS, ZhPS and GLONASS.  Moreover, they work clearly and their functioning does not cause any complaints.  This device provides support for only 2 wired interfaces: MicroUSB and 3.5 mm for the speaker system. </p><h2>  Owner reviews and expert opinion </h2><p>  Xiaomi Red Rice 1S turned out to be almost perfect and balanced.  Feedback from real owners and experts in this field indicate the following: </p><ul><li>  Stable and smooth operation of the smartphone interface. </li><li>  The build quality and materials used are impeccable. </li><li>  High quality pictures and videos from the main camera. </li><li>  Large diagonal display with a very high-quality IPS matrix. </li></ul><p>  Like any smartphone of this class, Xiaomi Red Rice 1S is not without flaws.  Reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li>  The small battery capacity and, because of this, a low degree of autonomy (previously recommendations have been already given regarding the solution of this issue). </li><li>  Certain problems with the Russification of precisely Chinese devices (this is also a resolved issue - additional firmware of third-party developers based on proprietary software is installed). </li><li>  The lack of headphones in the boxed version (they will have to be purchased separately). </li></ul><p>  As you can see, all the problems associated with this smart smartphone are easily and simply solved. </p>
