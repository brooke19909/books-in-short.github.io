It exists since 1885 and is widely known in art circles.  Often people from afar come to the city mainly to visit the Radishchev Museum.  Saratov, among other things, is also known in the world for this attraction. </p><h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  The actual history of the museum began eight years earlier than the date of its official opening.  The basis of his collection was a private collection of the Russian artist A.P. Bogolyubov, who lived in Paris, who was the grandson of A.N. Radishchev.  The collection was a collection of works of art and a library of rare books and manuscript documents.  All this was donated to the city of Saratov, subject to the provision of decent premises for a permanent museum exhibition.  The name of the future museum should be immortalized the name of an outstanding Russian thinker, writer Radishchev.  A prerequisite was also to ensure the accessibility of the collection for anyone who wishes to get acquainted with it.  This circumstance turned out to be one of the most serious problems that the future Radishchev Museum had faced even before its opening.  Saratov simply did not have a building that would fully comply with the stated requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radischevsky Museum of Saratov" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/401846.jpg" width="492"></div>

Bogolyubov.  <span>This</span> architectural work could not be <span>ordinary</span> in its status as a museum of art and historical values.  The project was entrusted to the famous St. Petersburg architect I.V. Shtrom.  And the place chosen was quite appropriate - in the historical center of the city.  The construction was supervised by the local architect A. M. Salko.  The two-story stone building, made in the style of Russian classicism, was completed two years later.  A suitable room appeared on <span>Theater Square</span> where the Radishchevsky Museum could be housed.  Saratov was looking forward to this event.  At the opening of the museum, in addition to many officials, the famous founder of the Tretyakov Gallery was also present. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paintings of the radio museum" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/401848.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Collection replenishment </h2><p>  The project was administratively supported by historical figures such as Konstantin Pobedonostsev and the new Emperor of Russia <span>Alexander the Third,</span> who takes over the board <span>.</span>  The monarch even presented several paintings from his collection to the new museum.  So began the Radishchev Museum.  Saratov was the first Russian provincial city to open a collection of art of such a level to the general public.  This event did not go unnoticed in Russia.  In the first year of operation alone, the museum was visited by over sixty thousand people.  The basic part of the collection was soon supplemented with new arrivals from the Hermitage and the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radshchev Museum in Saratov" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/402226.jpg" width="397"></div>

But the largest influx of new works of art occurred shortly after the end of the Civil War, when exhibits from the State Museum Fund were transferred to the funds of the Saratov Museum, along with other provincial cultural centers.  Today, the paintings of the Radishchev Museum cover the entire period of the formation and development of Russian painting - from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the present day.  A collection of European art is also very representative.  And of course, in the halls and funds of the Saratov Museum, the cultural heritage of the Soviet era is widely represented - works that correspond to the traditions of <span>socialist realism.</span>  Formed by the beginning of the 21st century, the collection allows us to classify the Radishchevsky Museum among the cultural centers of world significance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="site of the radio museum of saratov" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/402225.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <h2>  Radischevsky <span>Museum (Saratov).</span>  Exhibitions and Promotions </h2><p>  The modern staging of museum work involves a number of events that go beyond the mere exhibiting of works of art in the collections.  First of all, these are the so-called "exchange exhibitions" with other famous museums.  The artistic assets of museum collections are in a state of turnover, and this allows the interested public to get acquainted with works that have a permanent residence in other cities.  The Radischevsky Museum in Saratov is actively involved in this rotational process.  In addition, such non-standard events as the ‚ÄúExhibition of a single painting‚Äù or the exposition of folk art of the Saratov Volga region are regularly held here.  Work is underway in various sociocultural and educational areas.  In particular, the exhibition of a traditional children's toy with master classes in its manufacture has recently completed.  And of course, the Radischevsky Museum cannot but take part in such an action that has gained wide popularity as ‚ÄúThe Night of Museums‚Äù. </p><h2>  Branches of the Radishchev Museum </h2><p>  In the Soviet period, the museum appeared a number of peripheral structures.  These are primarily art galleries in the cities of Engels and Balakovo.  In addition, home-museums of artists were created, whose work was associated with Saratov and its environs.  These are the Pavel Kuznetsov House-Museum, the Borisov-Musatov Museum-Estate and the Petrov-Vodkin Museum in the city of Khvalynsk.  These centers of culture are provided with constant methodological assistance from the regional center. </p>
