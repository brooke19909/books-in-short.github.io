Someone is looking for a high-quality budget device with a set of all modern functions.  Fortunately, there are many in the market.  You can read about them for hours on reviews and reviews.  <span>Lenovo K6</span> Power is one of those models that were able to attract attention with its expensive-looking case and stable performance. </p><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  Lenovo has all smartphones with an index "K" turned out to be excellent.  The line was presented as the best in terms of price and quality.  This time, the manufacturer‚Äôs words were not empty.  It really happened. </p><p>  If you do not look at the models that were presented last year and even earlier, then we can confidently say that the K6 / K6 Power is an excellent choice for those who are looking for a simple but fashionable option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo k6 power reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018086.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In Russia, the model without the Power index was not supplied.  It differs from its older version only in reduced battery capacity, so the losses are small, and given the cost, <span>Lenovo K6</span> Power looks much more successful. </p><p>  He collected good reviews on all fronts.  Customers liked its appearance, performance, camera, the presence of a fingerprint scanner and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The company released this option, positioning it as the main competitor to all Chinese models.  For 150 dollars, the device looks great.  Especially fans of the manufacturer will like it. </p><p>  Of course, it is difficult to consider it any special due to the appearance or ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  But he is still a competitive unit in the budget segment. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  If you recall the phones from China, little can be said about their configuration.  Usually manufacturers do not stand out for their special generosity and unusual presentation. </p><p>  Lenovo always tries to surprise at least with the packaging.  You can recall the K900 model, which was delivered in a black box with a soft touch.  On top of it, an additional ‚Äúcover‚Äù was used.  It was carved the name of the model, and its reverse side is covered with red gloss. </p><p>  Browsed phone turned out less pretentious.  The box was painted in bright colors with a gradient turning from purple to orange.  Packaging cardboard lacquered, dense.  Provides reliable transportation of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lenovo k6 power reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Under the lid on the tablet is a telephone.  Under it there is a compartment in which, as usual, there is documentation, a charging unit and a USB cable for Lenovo K6 Power 16Gb.  Components reviews collected a lot.  Rarely now see gifts from the manufacturer.  For this model, a headset was put in a box.  It is inexpensive, without vacuum headphones.  But it is unlikely that someone will get in the way of a branded headset with a microphone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The device does not have a special design.  The newfangled design of models is still traced.  Soon, all manufacturers will begin to use a single template.  And until this happens, we can enjoy the minimal changes. </p><p>  The back panel resembles the options from Xiaomi.  Most likely due to the fact that a fingerprint scanner has settled here.  The body is still rounded.  It is made of metal, and the top and bottom are familiar plastic inserts. </p><p>  The model is available in three colors.  All of them are pastel and have already become universal.  The dark gray case is complemented by a black front panel.  The light gray model entered the market with a white front.  And the panel of the so-called golden phone, which looks more like pink, has a front part of the same hue. </p><p>  The dimensions of the model are universal.  In this regard, failed to meet bad reviews.  The Lenovo K6 Power 16GB smartphone is 14 cm long, 7 cm wide, and 9 mm thick.  It looks ‚Äúplump‚Äù, which may affect the ease of use. </p><p>  This thickness was due to the increased battery capacity.  She influenced the weight - 145 grams. </p><p>  But according to reviews, you can understand that holding the device in your hand is convenient.  It has a comfortable size, round shape.  All elements took their places. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  So, in front of the entire area is a five-inch screen.  Above it was placed a front camera, a speaker.  The notification indicator is standard, with moderate brightness, which is noticeable during the day, but does not interfere at night. </p><p>  There are control keys under the screen.  Despite the fact that most manufacturers transfer them to the screen, Lenovo decided to apparently make them their chip.  Sensors are highlighted and cannot be interchanged.  In general, they work efficiently, with a good response. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The display has a protective 2.5D glass with an oleophobic coating.  It is pleasant to the touch, rounded on all sides.  Fingerprints on it are practically invisible. </p><p>  The back panel is made of aluminum.  Above and below large plastic strips are visible, which are separated from the metal middle by a thin silver edging.  The design, although familiar, is interesting in the details. </p><p>  On the cover in the middle is the ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the camera.  Above it is a barely noticeable additional noise reduction microphone.  A flash was placed under the lens, and a fingerprint sensor below. </p><p>  Those who previously used smartphones in which these sensors are located on the front of the mechanical button were unhappy.  <span>Reviews Lenovo K6</span> Power Gray in this regard received negative.  Although, objectively speaking, using a sensor is a matter of habit.  Its placement on the lid is very successful.  If you take the phone in your hand, then the finger fits perfectly into the round "hole".  The sensor works quickly and without errors. </p><p>  The speakers also moved back.  At the bottom of the panel you can see two perforations.  Not very good speaker layout.  You will understand this if you lay the phone face down on a soft surface.  The sound will be barely noticeable. </p>

    <p>  The placement of the connectors may seem unusual to someone.  It is somewhat different from what we are used to seeing in Chinese devices.  The bottom edge is completely free.  A hole from the microphone is barely noticeable on it.  The top edge is occupied by the headphone jack and charger. </p><p>  On the left, as usual, a combined tray for SIM cards or memory cards.  On the right are the power and volume buttons. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The fight between fans of the IPS matrix and AMOLED can last forever.  Someone can tolerate too bright and saturated colors.  To some, they seem unnatural.  Therefore, it is impossible to say that a particular matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãworse. </p><p>  But the Lenovo K6 Power smartphone received good reviews in this regard.  The five-inch display looks good with FullHD resolution.  IPS-matrix conveys natural colors, without wild light green and other ‚Äútear eyes‚Äù shades. </p><p>  You can adjust the display setting by changing the contrast or brightness.  But by default, the screen is configured correctly.  Viewing angles are ordinary.  When tilted, the colors fade slightly and darken.  Otherwise, no problems are almost imperceptible. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Since this model is positioned as a budget, nothing supernatural should be expected from Lenovo K6 Power.  The technical component received good reviews.  Now at a minimum, but the owners are trying to understand the parameters. </p><p>  The model works with Qualcomm Snapdragon 430. Eight cores perform their work at a frequency of 1400 MHz, and the Adreno 505 became the graphic chipset. For those who do not understand, we note that this is quite a budget ‚Äústuffing‚Äù for everyday tasks. </p>

    <p>  This choice is understood by the positioning of the model.  The manufacturer immediately said that it was an option for ordinary everyday use.  Therefore, it is unlikely to be able to play resource-intensive games.  Although at minimal settings you can try popular projects.  The system copes with the interface.  There are no noticeable jerking or braking. </p><p>  There is a modification with 2 and 3 GB of RAM.  But regarding the internal memory, the Lenovo K6 Power Gray smartphone received negative reviews.  16 GB is not enough for everyone.  Some even switch from 32 GB to a larger 64 GB. </p><p>  On the other hand, if you do not care about having two SIM cards, one can be replaced with a memory card up to 256 GB.  This, of course, is enough even for the most demanding. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  It is believed that the device is for people who are not very used to understanding how much RAM is inside and what is the processor frequency.  Therefore, the manufacturer is not ashamed to save on everything.  Since he presented the device externally ‚Äúlike everyone else‚Äù, he can save on the rest. </p><p>  The device operates in the same range of a wireless network.  Maximum speed is limited.  There is no aggregation of frequencies.  If you can‚Äôt live without 4G, it‚Äôs hard for you without the Internet, downloads, and more, then the option is definitely not for you. </p><p>  The device also implements only one radio module.  "Sims" work alternately.  But this practically does not affect the autonomy of work in any way, since the battery inside is quite voluminous. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera in the Lenovo K6 Power Gold turned out to be a good solution.  Users left good reviews, especially regarding the front module.  It works with a resolution of 8 megapixels, has a portrait mode with face editing. </p>

    <p>  Recent Lenovo models have changed the camera interface, so they can be a little unusual for fans of the manufacturer.  There is a Smart mode that works with automatic image correction.  He can tweak the composition and colors. </p><p>  The main camera works with a resolution of 13 megapixels.  It produces medium quality pictures.  This is not enough to create photo masterpieces, but enough for social networks.  Better to shoot in the afternoon.  At night, the photos are very bad. </p><h2>  Shell </h2><p>  There are no complaints about Android 6.0.1.  Reviews Lenovo K6 Power 16 GB received good.  It has its own signature Vibe UI shell.  It does not greatly transform the system: there is nothing superfluous, but they left all that is useful. </p><p>  The interface is simple, intuitive.  When the model is updated to the seventh version of Android, no significant changes will occur. </p><p>  Here, as in most modern devices, they lost the usual menu.  It is all transferred to the desktop.  You can create folders, add new sites.  Sorting is simple, and the number of widgets is huge. </p><p>  The top curtain is from Android.  It has all the important switches: the inclusion of a wireless network, mobile Internet, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC and other options. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  This version has a 4000 mAh battery for Lenovo K6 Power.  She received good reviews, although the manufacturer's statements did not materialize.  The company claims that in standby mode, the smartphone will last 11 days.  If you talk, then two days. </p>

    <p>  In fact, these figures are slightly less.  With moderate load, it can withstand two days.  Up to 6 hours can last an active screen.  The conversation will drag on for 2 hours. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  That turned out to be such a good budget smartphone Lenovo K6 Power 16Gb.  He received good reviews on average.  Anyone who understood that in front of him was the middle segment, and did not expect anything supernatural, in return received a solid device. </p><p>  The users liked the screen, quick system update, good camera, beautiful appearance.  The stereo speakers turned out to be quite good paired with conversational.  The battery also paid off. </p><p>  But the negative emotions were caused by the sound in the headphones, the lack of fast charging, the combined slot and the incomprehensible operation of the additional microphone. </p><p>  If you close your eyes to some improvements, you can safely agree that the manufacturer managed to create a balanced budget device with the best price / quality ratio. </p>
