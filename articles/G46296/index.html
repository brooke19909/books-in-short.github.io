    <h2>  City Beach San Remo </h2><p>  Within the city there are two main beaches.  The first sandy, the most beautiful, is located between two ports - Porto Vecchio, which means Old Port, and Portosole (Sunny Port).  It is practically in the very center of the city.  From the train station 10 minutes on foot - a pleasant walk through Corso Trento Trieste, a promenade that stretches along the entire coast. </p><p>  Here you will find some of San Remo's most luxurious <span>beaches</span> in <span>Italy</span> , which can offer all kinds of services.  For example, Italian baths, rental of beach umbrellas and sun loungers, swimming lessons, yoga and Pilates classes.  There is a field for playing football, playgrounds for beach volleyball, a children's pool.  Boat enthusiasts can rent canoes.  The sea and the sun awaken appetite very quickly, you can satisfy your hunger in a local restaurant or bar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  San Remo has a long tradition in sailing and in the port area it is noticeable like nowhere else.  Here, besides the beach of San Remo, there is a city yacht club, several famous sailing schools.  Those who wish can buy or charter a boat for themselves.  Tourists love this beach in the city center also because the largest green zone is located nearby - the Ormond City city park and the Nobel Garden with many outlandish varieties of plants and flowers. </p>

    <h2>  Tre Ponti Beach, San Remo </h2><p>  Another of the beaches of San Remo, loved by tourists, is located in the Tre Ponti area.  This is the largest free beach equipped with showers.  There are two bars and a restaurant, several commercial offices where you can rent beach umbrellas, sun loungers, canoes, pedal boats.  The coast is heterogeneous - in some places sand, in some places pebbles.  The coast of Tre Ponti is popular with fans of surfing, especially young people love it, but it is also suitable for families with children. </p><p>  If you like peace and quiet, then you should know that in the high season there is nowhere for an apple to fall, as, indeed, on other beaches of the coast, especially in July and August.  By car, it is almost impossible to get to the beaches of San Remo at this time.  It is recommended to come by bicycle or come on foot.  By the way, here passes the longest cycle track in Europe, which stretches along the coast for 24 km, from San Lorenzo al Mare to Ospedaletti, crossing several beautiful places.  Bicycles can always be rented - this type of transport is very popular here.  The bike route along the Riviera dei Fiori coastal park is well worth the ride. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Arma di Taja Beach </h2><p>  East of Bussany, about a quarter of an hour from the city, is the town of Taj.  In 2017, one of his villages, Arma di Taja, repeatedly received the <span>Blue Flag</span> transitional title thanks to the clear water and equally ideal beaches.  The shore here is sandy, the place is quiet, well equipped - many people like it, including families with children.  The bottom is shallow and sandy - according to reviews, the beaches of San Remo, located near Taji, are the best place to relax with children.  If you don‚Äôt want to pay, then it‚Äôs easy to find free sites.  Also, without money you can sunbathe and swim in the Fortress area near Bussany - here are very beautiful places.  The plots alternate - if you immediately get to a paid beach, you just need to go a little further. </p>

    <h2>  La Pigna Old Town </h2><p>  You will not be full of beaches alone - you will definitely want to get intellectual pleasure.  Therefore, it is worth mentioning not only about the beaches, about the sights of San Remo in Italy, there is also something to tell.  Actually, almost all of them are compactly assembled in the old city, this area is called La Pina.  In the 11th century there were powerful fortifications that local residents created to protect against Saracens.  Ancient buildings make themselves felt - almost the entire area is a maze of narrow streets interspersed with stone stairs and round arches.  All these streets will sooner or later lead you to the sea - they, like garlands, cross the terrain from the top of the hill to the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions San Remo </h2><p>  There is something to see in the old town.  You can start with a huge stone arch called the "Gate of St. Stephen."  This is a 14th-century building and the main gate to the old city.  Another attraction is Via Palma, formerly the main street of La Pigny.  In 1538, here, in the house of Manard, Pope Paul III stayed during a trip to Nice, and in 1794, the Palazzo dei Conti Sappia Rossi received Napoleon Bonaparte.  The gardens of Queen Montenegro Helena are located on a hilltop and rest against the Sanctuary of the Madonna della Costa, which since ancient times served as a guide for sailors.  It was founded in 300.  A quiet and peaceful place where the whole atmosphere is conducive to stopping and thinking about the eternal, to philosophize from the heart.  Time seems to have no measurement here. </p><p>  However, it will be necessary to return to modern realities, if only in order not to become a victim of pickpockets, which are a dime a dozen in the resort of San Remo.  Especially in the old city, where all tourists seek, and in the high season.  If you haven‚Äôt taken care of this beforehand, you can in one of the hotels of San Remo with its own beach - it will be less crowded and you can relax with great comfort. </p>
