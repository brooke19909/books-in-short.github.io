    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Staying at this hotel is characterized by the following negative aspects: </p><ul><li>  very old and tattered <span>ironing board;</span>  the service staff is too arrogant and does not always tactfully treat guests; </li><li>  if you didn‚Äôt open the door right after the knock of a maid (for example, you were in the shower), she can unceremoniously use her key; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is non-smoking, the rooms have a pronounced smell of tobacco; </li><li>  even such a trifle as a shoe spoon is absent in the room (you have to ask at the reception); </li><li>  plumbing in the bathroom is leaking; </li><li>  poor water pressure (especially on the upper floors). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you want to settle in a presentable institution in the center of Moscow, then the Slavyanskaya Radisson hotel is ideal for you.  It is characterized by a convenient location, and also boasts an excellent business center.  Of course, you can not ignore two wonderful restaurants that specialize in Japanese and Italian cuisines.  You can admire the beautiful Moscow landscapes from your window, as well as take advantage of the huge number of services for recreation and entertainment. </p><p>  Nevertheless, as already mentioned above, there were some shortcomings.  It is worth noting, in particular, slightly outdated furniture and plumbing in the rooms. </p>
