The system cannot be compared with premium telematic solutions, however, by the standards of its class, it has quite effective functionality.  And reviews of the Pandora DX-50 as a whole confirm this, at least emphasizing the reliability of the basic security features. </p><h2>  Complex features </h2><p>  The system focuses on ensuring the stability of mechanical protective devices against electronic hacking with support for remote control.  Through the radio channel, the owner can monitor the status of the alarm, as well as its individual functional units.  The interaction is implemented using a new generation key fob with an increased range.  It includes an on-line programming button, status indicators, as well as an updated receiver with a frequency of 868 MHz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nizhnevartovsk.sokoleso.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pandora DX-50 Controls" class="if uuid-2563545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563545.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, reviews of car alarms Pandora DX-50 highly appreciate the quality of implementation of the physical control mechanisms of the machine, which operate through a wide range of adaptive sensors.  Both at close and remote distances, through a key fob or smartphone, you can receive information about the movement, tilt and condition of doors with car windows.  The alarm individually controls 10 zones, not counting a special device for tracking the position of the wheels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features modification Pandora DX-50 L </h2><p>  This is a more modern version of the DX-50 alarm, in which some changes were provided.  Emphasis was placed on optimization, as a result of which the system lost the start-up relay module and the motor thermometer.  Actually, the changes negatively affected the work of remote start with the traditional functions of programmable engine start, but there were also advantages.  Understanding the influence of the new limiting factors, the developers improved the integration capabilities of the heating mechanisms of the power unit, which in principle eliminates the need for autostart.  For example, reviews of the Pandora DX-50 L indicate optimal compatibility with Eberspacher and Webasto pre-heating systems.  Moreover, their control after installation is also carried out remotely using a key fob or smartphone. </p><p>  Of course, for the addition of the motor with boilers, you will have to pay extra, but in the basic set, the modification of the DX-50 L is cheaper than the standard version. </p><h2>  Installation instructions for the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="autobastion.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pandora DX-50 Kit" class="if uuid-2563562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563562.jpg"></div><p>  Installation is carried out according to the traditional distribution scheme of the functional components of the system.  The central unit (controller) is fixed in a niche behind the dashboard.  It is advisable to provide the unit with a reliable position with maximum protection against vibration and physical shock.  The antenna is mounted as high as possible in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe windshield, but without direct contact with metal surfaces or other electrical equipment - a distance of 10-15 cm is maintained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to reviews, the installation of Pandora DX-50 in the electrical part is best done with the connection of the Alarm Studio proprietary program.  It will allow you to correctly enter the digital CAN bus into the network through the controller and the key fob with the USB connector, and then install the sensors and protection modules in the destination places one by one. </p><p>  For physical laying and fixing of cables, the kit provides for double-sided tape, mounting ties, rubber switches and grounding contacts. </p><h2>  Settings Instructions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mobistar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pandora DX-50 Alarm Keychain" class="if uuid-2563544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563544.jpg"></div><p>  At the first stage, the system is assigned basic operating parameters with a choice of settings mode.  By default, the first time it is recommended to use the status of automatic programming.  Individual user settings are manually set with the key fob and smartphone connected to the central controller. </p><p>  Further, through the computer or the same smartphone, you can set the target protection zones of the Pandora DX-50.  Reviews in this part, for example, praise non-volatile memory, which can store settings for more than 10 protected points.  These include limit switches for ignition, doors, hood, shock sensors, sensors, etc. Through the CAN bus, the sensitivity and response parameters of each protection mechanism are set, as well as emergency shutdown events and communication methods are indicated - again, manually, via a keychain, controller or smartphone. </p><h2>  User's manual </h2><div class="photo" data-original="install-auto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pre-heater and Pandora DX-50" class="if uuid-2563555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563555.jpg"></div><p>  The basic management tool will still be a keychain or proprietary application on a mobile device.  By programming the control buttons for specific commands for disarming and arming the machine, you can fully control the alarm system in remote mode.  The LED indicators ALARM and SEND, depending on the operating mode, will notify you of the current security status and possible changes in operation. </p><p>  But in terms of operating the engine start, the feedback on the Pandora DX-50 alarm is mixed.  In normal mode, when <span>setting the autorun</span> for a certain time, the corresponding reverse shock signal should be applied to the key fob.  It may be absent due to blocking by the immobilizer.  In this case, the actual operation of the motor will not occur.  This problem is solved with the help of the immobilizer crawler in the form of a special key that will deactivate the unit directly in the cabin, after which it will be possible to start the power plant. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pandora-auto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pandora DX-50 Controller" class="if uuid-2563543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563543.jpg"></div><p>  With very limited capabilities (taking into account the price tag of about 10 thousand rubles), the developers were able to adequately implement the initial level of alarm telematics without significant interruptions in management.  Among the indisputable advantages of the system, the owners include support for a digital CAN network, a stable radio channel, high-quality electrical accessories with a blocking radio relay and wireless communications.  Regarding the correctness of the sensor readings, the reviews about the Pandora DX-50 are also mostly positive - in any case, with correctly configured settings, you can get a very wide set of data about the state of the car. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Obviously, the creators sacrificed many opportunities.  Partly because of the modest budget, but do not forget about the concept of the device.  At a minimum, you have to abandon GPS / GLONASS systems.  Moreover, the owners in the reviews of the Pandora DX-50 do not criticize the exclusion of satellite tools in themselves, but the lack of integration of such modules.  The possibility of such an addition, for example, is present in many StarLine budget systems.  There is also criticism of certain stylistic nuances of the keyring and control unit execution, but these factors do not affect the performance. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pandora-system.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keychain for Pandora DX-50" class="if uuid-2563540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2563540.jpg"></div><p>  The developers of the Pandora product line from AlarmTrade for a long time could not find a balance between acceptable functionality and affordable cost.  In the assortment, both premium versions from the DXL series and frank budget employees with severe restrictions on the ability to control basic protection tools were equally successfully presented.  But, reviews about the Pandora DX-50 showed that the middle segment is quite amenable to this manufacturer.  The model confidently discourages customers from competitive systems due to the inclusion of new technologies and by eliminating the characteristic problems of many alarms of this level.  It is enough to note the support of the remote signal at a distance of up to 3000 m, the use of high-quality plastic in the cases and the correct readings of the measuring equipment. </p>
