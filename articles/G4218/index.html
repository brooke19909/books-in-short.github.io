That is, with a salary of 20 thousand rubles, our income tax is 2,600. Of course, it is not enough pleasant.  I would like to get everything that is due to us for work.  It turns out that <span>income tax</span> refund is real.  Of course, everything paid for many years of work will not return, but at least part of the amount will be in the bank account.  Now more about how this is possible.

    <p>  The state returns to citizens 13% of the cost of education, treatment, apartment, <span>voluntary pension insurance.</span>  This is done provided that the citizen paid income tax.  Actually, it is precisely the return of the income tax paid at the time of the above expenses.  Each case requires special consideration. </p><h2>  Social deduction </h2><p>  If a citizen worked during the year, regularly paid income tax and at the same time studied, then he has the right to provide him with a <span>social deduction.</span>  It consists in reducing the <span>tax base</span> (that is, the salary received for the year), with which he must pay 13%.  For example, the annual salary was 200,000 rubles.  In the usual case, the income tax will be 26,000 rubles.  If in parallel during the year there was a paid training worth 40,000, and documents were submitted for social deduction, then the tax should already be paid not from 200 thousand, but from 160 000 rubles, and it will amount to 20 800. The excess 5,200 tax inspectorate will list to a bank account after checking all documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax return documents" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/17533.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth mentioning here, income tax refund is possible only up to a certain amount.  The maximum possible tax deduction for training does not exceed 120 thousand rubles.  This means that the largest amount that can be returned for the year is 15,600 rubles.  Anything spent in excess of this amount is not refundable. </p><p>  Parents can also refund part of the child‚Äôs tuition.  But in this case, the deduction limit is 50,000 rubles, that is, income tax can only be refunded in the amount of <span>6,500 rubles</span> per year.  In addition, it must be said that tax can be returned every year during the entire period of study in any educational institutions, if they have a license to conduct activities. </p><p>  All of the above applies to other types of social deduction: <span>pension insurance,</span> treatment.  Only the threshold of 50,000 is canceled to pay for a close relative.  The maximum, in any case, is 120 thousand.  The exception is expensive treatment.  There is no maximum, and a list of such services is determined by the Government of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Tax deduction after home purchase <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax refund when buying an apartment" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/17535.jpg" width="399"></div></h2><p>  No less popular and useful is the income tax refund when buying an apartment, or the so-called property deduction.  It is provided if the citizen purchased the apartment, house.  It also applies to the construction of houses, the purchase of building materials and repair work.  It is provided only once in a lifetime and after buying another apartment it is impossible. </p><p>  The maximum deduction in this case is two million rubles.  So, if the apartment was worth 3 million, only 260 thousand will return anyway.  A citizen has the right to submit documents every year until the moment the full amount is returned. </p><p>  We give an example.  The annual salary is 400 thousand rubles.  The tax is 52,000 rubles.  The cost of the apartment is 1 million. The total return is 130 thousand.  For one year this amount cannot be returned.  This means that documents for the return of income tax will have to be submitted several times.  For the first and second year, 52 thousand rubles will return, and for the third year - the remaining 26 thousand rubles. </p>
