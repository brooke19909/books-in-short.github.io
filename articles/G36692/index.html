Conquest of Pharaoh Thutmose</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The history of ancient Egypt</span> knows about the four kings with the name Thutmose, they all belong to the same 18 dynasty and ruled one after another.  But the most significant trace in history was certainly left by Thutmose III.  Egypt rose to unprecedented heights during his reign.  Thutmose and Hammurabi (the Babylonian king) are often compared, drawing a parallel between their military campaigns and aggressive foreign policy.  Both of them greatly expanded the borders of their state, having forever inscribed their names in the <span>history of the Ancient World.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The reign of Thutmose." class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/574702.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><h2>  Thutmose I </h2><p>  The years of the reign of Thutmose I - 1504-1492 <span>BC.</span>  It is difficult to say about its origin, scientists suggest that he was the husband of Amenhotep I‚Äôs sister and it is possible that he was the son of the pharaoh Ahmosis I (founder of the 18th dynasty).  The reign of Thutmose I is the beginning of the conquests that greatly expanded the borders of Ancient Egypt.  At the very beginning of his reign in Nubia, an uprising took place.  The king personally participated in its suppression, according to ancient chronicles, he struck the leader of the rebellious people with his spear.  Nubia was completely ravaged and entire tribes were driven into slavery.  His conquests in the South advanced to the third threshold of the Nile, and in the North to the Euphrates River.  Victorious raids enriched the treasury at the expense of looted property and tribute paid by the conquered peoples.  This contributed to the active construction of temples.  Thutmose I was the first pharaoh who refused a magnificent tombstone and chose to isolate the tomb from his memorial temple.  The tomb was built in an atmosphere of extreme secrecy, it was carved into the rock.  In 1881, the <span>mummy of the pharaoh</span> was discovered there <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The direct heirs of Thutmose I died in early childhood (two sons and a daughter), only one daughter remained - Hatshepsut.  Close family marriages were commonplace and she was married to stepbrother (father) Thutmose II, a son from a ‚Äúnot main‚Äù wife.  He became the next pharaoh. </p><h2>  Thutmose II </h2><p>  <span>The Egyptian king</span> did not have particularly good health, so the years of the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose II are short.  Some Egyptologists believe that he was on the throne for only four years.  Nevertheless, all these are only assumptions, therefore the date of the reign of Thutmose II, as a rule, is indicated approximate from 1492 to 1489 BC.  The first year of his reign was marked by the brutal suppression of the rebellion in Nubia, when they killed all the men of the tribe that they could find.  Thutmose II retained all the territories that his father had conquered.  He had two daughters from Hatshepsut, but his son was from a concubine, but it was to him that the throne passed after the death of Pharaoh. </p>

    <h2>  Queen Hatshepsut </h2><p>  The Pharaoh woman, one of the most famous rulers of Egypt.  Many historians believe that she could achieve her high status even at the time when Thutmose I ruled, that is, her father, and then, perhaps, was the co-ruler of her husband.  This subsequently allowed her to take the throne from the young pharaoh.  After the death of her husband, she was appointed regent of the 12-year-old Thutmose III, and then, after a year and a half, literally and peacefully removed him.  She became famous primarily for active construction, she patronized culture and sciences, and taught her stepson Thutmose III to do this.  Egypt flourished with it economically, but possessions in Palestine and Syria were almost lost.  Although, according to some reports, she personally participated in several military campaigns, in general, foreign policy was peaceful for two decades.  The queen ruled for almost 22 years.  According to the latest data obtained after studying her mummy, she died at the age of more than 50 years from diseases (liver cancer, bone tumor and diabetes).  During her life, she erected a funerary temple, it is carved in a rock and impresses with its size and decoration to this day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Thutmose III </h2><p>  The approximate years of the reign of Thutmose III - 1479-1425 BC  But in fact, he ascended the throne after the death of his stepmother Hatshepsut.  The first thing he did was order to destroy all references to her, erase the name from the walls, destroy the statues.  What were the motives for this, it‚Äôs hard to say now, perhaps personal, historians admit that this was done under the influence of the court nobility.  The years of the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III were marked by a change in the peaceful course to an active conquering foreign policy.  In the years when Thutmose III ruled, Egypt became one of the largest Ancient states. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the portraits of the great ruler, then scientists believe that his sculptural images have little in common with real appearance.  Based on the study of the mummy, experts concluded that he was not tall, but his physique was correct and strong. </p><h2>  Thutmose III Military Campaigns </h2><p>  The Pharaoh was distinguished by an active <span>military policy,</span> but the following campaigns were most notable: </p><ol><li>  The first trip to Syria.  It is believed that his reason was the uprising of Asian tribes.  But the reason is the same as many centuries ago - the state needed slaves, resources and an open path to foreign trade.  The campaign in Syria significantly strengthened the position of the Egyptian state in Western Asia. </li><li>  Military campaign of the 29th year of the reign of Pharaoh.  This was the fifth military campaign in Asia Minor.  As a result, the Egyptians on the Phoenician coast seized the large agricultural area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJahi, which became a stronghold. </li><li>  The sixth and seventh campaigns during the reign of Thutmose III were marine.  Ships moved along the Mediterranean Sea and landed for the first time in Simir (modern territory of Syria).  The goal was Kedesh fortress - one of the most impregnable, its siege lasted almost six months, but did not produce results.  The Egyptians sacked the neighborhood and were forced to leave the coast.  Returning a second time, the army of the pharaoh occupied the Phoenician city of Ullaz. </li><li>  The eighth campaign confirmed the rule of Egypt in all of Syria, Palestine, Finnicia.  Historians call this period the culmination of the military conquests of Thutmose III. </li><li>  Further campaigns (9, 10, 13, 14th) were undertaken in the years 34-39 of the reign of Thutmose III.  They no longer had a pronounced aggressive character, but rather were aimed at retaining the already conquered territories, on which uprisings flashed. </li><li>  Last trip to Asia.  By its purpose, it was rather a punitive expedition in order to crush the rebellious Syria, the same cities Kadesh and Tunip were at the head of the uprising.  Both fortresses were taken by the Egyptians, who dealt a crushing blow, permanently strengthening the position of their state in Syria and Phenicia. </li></ol><p>  All territories conquered during the reign of Thutmose III were turned into provinces of Egypt and governed locally by its governors.  Numerous nations presented him tribute as a sign of respect and solidarity to his politics.  The conquests of Thutmose III turned Egypt into a very powerful, strong power.  None of the subsequent pharaohs were able to expand the boundaries further than was done under him. </p><h2>  Domestic Politics During Thutmose III </h2><p>  Active construction continued, as under Queen Hatshepsut, including the Karnak Temple of Amon-Ra with obelisks.  According to the testimonies that remained on the walls of temples and tombs, the pharaoh was a fairly versatile person who patronized the arts.  In addition to the outstanding abilities of the commander, he possessed a broad outlook and even was engaged in modeling clay vessels, the projects of which were then transferred to artisans.  By orders of the pharaoh, new varieties of plants and animal species were brought into Egypt.  Under him, a standing professional army was formed, ships were built (cedar was specially brought from Libya).  Thutmose III led Egypt for 53 years.  The economic and cultural upsurge of the state was marked precisely by his years of rule.  Thutmose and Hammurabi are separated in time by several hundred years, but the similarity between them is noticeable, both rulers were not only great military leaders, but also competent politicians.  With the name of Hammurabi, the exaltation of Babylon, the creation of a rule of law, was connected, and Thutmose III turned Egypt into a powerful empire, having earned the title of ‚ÄúNapoleon of the Ancient World‚Äù, but not a punisher, the pharaoh showed humanity to the conquered peoples, without causing meaningless massacre and genocide. </p><h2>  The art of the XVIII dynasty </h2><p>  Egypt at that time occupied a leading international position, achieved unprecedented power, and the splendor of the furnishings, clothes and decorations of the nobility increased.  The leading role in art at that time was played by Thebes, the capital of the state at that time.  The temples built at this time are monumental and solemn, and the funerary ones are traditionally separated from the tombs, which were carved in separate gorges to prevent plunder.  An outstanding work of ancient architecture is the <span>temple of Queen Hatshepsut.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Ancient egyptian music </h2><p>  Numerous bas-reliefs depicting singers and instrumentalists speak of the great importance of music in the life of the Egyptians.  It sounded in everyday life, accompanying various labor processes, mass festivities, solemn processions.  During the XVIII dynasty, a palace chapel already existed.  The main musical instruments: harps, flutes, lyres, lutes, drums and systres (metal rattle).  In the era of the XVIII dynasty, military music develops along with palace music, the first orchestras with percussion instruments and trumpets appear. </p><h2>  Thutmose IV </h2>

    <p>  Pharaoh ruled around 1397-1388 BC, and this is a fairly short period.  According to the results of mummy research, he died at a young age.  His time on the throne was not marked by great accomplishments.  Thutmose IV made several military campaigns, but did not repeat the glory of his predecessors. </p>
