    <h2>  Assets in modern enterprises </h2><p>  Share capital is a certain amount of funds.  It is recorded in the constituent documents and introduced by the founders at the time of creation of the enterprise.  The size of the authorized capital is determined by the participants independently.  But at the same time, it cannot be less than established by law at the time of the creation of the company.  In the process of economic activity, the founders can change the fund - to make a contribution to the authorized capital.  Postings are a prerequisite for this process.  In other words, for any actions with proceeds, amendments are made to the <span>constituent documents.</span>  If one of the founders makes a decision to leave the company, he is entitled to claim the return of the previously contributed part of the assets in cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The size of the assets of each of the participants </h2><p>  Since one of the conditions for creating a company is the presence of founders in an amount of at least two, the amount of incoming funds is divided between all participants into the appropriate parts.  They are usually defined as a percentage.  The share in the charter capital of each participant is proportional to the value of the share of the net assets of the company, that is, if the amount of the founder's incoming funds is 40%, and the net assets of the company are 100,000 rubles, then in monetary terms, the share of each is 40,000 rubles.  Any information regarding the authorized capital, interest of founders and their changes is recorded in the Charter of the company.  In addition, restrictions may apply to the documentation regarding individual participants.  Such changes can be included in the Charter at the initial stage of the creation of a company or in the process of activity.  Any decision to make adjustments to the charter documents is made on the basis of a unanimously adopted decision at the General Meeting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="registered capital account" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/416758.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Factors Encouraging Expanding Assets </h2><p>  Very often, as a result of economic activity, an enterprise finds itself in a situation where it is necessary to increase the amount of its authorized capital.  The most common factors for this are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  lack of working capital for taxes, social contributions and payroll; </li><li>  requirements of licensed institutions related to active funds; </li><li>  terms of participation in tenders; </li><li>  new members who intend to contribute to the authorized capital. </li></ul><h2>  Basic conditions </h2><p>  An increase in the authorized capital occurs if all the conditions provided for by law are met, namely: </p><p>  1. Payment of active funds, the amount of which was determined at the time of the creation of the company.  The established amount must be paid in full.  In the law, this clause applies even to those enterprises that have carried out state registration in the current year. </p><p>  2. The amount by which revenues can be increased should not exceed the difference between net assets and the amount of authorized and <span>reserve capital.</span> </p><p>  3. The total value of net assets at the end of the year should be more than the amount of constituent funds indicated in the documents.  This condition is considered very important, since in case of non-compliance, the company must declare a reduction in the size of its assets.  And in accordance with the law, such a company is subject to liquidation. </p>

    <h2>  Sources of funds </h2><p>  In most cases, the need to increase the authorized capital indicates a successful economic activity of the company and its attractiveness from the point of view of investors.  There are some of the most common ways in which you can expand your registered capital: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - property owned by the company itself; </p><p>  - replenishment of the fund with additional contributions of existing participants; </p><p>  - Contributing by new members who intend to join the community. </p><h2>  Fund ownership </h2><p>  An increase in the authorized capital of an enterprise in this way is a rather troublesome procedure and characteristic of well-developed companies.  The basis for such a decision is a report on the financial condition of the enterprise for the last calendar year.  The proposal to replenish the authorized capital with the property of the organization is considered at the general meeting and is considered accepted if two-thirds of all participants in the company vote for it.  The result of the decision is made out by the relevant minutes of the meeting of participants. </p>

    <h2>  Replenishment of participants from their own assets </h2><p>  In practice, the authorized capital (account 75) can be expanded in two ways: </p><ul><li>  all founders at the same time; </li><li>  only a few participants. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, it is necessary to hold a general meeting at which to decide on the size of the contribution and the ratio of the amounts contributed with an increase in the share of participants.  Contributions by individual founders are somewhat different.  For this, the participant who intends to make an additional contribution must write an appropriate statement indicating the share that he would like to receive, the size of the contribution, the term and the procedure for making it.  All other founders should consider the application at the general meeting and make an appropriate decision. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="registered capital by property" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/416761.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Third party contributions </h2><p>  In order to become a member of the company, you must submit an application, pay a fee and wait for the decision of the current founders.  The applicant for membership submits an application, which, in addition to standard information, contains paragraphs indicating the size of the contribution and the timing of its contribution.  Participants in the company make a decision at the general meeting and increase the size of the authorized capital through additional contributions.  Moreover, their income in accordance with the law must be paid in full.  If the <span>authorized capital of a</span> company is subject to changes, then all adjustments are subject to registration with state bodies and are introduced into the charter documents. </p><h2>  Fund receipts in the form of fixed assets </h2><p>  The law provides for contributions to the authorized capital not only in money, that is, participants can transfer a car, computer or other value into the ownership of the enterprise in the form of a contribution to the fund.  The value of a fixed asset is expressed in monetary terms based on the initial cost specified in the documentation of the transferring party.  A certain monetary value is agreed with the founders of the company.  A feature of contributions to the authorized capital is that, according to the law, they are not taxed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="authorized capital" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/416762.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Deposit accounting </h2><p>  After the implementation of state fixation procedures and registration of investments, the balance sheet of the enterprise reflects the debt on contributions to the authorized capital.  In 1C, the account of the indicated operation is made at the debit of the account.  75 "Settlements with the founders."  This procedure is carried out in correspondence with the account.  80. It is, in fact, called the "authorized capital".  Postings of the main funds contributed by the founders are made at the debit of account.  08 "Investments in non-current assets" and a loan account.  75 (its name is indicated above).  The balance will reflect the debts of the founders at the end of the reporting month. </p><h2>  The concept of a joint venture agreement </h2><p>  One of the documents regulating the activities of the company includes an agreement on the implementation of joint actions.  In accordance with this agreement, several people undertake to combine their interests and contributions for economic activities that are not prohibited by law, in order to make a profit.  The combined property of all participants is on the balance sheet of the one who conducts common business and is not subject to income tax. </p>

    <h2>  Joint ventures in accounting </h2><p>  Reflection of operations associated with the agreement on joint activities occurs on the ‚ÄúInternal business calculations‚Äù, cf.  79. A participant representing interests on the basis of a power of attorney keeps a record of the fixed assets received and indicates them in the documentation as "Contribution to the <span>authorized capital". Postings on</span> reports are debited 01- "Fixed assets".  The loan is reflected in the account.  79 - "internal calculations". </p><h2>  Accounting for changes in the size of constituent assets </h2><p>  The reporting reflects any operations (increase or decrease) that affect the contribution to the authorized capital.  Postings are made in accordance with the grounds, that is, receipts are recorded for certain items.  Reasons for displaying changes are relevant documents.  Contributions to the authorized capital are made in cash or any assets in cash.  However, regardless of the form of receipt, all asset movements are recorded in the statements. </p><h2>  Sale of the constituent part </h2><p>  Any participant can at any time announce his withdrawal from society.

In the first case, the seller sends all other founders information about the proposed transaction.  Thirty days later, each of the participants in the company who intends to buy a share sends an acceptance to the seller.  According to the results of the decision of the seller, a transaction is drawn up, which comes into force after the procedure for registering changes.  Until then, the sale of a legal basis has not.  Registration of changes is carried out in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities. </p>
