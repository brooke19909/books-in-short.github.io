Features of rest, recommendations and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The charming country of Southeast Asia, Vietnam was recently "discovered" by Russian tourists.  A long flight, perhaps, is the only minus of a trip to rest in this state.  But there are no pluses.  These are relatively low prices, wonderful beaches, excellent service, hospitable people, exotic customs, nature enchanting with its beauty, rich excursion program at each resort.  The advantages of Vietnam should be added both security in the country and a visa-free regime for Russians arriving for a period of not more than fifteen days.  But when to go on vacation to this state?  In this article, we will look at Vietnam in August.  Is it worth going to the resorts of the country in the last month of summer, or is it worth waiting for a more comfortable time of the year?  What do tourists say about this?  We examined their weather reports in Vietnam and summarized them here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam is worth a ride in August" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vietnam in August: reviews and features </h2><p>  If you look at the map of the country, it is easy to notice that this state has a great length from north to south.  A relatively narrow strip is Vietnam along the Pacific Ocean.  Therefore, in a small country there are three climatic zones.  This makes it possible to relax in Vietnam at least all year round.  When in the winter in the north, in the Hanoi region, nasty rains and pretty cool, on the island of Phu Quoc, which lies in the same latitudes with the resorts of Thailand, a real hot summer reigns.  But from June to August, the tropics of southern Vietnam covers the rainy season.  But in the north of the country the sky is not cloudless.  So is it worth going to Vietnam in August?  Should I go to the fabulous <span>Halong Bay</span> (in the north of the country) in general?  Let's look at this issue in more detail.  According to climatic conditions, Vietnam can be divided into northern, central and southern parts.  What is the climate in all of them at the end of summer? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam in August is it worth it to go reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387750.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  North </h2><p>  When asked about whether to go to Vietnam in August, reviews respond that it all depends on the chosen vacation spot.  Summer - it is summer in Southeast Asia, and, consequently, air and water temperatures are quite high.  The climatic zones of Vietnam in August differ only in the amount of precipitation.  What can be said about the north of the country in the last month of summer?  There, the wet season is almost over.  There are more and more clear days.  Rains can still happen, but they mostly occur in the evening and night.  Meteorologists observing the weather in the most beautiful bay on Halong land say: for the whole of August, the sky is covered with clouds for eleven days.  Clouds cannot diminish the effect of the southern sun.  It warms the air to thirty-two degrees during the day, and at night the temperature does not fall below + 24 C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Should i go to vietnam in august reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach season in the north of Vietnam </h2><p>  Although rains (and even typhoons) are still possible, the sea has completely calmed down.  It is very warm and not at all cloudy.  So swimming and sunbathing in the resorts of northern Vietnam is already quite comfortable.  At the same time, daredevils who decided to come this ‚Äúlow‚Äù season are entitled to a bonus: still low prices for tours and half-empty beaches.  But as for excursions in Hanoi, the weather in the capital can make its own adjustments to your plans.  Reviews say that the city is flooded with heavy showers, which is why it is simply flooded.  Sapa is drier but slightly cooler.  During the day, the thermometer does not rise above +27, but at night it does not drop below twenty-two degrees.  So, what about North Vietnam in August - is it worth it to go?  Reviews say that it‚Äôs quite.  Moreover, the best rest will be at the end of the month than at the beginning.  Closer to September, the rains completely stop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam in August reviews and features" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387762.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Central vietnam </h2><p>  Gradually, very gradually, showers are moving south.  And the rainy season comes to Central Vietnam in August.  Is it worth going to the popular resorts of Hoi An and Da Nang in this case?  Reviews say the rainy season in August is just beginning.  In the first half of the month, not a drop can fall on the heated earth.  At the end of August, night rains take place in the resorts of Central Vietnam.  But in the morning the sun instantly dries the sand of the beaches, and only the freshened jungle testifies to the past rain.  In general, the meteorological service counted only seven days with precipitation for the entire month.  And their figure is not so high: only one hundred and ten millimeters.  As for the reviews of tourists, they testify: the rains, although they take place in the form of heavy showers, from which no umbrella saves, do not interfere with relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews of tourists about vacation in vietnam in august" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387812.jpg" width="458"></div>

    <h2>  Beach season in Central Vietnam </h2><p>  The last month of summer in this part of the country is comfortable in every way.  The sea is calm and does not storm.  Divers note the high transparency of the water.  All other vacationers sing odes to temperature.  ‚ÄúNot a sea, but a bath!‚Äù  - So you can summarize the reviews about the rest in Vietnam.  Where is better to stay?  Tourists agree on this question.  Of course, in resorts in the center of the country.  In Hoi An, Da Nang and the cultural <span>capital of Vietnam,</span> Hue, the sea warms up to twenty-nine and a half degrees!  In this case, the air temperature is within thirty-two.  With relatively low humidity, such indicators are ideal for a <span>beach holiday.</span>  Prices for <span>tours to Vietnam</span> in the last month of summer are low.  If there is such an opportunity, choose the first half of August for trips to the resorts of the center of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about vacations in Vietnam where to stay" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1387813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  South </h2><p>  Nha Trang and Mui Ne are extremely popular resorts.  And at the end of summer you can still find the dry season.  The amount of precipitation, according to meteorologists, does not exceed fifty-two millimeters.  In this case, the air temperature reaches thirty-three degrees during the day, cooling at night to + 24 C. The sea is very pleasing to tourists - calm, transparent, warmed up to plus twenty-nine.  So it makes sense to go on vacation to Southeast Vietnam in August.  Should I go to the famous island of Phu Quoc - a completely different question.  It lies on the same latitude with Thai resorts, that is, in the subequatorial climate zone.  Here, in the last month of summer, the rainy season is in full swing.  Hot, stuffy, high humidity, turbulent, muddy sea.  But tourists buy at low prices, so you will not be alone. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Vietnam in August </h2><p>  Do not tragically take the words "low season" or "time for showers."  Tourists say that in Vietnam this time is not so bad at all.  Showers go either at night or after dinner.  Morning, wherever you rest, is sunny and clear.  Moreover, showers do not cool the sea, which is stably very warm.  Rain only brings a slight freshness, and tropical flowers begin to smell even stronger.  If you want to completely insure yourself from the weather, choose the resorts of Central Vietnam - Mui Ne or Fanrang.  In August, this country celebrates an important holiday - the Day of the Wandering Souls.  He is ‚Äútied‚Äù to the lunar calendar, so he has no exact date.  It can be compared to Christian All Saints Day.  On this holiday, they honor the dead relatives, give them clothes and food, and incense burn. </p>
