    <h2>  Bus </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest ways to overcome the route "Samara - Nizhny Novgorod".  Fortunately, city dwellers, there are even two of them.  The first leaves at 19:00 from Samara Central Bus Station and arrives in Nizhny Novgorod at 8:20 in the morning.  Thus, he spends 14 hours 20 minutes on the way. </p><p>  The second <span>bus "Samara</span> - Nizhny Novgorod" travels only 11 hours.  He leaves from Samara from the square near the railway station at 21:00 and arrives at 7:00 at the Moscow railway station. </p><p>  In the opposite direction, along the route "Nizhny Novgorod - Samara", there are also 2 buses.  One departs from the city at 14:40 from the bus station and arrives at their destination at 9 in the morning.  In total, the bus spends 14 hours 20 minutes. </p><p>  The second bus leaves Nizhny Novgorod at 21:00 from the Moscow railway station and arrives at its destination at 8:00.  Thus, the travel time is 11 hours. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Note that, according to the carrier companies, all the buses of the Samara - Nizhny Novgorod route are tourist buses, therefore they are more convenient than usual. </p>

    <h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the distance along the Samara-Nizhny Novgorod route is relatively small, there are likely to be people who want to go to another city by air, fortunately there are almost direct flights.  <span>Samara Airport (Kurumoch)</span> is located 42 km from the city itself, and <span>Nizhny Novgorod Airport</span> (Strigino) is 16 km away. </p><p>  Passenger transportation is handled by the well-known UTair company.  Airplanes from city to city fly daily at the same time, which allows us to talk about the total cost of all tickets. </p><p>  Departure from Samara takes place at 15:55, and after an hour and a half - at 16:25 - passengers land in Nizhny Novgorod.  In the opposite direction, the departure takes place at 12:25, and the landing at 15:02.  Thus, it turns out that the flight from Nizhny Novgorod takes 10 minutes more. </p><p>  When calculating your time and expenses, keep in mind that after landing at the airport you will still need to get to the city itself.  Fortunately, this is not difficult to do: regular buses and minibuses constantly go, and finding a taxi will not be difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Fares </h2><p>  The cheapest transport option is the bus.  A ticket will cost about 1000 rubles, which is pretty cheap.  Just keep in mind that all the hardships of moving in a sitting position at night will not go anywhere, even in the most comfortable bus. </p><p>  If we talk about the train, then the ticket price depends on the type of seat.  So, you can buy a sedentary for about 1000 rubles, a reserved seat for 1600, a coupe for 2549, and a suite for 5400. </p><p>  The cost of a trip by car varies within 1740 rubles, so if more than two people are in the car, this option can already compete in terms of economy with a bus. </p><p>  Due to the fact that only one company operates flights between cities, the exact price of a ticket can be called.  Prices start at 5215 rubles.  Only in June and August they rise - in these months the cost is from 5715 rubles.  But do not forget about the cost of a trip from the airport to the city </p><h2>  Traveler opinions </h2><p>  According to residents of both cities, the best option is a train trip.  But it is better not to ride the bus, since this <span>type of transport is</span> often chosen by not very adequate people.  Sitting on the train, very few also venture to travel.  But in a compartment and reserved seat car usually travel with pleasure. </p><p>  Air travel is quite in demand, but because of the cost, few choose them.  But traveling by car is a frequent option, but not everyone has such an opportunity. </p><p>  Residents of cities also note that there is another way to go the way "Nizhny Novgorod - Samara."  The distance can be covered by the river.  Unfortunately, today all the ships that run between these cities are tourist ships, there are no longer scheduled ones.  Most likely, this is due to the fact that few people used maritime transport. </p>
