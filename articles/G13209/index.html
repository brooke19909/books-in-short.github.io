    <h2>  Opportunities for families with children </h2><p>  If you go to a hotel with your children, then you can be sure that they will not be bored.  The smallest tourists are provided with the following options: </p><ul><li>  in the children's pool with a safe depth there are water slides, inflatable toys and other entertainments; </li><li>  in the open air there is a playground with a safe rubberized coating; </li><li>  kids will have a great time at the kids club in the company of animators; </li><li>  The restaurant has a special children's buffet with diet dishes and comfortable furniture. </li></ul><h2>  Disabled Facilities </h2><p>  Hotel Porto Platanias Beach Resort 5 * (Greece) makes sure that guests with disabilities feel as comfortable as possible.  It is worth paying attention to the following features: </p><ul><li>  specially equipped rooms with wide doorways, handrails, as well as convenient sockets and switches; </li><li>  separate elevators with convenient check-in; </li><li>  ramps for comfortable wheelchair access are equipped throughout; </li><li>  gentle slope to the beach; </li><li>  wheelchair rental. </li></ul><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  You will find a lot of pleasant moments if you go on a vacation to Crete.  The review of Porto Platanias Beach Resort (Platanias) contains such positive comments: </p><ul><li>  huge well-groomed territory, which is densely planted with trees and flowers; </li><li>  excellent quality of cleaning, regardless of the tip; </li><li>  smiling and polite staff; </li><li>  very convenient location near the beach and resort infrastructure; </li><li>  convenient layout of rooms, so that guests feel comfortable even in a relatively small area; </li><li>  Upon arrival, guests receive a compliment of fresh fruit and amphora with local wine. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even the most luxurious hotels have a lot of flaws.  If we talk about this institution, then it should be noted such negative points: </p><ul><li>  carefully check the checks and the status of the credit card account, as employees can write off the amount of payment for the same services twice; </li><li>  ashtrays are on all tables of restaurants, and for non-smokers there is no separate zone; </li><li>  the hotel photos presented on the official website and other resources do not correspond to the real state of affairs; </li><li>  almost none of the hotel employees speaks Russian, and therefore the solution of organizational issues is significantly complicated; </li><li>  there is strong audibility between the numbers; </li><li>  very old furniture in the rooms (both morally and physically); </li><li>  for the entire time they were in the room they never brought drinking water; </li><li>  very cold water in the pools; </li><li>  beach towels are provided for a fee, and a rental service is available only three times a week; </li><li>  disgusting quality of the internet. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the first positive impression that you get when you get to the hotel disappears after a few hours.  Behind the external gloss and grooming, you begin to notice the "tiredness" of the interior, frayed walls and other signs that indicate the general neglect of the institution.  As for food and service, they also do not correspond to the declared five stars.  Nevertheless, the situation is saved by a beautiful green area, a well-groomed sandy beach and a convenient location with regard to tourist infrastructure.  If you consider the hotel exclusively as a place to sleep, then this institution is ideal for you. </p>
