    <p>  Here he embodied his dream in life, consisting in the creation of the Russian fleet, which subsequently made the Russian sovereign.  He personally took a direct part in the construction and launch of the very first ships.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the most famous monument to this emperor was erected in the city of Voronezh precisely when the Petrovsky Square was inaugurated. </p><p>  Then, in the distant thirties of the 19th century, the Voronezh governor D. Begichev decided to create a museum room dedicated to the tsar and located on an island with a Zeikhaus, and in front of it to build a square for cultural walks of citizens.  To create it, they raised money from local residents and allocated funds from the state treasury.  The construction of this place was led by a talented architect I. Volkov, who managed to create only the building of the chamber. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then the Russo-Turkish war began, and the construction of state and stone buildings and structures throughout the Russian state was prohibited. </p><h2>  View of the square before reconstruction </h2><p>  In past years, such structures were a subject of special concern on the part of the city authorities and required special care.  In those days, even a special commission worked, monitoring all the gardens of the center of the province.  Petrovsky Square also fell under her vigilant control.  Voronezh and its inhabitants quickly got used to such a green place in their city, they loved to spend their time here.  Therefore, periodically there were some changes in the appearance of the park, aimed only for the better.  So, in 1901, Petrovsky Square placed on its territory about 40 shops, so that you could safely sit and relax there on foot, and a beautiful fountain was also created. </p>

    <p>  Visitors could walk and spend their leisure time in the area from 06:00 to 23:00.  And also Petrovsky Square (Voronezh) was guarded by a watchman who monitored the observance of order here. </p><p>  This place is a local attraction, which should be given special attention. </p><h2>  Monument and its discovery </h2><p>  In 1834, the Voronezh governor decided to perpetuate the memory of the great Russian Tsar Peter I and for this he wrote a letter to Emperor Nikolai, in which he asked for funds to create such a monument.  The sovereign encouraged the decision, but did not allocate money from the treasury, so he had to collect donations from the inhabitants of the province, which was enough only to create a museum and a public garden.  For this reason, the construction of the monument was stopped for an indefinite period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1856, a new governor was appointed, also inspired by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a monument.  It was he who brought this venture to the end.  Thus, in 1860, under volleys of artillery and surrounded by a solemnly built regiment, Petrovsky Square received its monument dedicated to the greatest of the tsars of Russia, Peter I.  It is decorated with pink granite, and near it are five <span>ship guns.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Further history of the monument </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the statue of the monument was taken away by the Germans and subsequently remelted.  In the 50s of the 20th century, a new monument was erected at this place, the creator of which was the Moscow sculptor and architect N. Gavrilov. </p><p>  During his work, he respected all the proportions and took into account the necessary features of the statue, so it appeared to the townspeople in its original form.  All records that were destroyed in 1918 were also restored in 2003.  Not only the main <span>attraction of Voronezh was</span> changing <span>,</span> but also the territory on which it was installed. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction of the park </h2><p>  Petrovsky Square (Voronezh) was redone and transformed several times.  History shows that such a first transformation took place here in 1953, when new and beautiful alleys were laid, and a multi-stringed fountain was built, just behind which the stone descent begins, leading to Malo-Chernavskaya Street.  In those years, significantly expanded the territory of the square. </p><p>  The next reconstruction was already in 2007, when a shopping and entertainment center was being built near this place.  For this purpose, one historical building was specially demolished, on the site of which a new one appeared. </p>

    <h2>  View today </h2><p>  At present, Petrovsky Square (Voronezh) has a very beautiful and majestic appearance.  The photos show that in its center stands a large statue of the Russian sovereign Peter I, from which the well-groomed and stone-paved alleys diverge in different directions.  Behind the emperor‚Äôs monument, after a small staircase, a view of the amazing domed fountain opens. </p><p>  The entire territory of the square is decorated with lovely flower beds and green lawns, and the cast iron cannons have remained an unchanged attribute of this place since ancient times.  <span>Forged benches</span> and lanterns are made in the same style and are a beautiful addition to Petrovsky Square. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback from vacationers </h2><p>  Many residents and visitors of the city consider this park the most comfortable and comfortable place in Voronezh, where you can have a wonderful and relaxing time in the shade of cool trees.  They say that there is a pleasant atmosphere of purity and peace, with which you can hide from the bustle of the city. </p><p>  Those who have already visited Petrovsky Square say that there is a certain moment in the history of the city that began back in the time of Peter I. </p><h2>  Where is it located and what else is there? </h2><p>  Between Razin Street and Revolution Avenue is Petrovsky Square (Voronezh).  The address of its location is as follows: VLKSM 20th Anniversary Street, Building 54A. </p><p>  In 2006, a beautiful Passage hotel was built near this park, regarding the appearance of which the opinions of the townspeople were divided.  Many believe that this modern complex does not particularly fit into the architecture of the square.  Local historians are confident that the new building now suppresses the scale of this historic corner of Voronezh, which nowadays has become only a backdrop for the hotel.  But not everyone thinks so.  The remaining residents of the city are sure that the construction of the Passage only introduced some novelty to this place and made its appearance modern, as well as the building fits in very well with the park‚Äôs architecture. </p>

    <p>  As recent sociological surveys conducted among residents of Voronezh have shown, the overwhelming majority of citizens consider Petrovsky Square and the monument to Peter I standing in it unofficial symbols of the city.  Their photographs adorn many albums and books telling about the history of this region.  In this place you can touch the past of Russia and enjoy a pleasant walk at any time of the year. </p>
