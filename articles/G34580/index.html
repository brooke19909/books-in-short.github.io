    <p>  If you are making a parking lot, then you need to draw up places for cars on its roof and, of course, make a convenient exit for them.  Children love to ride cars on hills, so that an externally attached strip of cardboard glued to one side of the garage can easily play this role. </p><p>  You can improve the parking by making curbs or garage doors, as well as beautifully painted it.  It is interesting to glue the box with colored paper, or you can paint with markers or gouache paints. </p><h2>  Big fire truck </h2><p>  To make such a specialized machine, you need to pick up a box of corrugated cardboard.  It should not be too thin and high, because the truck is a package turned upside down.  Before you make a typewriter out of cardboard, you need to carefully glue the sides together with tape so that the slot is not visible. </p><p>  Then you need to cut a hole on top so that the hero-fireman could be put in the car.  The wheels can be cut out of another box and just stick them on the bottom of the car.  If you want to make them spinning, then you need to figure out what they will be installed on.  You can use wooden round sticks from flags, for example. </p>

    <p>  It remains to colorfully paint all sides of the fire truck, embellishing them with small details: a ladder, headlights, a windshield, white stripes, you can write a phone number for calling the fire service.  It is often written on such cars. </p><p>  Do not forget to use lights to make lights.  To do this, use strips of yellow paper, rolled up by cylinders. </p><h2>  Floor machine for a child </h2><p>  Children are very fond of all sorts of large containers - boxes, barrels, even cabinets, where you can hide or just fit in.  Therefore, before making a cardboard machine for the child himself, you need to check whether he fits there, think about where the baby can stretch his legs, so that it is convenient. </p><p>  One box can not do, you will need at least two, and preferably three, as in the photo below.  The trunk and the hood of the car make them two whole boxes, pasting them with adhesive tape.  But the middle part will have to work hard.  If the child does not fit in the center of the car, he has nowhere to put his legs, then you will need to cut one side of the box from the middle and also the side of the hood adjacent to it.  Then the child, sitting in the center of the structure, can stretch his legs into the space of the first box. </p>

    <p>  The windshield of the convertible is cut out of the sash, making a rectangular hole in it.  Wheels and headlights can simply be glued to the skeleton. </p><p>  As you can see, doing such interesting crafts with your own hands is not difficult at all, and the baby‚Äôs joy will be endless.  The main thing is not to be lazy and want to bring joy to the child. </p>
