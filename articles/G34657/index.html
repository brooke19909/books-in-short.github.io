Prior to this, there was a Russian fortification, founded in 1837, which lasted until 1854.  Next to it was the Abkhazian settlement, known since the Middle Ages.  Prior to joining the Russian Empire, these lands were owned by princes who traded with the Turks sailing here on ships.  The Turks called this place Arta, which later became Adler.  In 1910, a park was founded here, now called the Southern Cultures.
