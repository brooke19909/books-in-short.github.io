However, its exclusivity is not limited to this.  The history of this building includes several centuries of construction. </p><h2>  Cathedral Status </h2><p>  The medieval Ulm Cathedral was founded in 1377.  It was conceived as a Catholic church, but when the Reformation began in Europe, the construction passed to the Lutherans.  The main construction ended in 1382 when the building was consecrated.  Since that time, services have been continuously going on in it. </p><p>  The church is called the cathedral, but in fact this is not so.  A similar status is given to a building if it has a bishop's residence.  But in the case of Ulm, the local high priest lives in Stuttgart.  This contradiction arose in the Middle Ages.  Nevertheless, Ulm Cathedral is still called that way thanks to the colossal dimensions that amaze the imagination. </p>

    <h2>  Reason for building </h2><p>  Interestingly, the Ulm Cathedral was built because there was no working church inside the city walls.  The only temple was outside the defenses. </p><p>  This meant that during the siege, residents could not get into the church.  Such cases were not uncommon because medieval Germany often became a theater of operations.  For example, in 1376 Ulm besieged the Czech king Charles IV, who at the same time was also the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To avoid such situations, when the surrounded citizens could not pray in the right place, the Ulm Cathedral was built in Germany.  In addition, residents often clashed with the nearest Reinehau monastery.  It was he who owned the church, located on a posad. </p><p>  Despite the fact that only ten thousand people lived in Ulm in the fourteenth century, a successful campaign was organized to raise funds for the construction of a new cathedral.  As mentioned above, the bookmark occurred in 1377. </p>

    <h2>  Initial project </h2><p>  Since the construction was grandiose, it was decided to implement it in two stages.  The first architect of the cathedral was Heinrich Parler.  He became the author of the project, according to which it was planned to build a church with two identical naves, as well as several towers.  However, Parler managed to build only the lower part of the structure.  This was the future Ulm Cathedral.  The history of its construction is characterized by duration and numerous delays.  So, for example, in the first 150 years since the laying of the cathedral, 6 architects were replaced.  Someone refused to build because of the complexity of the project.  Others simply died of old age, and not waiting for the end of work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The difficult fate of the cathedral </h2><p>  Due to the change of architects, the original construction plan also changed.  He had a third nave.  Also in the XVI century, it was decided to erect a tall tower, which was supposed to become a bell tower.  This part of the cathedral is the highest, reaching 161 meters. </p><p>  The construction of the temple was prevented by the religious wars that began in Germany in modern times.  Many inhabitants of the country were dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and its orders.  The theologian Martin Luther, whose last name is today called one of the trends in Protestantism, became the exponent of these sentiments.  The conflict turned into bloody wars, the most famous of which is the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648). </p><p>  Due to lack of money and tense situation in the country, Ulm Cathedral remained unfinished for more than three hundred years.  The height of its tower in the XVI century reached 100 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Completion of construction </h2><p>  The second, final stage of construction began in 1844.  Measures were taken to strengthen the supporting structures.  The side naves could not withstand the weight of the entire building, because from the very beginning they were not designed for such a burden.  Nevertheless, preparatory work was carried out successfully, and in 1880 the construction of the western tower began. </p><p>  It lasted another ten years.  In 1890, a cross was erected on the highest spire, which is there now.  This symbolic ceremony marked the end of many years of construction.  So the Ulm Cathedral was built.  The architecture of the building belongs to the <span>Gothic style.</span>  He went to the church since the Middle Ages, when a similar aesthetic was common in Western Europe.  In the 19th century, it was already a rudiment, but it was precisely such exclusivity that helped the cathedral to acquire its own world-famous image. </p><p>  In 1890, Germany was already united around the Prussian kingdom.  The opening of the huge church has become a nationwide holiday.  Ulm Cathedral, a description of which is in every guide to Germany, is now a welcome place for tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral features </h2><p>  Before benches and other interior elements were installed in it, the building could accommodate about twenty thousand people.  The length of the cathedral is 123 meters, width - 49 meters.  The construction consists of three naves: one central and two side.  The main part of the temple has a height of 41 meters.  Two side naves are two times lower. </p><p>  The artists responsible for decorating the cathedral left behind numerous paintings on biblical motifs.  The main composition is a scene depicting the creation of the world.  There are also plots from the Gospel, for example, the Passion of Christ. </p><p>  The columns, which are the foundation of the entire building, are decorated with bas-reliefs of saints and apostles.  There are various sculptures inside the naves.  The general attention of visitors is attracted by the statue of Christ, which was created back in the 15th century. </p><p>  Thus, the efforts of many generations have come together in Ulm Cathedral.  There are testimonies and monuments of various eras - from the distant Middle Ages to the present. </p>
