Reviews about the rest in his hotels, located on the coast of the Riviera of the Red Sea, flood all the tourist portals. </p><p>  A wide choice of leisure tours for the city guests is provided by 314 hotels (statistics taken from the annual <span>rating of</span> Egypt <span>hotels</span> - 2015).  Most of them are five-star, however, there are four- and three-star. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novotel sharm el sheikh beach 5" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705956.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Egyptian resort business is good in that you can have a good rest here for a fairly affordable price. </p><p>  Pricing principles are known.  Roughly speaking, in most cases, the standard price of the tour is structured: it consists of 70% of the payment for hotel services, 30% of the funds paid by you is the price of the flight.  Accordingly, speaking the language of an accountant, air travel is presented as an <span>overhead cost,</span> and the longer your stay in the Land of the Pharaohs, the more average each day (taking into account the reduction in the share of these invoices), cheaper. </p><p>  In addition, the purchase of "hot tours" promises significant price benefits. </p><p>  In this review article, while talking about the Novotel hotel, we will also pay attention to hotel complexes of other travel companies of different price categories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Five star hotel in the heart of Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  The Novotel Sharm el Sheikh Beach 5 * hotel is a desired place for many tourists.  Italians love him the most.  So if you have the opportunity to purchase a tour to stay in it, and even in the period from June to September, do not refuse!  On the facade of this medium-sized hotel complex with a room fund of 197 rooms, five stars deservedly flaunts.  It really meets the highest evaluation criteria: based on the quantity and quality of the services provided, judging by the comfort in the client rooms, as well as the sophistication and aesthetics of the interiors and landscape designs (by the way, all the photos in this article illustrate it exclusively). </p><p>  It offers visitors - two pools, three restaurants, two cafes, a bar.  As part of the all inclusive, guests use the services of a hammam, jacuzzi, gym.  They are also provided with a range of paid services: massage, beauty services, diving schools, windsurfing schools. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As it should be for a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù five-star hotel, Novotel Sharm el Sheikh Beach 5 * is located not only in the first line (according to holidaymakers themselves, left the hotel - and here it is: the Red Sea), but also in the heart of Sharm El Sheikh, near the city of Naama Bay, unofficially called "Egyptian Las Vegas."  The carefree and vibrant club life here allows vacationers to ‚Äúshake themselves up‚Äù and relieve stress accumulated at work.  Naama Bay is also a center of elite trading establishments, supermarkets, restaurants, casinos, diving clubs, sports arenas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the bright, sparkling, like champagne, local resort life is not the only pastime for guests of the Novotel Sharm el Sheikh Beach 5 * hotel.  The local sandy beaches are the subject of admiration even for spa professionals.  Few places on Earth have such beauty!  <span>Sandy beaches, sandy</span> bottom and ... magnificent corals.  They really are the ‚Äúworks of art" of beach architects.  Comfort and beauty brought together. </p><h2>  Staff "Novotel" </h2><p>  Vacationers in the hotel complex Novotel Sharm el Sheikh Beach 5 * note the high qualification, helpfulness and courtesy of the staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="savoy sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="196" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705957.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is obvious that, in addition to exemplary management, only special education and training can lead to such performance indicators.  And indeed it is.  Indeed, according to international requirements, employees of the "five-star", occupying key positions, are really required to have certain knowledge and speak the necessary foreign languages.  In the reviews of visitors to the hotel complex, the contact and competence of Novotel employees are often noted.

    <h2>  About another hotel of the same chain </h2><p>  In Egypt, it often happens that completely different hotels belonging to the same chain have similar names.  It happens that such hotel complexes are even located within the same resort.  In particular, in the resort of Sharm El Sheikh there is another five-star hotel with the similar name Novotel Beach 5 *.  Moreover, if we ignore the level of comfort, "stardom", location in the first line, we will find a striking difference.  The second hotel is quieter.  It is not in the heart of ‚ÄúArab Las Vegas,‚Äù but in the middle of Ras Mohamed National Park.  Moreover, on the other side of the hotel rise the Sinai Mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So if the first hotel is more suitable for hanging out, then the second is for meditation. </p><p>  The catering services in these two hotel complexes are also different.  If in the first practice the principle of all inclusive, then in the second they use a more diverse formula for the choice of the visitor: BB (breakfast only), HB (breakfast and dinner), FB (three meals a day) </p><p>  Here, in the middle of a fantastically landscaped area with exotic trees and manicured lawns, in addition to an outdoor pool, there is also a wonderful spa center.  By the way, he is considered one of the most remarkable on the coast of Sharm El Sheikh. </p><p>  400 meters from the Novotel Beach 5 * hotel there is a beach belonging to it.  It is sandy, spacious, well equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  For the convenience of holidaymakers who want to enjoy the sight of the underwater coral kingdom, a special pontoon has been laid to the nearest reef. </p><p>  Also in this hotel, as an active vacation for clients, they practice not water sports, but yoga, fitness, dancing. </p><h2>  Leadership Principles of Novotel Hotels </h2><p>  By the way, many experts consider Novotel Sharm el Sheikh hotels to be the best on the coast.  And this is not an unfounded statement.  Firstly, there the staff does not take bribes.  At all.  Obviously, people value the workplace.  Even the uniform of the staff‚Äôs clothes is unique: it is exclusively snow-white and ironed ‚Äúfrom the needle‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kahramana hotel sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705959.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Novotel hotels are constantly replacing worn-out furniture and fixtures.  Here - active management, managers do not allow either moral or physical deterioration in principle! </p><p>  In addition, it is striking that in Novotel nightly concerts and shows for vacationers are organized.  This creates <span>a novelty effect.</span>  Celebrities are often invited to these concerts. </p><p>  We must pay tribute to the specialists working in this company. </p><h2>  Five-star lottery "Savoy".  Gourmet paradise </h2><p>  However, hearing such dithyrambs by the Novotel chain of hotels managed by Accor Group, it might be that those readers who had a chance to relax in another Sharm El Sheikh hotel in the Sharks Bay area would be outraged. </p><p>  This is another five-star rating - Savoy Sharm el Sheikh.  In terms of its number of rooms, it is almost twice as large as the hotel complexes we have previously mentioned - it has 477 rooms. </p><p>  Guests of the Savoy Hotel live in several buildings: 4-story (mostly) and seven 2-3-story (bungalows). </p><p>  A relaxation area by the three pools is comfortably equipped.  All of them differ in water temperature and depth.  Around them - in a fair amount of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Helpful waiters take orders from people right on the pool terrace.  In short, you can temporarily feel like a Roman patrician. </p><p>  The designers created a truly romantic atmosphere here: verandas with sofas, a luxurious garden.  However, the gourmets are most admired by Savoy Sharm el Sheikh.  Agree, not so often within one hotel operates 9 restaurants.  And although tourists traveling to the coast of the Red Sea, for the most part, "do not make a cult of food" (still the underwater coral exotic plays the first violin), however, if something is somewhere close to perfection, then this is about should speak.  Therefore, we will continue the story of the restaurants of the Savoy 5 * hotel.  Among them stands out the main restaurant "Tirana" with an extensive buffet.  The food there is tasty and nutritious as part of an all inclusaive: a lot of meat, fish, vegetables.  The assortment of fruits, sweets, juices.  Other restaurants - a la carte (served by order).  Of these, we recommend visiting - Chinese and Indian.  Exotic restaurant "Caligula", here you will find the most unexpected grill: meat on the stone.  Perhaps this was prepared several millennia ago. </p><h2>  Hotel "Concord".  Zest: infinity pool </h2><p>  Another five-star rating hotel, famous in Sharm el-Sheikh, is Concorde Sharm el Sheikh 5 *.  The first-line hotel complex is an adornment of the Soho Sharm-El-Sheikh district.  Of the 406 rooms of the hotel, 288 are double ‚Äústandards‚Äù with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novotel beach" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705960.jpg" width="600"></div>  Visitors to this hotel complex in their reviews highly appreciate the infinity pool, made in the form of a picturesque lagoon, which directly overlooks the Red Sea.  Thus, spa guests aesthetically enjoy the so-called infinity effect.

    <p>  This hotel is also called the "sports arena" for the opportunities it offers for active recreation.  We will not once again list in this article even the entire nomenclature of sports fields and clubs presented by the hotel, which is repeated in other ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù ones.  Just let us know that there is the only ice rink on the entire coast and a full-fledged modern football field.  It is not surprising that in the sports press this hotel is touted as No. 1 in Sharm El Sheikh. </p><h2>  Hotel "Dessole" (former - "Pyramid").  Mini city </h2><p>  However, there are among holidaymakers and those who adore everything global, textured.  Such people, accordingly, will want to buy a tour not just to a five-star hotel, but to a large five-star.  What can be reserved for them in the resort of Sharm El Sheikh?  Definitely - they can recommend the Pyramisa Sharm el Sheikh Resort 5 * hotel, in which there are 861 rooms!  The guests live in nine two-story buildings, thirty two-story bungalows and 40 two-story villas. </p><p>  However, although this is a well-known name in the resort business, however, it is already outdated.  Such is the dynamics and dialectics of development!  Today this hotel complex is called differently - Dessole Sharm el Sheikh 5 *.  However, both names are found on the Internet and in tourist guides.  "Why?"  - you ask.  The answer is simple to the extreme: "Well, do not miss the customers!" </p><p>  Visitors are served by five restaurants, six bars.  There are 3 outdoor pools on site and one indoor. </p><p>  The impressive length of the hotel beach is one kilometer.  It is divided into three parts: with a sandy bottom and a smooth approach, with the entrance to the water using a pontoon, with the entrance to the water along a concrete underwater path. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the former hotel Pyramisa Sharm el Sheikh (let us call the hotel the old way) is felt in scope.  In fact, it is a mini-city with its own infrastructure.  There is an ATM, pharmacy, shops, a hairdresser.  The conference rooms of the hotel allow solving business issues; they are equipped no worse than modern offices.  A wide selection of services: hammam, sauna, beauty salon, massage.  Car rental is available, its own parking is equipped.  One of the pools is equipped with <span>water slides:</span> adult and for children.  A whole range of sports fields has been equipped, and sports equipment rental is also available. </p><h2>  Hotel "Kahramana".  Ideal for youth </h2><p>  Well, what about the holidaymakers who are not financially pulling at a five-star hotel?  For example, youth.  After all, I want to hang out in the world-famous Naama Bay clubs (Little Buddha, Planet Hollywood, Hardrock Cafe) and the budget is running out. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novotel sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="194" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705961.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, there is a solution, since the Sharm el-Sheikh resort business is famous for its rating hotels in all price categories.  Among the four-star hotel complexes also have their flagships.  For example, Kahramana Hotel Sharm el Sheikh 4 * is an average second-line hotel with 118 rooms.  To the beach to go close - 150 meters.  The beach is well maintained, sandy, there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.

    <p>  How is he good?  Location.  Half of the above clubs are a five-minute walk away.  Around - a fair amount of fish restaurants, pizzerias, hookah cafes.  Interesting trinkets for sale in souvenir shops. </p><p>  There is a duty free shop nearby.  However, we will direct you immediately: you are allowed to buy in it only for 24 hours upon arrival.  Therefore, it is better to decide on purchases in it immediately. </p><p>  According to tourists, this hotel complex is not without some drawbacks.  Kahramana Hotel Sharm el Sheikh 4 * is unlikely to be suitable as a guesthouse for families with children and for older couples.  The menu of the hotel restaurant rather resembles the menu of a three-star hotel.  The hotel area is quite compact, there is a swimming pool.  The rooms have no balconies.  It is noisy in the evenings.  The surrounding neighborhoods are characterized by a specific ‚Äúparty spirit‚Äù.  For some, these shortcomings are critical; for some, they are compensated by the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù: the sea, nightlife, and excursions. </p><p>  In short, this hotel can be recommended for youth recreation. </p><h2>  "Park Inn".  Waterpark Hotel </h2><p>  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äú four-star ‚Äùis suitable for a relaxing family vacation?‚Äù  - Some readers will ask.  We recommend them Park Inn by Radisson Sharm El Sheikh Resort 4 *.  This is a cozy, quiet hotel of the second line on the coast of Nabq Bay with a good children's infrastructure, guaranteeing a safe stay.  From here to the bustling Naama Bay - 24 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pyramisa sharm el sheikh resort" class="if" height="176" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705962.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The housing stock consists of one main two-story building and nine three-story buildings.  The hotel complex has about 400 rooms.  The infrastructure is developed.  We will not focus on what is in other hotel complexes, we will talk about the "highlight".  The hotel has 10 pools and 25 water slides!  The professional work of the mini-club is admirable.  Here, the organizers created a whole world for children.  In the reviews of visitors a lot of good is said about the animators. </p><p>  Regarding the beach, it can be said that hotel guests can easily use the beach of the neighboring Radisson Blu Resort hotel complex, which belongs to the same Radisson hotel chain.  Obviously, this was provided for in the project, because there are enough sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone, and the bars on the beach function well. </p><h2>  Hotel "Luna".  Quality budget vacation </h2><p>  However, for those who want to save money there is an even more budget option - the three-star hotel Luna Sharm el Sheikh.  Positive in his choice is a good location.  Close to the Old City, the entertainment complex "A Thousand and One Nights", Naama Bay, a water park. </p><p>  The hotel is small.  Its two-story buildings form a ring in the middle of which is a swimming pool.  It is better to relax here from June to September, since water heating in the pool is not provided.  In cold weather, he is simply idle.  The hotel area is compact, but landscaped very intricate and aesthetically pleasing. </p><p>  We recommend to settle on the second floor (there are balconies). </p><p>  The hotel rooms are quite comfortable, but the bathroom is a bonus: functional, convenient, spacious.  Cleaning is daily, thorough. </p><p>  The food from the hotel restaurant is hearty, tasty.  Main dishes - from beef, chicken, turkey, liver, fish.  Regularly - fresh cucumber salads and tomato.  Fruits: watermelons, dates and melons. </p><p>  Of course, the assortment is not as wide as in the five-star ones, but even the guests from Western Europe were completely satisfied with it. </p><p>  The hotel does not have its own beach.  Its guests use the services of the city beach, which is called Farsha.  The fare to it is 2 Egyptian pounds. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> Concluding our story, we hope that you have a definite impression of the Sharm el Sheikh resort.  Its hotels are connected into a single resort infrastructure.  She is alive (if I may say so), because she is constantly evolving.  In particular, the third generation of hotels is currently the most relevant.  Advantageous position - in the south of the Sinai Peninsula since ancient times, the role of the Gulf of Kings has been determined, <span>this is a crossroads</span> to Jerusalem. </p><p>  Fortunately, modern civilization has not spoiled these virgin lands.  The Red Sea, which the folk tradition has saved from commercial fishing, appears to tourists as a unique natural environment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharm el sheikh reviews" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/705963.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, the Sharm el Sheikh hotel complex can be called a ‚Äúcountry in the country,‚Äù because the mechanism of self-development, that is, feedback, has already been launched here.  The funds earned by the hotel infrastructure are invested in a significant proportion in the development of the hotel business itself. </p><p>  Note that in this article we reviewed only a few hotels of this "country".  Which one do you prefer?  Each for himself solves this issue, but many still choose the hotel Novotel Sharm el Sheikh Beach 5 *. </p><p>  Many holidaymakers prefer five-star hotels for holidays, designed to accommodate up to 400 customers. </p>
