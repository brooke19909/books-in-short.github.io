At the same time, everyone wants to save a little, buy a house with available money or with a surcharge by taking a loan.  And the less it will be, the more chances for citizens to live with dignity.  Therefore, the proposals for the sale of cottages at attractive prices are very tempting, not so much for dealers as for such ordinary families. </p><p>  In 2008, a new company entered the market under the name Stroyinvest (Tomsk).  It was quite difficult to find reviews at that time due to the fact that few people worked with this developer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buildinginvest tomsk reviews" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949198.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Realizable objects </h2><p>  First of all, the company was engaged in active advertising, as well as the implementation of large-scale projects that helped to establish themselves in the market.  In the Red Hill microdistrict, more than 6 hectares of land were developed and 64 standard cottages were built.  Implemented the construction company "Stroyinvest" (Tomsk).  Reviews on building quality are pretty good.  The houses are delivered on time, the quality of construction is excellent.  Therefore, the company is steadily increasing momentum and acquiring new customers. </p><h2>  Description of cottages in Krasnaya Gorka </h2><p>  It is not in vain that the specialists of the Stroyinvest company (Tomsk) decided to found the village here.  Customer reviews fully confirm the information that the developer had in advertising messages.  This village is located in one of the most beautiful and ecologically clean corners of the region, in the village of Kornilovo.  Access to the territory is limited, there is a centralized security, which adds to the attractiveness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buyers are interested not only in the quality of construction, but also in communication.

    <h2>  Full package of services </h2><p>  As a company offering a full package of services, the company Stroyinvest LLC (Tomsk) is positioning itself.  Customer reviews of cottages in Krasnaya Gorka note that the developer fully complies with all obligations.  Land for construction can be bought for cash or on credit, the price of the plot includes ready-made engineering infrastructure.  This is the road and electricity, water supply and project documentation for gas.  Gasification was expected in 2012.  The company offers excellent conditions that are very attractive to customers. </p><h2>  Company specialization </h2><p>  The general director of Stroyinvest LLC (Tomsk) talks about this in his blogs.  Customer reviews note that for all major transactions he is ready to meet in person, discussing all the details.  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork is at home with a rough finish.  However, other services may be provided at your request.  For example, you can invite a designer who will do any project for you.  We can say that the company provides a full package of services.  It is no longer necessary to go to several companies, everything can be done in one.  For better or worse, we will find out soon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ooo stroininvest tomsk reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949200.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is a project of a housing estate of the country type of economy class "Barvikha".  This is a large plot with a closed territory.  On its area there are 155 houses, ready to move in.  Moreover, even the water supply is provided by the developer.  The project already includes the use of pumps and a filtration system.  The price of each house includes a plot of 8 acres.  The project was successfully implemented, reviews emphasize the excellent work done.  Dozens of families are already spending summers in their dachas. </p><h2>  Below market prices </h2><p>  This is always somewhat alarming.  If the work is done efficiently and on time, then why reduce prices?  The company "Stroyinvest" (Tomsk) is characterized by extremely attractive price offers.  What's the catch?  The point is the economy.  The company does not purchase building materials, most of them supply their own careers.  In addition, to carry out work, its own <span>concrete-mortar unit is used.</span>  The workshop for the production of plastic windows is actively working.  The company is preparing to launch a new plant, which will provide an opportunity to provide even more opportunities for its customers. </p><p>  All this allows us to occupy a leading position in the region, which Stroyinvest LLC claims to be.  The construction company in Tomsk on Frunze, 103 Avenue, purchased a fleet of its own equipment, which allows you to perform work in accordance with the plan.  You do not need to have a special education to understand that own production can greatly reduce the cost of a meter of finished housing.  That is why you can see offers to buy suburban housing, costing from 20 thousand rubles per square meter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroyinvest company in Tomsk" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Future plans </h2><p>  The company offers its customers flexible conditions for the purchase of their homes.  When choosing housing in the area under construction, you just have to move into a new house and put everything in its place.  Everything else has already been completed by the developer.  You get a land plot and a warm, solid house, with high-quality, thermal decoration.  It includes plastic windows and plastered walls, as well as a finishing screed.  All communications are already failed. </p><p>  The CEO regularly shares his plans with potential buyers, apparently for promotional purposes.  He says that the necessary infrastructure will soon be created in the microdistricts.  The company provides street lighting and garbage collection.  That is, soon there will be all the conditions for the village to grow and develop, filled with new residents. </p><h2>  How to buy </h2><p>  Relatively recently, reviews about the work of Stroyinvest (Tomsk) were very attractive.  The woodland is a new microdistrict which she undertook to build up with cottages.  As in previous cases, an attractive advertising campaign was launched, which interested many.  The company offered its customers unique conditions that it was a sin not to use.  A new program has been launched that allows you to exchange your old apartment for a new suburban cottage.  In this case, you will live in peace in your apartment until the construction is completed.  In addition, the buyer offered installment payment terms of up to 10 years without involving banks.  This allows a person to become the owner of real estate on very favorable terms.  And finally, customers have the opportunity to take a loan on any terms that banks can offer him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroyinvest Tomsk" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Personal account on the site </h2><p>  Construction is not the fastest business, and each buyer wants to constantly know how things are going.  Therefore, upon signing the contract, each client gets access to his personal account.  Here you can read reviews about the work of "Stroyinvest" (Tomsk).  The forest massif of many buyers was interested in its location and excellent ecology, so there were many who wanted to.  In addition, in your personal account you can ask a question about construction, make suggestions and suggestions.  The employees are obliged to give answers to all questions within 12 hours. </p><h2>  Construction dragged on </h2><p>  To date, the situation with reviews has changed a lot.  Buyers and those who invested their money in construction, that is, paid the full cost of their housing, had questions.  To date, more than 30 people have contacted the police with a request to check and evaluate the activities of the company.  People are sure that they were deceived.  A few concrete boxes in the middle of an endless field, that's all there is in the Lesnoy massif microdistrict.  Stroyinvest (Tomsk), reviews of which were quite good, does not comment on what is happening.  Instead, the manager stopped answering phone calls, and the company‚Äôs website no longer works.  According to the project, 172 houses were supposed to appear in the microdistrict, but today there are none. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroyinvest Tomsk Employee Reviews" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customer bewilderment </h2><p>  Everyone has a different situation.  Someone has invested a large sum of 500 thousand rubles or more in the construction of a future cottage, and now they cannot understand what will happen to his future housing.  No one explains anything, the director of the company has to look.  Other buyers used the attractive program of changing their old apartment to a new house.  To do this, under the terms of the contract, they re-registered housing for company employees.  Now they are being evicted, in return the company offers unfinished houses of other owners. </p><p>  This situation has already become familiar, although it sounds absurd.  A dissatisfied buyer contacts the director of the company and makes his claims, and he offers him one of the other houses as an ‚Äúapology‚Äù.  But describing the situation on the forum, he is surprised to learn that the housing at this address belongs to another person.  Is Stroyinvest bankrupt (Tomsk)?  The reviews do not yet give an exact answer, but the situation is very complicated. </p><h2>  Certification of leadership </h2><p>  Today it is difficult to believe that owners will be able to get their money or housing back.  But on thematic sites, the reviews are negative.  They are building Stroyinvest (Tomsk) not bad, but fraud is evident here.  Journalists can‚Äôt catch the director of the company at the office of the company, but the managers say that all the documents are in order and there will be no problems.  The manager is available only by phone, and he says that the company was set up by a former employee.  It was he who carried out dishonest transactions and deceived people.  Today he is already fired.  The developer admits that it does not meet the deadlines, but writes it off to the crisis and promises to fulfill its obligations to each client. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stroinvest tomsk company reviews" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1949204.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  Stroyinvest (Tomsk) today is owed not only to its customers.  Employees, managers and ordinary builders quit due to the fact that for several months they do not receive wages.  And more and more often reviews began to appear that, taking money for building a house, the company is building the foundation, after which it begins to refer to a lack of funds and promising to complete the work.  Builders are also released "on vacation", promising to call later when there are funds.  As a result, no money, no home. </p><h2>  The problem came unnoticed </h2><p>  So far, we have only talked about how the construction site stood in the new village of Lesnoy massiv.  But the residents of Krasnaya Gorka in the village of Kornilovo were also hit.  People may lose their new homes because they were built too close to the gas pipeline.  Several dozen families have already built houses here, ordinary people who have invested in the construction of everything that they had.  In 2015, they received a notice that the housing was too close to the gas pipeline, which means that the houses should be demolished.  This is a gross violation of safety precautions.  116 areas intended for construction fall under the restricted area, but in some of them people have already built solid houses.  They saved up for many years, denied themselves much, and now they just have to leave. </p><p>  Is the builder to blame, in this case, Stroyinvest?  Most likely not, because someone issued him a building permit.  But today no one is going to be responsible for what happened.  And people do not want to stay on the street at all.  There is no final decision yet. </p><h2>  Leadership delayed </h2><p>  To date, the head of Stroyinvest (Tomsk) has been detained.  It is almost useless to collect reviews about the company today, because while the director is in custody, he will not be able to repair the damage to his clients.  As it turned out, he has no property.  When the leader was detained for 2 months and handcuffed along the corridor, a whole crowd of people gathered in the courtroom.  All these are those who suffered from Stroyinvest and its employees. </p><p>  Among them are those people who bought the land and built a house in Kornilovo, and now it should be demolished.  They are left without a roof over their heads and without money.  But they have the opportunity to dismantle the house and at least partially return the investment.  Even worse for those who invested in building a house in the Forest.  They did not see anything, neither their home, nor the invested funds.  And how much it costs nerves. </p><h2>  Another story </h2><p>  Two pensioners who saved up money to move to Russia also turned to this developer.  We collected all the money, laid an apartment in Kazakhstan, borrowed it from relatives and went to place an order for construction.  And then the worst began.  At a personal meeting, the head of the Stroyinvest company said that there are no finished houses now, but he can sell the land and conclude a contract for the construction of the house.  Gradually filled out all the documents, executed the contract, paid the full amount.  And after that, the leader stopped picking up the phone and answering calls.  Arriving a year later, the pensioners saw that a second house was built on their site, and at a personal meeting the head of the company said that their contract of sale was terminated by a court decision and the house was sold to third parties.  So pensioners were left without anything, with debts and loans, with a pension that goes for regular trips to Russia and notary services. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Making a construction contract seems like a very good offer.  For the price of an old apartment, you can become the owner of a real, country house.  And of course, many people decide to take advantage of this offer.  However, you need to carefully choose the developer and collect feedback, carefully read the contract, and it is better to consult with a lawyer. </p>
