But over time, accumulating well-reasoned evidence, these assumptions became socially recognized truths.  And so there were theories on which all the scientific knowledge of mankind is based.  But what is the <span>meaning of the word theory?</span>  You will learn the answer to this question from our article. </p><h2>  Definition of a concept </h2><p>  There are many definitions of this term.  But those that are used by the scientific community are optimal.  Such definitions are taken as a basis. </p><p>  Theory is a certain system of representations in a given field of knowledge, which provides a holistic view of existing laws related to reality. </p>

    <p>  There is a more complex definition.  Theory is a complex of ideas, closed with respect to rational following.  Just such an abstract definition of the term ‚Äútheory‚Äù is given by logic.  From the standpoint of this science, any idea can be called a theory. </p><h2>  Typology of Scientific Theories </h2><p>  For a more accurate understanding of the essence of scientific theories, one should turn to their classification.  Methodologists and philosophers of science distinguish three main types of scientific theories.  Let's consider them separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Empirical theories </h2><p>  Empirical theories are traditionally considered the first type.  An example is Pavlov‚Äôs physiological theory, Darwin‚Äôs evolutionary theory, developmental theory, psychological and linguistic theories.  They are based on a huge mass of experimental facts and explain a certain group of phenomena. </p>

    <p>  Based on these phenomena, generalizations are formulated, and as a result, laws that become the basis on which the theory is built are formulated.  This is true for other types of theories.  But the empirical type theory is formulated as a result of a descriptive and generalized nature, without observing all logical rules. </p><h2>  Mathematical theories </h2><p>  Mathematical scientific theories make up the second type of theories in this classification.  Their characteristic feature is the use of mathematical apparatus and mathematical models.  In such theories, a special mathematical model is created, which is a kind of ideal object that can replace a real object with itself.  A striking example of this type are logical <span>theories, theories</span> of particle physics, control theory, and many others.  As a rule, they are based on the <span>axiomatic method.</span>  That is, on the derivation of the basic principles of the theory from several basic axioms.  Fundamental axioms must necessarily meet the criteria of objectivity and not contradict each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Deductive theoretical systems </h2><p>  The third type of scientific theories is deductive theoretical systems.  They appeared due to the task of rationally comprehending and substantiating mathematics.  The first deductive theory is considered to be the Euclidean geometry, which was built using the axiomatic <span>method.</span>  <span>Deductive</span> theories are built on the basis of the formulation of the main provisions and the subsequent inclusion in the theory of those statements that can be obtained as a result of logical conclusions from the initial positions.  All logical conclusions and tools that are used in theory are clearly fixed to form the evidence base. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, deductive theories are very general and abstract, so quite often the question arises of their interpretation.  A striking example is the theory of <span>natural law.</span>  This is a theory that does not lend itself to unambiguous assessment, and therefore it is interpreted differently. </p><h2>  Philosophy and scientific theory: how do they relate? </h2><p>  In <span>scientific knowledge, a</span> special, but at the same time specific role is assigned to philosophy.  It is said that scientists, formulating and comprehending certain theories, rise to the level of not only understanding a specific scientific problem, but also understanding of being and the very essence of knowledge.  And this, of course, is philosophy. </p>

    <p>  So the question is.  How does philosophy affect the construction of scientific theory?  The answer is quite simple, since these processes are inextricably linked.  Philosophy is present in scientific theory in the form of logical laws, methodology, in the form of a general picture of the world and its understanding, the scientist‚Äôs worldview and all fundamental scientific foundations.  In this context, philosophy is both the source and the ultimate goal of constructing most scientific theories.  Not even scientific, but organizational theories (for example, management theory) are not without a philosophical foundation. </p><h2>  Theory and experiment </h2><p>  The most important method of empirical confirmation of a theory is an experiment, which must necessarily include measurement and observation, as well as many other methods of influencing the studied object or group of objects. </p><p>  An experiment is a definite material impact on the studied object or on the conditions that surround it, which are carried out with the aim of further studying the given object.  A theory is what precedes an experiment. </p>

    <p>  In a scientific experiment, it is customary to distinguish several elements; </p><ul><li>  the ultimate goal of the experiment; </li><li>  object to be studied; </li><li>  conditions in which the facility is located; </li><li>  means for the behavior of the experiment; </li><li>  material impact on the studied object. </li></ul><p>  With each individual element, one can construct a classification of experiments.  According to this statement, it is possible to distinguish between physical, biological, chemical experiments, depending on the object on which it is conducted.  Experiments can also be classified according to the goals that are pursued during their implementation. </p><p>  The purpose of the experiment is to discover and comprehend some patterns or facts.  This type of experiment is called search.  The result of this experiment can be considered an extension of data on the studied object.  But in most cases, such an experiment is conducted to confirm a separate hypothesis or the basis of the theory.  This type of experiment is called verification.  As you know, a fairly clear line between these two species cannot be drawn.  One and the same experiment can be set in the framework of two types of experiment, or with the help of one you can find out the data that are characteristic of the other.  Modern science is based on these two principles. </p>

    <p>  An experiment is always a peculiar question to nature.  But he must always be meaningful and based on prior knowledge in order to get a worthy answer.  It is this knowledge that theory gives, it poses questions.  Initially, the theory exists in the form of abstract, idealized objects, and then there is a process of its verification for reliability. </p><p>  Thus, we examined the meaning of the word "theory", its typology, and related links with science and practice.  One can safely say that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. </p>
