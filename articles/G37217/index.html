    <h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  This beautiful tourist city is known almost all over the world.  From year to year he falls into the lists of the most respected publications.  He was recognized as the best in terms of living.  It is also listed in the Guinness Book of Records, thanks to the longest public beach. </p><p>  Virginia Beach (USA) is spread over an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 1288 square meters.  km  It is worth noting that half of this area is water.  The number of permanent residents in the city is slightly less than 500 thousand people.  Of these, about 15 thousand are employed in the tourism sector. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  The beginning of the history of this city can be considered April 16, 1607, when the former pirate, the Englishman Christopher Newport, sailed to the shores of the Chesapeake Bay in his three ships.  He was sent there specifically to form the first English settlements in the territory where the United States is now located.  But for a long time, Virginia Beach remained just a small settlement.  And only in the 19th century, with the advent of electricity and the railway, did this village develop into a large tourist resort.  By the way, he received the status of the city only in 1906 already after a huge avalanche of tourists poured there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin america" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1307308.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What awaits tourists? </h2><p>  For connoisseurs of European architectural art, a city in America may seem very boring and monotonous.  Of course, it was founded after the most famous palaces and cathedrals appeared in Europe.  But there is something to see here - parks and simply beautiful buildings that deserve the attention of any, even the most fastidious tourist. </p><p>  Virginia Beach Boardwalk is a very long city beach.  The main "local celebrity" is a statue of Neptune, which stands near the coast.  Tourists from all over the world are happy to take pictures against its background.  Neptune Park is also located there - a place of constant fun and celebration.  The beach itself is located far from the motorway, equipped with bike paths, which are separated from the coast by low bushes.  There are always a lot of people here, but because of the impressive size of the coast, it seems that the beach is almost empty.  Very conveniently built cafes and restaurants.  On the sites in front of them, music constantly sounds. </p><p>  A very interesting place is the Museum of Military Aviation.  Retired military men conduct excursions there.  Everyone who visits this place has an unforgettable experience of excellent collections.  Here are several aircraft since the First World War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="virginia beach time" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1307311.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First lighthouse </h2><p>  Cape Henry Lighthouse is the first lighthouse in US history.  <span>George Washington</span> gave the order for its construction in the 18th century.  In the XIX century, the lighthouse was destroyed, and then rebuilt again.  It is located on the territory of a military base, so it is not so easy to see it close.  You will need to show the military documents and pass a small test. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  No less interesting for a tourist will be the famous local water park - Ocean Breeze Waterpark.  There are always a lot of people there, since both locals and visitors are resting here. </p><p>  An extraordinary place is the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center.  Here, not only relax.  There is a scientific center on the territory where various studies are carried out. </p><p>  The city is simply saturated with a variety of infrastructure.  These are museums of modern art and <span>coast guard,</span> various <span>theme parks,</span> attractions, entertainment centers and unique restaurants and cafes with an atmosphere unique to them.  And here you can do surfing, boating, fishing in the ocean. </p><p>  Very serious companies, such as The North Seashore Park Trolley, are responsible for transporting passengers in and around the city.  The famous American railway company Amtrak provides rail transportation.  Thanks to this, the city in America is connected with all corners of the state, even the most distant. </p>
