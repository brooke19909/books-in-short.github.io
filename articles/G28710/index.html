    <p>  The Mongol-Tatar invasion of Russia is characterized as a bright period in the history of the Fatherland. </p><p>  In order to conquer new territories, Batu Khan decided to send his army to Russian lands. </p><p>  The Mongol-Tatar invasion of Russia began with the city of Torzhok.  For two weeks, the invaders led a siege.  In March 1238, the enemy took the city.  Having penetrated into Torzhok, the Mongol-Tatars began to kill its inhabitants.  They didn‚Äôt spare anyone, they ruined the elderly, children and women.  Those who managed to escape from the flaming city were overtaken by the khan's army along the northern road. </p><p>  The Mongol-Tatar invasion of Russia subjected to almost all cities the most severe defeat.  The Batu army fought continuous battles.  In the battles for the ruin of Russian territory, the Mongol Tatars were bloodless and weakened.  The conquest of the north-eastern Russian lands and the <span>Polovtsian steppes</span> took them a lot of energy <span>.</span> </p><p>  The battles on the territory of Russia did not allow Khan Batu to gather the necessary forces for further campaigns towards the West.  During their <span>conquests, the Mongols</span> met fierce resistance from the Russian and other peoples who inhabited the territory of the state. </p><p>  In history, it is often said that the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars in Russia protected the European peoples from the invasion of hordes.  For almost twenty years, Batu established and asserted his dominance on Russian soil.  This, mainly, prevented him from moving on with the same success. </p><p>  After a western campaign, which was very unsuccessful, <span>Khan Batu</span> founded a rather strong state on the southern Russian border.  He called him the Golden Horde.  After some time, Russian princes came to the khan for approval.  However, the recognition of its dependence on the conqueror did not mean complete conquest of land. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Mongol-Tatars failed to capture Pskov, Novgorod, Smolensk, Vitebsk.  The rulers of these cities opposed the recognition of dependence on the khan.  The southwestern territory of the country was relatively quickly restored from the invasion, where <span>Daniil Galitsky</span> (the prince of these lands) managed to crush the rebellions of the boyars and organized resistance to the invaders. </p><p>  Prince Andrei Yaroslavich, after the assassination of his father in Mongolia, received the Vladimir throne, made an attempt to openly oppose the Horde troops.  It should be noted that the annals do not contain information that he went to the khan to bow or sent gifts.  And the tribute by Prince Andrew was not paid in full.  In the fight against the invaders, Andrei Yaroslavich and Daniil Galitsky entered into an alliance. </p><p>  However, Prince Andrei did not find support among many princes of Russia.  Some even complained to Batu about him, after which the khan sent a strong army led by Nevruy against the ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù ruler.  The forces of Prince Andrew were defeated, and he himself fled to Pskov. </p><p>  Mongol officials visited the Russian land in 1257.  They came to make a census of the entire population, as well as to impose a heavy tribute on the whole people.  Only the clergy who received significant privileges from Batu were not rewritten.  This census was the beginning of the Mongol-Tatar yoke.  The oppressors of the conquerors continued until 1480. </p><p>  Of course, the Mongol-Tatar invasion of Russia, as well as the long yoke that followed it, caused great damage to the state in all areas, without exception. </p><p>  Constant pogroms, land devastation, robberies, heavy payments to the people of the khan hindered the development of the economy.  The Mongol-Tatar invasion of Russia and its consequences threw the country back several centuries ago in economic, social, and political development.  Before the conquest in the cities they proposed to destroy the <span>feudal system.</span>  After the invasion, the progressive tremors faded for a long time. </p>
