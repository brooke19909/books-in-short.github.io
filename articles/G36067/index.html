  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Applique of geometric shapes - fun with learning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If earlier children were taken to first grade without any training skills, today the first grader must first cross the school threshold with certain skills and knowledge.  And you need to start preparing the kid for study in advance, while he is still a preschooler.  Of course, it‚Äôs great if classes with kids take place in the form of games and entertainment. </p><p>  One way to familiarize yourself with the simplest geometric concepts in a playful way is to use an application of geometric shapes.  Such an interesting and fascinating lesson as geometric application, in addition to knowledge in mathematics, develops the child's practical skills in working with scissors, glue and paper.  And, as you know, the development of children's finger motility has a huge positive effect on the center of speech.  Also, the application of <span>geometric figures</span> helps to awaken the artistic and spatial perception of the world among the growing personality, teaches us to see the components in the complex, and the smaller in the large. </p><p>  The easiest way for very young people can be the lesson "Seedlings in the garden of flowers."  For a picture with a flowerbed, you may need yellow circles - for the middle of the flowers - and circles of different colors for the petals.  The number of one-color circles should be a multiple of 6. Flowers need to be ‚Äúplanted‚Äù on a <span>green</span> sheet <span>.</span>  You can even take velvet paper, because the grass should be fluffy.  In the manufacture of this work, the child develops the concept of color.  The child also learns that in one flower in nature, most often all the petals have the same color.  And the fairy tale ‚ÄúFlower - Semitsvetik‚Äù, told by adults during work, will brighten up the monotony and introduce the kid to the classic work of <span>children's literature.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For children 4-5 years old the application is quite simple, but interesting: ‚ÄúA house in the village‚Äù.  For her, rectangles and triangles are suitable.  It is best to use multi-colored blanks for applications in this composition: the rectangle of the wall of the house - one color, for example, blue, the rectangle and the triangle of the roof - the other, for example, red, and the rectangle of the pipe - the third, for example, yellow.  You can also prepare a window rectangle, for example, <span>pink,</span> and a door rectangle, for example, green. </p><p>  For more developed children, it is perfectly acceptable to propose that trees also be attached to the picture.  For deciduous, a long brown rectangle is suitable - the trunk and the green circle - the crown of the tree. </p><p>  And you can still make a Christmas tree!  Then you need to prepare also the trunk - a brown rectangle - and several green triangles of different sizes.  Green triangles will schematically depict rows of spruce branches.  They must be placed on the applique from the bottom up taking into account the reduction in the size of each next triangle.  Thus, the baby has the skill of comparing the size of the figures. </p><p>  Before the New Year, it‚Äôs a good idea to decorate such a Christmas tree with Christmas toys: colorful balls and garlands of flags - triangles and rectangles. </p><p>  The application of <span>geometric shapes for</span> older and more skilled <span>children</span> can be called ‚ÄúPiglet‚Äù and consist of three differently sized ovals of pink color, but slightly different shades, two triangles - ears and four sticks (rectangles) - legs.  One large oval will represent the body, the second smaller - the head, and the third, very small - a patch. </p><p>  First, we stick the torso on a clean sheet.  Then, inside the oval, depicting the torso, we position the head, moving the middle oval to the very edge of the large oval so that the delicate edges of the ovals coincide.  Piglet on the middle of the head.  Thus, we have obtained a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù of pink ovals, where each new, smaller, detail is stacked on top of the previous one. </p><p>  Next, attach the ears to the head, and the legs to the body.  At the very end of the work we draw nostrils, eyes and a tail with a felt-tip pen.  But for children for whom such an activity as an application from geometric figures is not a discovery, they can actually cut out eyes and nostrils from black paper for their piglet. </p><p>  By the way, when working with such applications, the method for the simplest sketchy drawing is subconsciously laid in the brain in children, which is also extremely important for its development. </p><p>  And how much joy and pleasure the children get when the real, albeit very simple, but already - works of art come out from under their hands! </p>
