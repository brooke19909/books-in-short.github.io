What sea is Vladivostok on?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vladivostok was founded as a military fort in 1860.  And he got his name from the imperial ambitions of tsarist Russia.  After all, it means "Own the East."  So Russia tried to strengthen its position on the Pacific coast.  But Vladivostok was prepared for a greater fate than just a military fort base.  Twenty years later, he receives the status of a city.  And in 1888 it became the center of the Primorsky region.  The city did not lose its strategic importance as part of the USSR.  In 1938, it becomes the <span>capital of the Primorsky Territory.</span>  The terminal station of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the fourth largest cargo flow port, the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet and the largest scientific center of the entire region, Vladivostok has not lost its significance today.  Since October 12, 2015, the city began to use a special regime of tax, customs and investment regulation.  In connection with the increased attention to this large port, the question becomes very urgent: "What is the sea in Vladivostok?"  The name of this water area and the features of its bays will be the topic of our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="In Vladivostok what sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Vladivostok located </h2><p>  The former military fort has now grown and stretched thirty kilometers from north to south and ten kilometers along the waters of Peter the Great Bay.  Modern Vladivostok occupies not only the Muravyov-Amursky peninsula on which it was once built.  In the waters of Peter the Great Bay, there are about fifty small land areas.  Among them, only six have an area of ​​more than a square kilometer.  These are the islands of Elena, Shkot, Rikord, Reineke, Popov and Russian.  The urban district includes not only them.  Vladivostok also captured the Peschany peninsula with the village of Beregovoye and the settlement of Trudovoye.  Now this is a large urban agglomerate.  It includes both an outstanding part of the land in the sea and the islands.  Let’s now take a look at the map of Vladivostok.  What is the sea there?  The map shows that from the west the city is washed by the Amursky Gulf, and from the east by the Ussuriysky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What sea in Vladivostok" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two water areas </h2><p>  The Muravyov Peninsula is the largest in the Primorsky Territory.  Its natural extension is the islands.  Closest to the shore is Russian.  This island is connected to the mainland by Velvet Street.  A chain of others separates Amur Bay from Ussuri.  In addition to them, there are many more bays in Vladivostok.  For example, the Golden Horn is the namesake of Istanbul.  A beautiful bridge is now thrown over it.  And there is Patroclus Bay in Vladivostok.  What sea washes the city?  That's the question.  Let's not keep the intrigue longer: Japanese.  But this name tells us little.  Its water area is huge, and in its various parts its own temperature regime is established.  Both bays, Amur and Ussuri, are part of one, larger - Peter the Great.  Let's consider them in order. </p><h2>  Amur Bay </h2><p>  Among the waters of the Primorsky Territory, this most deeply cuts into land.  The notorious <span>Golden Horn</span> Bay is part of the Amur Bay <span>.</span>  Its coastline is very indented, which served as a reason to compare it with the landmark of Istanbul.  The length of the Amur Bay is about sixty-five kilometers with a width of nine to twenty kilometers.  If we say what kind of sea in Vladivostok is in terms of recreation, then this water area is most suitable for swimming.  Amur Bay is smaller and warms up quickly.  But the salinity in it is lower than in the neighboring Ussuriysk, due to the exit of numerous rivers.  It is only twenty ppm.  On the eastern shore of the water area, the city of Vladivostok is adjoined by an extended resort area with sanatoriums, children's camps, boarding houses and recreation centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What sea washes Vladivostok" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009435.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its length is fifty-one kilometers.  The maximum depth is 67 m. From the higher water area in Vladivostok (which sea the city washes, we have already found out) it is separated by Mayachny capes on about.  Shkota and Sysoeva in the Shkotovsky region on the mainland.  This bay also has its own bays: Muravyinaya, Sukhodol, Andreeva.  Salinity in this area increases as it approaches the sea.  In kutovye bays, it is thirty ppm, although in Muravyino this figure is 34%.  Due to the depth, this part of Peter the Great Bay freezes only partially, off the northern shores.  There is also a resort area - on the west coast.  Despite the fact that the water here is colder than in the Amur Bay, it is here, in the <span>bay of Lazurnaya</span> (Shamora), that the most popular city beach is located.  So if you ask a local resident what sea is in Vladivostok, you will probably hear the answer - Ussuriysk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What sea is the name in Vladivostok" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Peter the Great Bay </h2><p>  This is a higher standing water area.  In addition to the Amur and Ussuri ones, it also includes other bays: Nakhodka, Vostok, Strelok, Posyeta.  In addition to the Eugenia archipelago, islands such as Two Brothers, Moiseev, Askold, Furugelm, Putyatin, and the Rimsky-Korsakov group are located in Peter the Great Bay.  This vast, nine thousand square kilometer water area begins from the line of Cape Povorotny and the mouth of the Tumannaya River, and ends in Vladivostok.  Which sea is the main one for Peter the Great Bay?  We have already talked about this - Japanese.  On the shores of Peter the Great Bay are the cities of Nakhodka, the port of Vostochny, Bolshoi Kamen, Fokino.  In winter, the open part of the water area is covered only by drifting ice.  Fast ice is formed in small bays.  The salinity of the bay is 33 ppm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladivostok what is the sea" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009436.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What sea washes Vladivostok </h2><p>  Now it's time to talk about the dominant waters of the entire region.  This is the Sea of ​​Japan.  It is part of the Pacific Ocean.  In different countries, the sea bears different names: in Japan - Nihonkai, in Korea - Tonhe.  This area of ​​origin is a deep-sea offshore depression.  Four straits are connected with the Pacific Ocean by the Sea of ​​Japan - Tsushima, Sangarsky, Laperuza and Nevelsky.  Thus, this is the inner water area.  It is separated from other <span>Pacific seas by</span> Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and the Japanese islands.  From the south, the warm <span>current of Kuroshio</span> enters it <span>.</span>  But the northern part of the water area completely or partially freezes.  This is observed primarily in Vladivostok.  What is the sea salinity?  This figure is thirty-four ppm, which is slightly lower than the oceans. </p>
