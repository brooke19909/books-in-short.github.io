Cybernetics has arisen at the junction of a large number of sciences.  It has its connections with a huge number of various disciplines: psychology, sociology, biology, computer science and so on.  We can say that cybernetics is <span>a science</span> that studies control systems. </p>

    <h2>  A little bit about systems </h2><p>  A system is an ordered set of elements between which some kind of interaction takes place and which is aimed at realizing a specific task.  The basic rule of systems is that none of them is a commonplace set of all elements.  An example is any system.  If the computer were a commonplace set of parts, it would simply not work. </p>

    <p>  A cybernetic is a specialist who studies computer as well.  Also in the sphere of his scientific interests include tasks that are performed by a computer.  Based on how effective it is, the possibilities for improving a particular system are evaluated.  The computer is a managed system.  This means that it can change under the influence of a person.  There are unmanaged systems, such as the Universe.  It is not within the scope of interest of cybernetics for the reason that it cannot be controlled by people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What do cybernetics do? </h2>

    <p>  A cybernetic is a scientist who is engaged in a whole range of diverse studies: </p><ul><li>  Artificial Intelligence. </li><li>  Human body. </li><li>  Complex information systems, such as computers and their networks. </li></ul><p>  Cybernetics is divided into many diverse industries, which are based on the connections between certain scientific disciplines.  For example, there is psychological <span>cybernetics, economic</span> or technical.  In general, there is a whole range of industries covered by cybernetics.  This is a very common science that is used everywhere.  Let's take a closer look at the branches of this discipline. </p>

    <h2>  Psychological cybernetics </h2><p>  Psychological cybernetics is <span>an industry whose</span> subject is in many respects similar to general psychology, as well as neurophysiology.  But this is another conversation.  This industry is studying the interaction between different analyzer systems and the exchange of information within the human brain.  Also, this science is engaged in the construction of realistic models of certain mental functions.  Let's look at them in more detail so that it is a little clearer: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Thinking.  Each person thinks in his own way.  By its nature, this mental process is a way of reflecting the surrounding reality by the human psyche, which is expressed in judgments, inferences, and concepts.  Each person has his own style of thinking specific to him.  Therefore, we can say that this style has certain characteristics, which cybernetics are trying to model. </li><li>  Memory.  Not all people can remember, as well as the mechanism of memorization for each person is individual.  At the same time, cybernetics are trying to identify some common properties and build realistic models on their basis that will help psychologists to interact more effectively with a person. </li><li>  Sensation is <span>a reflection of</span> reality, which is based on the direct impact of individual parts of the surrounding reality on our senses.  In order for a person to feel something, he needs to process information before that.  And these processing mechanisms are studied by psychological cybernetics. </li></ol><p>  Naturally, these are not all areas that are part of the range of interests of psychological cybernetics.  But these are enough to reveal this industry. </p><h2>  Economic cybernetics </h2><p>  Also quite often economic issues are studied by cybernetics.  <span>The meaning of the word "economic</span> cybernetics" is this: this area is trying to use the discovery of cybernetics in relation to a variety of economic systems.  Since the latter are generally manageable, the discipline in question is directly related to them. </p><p>  If we take a broader definition, then economic cybernetics is a science that was formed at the intersection of three sciences: mathematics, economics, and cybernetics itself.  And that is why it is valuable. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We figured out what cybernetics is.  The meaning of this word has become clear to us.  And that is wonderful.  There is no need to think now what the word "cybernetics" means, since some people may even have decided to devote their lives to this science after reading this article.  I would like to hope so.  A cybernetics scientist can be considered a universal specialist in any field.  After all, most of the areas of our lives are based on managed systems that are part of the study of this science.  Since it is becoming more and more popular every day, we can safely say: the future lies with artificial intelligence.  Cybernetics is a real all-rounder.  This is why it is valuable. </p>
