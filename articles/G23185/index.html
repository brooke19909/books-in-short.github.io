  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Information Modeling</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern information modeling uses a computer as its main tool.  The computer allows you to write any text, building a verbal model, draw diagrams and maps (a system of graphic models), build diagrams and tables.  But such a use of a computer during modeling will reveal its capabilities incompletely. </p><p>  The main advantage of computers compared to humans is the ability of the machine to quickly read and perform in one second a billion operations with a system of multi-digit numbers.  Therefore, computer information modeling has recently become increasingly popular. </p><p>  Any process taking place in technology, nature, social and economic systems can be described using complex mathematical relationships.  Scientists resorted to this even in ancient times, even before the advent of the computer, creating such formulas that could be calculated "on the fingers."  Therefore, information modeling in ancient times was relatively simple and often erroneous. </p><p>  With the advent of computers, this problem was solved.  Now it has become possible to quickly and easily carry out calculations of complex mathematical models.  Scientists today can not limit themselves when creating models, relying on their speed. </p><p>  Information modeling is a special way that implements calculations of the state of the system, taking into account the functioning of models in the present, past and future.  The most striking example of its use is the possibility of terminating nuclear tests, which lead to significant environmental damage.  Information modeling using powerful computers will make it possible to calculate and predict the possible consequences that will lead to changes in the design of <span>nuclear weapons.</span>  Therefore, it will be possible to "click on the detonator" inside the computer without destroying anything.  This was made possible by visualizing the possible results and thanks to the correct calculations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modeling of <span>information processes</span> involves the use of graphics.  It will allow during the experiment to "see" inaccessible points, places of this object. </p><p>  Let us dwell on the management features taking into account information modeling. </p><p>  It is used in order to carry out and control the operation of reactors in stations, factories, accelerators in laboratories, flight stations, and so on.  By controlling a laboratory or industrial installation, a computer will be able to calculate its first characteristics.  This is necessary in order to be able to take readings from each sensor on time, or to have the necessary effect on them: turn on the button, close the valve, and so on.  This will be possible in accordance with the <span>information models</span> embedded in the management program <span>.</span>  The only important thing is that the available calculation results when managing this process arrive in real time. </p><p>  We will tell more on simulation modeling, which is <br>  a special kind of information.  It is used in special cases.  Simulation is necessary when it comes to the behavior of a complex system whose elements behave randomly and whose movement cannot be predicted in advance.  Therefore, it is difficult to calculate its trajectory, but there is the possibility of "playing" on the computer screen. </p><p>  <span>Simulation modeling</span> is usually used when it comes to service systems: trade, car service, transportation systems, ambulance and so on.  The main task that is solved when using it is the search for their modes of operation, methods for receiving applications, and so on. </p>
