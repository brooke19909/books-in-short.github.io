Correct lighting becomes more important than the cost of it, since the productivity of the employee in the office or at the enterprise depends on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED downlight" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22758/1354087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most popular types of light sources is the laid on LED <span>ceiling lamp</span> .  Its main advantages are as follows: </p><ul><li>  ease of installation; </li><li>  the ability to install on the surface of any material (drywall, canvas, concrete); </li><li>  saving ceiling space; </li><li>  lack of overheating of material of false ceilings; </li><li>  the case often serves as an interior decoration. </li></ul><p>  LED luminaires for home ceiling overheads are spot, raster, such as chandeliers or ceiling lights. </p><h2>  LED lamp features </h2><p>  The durability of LEDs is the highest of all types of light sources.  At the same time, minimal energy is consumed, and the luminous flux is quite powerful and without flickering.  For LED lamps, the direction of the light flux is characteristic, although if necessary, diffusers can be installed.  At the same time, the efficiency is slightly reduced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The housing of each type of lamp is developed individually, since many nuances must be taken into account.  At the same time, manufacturers are trying to increase the reliability of the device and improve the quality of lighting.  In most cases, round <span>LED</span> overhead <span>lamps</span> are used.  They are cheaper to manufacture and suitable for rooms of any layout. </p><p>  Other simple geometric shapes are popular.  The overhead square LED ceiling lamp used to be used mostly in public buildings.  Now it is willingly installed in country houses or apartments.  Simple in shape models are primarily attractive at reasonable prices and the possibility of use in many interiors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="overhead light square led" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22758/1354225.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  The cost of LED lights </h2><p>  On the LED ceiling light, the price is much higher than other types of lamps.  Therefore, products should be purchased from trusted manufacturers.  The price depends on the power, as the number of LEDs increases.  So, a lamp of the ASD Group company costs 3.5 rubles for 3.5 W, and 473 rubles for 24 W.  It is also necessary to pay for enhanced functionality.  For example, a 32 W Hazard <span>dimmable LED lamp</span> costs 2345 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The advantage is the ability to choose a lighting source from a variety of options for price and performance.  Fairly decent in quality, the LED ceiling consignment note 600x600 by 36 W of Armstrong can be bought for 1490 rubles. </p><p>  Please note that products that are too cheap may be fake.  In most cases, they do not correspond to the declared indicators. </p><h2>  Spotlights </h2><p>  You can choose the right model for any room: living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom.  But compared with other types of lamps, most often they prefer to install LED spotlights.  Ceiling overhead models occupy a small space and do not "eat" the excess volume of the room. </p><p>  They are installed in several pieces next to each other or evenly distributed throughout the room, which makes the interior elegant. </p>

    <p>  Models of LED lamps are made both single and in sets.  Plafonds are rotatable, which allows you to adjust the direction of the light.  At the same time, they often make it so that the position of each bulb is regulated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To maintain the general style of the interior, there is a large selection of finishing materials for the manufacture of spotlights: plastic, metal, glass, crystal, etc. </p><p>  Advantages of spotlights: </p><ul><li>  compactness; </li><li>  ease of DIY installation; </li><li>  a large selection of decorative products; </li><li>  the ability to create lighting zones, the creation of light and color accents. </li></ul><p>  Usually it is recommended not to use LED lamps for main lighting due to their high cost, but this option is also possible. </p><h2>  Overhead chandelier </h2><p>  Ceiling lights are more popular than wall and floor lamps due to the fact that they can create more uniform and proper lighting.  The ceiling version is used mainly as the main lighting in almost all rooms.  But for residential, they often prefer a false chandelier in connection with the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  A wide variety of designs with one or more lamps. </li><li>  Easy installation with a few dowels or self-tapping screws.  Many models are equipped with special mounting structures. </li><li>  Use in any room with low ceilings, since the classic chandelier can not be hung in all apartments. </li><li>  Ability to choose from all price categories. </li></ol><p>  Overhead chandeliers with LEDs are used on stretch ceilings.  They produce little heat and are very beautiful.  Particularly different models of crystal, which with LED light sources create a decorative effect. </p><p>  The chandelier is always located in the center.  Along the perimeter of the room, lighting is added to it.  When choosing LED ceiling lights, round overheads are a classic option that is not conspicuous and easily matched to any interior.  They are suitable for any form of space, and in simple execution without frills are used in shopping centers, offices and public buildings. </p><h2>  Lampshades </h2>

    <p>  Plafonds differ from spotlights in a large size.  The lamp here may be one or more.  All of them are closed by one lampshade.  Plafonds are especially effective in rooms with a low ceiling when it is impossible to hang a chandelier.  This type of luminaire is easy to install and has a wide variety of designs.  Designers recommend installing devices with a metal case - they are durable, reliable and last a long time. </p><h2>  Raster overhead lights </h2><p>  LED overhead light is increasingly used in large offices and public places, where energy saving is important and intense lighting is required.  Raster modules are characterized by high light intensity and the presence of a reflector (white or mirror).  It can have a different form: parabolic, V-shaped, etc. </p><p>  LED luminaires for home ceiling overhead with a raster are also used, although less frequently.  They are well suited for large and tall rooms. </p><p>  Devices have more weight than other <span>types of luminaires.</span>  They require reinforced mounting.  One such light source is required for an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 m¬≤.  220V LED Overhead Ceiling Lights have built-in drivers for converting mains voltage.  Now many manufacturers are trying to create models for direct connection to a standard AC network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="220V LED Overhead Light" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1356027.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Lighting device </h2><p>  Each owner has his own personal preferences, where to place and which to choose a laid on LED ceiling lamp.  Despite this, it is important to consider the general rules, which are mandatory: </p><ol><li>  Comfortable lighting is provided when the power of the LED lamp is 2-4 W / m¬≤. </li><li>  The bedroom uses light fixtures with light diffusers. </li><li>  In the living room, combined options are used, where the main lighting must be, and the additional one allows you to highlight certain areas and interior elements. </li><li>  In the kitchen or in the dining room, in addition to the main lighting, two important zones are distinguished: the workplace and the eating place. </li><li>  Bright light is not needed in the hallway, and it‚Äôs enough to install several spotlights here. </li></ol><h2>  Selection of overhead lights </h2><p>  Small lamps with an attractive design are suitable for the apartment.  Office luminaires must comply with lighting standards, as this affects the productivity of workers.  In this case, the color temperature should not distort the natural look of the interior. </p><p>  In offices, they usually prefer to use strict forms of lamps, but the room should look comfortable.  Devices should be easy to install, and their locations should be changed as needed. </p><p>  With high room heights and other inaccessible places, problems often arise with replacing lamps.  It is better to use LED lights, because they are the most durable. </p><h2>  Installation of overhead spotlights </h2><p>  Lamps are sold with all accessories.  Devices consist of the following elements: </p><ul><li>  housing; </li><li>  mounting plate; </li><li>  lamp; </li><li>  terminals. </li></ul><p>  The installation sequence for plasterboard ceiling is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Pre-done wiring to the place of installation of the lamp.  The ends of the wires are pre-cleaned and isolated.  The machine for the lighting line in the shield and the power switch during installation should be turned off. </li><li>  A hole is cut out in the ceiling at the mark so that its size is blocked by the overhead lamp. </li><li>  The power cable is removed. </li><li>  A mounting bracket is mounted on the ceiling and ground is connected to it.  The power wires are connected through the <span>terminal block</span> .  In this case, color marking must be observed (blue - zero, white - phase, yellow-green - earth). </li><li>  The wires are neatly laid, and the lamp housing is fixed on the sides with screws to the mounting plate.  The method of mounting may be different. </li><li>  The lamp is installed.  It is sold separately from the lamp.  It is important that the base matches the cartridge. </li></ol><h2>  Installation of chandeliers on a false ceiling </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Downlight Spotlights" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1355971.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Heavy luminaires weighing more than 5 kg can be mounted directly to the suspended ceiling made of drywall or MDF panels.  Usually these are heavy powerful <span>office lights</span> and chandeliers.  The most reliable way is to hang the chandelier to the base of wood or concrete.  To do this, a mortgage element of wood is fixed in advance to the main ceiling, on which the mounting plate will be fixed in the future.  Holes are drilled in the bar and wires are passed to supply power. </p><p>  If a stretch ceiling is installed, thermal rings are glued onto it, inside of which holes are cut for connecting the chandelier. </p><p>  A mounting plate is screwed onto a wooden block with screws.  The chandelier is fixed on it with screws through the mounting holes. </p><p>  Note!  The height of the embedded element for the stretch ceiling should be at the level of the canvas.  If several holes are supposed to be made in the ceiling for attaching the strip and the output of wires, a separate o-ring should be prepared for each of them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Installation of the described fixtures on a suspended ceiling can be done with your own hands, having an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat construction and repair are.  The overhead <span>LED lamp</span> is especially simple and convenient to use <span>.</span>  It is important to carry out its installation according to the rules and not to forget about electrical safety. </p>
