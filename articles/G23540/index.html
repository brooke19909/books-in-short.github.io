    <h2>  Policy Results </h2><p>  <span>During the reforms of Stolypin (which had enough pros and cons), the country has seen an active growth in agricultural production, the volume of the domestic market has increased, and exports to agriculture have increased.</span>  <span>All these events not only brought agriculture out of the crisis, but also made it dominant in the Russian economy of that time.</span> </p><p>  <span>The resettlement of peasants in Siberia also contributed to economic growth.</span>  <span>Sown areas expanded, livestock developed.</span>  <span>By all significant indicators, Siberia was ahead of the European part of the Russian state.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Negative moments </h2><p>  <span>Despite success, Stolypin’s reforms could not solve all the problems that existed at that time.</span>  <span>Hunger and agrarian overpopulation did not stop.</span>  <span>The country, as before, was backward in terms of economy, technology and culture.</span>  <span>The pace of agricultural growth was slow when compared with the United States and European countries.</span> </p><p>  <span>An obstacle to economic development was the low level of literacy in agriculture.</span>  <span>The government provided the peasants with comprehensive assistance, raising their cultural and educational level.</span>  <span>Agricultural courses were created to help introduce progressive forms of production into the peasant environment.</span> </p><p>  <span>In the period under review (from 1906 to 1913), much was done to move to a new stage of economic development.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Analysis of activities </h2><p>  <span>So, if we talk about the results of Stolypin’s reforms, the pros and cons should be considered more carefully.</span>  <span>Among the advantages it is worth highlighting:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>The beginning of the destruction of the communal system.</span>  <span>A quarter of all households left the community.</span> </li><li>  <span>Increased grain yield during the period of transformation of 1906-1913.</span> </li><li>  <span>A 2-fold increase in agricultural exports.</span> </li><li>  <span>The development of the cooperative movement and small commodity relations.</span>  <span>A system of peasant lending appeared.</span>  <span>Artels, shops, agricultural societies were built.</span> </li><li>  <span>Relocation of 3 million families to Siberia.</span> </li><li>  <span>Industrial growth in the economy of those years.</span>  <span>The beginning of the formation of prosperous farms.</span> </li></ul><p>  <span>Speaking about the pros and cons of Stolypin's agrarian reform, it should be said about the disadvantages.</span>  <span>They can be considered the following points:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>A significant part of peasant farms remained in the community.</span> </li><li>  <span>Half a million migrants returned back and joined the ranks of workers, as well as beggars and tramps.</span> </li><li>  <span>The famine of 1911-1912, spanning 30 million people.</span> </li><li>  <span>As a result of changes in society, a new wave of discontent has arisen directed against former community members who managed to get rich.</span> </li><li>  <span>Land holdings owned by the landlords remained untouched.</span> </li></ul><p>  <span>Speaking generally about the results of Stolypin’s agrarian reform, the pros and cons, it should be noted that the politician’s desire to implement bourgeois relations in Russia did not give the expected result.</span> </p><p>  <span>Transformations were criticized.</span>  <span>The politician planned that the reforms will be carried out over 15-20 years.</span>  <span>But after the unexpected tragic death of Stolypin, they stopped and gradually came to naught.</span> </p>
