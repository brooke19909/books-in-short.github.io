    <p>  Air is one of the main components of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, without which a person simply cannot exist on the planet.  Indeed, without air, we will all perish, not only we, but all life on Earth.  In its <span>composition, air</span> is a natural mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and small inclusions of nitrogen.  For a long time it was believed that this is a homogeneous substance, that is, it is a single gas that is distributed throughout the planet.  However, on the example of numerous experiments, it was concluded that air is still a mixture of gases. </p><p>  The importance of air for all living things on the planet is very high, since not all of us react equally to this or that humidity.  Absolutely every body needs it to maintain vitality.  In industry, air also has a number of applications.  We know that the chemical formula of air has a fairly large amount of oxygen.  <span>Mechanical energy</span> in internal combustion engines, for example, is obtained by burning fuel using atmospheric oxygen.  But the laboratory method for producing <span>inert gases</span> is the process of liquefying air. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the gases that make up the air are capable of various forms of conversion, because the air formula, although it is a constant value, there are many factors that depend on the specific conditions of air being in a free state.  By raising or lowering the air temperature, gases can acquire not only a liquid, but even a solid state.  In specially equipped cryolabs, scientists conduct many experiments on the breakdown of oxygen into individual elements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Separated air gases are used in absolutely all areas of industrial activity.  Oxygen, nitrogen, argon, neon, xenon, krypton - without these components, many industrial sectors simply cannot carry out their core business.  The energy of <span>compressed air is</span> widely used in the field of <span>mechanical work.</span>  Air consumption, the formula of which has long been known in production, is small, so you can paint, inflate, rinse, wash, and still perform many actions with compressed air.  Shafts are ventilated with compressed air, it is used to start various pneumatic engines and create piston thrust.  This component is necessary, for example, to create the necessary pressure balance in the suit of divers.  And the air formula is not needed here at all, but the pressure of it is simply necessary to know. </p><p>  The formula of air is constant, but the quantitative composition is capable of changing.  Surely this is noticed by absolutely everyone.  It is enough to pay attention to the urban and natural environment.  In noisy settlements, the air is heavier, and in the modern world there is a serious problem with its pollution.  In nature or outside the city, the situation is changing dramatically.  The air here is clean and fresh unusual for urban residents. </p><p>  Absolutely every inhabitant of the planet should think about the problem of air pollution.  Nowadays, the construction of various factories that mercilessly pollute the environment is expanding significantly.  On the other hand, this problem is an incentive for the creation of environmentally friendly types of production.  For example, it is pronounced in the world of modern automotive industry.  Eco cars are increasingly appearing in the lineup of many manufacturers.  However, this is not enough to completely eliminate the negative effects of urbanization and industrialization of society.  Representatives of all industries should think about <span>protecting air from pollution</span> . </p>
