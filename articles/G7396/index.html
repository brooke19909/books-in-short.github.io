  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a tie for a child?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You have a growing son.  He is your joy and hope.  In order for an elegant man to grow out of him, you should teach your child to <span>classic clothes</span> from childhood <span>.</span>  Even babies look compelling in suits and ties.  Dressing your son in such clothes from childhood, you instill in him a certain manner of behavior and style.  With sewing skills, you can make a <span>children's costume</span> yourself.  And if there are problems with this?  Then make any decorative detail, for example a beautiful men's scarf.  Or learn how to sew a tie.  For such trifles, special skill is not necessary, and the son will be happy with the new thing.  You can be proud of the elegant look of your little man. </p><p>  Let's look at <span>how to sew a bow tie.</span>  Such a model is equally suitable for a child of 3 years and a young man.  Having mastered the sewing technique, you can sew a tie that fits every suit or shirt, without spending a lot of time and money. </p><p>  <strong>How to sew a tie for the smallest?</strong> </p><p>  In the manufacture of clothing, a young child should be guided by its practicality and convenience.  This approach is also necessary for the decorative details of the costume.  How to sew a tie so that the child is comfortable in it?  You must select the simplest model. </p><p>  We need a flap of beautiful fabric of small size, threads of a suitable color and elastic braid.  If our butterfly in finished form will have dimensions of 15x5 centimeters, then you should cut out a rectangle of 11x17 centimeters and the central part 6x7 centimeters.  The blank for the butterfly is folded in half with the wrong side up.  We get a part with dimensions 5.5x17 centimeters, on one side of which there is a fold, and on three sides - sections. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lay a line at a distance of 0.5 centimeters from the cut, leaving a small area in the middle unclosed.  We turn the part to the front side and straighten the corners.  Manually sew up the hole and iron the workpiece.  Fold the central part in half with the wrong side up and sew together, laying a line at a distance of 0.5 centimeters along a long cut.  We turn the part to the front side.  Iron in such a way that the seam is in the middle. </p><p>  Sew the resulting strip into a ring.  We put it on the workpiece and arrange it in the middle.  Beautifully spread decorative folds on a butterfly.  We fix the details with a few stitches on the back of the butterfly.  We measure the elastic braid of the required length.  It should be locked in a ring, freely located under the collar of the shirt.  Sew the ends of the braid and sew our butterfly at the junction.  Now you know how to sew a bow tie quickly and easily. </p><p>  For an older child, a more complex model can be made.  Use a separate piece in the form of a strip with a fastener at the back instead of elastic braid.  Its length should correspond to the circumference of the neck with an increase of a few centimeters for a loose fit. </p><p>  The butterfly itself can be made of two parts.  To do this, you need to carve out not one rectangle, but two.  The difference in the size of the workpieces should be no more than 1.5 centimeters.  In this case, the tie will look harmonious.  Using a black satin for the bottom part and a jumper, and a white satin for the top, you will get the most elegant and festive tie model. </p><p>  An example of imitation for a little man should be dad, grandfather or uncle.  Do not miss the moment in the development of the child when he tries to imitate adults in order to develop certain habits in choosing clothes.  If the kid is uncomfortable wearing a jacket or jacket, then use a white shirt, bow tie, classic-style trousers and a vest for a festive costume.  In this outfit, he will look very stylish. </p>
