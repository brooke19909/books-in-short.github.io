Many are accustomed to presenting them in special gift envelopes or simply giving them personally to the hero of the occasion. </p><p>  However, if you have free time and inspiration, you can make an original bouquet of real money.  Such a surprise will remain in the memory of the birthday man and will surely surprise others. </p><p>  The article will describe how to make a bouquet of money with your own hands, give basic recommendations that will help make this wonderful gift neat and stylish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of money master class" class="if uuid-2443879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50162/2443879.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is it worth giving a cash bouquet? </h2><p>  Not knowing what exactly a person wants as a gift, it is very difficult to buy something necessary and useful.  Often, donated items are sent to a shelf or in a closet and lie there unclaimed, but money is a present that will always come in handy for the hero of the occasion. </p><p>  Presenting simply banknotes is boring, so a self-made gift bouquet of money will allow you to present a present in a very original way.  Such a surprise will be remembered for a long time and will leave a storm of good and good emotions. </p><h2>  Key recommendations </h2><p>  Before you make a bouquet of money with your own hands, it is important to remember a few basic rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are making such a gift for the first time, and there is no practical experience yet, then it is best to make a trial version of souvenir notes.  So you can understand the technology of the process without fear that the money will go bad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.se.happypancake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of real money" class="if uuid-2443887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50162/2443887.jpg"></div><p>  If adhesive materials are used during the work (PVA, silicone or hot glue), they should be fixed in such a way that the appearance of the bill was not damaged.  It is also best to use souvenir money. </p><h2>  How to make a bouquet? </h2><p>  Making flowers out of notes is only one part of the story.  It is important to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat a bouquet of money will look like when you complete a job.  There are many techniques for designing artificial crafts, but you should focus on the following: </p><ol><li>  The standard design of a bouquet of money.  This method implies that the finished cash flowers will be wrapped in paper for packing fresh flowers, kraft paper or a special floral grid.  The advantages of this method are that a bouquet of money takes on a neat and finished look. </li><li>  The addition of cash flowers live or artificial.  Crafts look very harmonious, in which there are not only independently made money flowers, but also, for example, real roses, small peonies or decorative daisies.  However, if there are no fresh flowers at hand, you can make them, for example, from beads, satin ribbons or decorate a bouquet of money with artificial flowers. </li><li>  Dilution of a bouquet of sweets.  If there is a desire to make a completely non-standard gift, then you can dilute the craft with sweets, candies or small decorated gingerbread cookies.  However, in this case, it is worth remembering the basic rules of hygiene - a lot of bacteria and microbes accumulate on the money, so sweets must be separately packed. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of money master class" class="if uuid-2443893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50162/2443893.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  A simple bouquet of money - a master class </h2><p>  To make one flower you will need six to seven bills.  First you need to fold each bill in half.  Next, use a toothpick or a ballpoint pen to draw the corners so that they twist to the outside.  The same operation should be done with all other bills. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, you need to form a bud - the first bill is the center of the flower, the second and third are the middle, and the rest are extreme.  In order to make the flower magnificent, you should add money petals in a spiral, shifting each leaf by one or two centimeters from the previous one.  In the end, so that the bud does not fall apart, you need to tie it with a thin elastic band. </p><p>  After the flowers are prepared, proceed to the assembly of a bouquet of money.  The easiest way would be to take a <span>foam ball</span> and use the toothpicks to plant shaped flowers on it.  The volume of the ball depends on the size of the bouquet. </p><p>  In order to decorate the bouquet, add small living flowers, and at the very end, wrap the craft with floral paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="auswiel.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself money bouquet" class="if uuid-2443735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50162/2443735.jpg"></div><h2>  Candy money bouquet.  Master Class </h2><p>  A useful and tasty gift can please a child or an adult with a sweet tooth.  Any beginner needlewoman can make a surprise, as here is a very simple instruction.  A bouquet of money and sweets is formed from notes and sweets, for example, chewing gum, candies, sweets, packaging with sweet dragees.  It is best to choose sweets according to the color of the package, so that upon completion of the work the gift looks bright and harmonious. </p><p>  To begin with, you should prepare a vase or pot, polystyrene, long skewers and finishing materials.  Next, you need to fold the banknotes on the principle of a fan, iron the folds well, unfold and fasten them in the middle with a thin elastic band.  This way you get round cash flowers.  Next, flowers and sweets should be attached to the skewers, inserted into a foam placed in a vase or pot.  The foam should be well fixed to the bottom of the pot. </p><p>  Upon completion, the craft is decorated with corrugated paper to cover the foam and give the work a festive look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bunch of money" class="if uuid-2443800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50162/2443800.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Gifts that were made with their own hands always bring a lot of joy and happiness, because the things that were made by a man with love have their own unique energy.  A bunch of money will combine all the main components - financial well-being, love and beauty.  That is why such an original present is considered one of the best gift options. </p>
