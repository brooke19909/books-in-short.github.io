Taman is the land of three seas.  And the Salt Lake originates from the peninsula.  A pond is not an ordinary piece of the sea.  A large layer of healing silt was discovered here.  Moreover, its extraction does not greatly reduce the amount of therapeutic mud, since it is constantly restored by nature. </p><h2>  Lake history </h2><p>  On a map published in 1847 in Tiflis, the <span>Salt Lake</span> has not yet been plotted.  This confirms that at that time the reservoir as a separate object did not exist.  The lake was part of the Kuban estuary, which broke up into several small ones after a while.  In the period 1850-1912.  The salt lake separated from other reservoirs and became a separate object.  At first he was called Bugaz.  Then it was renamed Salty. </p>

    <h2>  Reservoir description </h2><p>  If you look from the watershed to the pond, then it seems great.  Salt Lake (Taman) has high banks, on which cereals and wormwood grow.  And only in one place is the pond open to the sea, but separated from it by bulk.  The water in the lake is framed by white breakers.  But they, if you approach the pond, are dazzlingly sparkling, clean, coarse crystalline crust of salt. </p><p>  The lake is small, with a length of only 1.5 kilometers and a width of 1000 m. And the maximum depth of the reservoir is only 10 centimeters.  The lake is fed with rare atmospheric precipitation and sea water rolling through a natural rampart during severe storms.  Therefore, in the summer, Salt Lake (Taman) dries up almost completely.  And salt accumulates in the remaining water: 400 g per liter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the years, a beautiful beach has formed on the embankment, the length of which is much further than the borders of a salt reservoir.  It consists of thin quartz sand with admixtures of pebbles and shells.  The beach is small - only 100 meters wide.  But its length is impressive - 40 kilometers.  The beach starts from the Salt Lake and ends only at Anapa. </p>

    <h2>  How did healing mud form? </h2><p>  Previously, there were crafts in the lake.  People collected salt, which remained after the evaporation of water.  But in 1952, such development of the lake ceased.  But the reservoir revealed to people its new properties.  Under the crust of salt was a large layer of mud.  This is black silt.  It is very flexible, and to the touch is greasy.  Sludge has a strong odor of hydrogen sulfide. </p><p>  When dirt gets into the air, it oxidizes and becomes gray.  But the sludge plunged into the lake turns black again.  In 1968, the mud was examined, it turned out that it contains a huge amount of hydrogen sulfide, bromine and iodine.  Moreover, clogging impurities in the sludge are completely absent.  Studies of mud have shown that it is therapeutic. </p><p>  Salt Lake (Taman) has been keeping healing silt for centuries.  It is formed from the remains of dead plants and animal organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake.  This is great food for bacteria.  They oxidize the residues with seawater.  And as a result, bacteria get vital energy.  Due to the reduction of sulfates, the composition of water changes.  A lot of hydrogen sulfide appears in it.  The mud of the lake lay at the bottom for centuries, forming healing mud.  All traces of tourists quickly drag out, and the pond continues to accumulate healing mud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The healing properties of the lake </h2><p>  Thanks to the therapeutic silt, which is located in the Salt Lake, many diseases can be treated: </p><ul><li>  joint pain </li><li>  oncological diseases; </li><li>  obesity; </li><li>  muscle dystrophy; </li><li>  problems with the nervous system; </li><li>  skin diseases; </li><li>  pathology of the musculoskeletal system; </li><li>  consequences of accidents and injuries; </li><li>  diseases of the male and female genital organs; </li><li>  pathology of the ears, throat, nose; </li><li>  thyroid disease. </li></ul><p>  There are no contraindications.  Treatment sludge is transported from the lake to many sanatoriums.  And it is effectively used to treat diseases.  The air of the lake is no less useful, as it contains a lot of hydrogen sulfide, salts and light ions. </p><p>  Vacationers, arriving at the Salt Lake, smear sore spots with healing mud.  But the procedure should not last longer than 20 minutes daily.  The result is visible after 10 days of regular mud baths.  Scratches and wounds heal even after a single application of dirt.  You can completely plunge with your whole body into the Salt Lake. </p><h2>  Taman: how to get to Salt Lake? </h2><p>  This pond is a unique natural hospital.  Therefore, they come here mainly in the summer - to try mud baths. <strong> </strong>  You can get to the Salt Lake only by your own car.  Public transport does not go to the pond.  But you can come to Taman.  Salt Lake (Veselovka - a nearby village that can be used as a landmark) is located near the Yantar beach.  Check-in from Artyushchenko. </p>
