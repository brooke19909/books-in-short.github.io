    <p>  Later, already in 1883, each city officer had a special instruction that described the requirements for vehicles.  It clearly stated at what speed you can move around Moscow, where and how you can overtake other vehicles. </p><h2>  History of the GAI of the USSR </h2><p>  With the formation of the new state - the USSR, in 1922 Orders were issued, which obliged all representatives of the Workers 'and Peasants' Police to learn the rules of the road, to regulate it on the road with a wand.  Since 1924, the functions of future traffic police of the USSR began to be assigned to district and rural militia officers.  They established control over traffic on the roads and compliance with traffic rules. </p>

    <p>  But there was more transport, and ordinary policemen could no longer cope with such extensive duties.  First, in 1925, by decree of the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet, a department was created that was responsible for regulating traffic on the streets of Moscow.  And already in 1928, a separate position appeared among city police officers - a traffic control inspector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 30s, special units were created.  These were already completely separate police units that were engaged exclusively in auto and motor vehicles. </p><h2>  Traffic Police Foundation </h2><p>  In November 1934, the <span>State Automobile Inspection (GAI of the</span> USSR) was created, which existed under TsUDorTrans.  Such a structure existed in all large places where a fairly large number of cars were present on the roads.  Police were given instructions.  They had to not only monitor the quality of traffic on the roads, but also fight the misuse of transport in various departments of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <p>  But the real birthday of the GAI of the USSR is considered July 3, 1936.  On that very day, Decree No. 1182 was issued entitled "The Regulation on the State Automobile Inspection of the Main Directorate of Workers and Peasants' Police of the NKVD of the USSR."  The employees of this service already had broader goals and objectives. </p><p>  They had to control the preparation and operation of drivers, the operating standards of vehicles, and actively fight against violators of traffic rules and accident rates on city streets.  Previously, the police, who only participated in the regulation of the movement, were engaged in this.  Until the 1950s, traffic controllers were not part of the traffic police of the USSR.  At the time of the establishment of the service, there were only 7 branches.  The number of employees of the traffic police was only 57 employees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First rules </h2><p>  In 1940, a unit of the State Automobile Inspection developed a system for the necessary organization of traffic on the road, issuing the Rules of the Road.  In the same period came the rules of accounting for cars in the country, technical inspection.  The traffic police of the USSR, in addition to organizing safe traffic on the roads, had to control the condition of roads and streets in and between cities, decide where there is a need to put signs on the road, apply the necessary markings. </p><h2>  GAI during the war </h2><p>  With the beginning of the most difficult period in the life of the country, many service employees voluntarily went to the ranks of the defenders of the motherland from the Nazis.  Most of them after the fighting did not return home, they died the death of the brave.  Those employees who remained at their post helped the army as best they could.  They carried out the mobilization of equipment for the needs of the front, built defenses, military dugouts. </p>

    <p>  The trained staff of professional drivers for the army was constantly updated.  The traffic police officers were especially distinguished during the evacuation of residents from besieged Leningrad surrounded by Germans and the delivery of such products that people needed.  On the roads at that time, traffic control was carried out by battery-powered traffic lights, which had directional light only forward, which served as a disguise during enemy attacks. </p><p>  After the victory in World War II, many returned to the ranks of the police.  The GAI of the USSR resumed its work, while participating in restoration work.  After all, most roads were actually destroyed. </p><h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  With the development of science and technology in the inspection began to apply scientific methods of work.  The use of radar speed meters has been introduced.  The staff included patrol helicopters and ambulance vehicles.  A decree came into force, allowing the driver to be taken away from drivers who drive while intoxicated.  In the 70s, research laboratories began to be created to study the problems of road safety. </p><h2>  Traffic police </h2><p>  For the organization of control on the roads, the inspectors were allocated good and powerful cars capable of participating in the pursuit of the intruder.  At that time, such vehicles as the GAI of the USSR, such as Pobeda, GAZ-21, were popular, later newer models appeared at the disposal of employees - VAZ-2106, 2107, 2109 and GAZ-24.  It was convenient for the traffic police to get around on motorcycles.  The Ural model was used.  This is a fast tricycle <span>with a sidecar.</span> </p>

    <p>  You could also see other equipment - helicopters, buses, minibuses "Latvia". </p><h2>  Heroic labor </h2><p>  The police service has always been considered dangerous and complex.  It was necessary to be on duty at a post both in a heat, and in cold, in the afternoon and in the dark nights.  Many road police officers, in the exercise of their official duties, were caught in the hands of bandits or were shot down on the road while on duty. </p>
