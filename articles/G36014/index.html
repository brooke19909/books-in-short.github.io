It is located in the Lazarevskoye microdistrict, the famous Sochi resort, located on the Black Sea coast.  This is a large entertainment complex, in the territory of which various water attractions, swimming pools, a network of catering establishments are located.  The area itself is very picturesque: the mountain river Psezuapse with crystal clear water flows nearby, and the majestic mountains of the Caucasus rise around.  It is very warm, even on cold days, the water temperature does not drop below +28 C ¬∞. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ayda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park rides" class="if uuid-2309938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67777/2309938.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Waterpark "Nautilus" in Lazarevsky is an entertainment complex located in the open air.  Of the attractions there are water slides of various difficulty levels and several small pools.  The territory of the water park itself is ennobled: the paths are paved with tiles, between which flower beds are planted, palms and cypresses grow.  There are cafes and eateries.  The main feature of the Nautilus is very steep and extreme slides. </p><p>  Waterslides: </p><ul><li>  "Tsunami". </li></ul><p>  ‚ÄúTsunami‚Äù is the craziest and most extreme water slide of the park, very high.  The shape resembles a large bowl, on the walls of which a person, swaying from side to side, glides along the water.  After rolling it with a stream of water carries it out to the pool.  There is an age limit (up to 14 years). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AivQsfWkQxQ"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsunami Hill" class="if uuid-2309940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67777/2309940.jpg"></div><ul><li>  "Kamikaze". </li></ul><p>  This slide is the second most extreme after the Tsunami.  A high rise, and then a sharp descent will cause a real rush of adrenaline.  There are only two slides, one yellow, the other pink, they are parallel to each other.  They can compete who quickly flopped into the pool.  Fans of heights and extreme sports will certainly enjoy such entertainment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="go2trip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamikaze hill" class="if uuid-2309987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67777/2309987.jpg"></div><ul><li>  "Black hole". </li></ul><p>  Only the name scares, in fact, this slide is not black, but a blue-white color, twisted into a spiral.  They go down on it in an inflatable "bagel".  Just a few minutes in the dark, and you already jump out of the pipe into the warm water. </p><ul><li>  "Tobogan". </li></ul><p>  ‚ÄúTobogan‚Äù is an open water slide of a white color, somewhat similar in shape to the ‚ÄúBlack Hole‚Äù, the same long and twisted.  Descent on a cheesecake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  "Pigtail". </li></ul><p>  This attraction is shaped like a braided pigtail.  Two slides of blue color twist together at the very beginning.  The slides are less steep and safer than previous rides.  The slopes are almost straight and quite high.  This is more a family entertainment in which both children and parents can participate. </p><ul><li>  Multislide. </li></ul><p>  Four slides of different colors parallel to each other.  The descent along them is smooth, without sudden changes.  The whole family can arrange speed competitions.  The youngest member of the family must win. </p><ul><li>  Children's town "Fantasy". </li></ul><p>  In the middle of the pool for the smallest, a children's town has been built, consisting of various attractions.  There is not much water in the pool, so kids can swim in it without fear.  "Town" consists of several slides, a small fountain and structures in the form of houses.  It will be interesting for the child to climb through numerous tunnels, ladders, passages.  And you can stand under a barrel, which periodically turns over and douses water from head to toe.  Child safety is monitored by experienced rescue instructors. </p><ul><li>  Pools. </li></ul><p>  Each water attraction has small pools - this is a very interesting design idea.  There is also a separate swimming pool equipped with a hydromassage system.  Around there is everything for a comfortable stay, deck chairs, sun loungers, umbrellas are installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hill Pigtail" class="if uuid-2309941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67777/2309941.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to eat? </h2><p>  It is not surprising that after such active water procedures, a wolfish appetite can occur.  Finding a dish to your taste in Nautilus is easy.  Everything is in order with food.  There are many cafes, pizzerias, beer bars, and shops in the water park.  They are located in large round tents in blue and blue.  You can just drink water from the fountains.  The prices in the cafe are quite reasonable, for any wallet. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the Nautilus water park in Lazarevsky both by public transport and by private car. </p><p>  You can get to the microdistrict: </p><ul><li>  By bus. </li></ul><p>  Buses No. 155-158, 164-166, 170, 182 go to the Rynok stop, and it‚Äôs very close to Nautilus.  You can also take buses number 70, 69, 68. They go to the stops "Center" and "Shop Andromeda".  The distance from these stops will be slightly larger than from the market. </p><ul><li>  On a personal car. </li></ul><p>  If you go by car, then parking can be a problem at the height of the tourist season.  It will be difficult to park near the water park during peak hours.  In this case, you can drive a little further into the territory of the microdistrict, and leave the car there. </p><ul><li>  By train. </li></ul><p>  An electric train runs to the Lazarevskoye station regularly.  This is a very convenient option, especially in the summer, when traffic jams occur on the roads. </p><ul><li>  By taxi. </li></ul><p>  You can take a taxi to Lazarevsky from Sochi, but you need to take into account such a point that at peak times, taxi prices bite a lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": Sergey Siman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from above" class="if uuid-2309944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67777/2309944.jpg"></div><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Prices at the Nautilus water park in Lazarevsky for 2018: </p><ul><li>  Entrance ticket for an adult for the whole day costs - 1100 rubles., For a child (up to 12 years) - 900 rubles. </li><li>  For 4 hours for an adult - 900 rubles, for a child (up to 12 years) - 700 rubles. </li><li>  For kids (up to 3 years old) admission is free. </li></ul><p>  Opening hours: from 10.00 to 19.00.
