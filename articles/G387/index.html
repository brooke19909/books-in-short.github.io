    <p>  For those who do not like to book hotels in advance, ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù is the best option.  There is almost always free space.  Despite its "two-star", the hotel offers a good quality of service.  It is especially nice that at the station or at the airport, a person from the hotel meets guests for free. </p><p>  The price is pleasing, but as the owner says, his complex is young and he plans to raise the price and level of service over time.  The downside is that the hotel does not have its own beach.  Walk to the nearest 15 minutes. I am glad that there are several beaches nearby. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2>

    <p>  In the dining room they feed for an amateur.  But there are many decent cafes in the area, where for a little money there is the opportunity to eat deliciously.  If you do not order alcohol, then for everything you can pay no more than 500 rubles.  In the dining rooms it is better not to eat.  Local supermarkets and markets are littered with various products.  Almost at the entrance to the hotel are trays of fresh fruit.  The rooms have kitchenware and a refrigerator.  So you can safely buy everything you need and store it in your room, thus saving a lot of money.  The room has everything you need.  Shower with warm water.  The television shows well, and children can watch cartoons.  There is a safe and air conditioning.  The furniture is new and comfortable.  There are balconies on which it is pleasant to drink coffee in the morning. </p><p>  An ironing board and iron can be requested on the floor.  On vacation, you also want to look good, especially if you are going for a walk or to a restaurant in the evening. </p><p>  Many budget tourists choose the hotel "David" 2 * (Adler).  Hotel prices are very affordable.  Room rates are in the range of 4000 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Local entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel is very quiet and comfortable, no one bothers to sleep comfortably.  Fishing lovers will definitely like it here.  The river on the coast of which the hotel is located is filled with trout.  You can take fishing rods with you and go fishing.  Tackles are also sold at local stores, but the prices are resort. </p><p>  For entertainment, the hotel has Russian billiards. </p><p>  If you want to relax inexpensively and comfortably, then feel free to choose the David Hotel (Adler).  Reviews of former guests suggest that there are more positive moments of stay here than disadvantages.  Shortcomings mainly concern nutrition.  The fact is that the dining room at the hotel began working recently, so the system is not yet very tuned.  Nevertheless, a snack for breakfast is quite possible.  Especially for those who like porridge and eggs.  Breakfast is monotonous, but hearty.  For that kind of money, one should not expect more. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  The main advantage that Adler, the David Hotel offers its guests, is the price.  Here are good-natured hosts and friendly staff.  The hotel is surrounded by many shops, grocery stores, cafes and restaurants.  For a relaxing family vacation, this is ideal.  You can safely go here with children. </p><p>  Many guests say that the level of the hotel is far from 2 stars.  With minor modifications, it can claim all 4. </p><p>  The rooms offer beautiful sea views.  The apartments have new high-quality furniture, very clean and comfortable.  In extreme heat, air conditioning and a fridge save drinks and food. </p><p>  The path to the sea is 15 minutes.  For some this is a disadvantage, while for others it is an advantage.  You can once again stroll through the picturesque Adler.  Fans of renunciation can visit the wild beach, which is also located near the hotel. </p><p>  Central location is also a plus.  Within walking distance are entertainment, cafes, shops.  Public transport stop within walking distance. </p><p>  In the evening, you can stroll along the promenade and breathe in the healing air. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is also a beautiful arboretum with the uncomplicated name ‚ÄúSouthern Cultures‚Äù.  A resort town can be reached in just 15 minutes. </p><h2>  Pricing and discounts </h2><p>  Prices at the hotel are available to everyone.  In season, the Standard room costs only 2700 rubles.  per day.  In October, the price drops to 1000 rubles.  Room "Suite" in this period costs only 2500 rubles.  Adler is as good in autumn as in summer.  For some, this is the best time for a vacation.  Not so hot, and much less people.  But the sea is still warm, the sun is warming, and the prices are much lower.  The velvet season is the best time for a beautiful tan and a healthy vacation. </p><p>  I am glad that the hotel provides discounts to certain categories of the population.  Military personnel, government employees and retirees can expect a 10% discount. </p><p>  The hosts are constantly working to improve the conditions of their stay at the hotel.  Perhaps soon this institution will receive more stars. </p>
