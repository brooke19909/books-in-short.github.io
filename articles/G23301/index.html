But it is known far beyond the borders of the country as a center of contemporary art and design.  This is not a place of pilgrimage for tourists, but there is also something to see and what to pay attention to.  Eindhoven is a modern city with an ancient history. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first mention of this town is found in the chronicles of 1232, although people lived in this place before.  In those days, the settlement consisted of one and a half hundred houses, and now the population of the city has exceeded the 200,000th mark. </p><p>  The city lived due to the fact that it stood on a busy road connecting the French Liege and Holland.  In 1891, the brothers Gerard and Anton Philips opened a small lamp factory here.  This company gave impetus to the development of the city, making it one of the most modern and technologically advanced in Europe.  And Philips is today a world leader in technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.netherlands-tourism.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven photo" class="if uuid-2540040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540040.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Over the long period of its history, the city has repeatedly collapsed.  During the Second World War, he was subjected to massive bombing of fascist aircraft and was almost completely destroyed.  Therefore, there are very few ancient attractions in Eindhoven.  But lovers of antiquity, and connoisseurs of modern architecture will find here a lot of interesting things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Eindhoven is a modern city with a developed infrastructure.  There is an international airport that accepts flights from many European countries.  Trains from different parts of Europe arrive at the train station.  Bus routes connect Eindhoven with Amsterdam and other cities. </p><p>  Tourists choose any convenient way to travel.  The easiest option to get to Eindhoven from Amsterdam is by train, which leaves every half an hour from the capital <span>'s Schiphol airport.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikivoyage.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven Amsterdam how to get" class="if uuid-2540071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540071.jpg"></div><h2>  Little tip </h2><p>  Before a walk around the city, it is recommended to look into the tourist information center.  It is located near the train station.  Here you can find out information about all the excursions and cultural events, buy a map of the city, get discount coupons to museums, as well as purchase souvenirs. </p><h2>  Bicycle City </h2><p>  All of Eindhoven's main attractions can be explored by cycling or walking.  Transport is prohibited in the center, and this must be taken into account when planning the route.  Bicycle parking and bike rental are almost at every step here, paths and ramps are equipped. </p><p>  This modern city is obsessed with economy, modern technology and ecology.  The roofs of the stops here are turned into flower beds.  In the attics are solar panels, and buildings are built using energy-saving technologies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="inhabitat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2540038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540038.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern Art Museum </h2><p>  Van Abbe - one of the leading European museums, which presents contemporary art.  It was opened in 1936 by a cigar industrialist.  To date, the collection of exhibits has reached almost 3,000 copies.  Here is the largest collection of works by Russian artist El Lissitzky, as well as world masterpieces by Picasso, Kandinsky, Mondrian.  The works of Dutch artists are exhibited in the old building of the museum, but the works of foreign authors are in the new building. </p><h2>  Historical Museum </h2><p>  The historical museum operates directly in the open.  Here is a reconstruction of the Iron Age village, a farm similar to what it was 1000 years ago, as well as a model of the city like Eindhoven was in the Middle Ages.  A collection of household items and decorative items traditional for the region is exhibited. </p><h2>  Ancient buildings </h2><p>  Eindhoven's oldest attraction is the Oude Thoren - "Old Tower".  This is all that remains of the Gothic temple built in the 14th century. </p><p>  Another historical building is the church of St. Catherine.  The temple on this site was erected in the 13th century, but has not survived to this day.  Nevertheless, this magnificent and beautiful building, made in the neo-Gothic style, is worth a visit.  It was restored in the 19th century.  The height of its towers reaches 73 m. The majestic, strict and beautiful temple will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven Attractions" class="if uuid-2540043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540043.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the neo-Gothic Church of the Augustinians was consecrated in the city.  It stands out with a statue of Christ at the top of the tower.  The windows of the temple are decorated with colored stained-glass windows. </p><p>  Another old church is located far from the main streets, so a rare tourist peeks under its arches.  This is the church of St. George, towering 90 meters above the ground.  A large organ is installed inside the building. </p><h2>  University of Technology </h2><p>  Eindhoven University of Technology opened in 1957.

Here is the home stadium and museum dedicated to this club, which in 2013 celebrated its 100th anniversary.  The Hall of Fame exhibits the items of the legendary football players Romario and Jan van Beveren, as well as photographs, cups, prizes, uniforms and much more.  Fans have a real opportunity to play an amateur match at the team‚Äôs home stadium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paradiseintheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven Attractions" class="if uuid-2540022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540022.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips Museum </h2><p>  One of the city-forming enterprises is Philips.

Here, at every step, buildings are amazing in their architectural design.  This city impresses with its modernity and spontaneity. </p><p>  The futuristic Evolution building, which is more reminiscent of a landed flying saucer, attracts attention.  Once upon a time there was a very popular interactive museum, but now it is a conference room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegeordietravellerblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eindhoven Attractions" class="if uuid-2540077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2540077.jpg"></div><p>  Nearby stands the tallest skyscraper in the city - the Admirant, whose height is 105 m. Due to the asymmetrical windows, the facade resembles a punch card.  Inside the building, shopping malls are a paradise for shopaholics. </p><p>  And another structure that attracts the views is the Tower of Light - Lichttoren.  Not so long ago, Philips lamps were tested on the upper floors of this building, which did not turn off either day or night, illuminating the city jungle like a lighthouse. </p><p>  Animal lovers can head to a small but cozy zoo. </p><h2>  Festivals </h2><p>  Eindhoven, whose attractions are not limited to museums and architecture, is known for its grandiose festivals held several times a year. </p><p>  So, in October, the Dutch Design Week is held.
