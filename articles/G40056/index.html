Even the townspeople who do not have suburban garden plots, have no relatives in the villages, still conquered the mulberries and apricots growing in the city.  It was just so interesting!  Especially tinkering in the forks of branches of the hut.  Now, with the advent of rope parks, adults are happy to overcome obstacles, and moreover, they return to childhood with their children and grandchildren. </p><h2>  High altitude city </h2><p>  A modern amusement park of sports and entertainment with adventures and flights - this is the high-rise city, which is the park "Mowgli" in Yekaterinburg.  The time spent in the park will give the conquerors of the tracks a good mood and a lot of impressions.  There is a climbing wall nine meters high in the town.  Those wishing to test themselves in rock climbing are provided with modern automatic insurance.  The only restriction on the climbing wall is that the participant must weigh no more than 100 kilograms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mayakovsky Mowgli Park" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1850358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Airways are designed for different ages and different levels of physical fitness.  Routes on the tracks are designed so that they do not interfere with the participants passing each section of the route.  Before starting the passage, a briefing with the participants of the routes is mandatory.  Instructors tell in detail how to behave at altitude, introduce them to carbines, and teach them to move them correctly when moving from one passage to another.  Be sure to conduct training on the mini-training track, where the skills of fastening carbines are tested and it is checked how correctly the rules that the instructor talked about are learned.  Everyone is instructed and trained, no matter what time the participant will work on the track. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For the smallest </h2><p>  The smallest are waiting for four children's tracks in Mayakovsky Park in Mowgli.  The smallest athletes, from 3 to 6 years old and up to 110 cm tall, master the "Anthill" track.  It is equipped with a special mesh.  Passing this track is a real game of walking on wooden steps and a log that does not swing.  Parents have to wait a long time until their child plays enough.  This pleasure for a child costs 150 rubles.  The next track is "Yellow", which are children from 6 years old.  It already includes the simplest elements of transitions and dislocation of carbines.  The length of this route is 130 meters.  Passing through it will cost parents 150 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mowgli park" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1850360.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <h2>  Trails for schoolchildren </h2><p>  Two more tracks in Mowgli Park are for children, these are Orange and Green.  Junior schoolchildren who are over 8 years old are admitted to Orange.  The track is located at a height of 3-4 meters above the ground and includes 16 different stages of the path.  The length of the route is 140 meters, the cost is 200 rubles.  The track gladly obeys the younger students.  It was at this age that their grandparents conquered trees.  The next is the Green Track.  On it, children from 10 years old hone their agility and flexibility.  Starting from this route, there is already an increase in complexity from simpler to more complex elements.  The length of the route is 130 meters, the height above the ground is 4-5 meters, the cost of passage is 250 rubles.  Children, passing different levels of difficulties, "temper" their character and get a lot of positive emotions.  On all four tracks, children not only insure themselves with belts and carbines, but also pass them accompanied by an adult family member or instructor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The instructors of the Mowgli park draw the attention of parents that, if desired, the child can go the route again, paying 50 rubles less if the equipment was not removed. </p>

    <h2>  What is the difficulty of black runs </h2><p>  Two black tracks are definitely not for beginners.  Physically trained people, extreme people come to them.  The track passes in climbing equipment, consisting of cables and carbines.  The participant is given gloves and a helmet.  The track begins with a climbing wall, that is, there must be skills to conquer this attraction.  The top of the climbing wall is the beginning of the path along the Black Plus track.  It starts from a height of 10 meters.  Two carbines and a roller are involved on the track.  There are difficult flights on the rope and the passage of the so-called DNA - wooden sticks twisted in a spiral.  Rescue workers of the Mowgli park watch the passage along the highway and, if necessary, come to the rescue. </p><p>  The main thing is that those who have gone through these routes get satisfaction from the fact that they can do it. </p>
