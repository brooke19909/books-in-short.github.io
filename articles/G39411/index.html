Features, types, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One fifty kopeck coin of 1925 can be called the true pearl of minted coin art.  A coin is made of solid silver.  Printed at the Leningrad Mint in accordance with all requirements, weight standards and geometric norms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="plastinka-rip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one fifty kopeck 1925 price" class="if uuid-3174145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3174145.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  On a coin, one fifty dollars of 1925 depicts the main symbol of the USSR - the hammer thief.  Among the specimens there are quite unique and rare monetary units.  Their value is influenced by inscriptions on the edge, various types of stamps used for minting, and so on.  The coin is made of pure silver, which is confirmed by the inscription on the edge.  It reads: "Pure silver 9 grams PL."  Initials show the name and surname of the person who was in charge of the Leningrad Mint.  His name was Peter Latyshev.  He held his post for a long time, since he worked back in the days of Nicholas II. </p><p>  Coins one fifty dollars (silver) 1925 was produced in an amount of more than 43 million copies.  The mass of one coin was 10 g, 9 of which were silver.  At the moment, there are more than 18 species of fifty dollars this year.  Their cost varies from 100 rubles to 40,000 dollars. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Almost the entire front side of the coin is occupied by the image of a blacksmith.  In his hands is a hammer brought for a blow.  Apparently, the hammer thief has already struck several blows on the anvil, since a column of sparks emanates from it.  The image of the man‚Äôs left leg is almost hidden behind the anvil.  The right leg is set forward.  Gears and wheels with cloves are scattered under the blacksmith‚Äôs feet.  Behind the figure is a plow on which a sickle hangs.  It can be seen that the man is wearing wide trousers and a leather apron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A wide line runs under the blacksmith's feet.  Under it at a fifty-fifty coin of 1925 the date of coin production is engraved.  A little to the right you can see the small letter "G".  The letter is close to the decorative border, which surrounds the entire coin and consists of convex points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fifty dollars 1925" class="if uuid-3174139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3174139.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  If on later coins, almost the entire reverse is an image of the coat of arms of the USSR, then at fifty-fifty coins of 1925 the coat of arms occupies only half of the coin disk.  In the center is a globe with a sickle and hammer minted on top. Just below the Earth is the upper half of the sun, which heats the planet with its long rays.  Some rays are half hidden under the globe. </p><p>  Ears of wheat are located on both sides of the Earth and the Sun.  They are collected in sheaves using wide ribbons.  Only three turns on each side.  In the center of the tape they are connected into a knot.  Seven ribbons symbolize the number of union republics.  In the upper part of the sheaves are practically in contact with each other.  In a small remnant of space is a five-pointed star.  As on the obverse, an underline is present here.  She shares the image of the coat of arms of the USSR and other inscriptions.  On the left and right side of the coat of arms are the letters of the abbreviation of the state.  "SS" - on the left, "CP" - on the right.  They are printed in beautiful uppercase letters.  The letters "CP" somewhat resemble an image of a sickle and a hammer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.spb.baraholka.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one fifty dollar coin of 1925 price" class="if uuid-3174151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3174151.jpg"></div><p>  Under the wide separating strip is the inscription "One fifty dollars."  Decorative stripes and a point in the middle are located a little lower.  All of the above details are closed in a ring.  Decorative dots are located along the edge of the coin disk.  Between the two circles is the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" </p><h2>  British chasing </h2><p>  Now we turn to the conversation about the varieties of coins one fifty dollars of 1925.  The price for each type will be indicated below. </p><p>  There are several types of coins that are of particular value.  Some of them are those that were minted at the British Mint.  On the obverse of such a currency, if you look closely, the globe will be flatter.  The strip that snaps the coat of arms is flat and thickened.  If on ordinary coins the comma in the slogan slightly goes to the inner semicircle, then on the coin of British coinage, on the contrary, it is distant from it. </p><p>  The reverse also has some differences.  Firstly, the figure of a smaller smith.  The hammer handle is slightly extended.  The initials of the British mitzmaster are minted on the edge.  At that time, Thomas Ross was in charge of the Mint in Birmingham. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fcoins.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fifty dollars silver 1925" class="if uuid-3174150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3174150.jpg"></div><h2>  Superior Standard </h2><p>  There is another variant of coins: one fifty fifty dollars in 1925, the price of which will differ significantly from the cost of standard coinage.  The land, which is depicted on the obverse of the coin, is more voluminous.  On these monetary units, the meridians and parallels on the globe are more clearly traced.  On the other side, as in the case of British coinage, there is a reduced image of a blacksmith, a thickened handle of the hammer, and also a smaller dotted stroke. </p><h2>  Modified Edge </h2><p>  Among coins in denominations of one fifty kopeck coins of 1925, there are varieties that do not have an inscription on the edge.  There are options where the pattern of letters is changed.  There are monetary units where points in the initials are missing. </p><h2>  Technological marriage </h2><p>  There is another type of coin, which will cost a little more than the standard.  It can be distinguished by a thinner strip, emphasizing the emblem.  The comma in the slogan will almost touch the stroke.  If you look closely at the number 5, which is located on the back of the coin, you can see that it does not go beyond the anvil.  On other species, it will be located under the anvil.  In addition, there are no carvings and inscriptions on the edge of the coins with technological defects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one fifty kopeck coin 1925" class="if uuid-3174587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3174587.jpg"></div><h2>  Special coinage </h2><p>  These coins are considered a rarity.  Made from 18 grams of silver.  They were produced for the Soviet philatelic association.  They never "lay" in the wallets of ordinary citizens, as they settled in the collections of famous numismatists. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Fifty standard coinage can be sold for 150-230 rubles.  Coins that have changes on the edge, as well as technological defects, cost from 8 thousand rubles to 190 thousand rubles.  One of the most expensive is the currency, which refers to a special trial coinage.  Their price can reach 800 thousand rubles.  Coins of special minting do not have an exact value.  Here, as they say, the price is negotiable. </p>
