Regardless of whether the model is made with knitting needles or crochet.  This continuous knitting is called "raglan". </p><h2>  What is a raglan sleeve? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="raglan sleeve" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/391623.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><p>  It is created by two symmetrical beveled armholes, forming a truncated cone in the upper part of the product.  Its top becomes the neck.  Knitting raglan sleeves requires great care from the craftswoman.  However, a product with such cut details has a more "professional" appearance.  In addition, the sloping armholes provide greater freedom of movement. </p><p>  Building a raglan sleeve is a rather complicated process.  It requires absolutely accurate calculation of bevel lines.  Sleeves should be tied up similarly to armholes on the main part of the product.  Not every knitter will undertake such a complex technique.  But if the calculation of the loops is carried out correctly and clearly follow the basic rules of <span>raglan knitting,</span> there will be no problems in the process. </p><h2>  What is a raglan line? </h2><p>  Before you directly start the knitting process, you need to understand what a raglan line is.  These are the loops to which the yarn is adjacent on both sides.  Due to the latter, the <span>knitted fabric</span> expands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a raglan sleeve" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/391628.jpg?1399504356752" width="300"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you knit a raglan sleeve with knitting needles, there are many options for aesthetically pleasing a raglan line.  It can consist of one <span>inside loop,</span> several (usually three) facial ones.  Also, to create it, you can apply a three-dimensional pattern, for example, a ‚Äúflagellum‚Äù of four facial loops. </p><p>  For inexperienced knitters, it is recommended to start with the simplest option - one wrong side.  Then it will be easier to calculate the loops, and there will be no confusion during the work. </p><h2>  We calculate raglan loops </h2><p>  In order to calculate raglan loops quickly and without errors, you need to: </p><ul><li><p>  calculate the total number of loops in knitting and divide into three for the front, back and sleeves; </p></li><li><p>  we divide the part for the sleeves into two, if the number of loops is odd, we add the remainders for the front; </p></li></ul><ul><li>  when knitting the raglan line, we take the loop ‚Äúfrom the sleeves‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  This completes the calculation of the loops.  Now you need to dial them on the knitting needles. </p><h2>  Where to start </h2><p>  If you knit a raglan sleeve, you can start work both from the bottom of the product, and from above.  Both methods will not cause difficulties with a certain skill. </p><p>  The answer to the question of where to start knitting a raglan sleeve better is quite simple: </p><ul><li><p>  If the product will be worn by an adult, both methods will work. </p></li><li><p>  If children's clothing is knitted, it is preferable to start knitting from above.  When the child grows up, it will be possible to add the missing rows on the bottom and on the cuffs. </p></li></ul><h2>  We knit raglan knitting needles from the neck </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting raglan sleeves" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/391625.jpg?1399504469929" width="275"></div></h2><p>  To begin with, we calculate the density of knitting.  To do this, we gather twenty loops on the needles with the yarn prepared for the product and knit a sample of a pattern 10 cm high. We measure its width in centimeters and the height in loops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then we measure the circumference of the neck (since <span>knitting</span> starts from the neck) and calculate how many loops you need to dial for the first row of the product. </p><p>  We complete the set and proceed to knitting according to the following pattern: 1 air loop, 1 front, 1 yarn, 5 front (sleeve), 1 yarn, 1 wrong side (raglan line), 1 yarn, 15 front (back), 1 yarn, 1 wrong side (raglan line), 1 yarn, 5 front (sleeve), 1 yarn, 1 wrong side (raglan line), 1 yarn, 1 front loop. </p><p>  So we knit the first ten rows, while doing all the even rows with purl loops.  For yarn we use the wrong side crossed. </p><p>  Starting from the eleventh row, we close the work in a circle and continue until we have enough loops for the sleeves.  When it is achieved, put off the loops for the sleeves on the auxiliary knitting needles and continue to work on the front and back, knitting them in a circle to the level of the final length of the product. </p><p>  Now let's get to work on the sleeves.  We will knit in a circle, so the delayed loops need to be distributed on four stocking knitting needles.  We attach the working thread and the contrasting marker thread, thus marking the beginning of the row. </p><p>  Getting to work.  Moreover, in every sixth row we make decreases at the beginning (for beveling the sleeve): we knit two loops together and the next two loops with a broach. </p><p>  So continue until you reach the specified sleeve length. </p><h2>  How to tie a raglan sleeve with knitting needles from the bottom </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="building raglan sleeves" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/391621.jpg?1399504511313" width="336"></div></h2><p>  The method in which raglan is knitted from the bottom of the product at the initial stage is no different from the process of working on any sweater or pullover.  We carry out all the details separately to the beginning of the bevel of the armhole.  Set aside all parts without closing the loop. </p><p>  We also knit the sleeves before the beginning of the bevels.  Now we transfer four finished parts of the future product to circular knitting needles.  We continue to work, making circular rows for a sweater or direct and reverse, if the fastener is present in the product. </p><p>  In the process, do not forget to make reductions for the raglan line in the same way as described above, only in the reverse order. </p><h2>  Raglan sleeve - advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  All methods for making knitwear manually have both their advantages and disadvantages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Raglan sleeve knitting" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/391630.jpg?1399504549321" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The following are the obvious indisputable advantages of products with raglan: </p><ul><li><p>  if the work is done from the neck, there will be no seams on the whole product; </p></li><li><p>  the ends of the threads will be practically absent in the product; </p></li><li><p>  no pattern is required; you can use the loop counting method; </p></li><li><p>  at any time, work can be tried on. </p></li></ul><p>  Products in which there is a raglan sleeve are always beautiful and fashionable.  Therefore, only two points can be mentioned as cons: </p><ul><li><p>  In the work is at the same time a large number of loops.  This disadvantage is especially significant in the manufacture of clothing for adults. </p></li><li><p>  This method limits the possible selection of patterns.  Therefore, most products are made with <span>front stitch,</span> and in order to diversify the canvas, melange or fancy yarn is used. </p></li></ul><p>  Of course, the raglan sleeve in the process of knitting can deliver additional chores to the craftswoman.  But still, do not be afraid of such a technique.  Even with a little experience, you can quickly learn how to tie a raglan sleeve.  And as a reward you will receive truly professional handmade products. </p>
