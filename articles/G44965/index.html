However, residents of many cities of Russia are faced with the fact that the swimming season lasts no more than 2-3 months.

Year-round residents of the Voronezh region invites you to relax soul and body at the “Fishka” water park.  Voronezh is a city in which the mentioned center of water entertainments is located. </p><h2>  Description of the water park </h2>

If you believe the guest reviews, the most “scary” slides are “guns”.  Two symmetrical, not too high descents look quite harmless.  Their insidiousness lies in super-fast gliding, during which the surface of the descent completely ceases to be felt, and it seems as if you are flying down a steep cliff.  Two of the longest and highest spiral descents will give a lot of vivid impressions.  Waterpark "Fishka" (Voronezh) will delight guests with standard family rides of medium complexity.  The complex has two adult pools.  In one you can enjoy the sea waves, there are also geysers, a hydromassage area.  For visitors wishing to relax and unwind, there is also a large jacuzzi bathtub.  Between the adult and children's zones there is a “beach” - the territory of passive relaxation with sunbeds.  There is a water playground for young visitors, there are three low slides, various fountains, waterfalls and water-spraying installations.  In addition, on the territory of the complex you can do "peeling fish" and visit the Finnish sauna.

With it, you can open your personal locker and pay in the cafe.  Do not forget to put money on the bracelet (cash or from a bank card) in a special cashier, when leaving the water park, the change can be withdrawn and picked up.  Locker rooms and separate showers await guests in locker rooms.  Qualified lifeguards are on duty near the pools and in the amusement zone, and there is also a medical center on the territory of the complex.  When visiting the water park, do not forget to carefully read all the <span>information stands</span> and posters.  Follow the rules for using attractions and do not leave children unattended.  And then only pleasant impressions await you, and you will definitely want to return to the Chip water park again.  Voronezh, judging by the reviews of satisfied guests, may seem like a real southern city after a good rest in the center of water entertainment.

Today, the "Chip" is the only one of its kind complex of water attractions in the entire region.  In addition to it, mini-water parks operate at some hotels and saunas, but often these are 1-2 low slides and pools with a jacuzzi.  However, not all residents of the city like "Chip".

    <p>  Many visitors complain about the insecurity of the rides, in particular the rugged joints on the slides.  This is a moot point, as it is possible to increase the comfort of the descent using special mats for safe skiing, which are provided free of charge and are always available to guests in large quantities.  Negative opinions regarding the quality of water treatment, the attitude of the staff and the number of employees in the water entertainment zone are popular among visitors to the complex.  The smell of bleach and the dissatisfaction of guests with employees of entertainment centers are problems typical of many water parks in our country. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the “Fishka” water park (Voronezh) has not only negative reviews.  Many residents of the city and the region like this place, and they gladly come here regularly and recommend it to friends.  Rest will leave only positive emotions, if you go to the aquacenter in a good mood, with a positive company and do not focus on unpleasant details.  Try to personally visit the water park and make your own opinion about this complex. </p>
