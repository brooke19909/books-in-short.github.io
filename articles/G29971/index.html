The territory is small and well-groomed.  The hotel consists of one three-story building.  What is noteworthy - the entrances to the rooms are not in the inner corridor, but outside.  The inhabitants of the first floor were comfortable.  On the upper levels you need to climb the internal stairs and exit to the shared balcony.  But this is from the land side.  And from the sea, each room has an individual balcony, on which a table and chairs are installed.  Thus, each hotel guest has a gorgeous view from the window.  True, the sea is almost invisible on the ground floor - it is obscured by lush Mediterranean vegetation.  Another "feature" of the hotel is a pool around the clock.  It is regularly cleaned, but a cleaning break takes a maximum of 15 minutes.  The pool is small but pleasant for swimming.  Around it there are sun loungers with mattresses and umbrellas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lagonas Beach Hotel Apartments 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2122691.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  This hotel positions itself as an apart-hotel.  Lagonas Beach Apart (Greece) offers its guests both budget rooms and studio apartments.  All rooms are adjoined by spacious furnished balconies with sea views.  Bathrooms are equipped with shower (shower tray).
