Attractions and entertainment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Obninsk arose recently and got its name from the Obninskoe railway station.  It all started with the formation of a secret facility "B" - a set of research laboratories for work in the field of nuclear energy.  It happened in 1946.  Gradually, residential quarters began to grow near scientific buildings.  So the first science city appeared in Russia. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.1170375" data-lng="36.597081799999955" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/5/8/14358.png"></div><p>  The city is located at the intersection of Kiev and Warsaw highway, has a railway connection with Moscow.  Therefore, there are always many tourists.  What attracts people to it?  What is interesting to see here, where you can go to Obninsk, what to see? </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Places to visit are located outside. </p><p>  Bird Park "Sparrows".  2000 species of birds live here, including domestic ones.

Where to go in Obninsk to get acquainted with its history? </p><h2>  Museum of the History of Obninsk </h2><p>  It is not by chance that it is named that way.  Today the museum is a center of spiritual and cultural life.  The thematic focus of the expositions is quite diverse, here, in addition to everything, exhibitions are held, an art salon is organized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Obninsk History" class="if uuid-3077738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/3077738.jpg"></div><p>  In front of the building is a large venue where cultural events are often held.

In 2002, it was stopped and turned into a museum complex.  Located at Bondarenko Square, 1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ians.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The world's first nuclear power plant in the city of Obninsk" class="if uuid-3077734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/3077734.jpg"></div><p>  Another attraction is the meteorological mast with a height of 310 meters (recall that the height of the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters). </p><p>  It is supported by four tiers of stretch marks.  The diameter of the mast is 2 meters.  Today it has received official recognition as a landmark of the city of Obninsk.  It is located three hundred meters from the Guryanovsky forest park on Guryanovskaya street. </p><h2>  Where to go in Obninsk on the weekend </h2><p>  The city has several cinemas, many cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  The city authorities do not forget about family vacations.  There are many places in Obninsk where going with children on a day off will be both interesting and useful. </p><p>  So, in the center there is an untouched section of virgin forest, on the site of which the city was built.  It is good to ski here in winter. </p><p>  The Atom Entertainment Center offers a lot of entertainment to parents and children.
