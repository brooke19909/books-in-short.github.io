History, career relaxation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The kaolin quarry got its name due to the rock mined in it.  This is a peculiar kind of white clay mixed with quartz, mica and <span>feldspar</span> grains <span>.</span>  The deposits of this rock are not uncommon, and one of them is the kaolin Kyshtym quarry.  This career has different names: Azure, Affectionate, but most often it is called Bali. </p><p>  Earlier in the quarry, white clay was extracted, which consisted of kaolin.  Currently, production is stopped, the field is abandoned.  When walking along its shores, you need to be especially careful, as steep slopes are often found.  But they are not everywhere, and if you get around them, you can get to a kind of "beach". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaolin quarry" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/467759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The depth of the quarry reaches about seven meters.  It differs from many other quarries in that there is no fish in it at all.  This is due to the high concentration of clay and minerals that make the water unsuitable for fauna. </p><h2>  Career history </h2><p>  A kaolin quarry was dug in 1945 for clay extraction, and in industry it is used to produce phosphorus, earthenware, and porcelain.  This field in Russia is considered the richest.  Initially, an enterprise that was in a quarry simply pumped water out of it.  Once on an unusual blue career, they simply wrote on the Internet as a picturesque place.  And immediately many tourists poured onto its shores. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2012, the owners of the quarry were going to drain it and continue working at the field, but so far the local Bali is still open for visits.  The barriers that were set up at the quarry, eager to see an exotic place, were overcome with enviable tenacity, and as a result, the quarry remained open to the public. </p>

    <h2>  Why is blue water in a career </h2><p>  The water in this picturesque quarry is turquoise.  It is because of its color that this place was called Ural Bali.  Such an unusual color in the quarry gives chalk chalk, which it contains, and white clay, which is very similar to the <span>white sand of</span> tropical countries. </p><p>  Despite the fact that a lot of people visit the kaolin quarry, the banks near the water are very clean and there is practically no debris.  It happens that you can meet an abandoned barbecue or abandoned tires, but this is more an exception than a rule.  Thanks to its clear blue water, this place is ideal for romance.  Because closer to evening, the shade of water acquires a certain mystery, and inspires a <span>romantic mood.</span> </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the quarry </h2><p>  The quarry itself is located not far from Chelyabinsk, about 100 kilometers away, in Kyshtym.  Many are interested in the question: "Kaolin quarry - how to get there?" </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can get to it by car, although there is a slight obstacle in the form of a mound of sand a kilometer away.  You can go around it, or drive right along it, as it is already practically rolled out.  After a few kilometers of <span>dirt road</span> to be overcome, the quarry itself will appear. </p><h2>  The road from Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  If you get to the quarry from Yekaterinburg, then you need to go to <span>the M5 highway.</span>  Passing the Tubuk, you need to turn to Kaspi, to the right.  After that, go straight to Kashtym.  Behind it is the road that connects the village of Kaolinovy ‚Äã‚Äãwith Kashtym.  This is just beyond the <span>railway crossing.</span>  After this you need to turn left, having left on a wide dirt road.  You can drive through it without problems on any car, as it has long been rolled out by many trucks.  If you encounter large puddles - you can simply go around them, as traffic along the road is not very busy. </p>

    <p>  Only this opinion is erroneous.  Studies have shown that white clay, which is located in a quarry, does not have properties attributed to it, but there are just as many dangerous elements that can be found there.  This is due to the landfill, which is located slightly above this quarry, and from there <span>sewage is</span> discharged into the blue expanse <span>.</span>  Since water is not purified here, many chemical compounds simply accumulate in it for years.  Therefore, swimming here is not only undesirable, but also very dangerous.  In general, the kaolin quarry in the Chelyabinsk region is more suitable for romantic dates and surveying the surroundings. </p><p>  The danger lies in wait because of the clay bottom, which can even suck in the foot and thereby create a danger to life.  But, nevertheless, the locals still bathe in these waters, and in the hot season there are many vacationers on the shore. </p><p>  But you can relax on a career without swimming.  Many just put up tents and stay overnight at barbecue.  In addition, photo shoots are often held here, as the place is quite picturesque. </p>
