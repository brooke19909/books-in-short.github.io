It begins its history in 1922, when the "Corner of Wildlife" was created on the basis of the museum of local lore.  The first inhabitants were a brown bear, which was called by the simple name Masha, five foxes left without a mother, and two calves who lost a moose cow, she died at the hands of poachers.  Then came two roe deer, three owls, a family of rare borefoot owls and a couple of birds.  And the animals all came and went, and over time there were a lot of them. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perm zoo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1025659.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Where is the menagerie? </h2><p>  Since August 1, 1933, the zoo becomes an independent organization.  It is impossible to believe that now the Perm Zoo is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1.95 hectares in the center of the Ural city of Perm.  Located on Monastyrskaya street, 10. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perm Zoo opening hours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1025656.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What interesting things can be seen in the zoo? </h2><p>  The zoo hospitably opens its doors to parents and children of different social classes.  Throughout the year, the number of visitors who want to see many representatives of the fauna does not decrease.  Almost three hundred thousand people visit the Perm Zoo annually.  The workers and the menagerie administration make communication with animals unforgettable.  Kids can pet and feed rabbits, lambs, and goats, or have fun on the playground with slides and swings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Perm Zoo has more than four hundred species of animals, about two hundred of them are listed in the Red Book.  But some animals cannot be found on the territory occupied by this zoo, as large ungulates need an area even larger than is currently available. </p><p>  A polar bear, a snow leopard, an <span>Amur tiger</span> and a <span>horned goat</span> are considered rare and endangered animals.  But the zoo of the city of Perm boasts their breeding. </p><h2>  Caring for the inhabitants and visitors </h2>

    <p>  All workers are very careful and with great attention to their pets, build new enclosures, as annually created species pairs of animals breed, animal families grow.  Their living conditions are constantly improving.  They also take care of people who come to chat with our smaller brothers.  This concern is manifested in the refinement of the appearance of the grounds and aviaries, in the equipment of recreational facilities for visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reconstructions that were carried out in the menagerie </h2><p>  The zoo has undergone several renovations.  Since 1980, the premises for keeping elephants have been rebuilt.  The hoofed range has also undergone changes.  Added a room for cranes and ostriches.  In a separate pavilion, lions and all fur-bearing animals began to live.  Redesigned the pavilion of all exotic representatives of birds.  The monkey was completely restored after the fire.  The territory has increased significantly due to all redevelopment and completion. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perm Zoo mode of operation hours inhabitants animals" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1025660.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The inhabitants of the Perm menagerie </h2><p>  The zoo is quite fully represented by a diverse world of not only the Ural fauna.  Who is not there: insectivorous and hare-like, only primates, there are eight species, and there are quite rare individuals, such as tamarines.  A lot of rodents and predators.  There are so many of them, they are all so different that many visitors do not have time to approach other enclosures: beautiful and proud lions, tigers, bears, wolves and leopards attract the attention of those who come to the zoo for a long time.  Not all animals living in the Perm Zoo have a meek disposition.  After all, they say, no matter how much the wolf feeds, he still looks into the forest.  No matter how ideal the conditions of keeping animals, each of them wants freedom.  All employees of the zoo are well aware of this. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="working hours of the Perm Zoo animals" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1025654.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Menagerie educational mission </h2><p>  The educational mission, which zoos are primarily called upon to fulfill, is also pursued by the Perm Zoo.  Not many people living in Russia can afford to travel to Africa or India.  And in Perm they observe with interest and even feed, for example, a real living elephant.  This is also a huge contribution to the upbringing of the younger generation.  The child, communicating with animals, becomes kinder.  Thus, the correct behavior and attitude towards those who need human protection is laid. </p><p>  The zoo plays the role of a link between a person and the animal world around him.  Many menageries not only watch and care for their dumb inhabitants, they protect them from those who crave profit, who kill animals, despite the fact that they are facing an endangered species.  Many cubs who came to the attentive workers by pure chance, acquire a new family.  Being in a familiar environment, some would die without parental care. </p><h2>  Perm Zoo: working hours </h2>
