  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Property for rent in Bulgaria</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to statistics, the share of real estate transactions in Bulgaria with the participation of Russian citizens is about 80%.  Some people buy housing for their own permanent residence in the country, someone only plans to relax in their living space in the summer, and the rest of the time to rent an apartment. </p><p>  If you need <noindex>  <span>commercial real estate for rent</span> </noindex>  We recommend the site shopandmall.ru where only trusted realtors work. <br><br>  Both that, and at other option have undoubted pluses and minuses.  Let's consider them in more detail. <br><br>  Benefits <br><br>  Real estate on the seashore will bring its owner a stable income throughout the holiday season.  Moreover, prices for daily rental housing are always higher than the cost of renting for a long time.  Therefore, the advantages of acquiring apartments near the sea in the first place will be the high cost of rent, a long tourist season, the presence of great demand.  The price of accommodation will directly depend on the proximity of the apartment to the sea.  Also, in luxury apartments, the cost increases if there is a guarded parking lot, swimming pools, equipped recreation centers, gyms and other signs of improvement. <br><br>  disadvantages <br><br>  But there are also disadvantages.  An apartment in such an area will cost you a lot of money.  In addition, there is a possibility that in the off-season the number of tourists will decrease significantly, and for some time your living space will be idle, and utility bills need to be paid year-round. <br><br>  If you plan to rent out real estate by the day, then take care of the internal improvement: there must be furniture, household appliances (refrigerator, washing machine, air conditioning, etc.), dishes, bedding. <br><br>  In the case of long-term leases, housing is not in great demand on the seashore (mainly due to high prices), but in large cities of the country.  Here, the proximity to the beach does not matter.  The availability of heating during the winter periods and the general warming of the apartment will become much more valuable. <br><br>  For example, in the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, thousands of tourists rent housing every year to spend several months in the city and get acquainted with all the sights.  Also, students, foreigners who came to find a job, businessmen who arrived to conduct negotiations need the housing.  The cost of renting housing in the capital is quite high.  It almost coincides with the prices on the coast.  But there are pluses: housing in large cities is required not only in the warm season, so the apartment will not stand idle in the winter.  In addition, a long-term lease will allow you not to think about finding new tenants for a long time, which again will save the effort and money that you would have spent on paying for the services of realtors.  But still, you will lose a little money, because a long rental costs much less than a daily rental. <br><br></p></div></article>
