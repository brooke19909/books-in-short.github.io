  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Side Hotels: Two Sides Five Star</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, thousands of tourists go on holiday to Turkey.  One of the most popular resorts is considered the city of Side.  This is due to the huge number of hotels on its territory, access to the Mediterranean Sea, developed service and non-stop year-round fun, which this country is so famous for.  Numerous Side hotels are happy to welcome their guests at any time of the day or year.  They, like many others, vary in stardom.  It is worth noting that Side hotels are mainly 4 and 5 *, which, unfortunately, do not always correspond to their indicated stardom. </p><p>  In 2011, new Side hotels were opened, among them the <span>Crystal Palace</span> Resort <span>Spa 5 *</span> hotel <span>,</span> located on the seashore not far from the city itself, stood out especially.  Its location is very convenient for tourists, as it is located near the airport of Antalya, but at the same time there is no inconvenience associated with flights.  Its territory is 22,000 m2.  It has one main four-story building and another 5 four-story buildings.  Many <span>Side hotels</span> have rooms for people with disabilities, as well as for families with children and honeymooners.  The bulk of housing in this hotel is made up of standard rooms, where 1 to 4 people can stay at the same time with the possibility of an extra bed.  The room has a TV, balcony, shower, flooring, wireless internet, safe, hairdryer, minibar, air conditioning.  This hotel, like the rest of Side hotels, has in its territory one main restaurant and 5 restaurants serving national cuisines of different countries.  One dinner in each of them will be free for the visitor.  The main restaurant has no restrictions on food and local alcohol.  There is a meal schedule.  Which is still worth observing.  Every evening various artists perform at the hotels, and during the day animators entertain guests with funny contests and fitness programs.  Girls will appreciate the proposed SPA - procedures that can restore beauty and health to an organism that is tired of life in a megalopolis.  If we consider hotels with children in <span>Turkey Side,</span> then this is the best option, because in addition to animation and a children's menu, there is a children's pool with water slides, a cot for babies in the room for free, all restaurants have free highchairs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the external and internal design, most tourists say that everything is done at the highest level.  Service is poor.  This hotel is perfect for Germans, but for Russians a comfortable stay in it is possible only with knowledge of English, because the staff practically does not speak Russian.  Otherwise, this is a great vacation spot with children for young people. </p><p>  In 2011, not only beautiful and comfortable Side hotels were built, but also those that almost did not correspond to their status.  These include <span>the Cenger Beach</span> 5 * <span>hotel</span> , located 20 km from the city center.  It consists of one building, where, as in the previous version, there are room options for any vacationers.  The rooms are equipped as described by the owners of this place, as well.  On the territory there is a restaurant, several bars, a spa - salon.  What really is?  In fact, it turns out that something is constantly not working in the rooms, and it‚Äôs extremely difficult to interrogate the staff to fix the breakdowns.  The hotel is not in the first line, as stated, and not even in the second, but much further.  On its territory there is a private pool, but it is much smaller than stated in the description.  Only spa - salon where really talented masters really work are its pluses.  In addition, there is nothing 5 * in the hotel.  Only one conclusion can be drawn from this: when choosing a place to stay, one should rely not on descriptions of travel agencies, but on real reviews of those who were there.  No need to take risks if there is more negative information than positive information. </p>
