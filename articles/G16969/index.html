Because they can not be compared with frosts, which are familiar to our latitudes.  A trip to Tunisia in December can bring you many unforgettable experiences, especially if you are interested in learning more about the historical and cultural attractions of this country.  So, you decided to go on vacation in the winter.  What is the weather like in Tunisia at this time and how to plan your vacation?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  Tunisia: December weather </h2><p>  The average temperature in the December period, when compared with November, usually drops by a few points.  In the north-eastern regions of Tunisia, the thermometer readings are in the range of 6-10 degrees Celsius.  In the main resort areas in the east of the country, on the Mediterranean coast (Sousse, Monastir, Hammamet, Mahdia, Port al-Kantanui), the temperature is somewhat different.  Usually it is from 10 to 17 degrees.  The highest temperature indicators can be recorded on the island of Djerba, which is located in the south.  This is usually 11 to 18 degrees Celsius. </p>

    <p>  In addition, sundials, when compared with other regions of Tunisia, are present in greater numbers.  Favorable about.  Djerba is also considered to be due to the fact that there is little rainfall.  If in the metropolitan area it is as much as 11 rainy days, and in the northern part of the country - 13 days, then there are only 4 on the island. In the evening, the level of humidity increases, so the cold is felt more.  This is what Tunisia is known for.  The weather in December here is also different in that a gusty north wind blows in the country, and the possibility of dust storms is not excluded in the southern regions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach holiday </h2><p>  If you want to go on a beach holiday to Tunisia in December, the weather is unlikely to let you enjoy it.  You won‚Äôt have to take swimwear or summer shoes, because in the first winter month you won‚Äôt be able to swim in the sea.  In addition to lowering the temperature of air and water, at this time the winds contribute to the waves, which reach six points.  Those who like to relax, basking on the beach, will not be able to feel comfortable in such conditions, but outdoor enthusiasts will be able to find something to their liking.  In the cold season, there are many visiting surfers in Tunisia.  The turbulent winter sea is suitable for training that is not possible during strong spring waves or in calm summer water.  "Tamers" of the vast blue expanses will have to wear a special wetsuit, because December water is cold - no more than 15 degrees.  However, those who like to surf, this will not stop. </p>

    <h2>  Sightseeing trips and recreational activities </h2><p>  If you want to go to Tunisia in December, then you can stay at the hotel, which has a thalassotherapy center.  It should be noted that this trend is both fashionable and useful.  If you are tired of spending time in spas, then you can go to Tozeur, where most tourists like an excursion to the Museum of the Time, as well as the historical park.  Shopaholics will also like in Tunisia, as there are a lot of markets and shops where you can not only purchase exotic goods, but also learn the oriental art of bargaining. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Festivals and festivals </h2><p>  Those who purchased a tour to Tunisia in December can attend many different celebrations and cultural events.  Here, unlike many Muslim states, the New Year holiday is usually celebrated on a large scale.  At the same time, traditional events are similar to European ones.  <span>Tunisians</span> also decorate New Year's trees (pines), and also celebrate New Year's Eve with fireworks in the city streets.  The only difference is in Arabic color and green surroundings, without snow, of course. </p><p>  In addition, in the December period celebrate the Sahara Festival in the city of Douz.  If you have planned a trip to Tunisia this month, you need to visit the Berber holidays, during which you can observe their traditional customs and everyday life. </p><p>  Tozer in December is the place where the Oasis Festival is held, which is customary to organize in the picking season of dates.  At this time, at festive events, it is customary to arrange camel races, compete in throwing knives and other types of competitions. </p>

    <h2>  Tunisia in December: prices </h2><p>  The beginning of December is a period when travel agencies offer a number of tours at November prices, which are relatively low.  On average, this is 300-500 dollars per person per week.  But if you want to go at the end of the month, then their cost will increase significantly.  The most expensive ones are vouchers for a departure for the New Year.  On average, a 7-day vacation for 2 adults at this time will cost $ 1,500.  However, in general, prices in December cannot be compared with the level of the most popular summer season, since less tourists travel to Tunisia in winter (which cannot be said about other exotic countries, which are warm enough during this period). </p>
