In fact, as in any other city in the country, even native Muscovites here do not have the opportunity to live separately from their parents.  Of course, you can rent a house, but this is completely unreasonable, given the high rents of even the most modest options.  <span>Near Moscow</span> recently attracted the attention of many Muscovites and those who are thinking about buying their own apartment.  The secret of such popularity is extremely simple and clear: a great opportunity to maintain access to the developed infrastructure of the capital and to purchase an apartment with significant savings for your budget.  LCD "YIT Park" (Krasnogorsk) - an excellent project for a modern resident of the metropolis, presented by the developer of the same name.  YIT Group of Companies is a developer with many years of experience and a modern outlook on construction.  Each of his projects is better than the previous one, which only confirms the desire to grow and develop, presenting the residents with better living conditions.  It remains only to understand what assessment the real residents of the complex give him, whether they can recommend it to other potential buyers. </p><h2>  About Krasnogorsk </h2><p>  The opinion that only residents of Moscow living inside the MKAD can get maximum comfort and a high quality of life is gradually losing their strength and power.  Currently, thanks to the active development of the transport network, the near Moscow region has become quite popular.  You will not feel any difference, if only in the cost of the apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  All those who have lived in Krasnogorsk for a long time admire this <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnear Moscow</span> and are not going to change their place of residence.  Of the obvious advantages, first of all, I would like to note the state of the environment: the city is green, with clean and fresh air.  Moreover, it is quiet and calm, which certainly can not be said about the crowded and bustling Moscow.  Many even note that Krasnogorsk is a city for couples who want to raise their children in excellent conditions.  Of the shortcomings - traffic congestion, traffic jams.  But this drawback is inherent in all <span>cities of the Moscow region.</span>  In general, the city is ideal for life, has a developed infrastructure and an excellent transport network, which allows you to quickly reach any point in the capital. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  So, we pass to the LCD "YIT Park" (Krasnogorsk).  Reviews about the project are mostly positive.  Just 5 km from MKAD, in the western part of Krasnogorsk, there is a new complex for a comfortable and active life.  A 17-storey comfort class house built using monolithic technology is something that all customers can count on.  Currently, the house has been commissioned, all finishing work in it is completed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  YIT is one of the <span>largest developers in Moscow</span> and the Moscow Region, which to date has managed to deliver quite successful projects.  Responses of residents are extremely positive, all objects are delivered on time, do not cause any complaints. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The residential complex "YIT Park", a photo of which can be found in our material, is an image of a worthy project.  It is located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, while not limiting the access of its residents to the developed infrastructure of the capital.  The territory of the complex is bordered by a park area, and the windows of the 17-story building offer stunning views of the park and the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate, which has preserved a huge cultural heritage.  For many residents of the complex, the park has become a favorite place for family walks: it is so easy to breathe here that you simply do not want to leave this paradise.  And cute and mischievous squirrels cause true delight among the youngest residents. </p>

    <p>  Proximity to Volokolamsk and Novorizhskoye highways provides transport accessibility.  Within walking distance from the complex is the Krasnogorskaya railway station.  Electric trains depart from it every 20-30 minutes, following to the <span>center of Moscow.</span>  Using public transport in just 15-20 minutes you can reach the metro station "Tushinskaya" or "Mitino". </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The YIT Park residential complex from the builder does not have its own infrastructure, but is being built in the immediate vicinity of a kindergarten, a comprehensive school, shopping and entertainment complexes and fitness centers. </p><p>  Residents of the complex note that the best medical facilities of the city are in close proximity.  Moreover, near the house there is a public transport stop, from where you can get to anywhere in the city and the largest shopping and entertainment centers. </p><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  LCD "YIT" (Krasnogorsk), although it is represented by just one house, but the developer took control of the improvement of the surrounding area.  All residents who have already managed to call in an apartment note that there are excellent sports and playgrounds for children of different ages on the territory - you no longer need to worry about organizing their leisure time. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, it should be noted an insufficient number of parking spaces.  If in each apartment of the rented house there will be at least one car, then everyone simply does not have enough space.  All those who decided to play it safe, bought a car seat in the property, saving themselves from this problem.  Moreover, the developer at the construction stage offered an excellent discount. </p><h2>  Planning decisions </h2><p>  The YIT Park residential complex in Krasnogorsk offers free planning solutions with spacious glazed balconies and loggias.  Modern buyers of real estate positively perceived the trend of free planning, because in that case there is an opportunity to arrange and zoning the space at your discretion. </p>

    <p>  Apartments for rent in rough finish, which caused a wave of indignation among residents.  Of course, most of them want to immediately enter the apartment after receiving the keys.  All those who were engaged in repairs on their own note that even the rough finish was excellent, the walls, floors and ceilings do not need additional alignment, and this is a significant saving for the budget. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  The price of an apartment in LCD "YIT Park" is an average of 122,000 p.  per square meter.  For the suburbs quite substantial cost, which is reflected in many reviews.  Potential buyers are not willing to overpay for an apartment that rents out without internal partitions and fine finishing.  But it is enough to visit the complex in order to verify the advantageousness of the location that it occupies, as all doubts disappear by themselves.  A similar apartment in Moscow will cost much more.  And the freedom of planning reviews refers to advantages, not disadvantages.  You must admit that rarely anyone manages to buy an apartment that is fully consistent with personal preferences, otherwise how to explain the massive demolition of partitions.  A free layout just allows you to create your dream apartment. </p>
