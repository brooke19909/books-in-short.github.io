    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Many MTS subscribers complain that money from their mobile accounts disappears in an unknown direction.  The reason for this is paid newsletters to which a person accidentally or consciously subscribed.  Spam, advertising messages and links to fraudulent sites - every second cell phone user is faced with all this. </p><p>  MTS offers its subscribers additional options to protect against unnecessary information and paid newsletters.  For example, you can set a ban on receiving SMS from short numbers.  But it‚Äôs best to use the ‚ÄúContent Blocking‚Äù (MTS) service.  It will solve several problems at once. </p><p>  The essence of this service is to limit access to infotainment services by the operator.  What will it give?

    <h2>  How to get rid of unnecessary newsletters </h2><p>  Most <span>subscribers do not</span> understand why they receive advertising messages on their phone.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that such mailings are not only intrusive, but also paid.  Your task is to save your money.  You just need to turn off the newsletters.  Not sure how to do this?  Now we will tell you everything. </p><p>  Ways to disable mailing lists on MTS: </p><p>  <em>Using the Internet Assistant service</em> </p><p>  First, you must visit the operator‚Äôs official website to create an account there.  After going through a simple registration procedure, you will have access to the functions of the ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù.  Having an account on this resource, you can track all operations on your mobile phone.  To disable unnecessary newsletters, you must do the following: dial * 111 * 25 # and send a request.  A special form should appear on the screen for entering the login (your 10-digit number without a figure eight) and the received password. </p><p>  <em>Getting detailed instructions</em> </p><p>  The Mobile Assistant is useful here.  On the telephone keypad, dial 111 and make a call.  Carefully listen to the instructions on the voice menu, and then follow all the points that have been announced. </p><p>  <em>SMS sending</em> </p><p>  You still don‚Äôt understand how to use the Mobile Assistant service correctly?  It is quite possible to do without it.  The easiest way to get rid of MTS mailings is to send an SMS to 111. In the message, specify a combination of numbers 2119 or 21190. </p><p>  <em>Personal visit</em> </p><p>  This option is suitable for those who have free time.  Going to the nearest MTS communications office, take your passport with you.  Employees of the company will carefully listen to you, and then they will ask you to write an application to turn off the reception of SMS mailings.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this. </p><h2>  How to disable the "Content Blocking" (MTS) service <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Protection against spam, intrusive advertising and uninteresting information - all this is great.  But sometimes situations arise in which the subscriber wants to deactivate previously connected functions.  How can he cancel the action of the "Prohibition of content"? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS content ban" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/465399.jpg" width="600"></div>
