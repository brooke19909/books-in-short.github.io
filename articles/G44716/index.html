Therefore, in this article we want to talk about one of the five-star hotels in the city called Pattaya.  Garden Cliff Resort Spa - a wonderful resort hotel, built on a beautiful snow-white beach called Crescent Moon.  The complex is surrounded by chic gardens of tropical plants and flowers. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Garden Cliff Resort Spa features traditional Thai d√©cor.  For its decoration, only natural materials were used.  All rooms are made in a special style that creates incredible comfort and harmony.  The complex is located near the center and the international airport. </p><p>  Thailand has many beautiful and amazing places.  But the main sea resort was precisely the city of Pattaya.  But back in the sixties of the last century in its place stood an ordinary fishing village.  Years have passed since then, and gradually this place has gained popularity among tourists.  More than one hundred and twenty hotels have been built on the coast, among which there are expensive fashionable complexes and simple guest houses.  The resort has gained such popularity due to its non-hot climate, fresh sea breeze and beautiful beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garden cliff resort spa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1451539.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By purchasing a tour to this hotel, vacationers can only pay for breakfast or take full board.  Experienced tourists, as a rule, choose the first option, because at lunch you do not want to leave the beach or you can stay on excursions.  In the evening, as a rule, people try to go to the city and sit there in local cafes.  I would like to note that there are plenty of different establishments where you can eat throughout the district, and in Pattaya there are even more.  Therefore, it is simply impossible to stay hungry. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Garden Cliff Resort Spa 5 * (Pattaya) has a sandy beach with small shells and rocky areas.  There are free umbrellas and sunbeds on the coast.  The sea is clean and warm.  Sometimes garbage and algae are washed ashore, but hotel workers are trying to quickly eliminate pollution.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach there are bars and cafes offering tourists soft drinks, snacks and cocktails. </p><h2>  Entertainment <strong></strong></h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Garden Cliff Resort Spa 4 * is located away from the city called Pattaya.  Nevertheless, this does not prevent vacationers from regularly going for walks and excursions, since there are no attractions and special entertainments near the complex itself.  The center can be reached in twenty minutes by taxi, which will cost two hundred baht.  There is also a free shuttle bus six times a day to Central Festival Shopping Center.  You can independently get to the city.  To do this, you need to walk to the main road, and then take a tuk-tuk and get to the right place.  Near the hotel is the temple of Truth, which everyone can visit. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  The Garden Cliff Resort Spa, which we describe in the article, is a quiet and peaceful place for families.  However, being close to the famous city, it is simply impossible to resist, so as not to visit its most famous sights and simply beautiful places. </p><p>  This resort has long been appreciated by tourists from all over the world, not only for its beautiful beaches and active, eventful nightlife, but also for its natural and cultural attractions.  The most important object on the must see list is the famous Big Buddha Hill.  It is interesting to see from the point of view of acquaintance with the cultural heritage of an Asian country.  In fact, this is a large complex of religious monuments, the most important of which is considered to be a gilded Buddha statue. </p><p>  To get to the monument, you have to climb the stairs, decorated with dragons and snakes.  There is even a tradition of recounting steps: if a person is not mistaken in counting, then everything is fine in his life, and if he is mistaken, then something needs to be changed.  The statue is at a height of one hundred twenty meters.  The figure of the Buddha reaches fifteen meters in height.  It really makes a huge impression, it can be seen from anywhere in Pattaya.  The statue looks even more spectacular at night in the light of lights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garden cliff resort spa 5 thailand pattaya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1451536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For parents with children it will be interesting to visit the village of elephants.  This reserve can be called unique.  Here sacred animals live in natural conditions in complete safety.  Currently, about thirty elephants live in the village.  Animal shows are shown daily.  Employees of the reserve tell interesting facts from the life of good-natured giants, and elephants demonstrate their achievements: the ability to play musical instruments, draw and much more. </p><p>  Children will be delighted to visit the Khao Keo Zoo.  The animals in it are kept in a natural environment, and at the same time they can be stroked.  Currently, the zoo occupies eight hundred hectares of land and is considered one of the largest such institutions in the world.  Its entire territory is divided into different zones.  Guests can not only chat with animals, but also watch performances with their participation. </p><p>  To appreciate the nightlife of Pattaya, you should go to the famous Walking Street in the evening.  From six o‚Äôclock in the evening, it becomes a pedestrian mall illuminated by a thousand lights, along which go-go bars are lined up.  However, if you came to rest with children, then you are unlikely to appreciate the nightlife of the city, since Walking Street with all its temptations and unusual shows is not a place for kids. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  For many tourists, a must-have item of the entertainment program is shopping.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter what you want: purchase small souvenirs for relatives or make serious purchases.  Relaxing in the Garden Cliff Resort Spa 5 * (Pattaya), guests will be interested in visiting the floating market.  He appeared relatively recently.  Of course, the market is not as large as its ground-based prototype (0.1 square kilometer), but among the similar water supermarkets, it boldly takes the first place.  Outwardly, this place resembles a residential village built on the water.  Here you will see shopping arcades, entertainment venues, shops, cafes.  This bright and colorful place will certainly be interesting for tourists. </p><h2>  Garden Cliff Resort Spa Pattaya: reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who visited it.  Is Garden Cliff Resort Spa 5 * really good?  The reviews of the guests of the complex are a bit contradictory in some issues, but overall very positive.  The main point that vacationers emphasize is the successful location of the hotel.  As we mentioned, it is located outside the city.  For couples with children, this is a significant plus, because loud music does not interfere with relaxation.  The hotel is perfect for a quiet and measured relaxation.  Young people who want to be closer to the rich nightlife are likely to prefer the complex closer to the center of Pattaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garden cliff resort spa 5 pattaya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1451535.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Garden Cliff Resort Spa (see the article) is on the first line and has its own beach, which is quite a rarity for Thailand.  Who is not the first time resting in this country, already knows that the sea on the coast is not always clean.  To enjoy the clear water, it is better to go to the islands.  As for the hotel's beach, it is a little rocky and small.  However, staff regularly clean it.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas on it. </p><p>  Absolutely all hotel rooms are beautiful, spacious and comfortable.  They have everything that guests need for a carefree vacation.  Quality furniture and traditional Thai interiors create a special atmosphere.  Apartments are cleaned regularly.  On the day of arrival and check-in, a small surprise awaits guests in the form of a fruit basket.  In addition, the hotel staff is very courteous and nice.  Settlement is fast.  If desired, you can replace the number if you are not satisfied with something.  At the hotel, some of the employees understand Russian well, and therefore it can be explained.  Daily evenings are organized with live music.  Most of the guests of the complex are Chinese.  You need to be prepared for this.  There are not so many of our compatriots there. </p><p>  The food is quite normal and of high quality.  Some vacationers note the uniformity of dishes.  However, many hotel complexes sin this.  Given that many tourists at the hotel only have breakfast, the question of monotony is not so relevant.  There are many cafes and restaurants in Pattaya where you can have dinner and lunch.  The main hotel serves delicious lunches and dinners at affordable prices.  What sets Garden Cliff Resort Spa (Pattaya) apart from other hotels is its beautiful and large area, surrounded by greenery and flowers.  Ponds create a special charm.  It is very nice to just walk along the alleys of the complex and enjoy the peace and tranquility. </p><p>  Relaxing at the hotel, guests will certainly wish to visit excursions and see local attractions.  This will help Russian-speaking guides.  However, experienced tourists are not advised to rush to pay for tours, because you can go around all the beautiful and interesting places on your own.  It will cost much less.  In addition, you will not be attached to the group and you can manage your time yourself.  You need to get to Pattaya, and there it will be quite simple to find all the attractions.  According to vacationers, it is certainly worth visiting all the most recommended places and get acquainted with the peculiarities of culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garden cliff resort spa 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1451537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you just plan to walk around the city, then you can use hotel buses, which regularly go to the most popular shopping center.  You just need to remember that they must be pre-registered at the reception. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel has one serious drawback - it is paid internet, the quality of which is poor.  As a rule, Wi-Fi is free in five-star complexes.  As for the hotel category, various tour operators position it as a five-star and as a four-star hotel.  In general, it should be understood that Garden Cliff Resort is not a pathos place at all.  Therefore, buying a tour here, you should not rely on the fact that you will end up in a chic five-star complex.  However, here you can relax and not overpay the extra money. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Garden Cliff Resort is a beautiful, modern Thai-style hotel that is value-for-money.  Therefore, the complex can be recommended for a quiet family vacation. </p>
