    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Inspired by the idea to build the best musical theater in New York for instrumental musicians, E. Carnegie finances the project and employs true professionals.  It was necessary to clearly plan the size of the room, the area, the height of the ceilings.  Every little thing was important to create good acoustics.  The project was carried out by W. Tathill, who managed to create a unique building.  The acoustics of space still remains at the highest level.  It is worth noting that the construction of the facility took more than a million dollars. </p><p>  Such a high cost was associated with some design features.  As the main material, only masonry was used.  The decoration was mixed terracotta and sandstone.  The severity and simplicity of the exterior of the building contrasts with the richness and brightness in the interiors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the color scheme of the halls (and there are only three of them), red and gold shades are used.  The luxury and magnificence of the atmosphere is emphasized by the light that floods the whole space.  At the same time, <span>the Carnegie Hall</span> concert <span>hall</span> lacks bulky decor elements and large chandeliers that can adversely affect the acoustics. </p><h2>  Concerts </h2><p>  The opening of Carnegie Hall took place in May 1881.  At the very first concert, an orchestra performed under the leadership of P. Tchaikovsky.  Subsequently, L. Pavarotti, S. Rachmaninov, I. Stravinsky and many other world-famous musicians were on the same stage.  And not only classical music was performed within the walls of the building.  Over the years, you could see David Bowie, Bob Dylan, even groups such as The Beatles and The <span>Rolling Stones.</span>  Recently, some opera performances have been held in the music hall. </p><p>  The presence of three halls allows holding several events at the same time in the building: from crowded performances to chamber concerts.  In small rooms, sometimes there are lectures for beginner musicians and amateurs.  Among the jazz performers who appeared on the Carnegie Hall stage, the names of Ella Fitzgerald, Billy Holiday, and trumpeter Davis Miles are worth mentioning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Halls </h2><p>  The main hall, named after A. Stern, accommodates up to 2800 people.  The seats are located on five tiers.  Do not worry if you do not get tickets in the front rows: from any place the sound quality will be perfect.  In addition, viewers do not have to climb the balcony on foot, as the room is equipped with several elevators.  However, it is worth hurrying with the purchase of tickets: it is likely that there will be no offers left a few days before the event. </p><p>  The smaller halls accommodate up to 600 visitors in one and about 260 in the other.  The middle one is listed as Zenkel Hall.  The chairs in it stretch in a semicircle over a small stage.  The small hall, despite its size, looks especially solemn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carnegie concert hall" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2080356.jpg"></div>  The walls are covered with gilded paintings, the audience seats are traditionally bright scarlet.
