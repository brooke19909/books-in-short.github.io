Staying in this country leaves a deep mark in the soul of man.  Ancient monuments of antiquity, ancient ruins, streets that Hercules, Homer, Aristotle walked on ... The dwellings of the <span>ancient Greek gods,</span> from whom, although there were not many, they preserved the most important thing - the unique spirit of ancient times - the time of Greek mythology and the adventures of heroes. </p><p>  Mainland Greece is markedly different from the island of the country.  It was on it that most of the temples, settlements and statues were preserved.  For example, the ancient city of the Acropolis with its pagan temples in Athens, Delphi, where oracles once prophesied and held the <span>Delphic Games</span> in honor of the Greek <span>god Apollo, the</span> kingdom of Mycenae and ancient Olympia ... It‚Äôs impossible to count, because each <span>Greek city</span> has its own history and unique spirit. </p><p>  The island part of Greece, although it has preserved the remains of its history, has nevertheless turned into a center of youth entertainment and adapted to tourists, because it depends on their spending how much the country's budget is filled. </p><p>  The Dodecanisi Islands are the most popular among tourists (twelve are translated from Greek ‚Äúdodeca‚Äù, ‚ÄúNishi‚Äù is an island).  The first largest island is Rhodes, then Karpathos.  Kos island Greece occupies the third largest space on the Dodecanese.  Let's get to know him better. </p><p>  Kos island in Greece is called the "Aegean Sea Garden" because it is famous for its unique terrestrial and underwater plant world, resembling paradise.  This is one of the most environmentally friendly places on the planet.  But besides the rich vegetation, the island of Kos Greece is famous for its attractions, which you need to spend several days to explore.  A vibrant nightlife, so characteristic of this European country, will make even the most lazy tourist a good rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of the island of Kos, Greece chose the namesake.  The city of Kos is famous for its attractions, beaches, the azure coast of the Aegean Sea and, of course, the Castle of the Knights, which were erected in the 15th century by the Knights of St. John.  In addition, as in any vibrant city in Greece, Kos has its own archaeological part and its own market or agora, which the Greeks call it, to this day. </p><p>  On the island of <span>Kos Greece, hotels</span> are famous for the fact that their beaches are covered with volcanic sand - golden, white and black.  The island of Kos Greece has preserved its other attractions to this day more than perfectly.  These are the ruins of the temple of Asclepius, which in Greek mythology was a healing god.  Until today, the famous tree has survived - the plane tree of Hippocrates, which, according to legend, was planted by an ancient Greek doctor himself.  The ancient ruins of Fort Pili will also leave a lasting impression on tourists. </p><p>  In Kos Greece, hotels are scattered throughout.  Here you can always find a hotel for every taste and budget - from fashionable five-star to two-star.  In addition, if you do not like the best hotels on the island of Kos or hotel stops, you can also rent apartments - their choice is also wide.  But on Kos Greece, hotels are the best place to relax, because they always include at least breakfast. </p><p>  If you decide to combine an inexpensive price and excellent conditions for relaxation, then the island of Kos Hotel Atlantis is always at your service.  This four-star hotel is located in the capital of the island, two kilometers from the center of the capital.  Built to all modern standards, the Atlantis hotel complex will always welcome guests of the island.  The location of the hotel allows you to enjoy views of the <span>Aegean Sea</span> or the island of Pserimos.  This is an ideal place to relax with the whole family, as the hotel is far from nightlife. </p><p>  So, on the island of Kos Greece, hotels are waiting for their visitors.  Plan your trip and your vacation will be unforgettable! </p>
