Such a little thing as a doll-box ‚ÄúYoung lady in a hood‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeautiful Barbie‚Äù must be sure to please any girl.

    <h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  How are handmade dolls made?  In fact, the work should not cause any particular difficulties.  Therefore, this craft is ideal for co-creation with a child. </p><p>  For work, you will need such materials: a doll, a container for a future casket, some synthetic winterizer or foam rubber, fabric, beads, lace and decorative ribbons, sewing supplies and a gun with hot glue.  As a basis for the box, any plastic jar with a lid or a bottle is suitable.  The splendor of the doll‚Äôs outfit will depend on the diameter of the container.  Therefore, to create a royal dress, it is necessary to choose a container of sufficient size.  For such a box, an ice cream bucket and a two-liter plastic bottle of water or a drink may well be suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll casket mk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/372479.jpg?1397465471997" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  Before you start directly working on the box, you need to do some preparatory work: from the doll cut the lower part of the body slightly below the waist line;  the height of the bottle or bucket is adjusted so that they correspond to the length of the legs, and the future product looked proportionally.  Next, the part is cut into two parts.  If you take a plastic bottle for work, then it will be most convenient to work with a neck and a bottom.  Therefore, measure it from above and below, and throw out the middle.  So, when the materials for the base are prepared, they begin to assemble and decorate, as a result of which the original casket doll comes out.  MK will be very appropriate here. </p><h2>  Decorating the bottom of the casket </h2><p>  <span>DIY casket dolls</span> are made quite simply, and perhaps the stage of decorating the lower part will be the most difficult, because the rest can be dealt with only with glue.  Here you will also need <span>sewing accessories,</span> fabric, foam rubber or synthetic winterizer.  First, the inside of the upholstery is sewn.  To do this, trace the bottom of the base onto the fabric, make seam allowances and cut it out, duplicate the bottom of the fabric with a soft filler and stitch it with beautiful stitches.  Next, measure the height of the plastic base and the resulting circle around the perimeter, cut out a strip of fabric, lay a side seam and sew the finished bottom into this part.  After all these manipulations, the cross-linked upholstery is placed inside the plastic base, the bottom of which is previously coated with glue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll box young lady in hood" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/372476.jpg?1397465501557" width="399"></div>  Further, a foam rubber circle is glued to the bottom from the outside to hide the ribbed surface.  In this form, the base is placed on top of a previously cut circle of fabric, laying the folds, and close the outer sides of the bottle.  At the junction, the inner and outer upholstery is tucked, stitched and masked, imposed on a beautiful braid.  At this stage, you must not forget to insert a piece of silicone tape into the seam, which will connect the upper and lower parts of the casket doll.  With your own hands, it is easy to make another mount, for example, on a chain, which will add charm to the craft.

To do this, cut the neck of the bottle so that the body fits snugly into the hole.  If a bucket is used in the work, then the doll is glued to its lid with hot glue.  The upper part of the bottle or the lid is decorated according to the same principle as the lower base by inserting the second end of the silicone tape into the seam.  Only the fabric of the outer upholstery in this case is cut out not in the shape of a circle, but simply with a strip and fixed it at the waist.  The doll box, the MK of which is described in this article, will come out quite roomy and durable, which is very important for the thing that the child will use. </p><h2>  Decorating the casket doll </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make a lot of interesting outfits for such a lady with a secret.  It can be an airy lace dress with a huge number of frills or an almost royal velvet robe with gold trim.  A kanzashi doll-box with a chic skirt of petals and flowers in this style will also look beautiful.  The restriction here can only be the craftswoman‚Äôs own imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doll casket country of masters" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/372475.jpg?1397465542387" width="500"></div>  One simple option is a dress with ruffles of ribbons or lace.  To create it, the finishing material is collected with a needle into folds and glued to the casket upholstery.  It is very important to calculate the distance between the rows of frills, so that the upper tier of the lower part of the casket passes under the very top, and subsequent frills fill the entire dress to the doll‚Äôs waist.  The bodice of the dress is formed from a satin ribbon at the place of its connection with the frill, this joint is masked with sequin braid, satin ribbon or small flowers.

    <p>  To create a harmonious image, it is absolutely necessary to supplement the doll‚Äôs outfit with such accessories as an umbrella, hat and gloves.  To make these elements is not difficult.  For an umbrella, you need a tube for juice, which is pasted over with tape, a circle of fabric and a strip of lace, which are collected with a needle and thread into a tube in the form of a closed umbrella.  Gloves are made from pieces of lace that stick to the doll‚Äôs hands.  To make a hat, the ribbon is collected with a needle in the form of a bundle skirt, and a large rose is glued on top.  It is these details that make the image complete and harmonious. </p><p>  It is worth noting that such a creation can be not only a wonderful gift, but also a well-sold product.  Many lovers of beauty will want to have such a trinket as a casket doll.  "Country of Masters" is a great place where you can not only show your masterpiece, but also find people interested in buying such creations. </p>
