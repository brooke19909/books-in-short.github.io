To date, it is known about 8 planets and more than 63 satellites located in this system.  Many asteroids and meteors of various sizes are discovered, as well as comets, which intersect the entire system in their orbits. </p><p>  Which scientist first described the solar system?  How is it created and is there a chance of having life in other galaxies? </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the solar system was first described by a scientist named Nikolai Copernicus back in the 16th century.  Before him, there were very poor ideas about the location in space.  It was believed that the Earth is the <span>center of the universe,</span> and all objects revolve around it.  Despite the lack of modern devices for the study of space, Copernicus was able to accurately determine the location of the Earth in outer space.  He first made a model of our solar system, presenting it as heliocentric.  This means that all the planets known at that time revolve around the Sun and around its axis. </p>

    <h2>  Galileo <strong>and</strong> other scientists </h2><p>  In the next century, using the primitive telescope, the solar system was first described by a scientist - Galileo Galilei.  So there was accurate evidence of the heliocentric system, which Copernicus spoke of.  Galileo discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter.  Although it should be recalled that the religious leaders of that time strongly resisted the model of the heliocentric solar system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The 18th century was marked by new discoveries in the field of astronomy.  The solar system was first described by a scientist who discovered a hitherto unknown planet - Uranus.  Following him were discovered 2 satellites of Saturn and 2 satellites of Uranus. </p><p>  The peak of research on the solar system occurred in the middle of the 20th century.  And here the solar system was first described by a cosmonaut who first saw it with his own eyes.  Further flights into space confirmed the heliocentricity of our galaxy.  Today, the launch of the orbital station and satellites, as well as flights to other planets, expand our understanding of our galaxy. </p><h2>  The solar system and its planets </h2><p>  The sun with its planets, belonging to the Milky Way galaxy, is the most studied part of the universe known to us.  It consists of 8 planets that are visible in the sky in the form of small stars reflecting the light of the nearest star to us - the Sun.  The planets were named after the deities worshiped by the peoples of Ancient Rome and Greece. </p>

All the planets of our system are divided into two groups: terrestrial and giant planets.  Consider coming to us.

In addition to the Earth, these include: Mercury, Venus and Mars.  Of course, the most studied of all these planets is the unique Earth.  With its unimaginable landscape and beauty, the astronauts observing her from space speak of a blue pearl in cold space. </p><p>  Studying the composition of the Earth using various seismic instruments, scientists came to the conclusion that inside the planet there is a red-hot core surrounded by a mantle.  A small dense surface is called bark.  It was these studies that helped determine that the other three terrestrial planets have a similar composition and are very similar to each other. </p><h2>  Mercury </h2><p>  The planet closest to the Sun - Mercury - is small in comparison with the Earth.  It is 20 times smaller than the Earth‚Äôs mass and has dimensions 2.5 times smaller than that of the Earth.  The rotation speed around its axis is 58.7 Earth days, and Mercury makes a revolution around the Sun in 88 Earth days.  This planet is so close to the star that the temperature on the sunny side is more than 400 degrees Celsius, and on the reverse side everything freezes at a temperature of -200 degrees. </p><p>  Only in 2009, scientists were able to compile the first maps of the planet, relying on images obtained from spacecraft launched to it.  Mercury does not have its own atmosphere and is very similar to the satellite of our planet - the Moon.  Due to its proximity to the sun and an elliptical orbit, research is very difficult. </p><h2>  <strong>Beauty</strong> Venus </h2><p>  This is the second planet remote from the sun with its own atmosphere.  You might think that life is possible on Venus, but, unfortunately, this is not so.  The atmosphere of this planet is very dense and aggressive.  For the most part, it consists of carbon dioxide, but it also contains toxic substances such as sulfuric acid. </p><p>  Venus revolves around the Sun faster than the Earth and, interestingly, in the opposite direction from it.  A turnover is completed in 225 days, and around its axis in 243 days.  Due to the density of the atmosphere, the temperature on the planet exceeds 500 degrees Celsius.  Thus, it turns out to be <span>the hottest planet in the solar system.</span> </p><h2>  Earth is a Blue Pearl </h2><p>  Planet Earth is the most explored of all the planets.  It has been studied since time immemorial, but only the 20th century was able to reveal the answers to previously asked questions.  What is her form, what is it hanging on, and other issues.  The first flights into space confirmed the assumptions of scientists and confirmed undeniable truths: the Earth is round and hangs on nothing in outer space.  Today we perfectly know the composition of the atmosphere, and thanks to it, all living things can safely exist. </p>

    <p>  It also turned out that our planet has a magnetic belt that is able to protect all life from the effects of harmful sunlight and solar wind.  These disturbances can be observed in the form of northern and southern lights. </p><p>  It should also be said about the magnificent <span>satellite of the Earth</span> - the Moon.  It has an equal velocity of rotation both around its axis and around the Earth, due to this, only one side can be observed.  It is this that contributes to the fact that the Moon is also a kind of shield for the planet and takes the largest number of falling meteorites onto itself.  The surface of the moon is well studied, many craters or lowlands are named after scientists who discovered them.  So far, it remains the only <span>cosmic object that</span> man has visited. </p><h2>  Mars </h2><p>  The fourth of the terrestrial planets.  The red planet is fraught with many secrets.  The atmosphere of the planet is quite light, it contains mainly carbon dioxide, nitrogen, partly oxygen and many other substances.  On Mars, wind storms often rage, where the wind speed reaches 100 m / s.  Since the remnants of water were discovered on the planet, scientists assumed that it may have had life in the past.  The year on Mars is 687 days, and the temperature does not rise above minus 23 degrees in the summer.  At this temperature, life, in the human sense of the word, on Mars is impossible. </p>

Scientists first found water on a planet outside the solar system, but now this is only an assumption.  On a planet called Osiris, located 150 light-years away, particles of vapor were allegedly detected in spectral analysis.  Many times, scientists' attempts to find extraterrestrial civilizations have been unsuccessful.
