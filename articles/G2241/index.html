It is the left tributary of the well-known Don and is a very calm winding pond, surrounded along its entire length by wooded, picturesque shores.  Voronezh is a river with a length of 1403 kilometers, the left bank of which is gentle, with an abundance of small lakes and old ladies, and the right one is steep and high. </p><h2>  A brief description of the Voronezh River </h2>

    <p>  The Voronezh River flows through the territory of the Lipetsk, Tambov and Voronezh Regions.  It was formed at the merger of Forest Voronezh and Floor Voronezh.  It is a typical plain river.  It starts at the village of Pushkino (Ryazan region, Uholovsky district).  The confluence of the two rivers takes place near the village of Novonikolskoye <span>(Tambov Region,</span> Michurinsky District).  After that, the river flows northwest for 60 km.  There, the Stanovaya Ryas flows into it.  Five kilometers from the confluence, the river turns sharply from north to south, while slightly deviating to the south-west.  If you look at the map, we will see that the Voronezh River is a pond on which there are three cities - Voronezh, Lipetsk and Michurinsk.  You can also see that along the banks there are many different villages.  And, for example, below the village of Stupino, the <span>Voronezh Reserve</span> adjoins the left bank <span>.</span>  It will be very interesting for tourists with children and novice travelers.  There are several tourist routes along the river.  Let's travel a bit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Let's start the journey from Michurinsk </h2>

    <p>  Many have heard about this city.  From these places the river Voronezh begins.  The map confirms this.  Michurinsk is an all-Union center for scientific fruit growing.  The city was founded as a fortress to protect against nomadic peoples in 1636.  In the city there are: the house-museum of I.V. Michurin, the museum of local lore, the drama theater, the Ilyinsky church - an architectural monument, designed by V.V. Rastrelli, a famous architect. </p><p>  Michurinsk is located on the steep bank of Forest Voronezh, from where we will begin our short trip.  Through several fairly large loops, the river connects with Floor Voronezh.  The river itself flows from this confluence, which is the topic of this article.  Her course is calm, the width is 20-30 meters. </p><p>  A little further, having accepted a large influx - the Stanovoi Rassa, it becomes noticeably full-flowing.  On the right bank, high, mainly small settlements are located, on the left - forests.  Soon, in front of the village of Good, we will see a destroyed dam.  Depending on the experience of travelers and the water level, the dam can be passed along the channel along the left bank or along the spillway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further, water meadows stretch, then floodplain forests.  Behind the Goritsy there is a school tourist camp, next to which you can equip your own, for recreation.  Soon motor ships will begin to meet, which are a clear sign of approaching Lipetsk. </p><h2>  We are in Lipetsk </h2>

    <p>  This city arose in the XIII century, but its development began at the end of the XVII century, when Peter I made the Azov campaigns.  Even by his decree, ironworks were built in Lipetsk, which provided the fleet under construction in Voronezh with the necessary metal.  A little later, the city began to develop as a mud and balneological resort.  At the moment, Lipetsk is a large cultural and industrial center of Russia.  Here are: the Museum of Local Lore, the Drama Theater, the <span>house of Peter I, the</span> Museum of Local Lore and other architectural monuments of the XVII-XVIII centuries.  We get to the middle part of the city and see that the river spread widely in this place, and it turned out to be a reservoir with a width of 700 meters and a length of two kilometers.  Below Lipetsk, we see that villages stretch almost continuously along the right bank, and deciduous and pine forests stretch along the left. </p><h2>  Between Lipetsk and the village of Ramon </h2>

After the village of Troitskoye, it is divided into ducts, the current here is weak, but it is addictive, so you need to carefully monitor the route so as not to be in the dense duct.  In this section, the forest recedes from the water and reappears near the villages of Karamyshevo and Pada. </p><p>  On the left bank, from the village of Verbilovo, on a large territory there is a hunting farm Kulikovskoye.  If desired, you can obtain permission from the farm department and inspect dams and beaver settlements.  At the village of Manino, the river is again divided into channels.  Soon we get to the mouth of the river Izlegoschi - a very picturesque place where you can easily get a rest.  Even lower is the village of Karachun, which is located on the right bank.  These places are famous for their pottery. </p><p>  15 kilometers from Karachun is one of the oldest settlements in these parts - Ramony.  Here in the XVI century, under Tsar Peter I, there was a shipyard.  The palace, the former summer residence of the Princess of Oldenburg, is also well preserved.  It was built in the Old English style, a monument to the local native S.I.  Mosin, the inventor of the well-known Russian three-ruler.  Unusual and unforgettable Voronezh river - photos taken on its banks only confirm this. </p><h2>  From Ramoni to the end of the journey - the city of Voronezh </h2><p>  A small railway line departs from Ramoni on the left bank.  On it you can get to the Office of the Voronezh Reserve.  This is Grafskaya station.  If you get permission to visit it, you will get a lot of pleasure visiting the beaver farm, aviaries, beaver settlements and the museum. </p>

    <p>  Further to the regional center, the entire right bank has a very picturesque view due to the beautiful broad-leaved forests.  Having passed under the Chertovitsky highway bridge, the Voronezh River turns into a reservoir, which stretches almost to the Don - 40 km.  Here, in bad weather, there is already a high wave, and swimming becomes very dangerous for tourists without the appropriate experience. </p><p>  Our campaign ends in the city of Voronezh, which was founded in 1585 as a fortress.  There are many architectural monuments.  Some of them are the Potemkin Palace, built in 1760, and the St. Nicholas Church, erected even earlier - in 1720.  There are also four theaters, fine art museums and a local history museum. </p><h2>  Voronezh River - a tributary of the Don </h2><p>  The map of the rivers of Russia clearly shows us that the Voronezh River is one of the many tributaries of the largest body of water in the European part of Russia - the Don.  Yes, in Europe it is second only to the Danube, Dnieper and Volga in the catchment area.  Its catchment is 422 thousand km <sup>2</sup> , and its length is 1870 km.  It starts at an altitude of 180 meters above sea level, in the northern part of the Central Russian Upland.  Previously, the source of this great river was considered the place of exit from the famous Ivan Lake, but this is not so.  Now, such a place is often called the <span>Shat reservoir,</span> located north of Novomoskovsk, the city of the Tula region.  This is also not true, the reservoir is even fenced off by a railway dam from the river. </p><h2>  A little about Don </h2>

    <p>  The real source of the Don is located at a distance of 2-3 kilometers to the east, in the park.  It even installed the ‚ÄúSource of the Don‚Äù - an architectural complex, although the source in this complex is powered by a water supply network, that is, of artificial origin.  Navigation on the river operates from the mouth to Voronezh, the distance is 1590 km. </p><p>  There is a place where the Don is very close to another large river - the Volga.  A map of the rivers of Russia defines this place as a district of the city of Kalach.  The distance between them is only 80 km.  Here, both rivers in 1952 were connected by the navigable <span>Volga-Don canal.</span> </p><p>  Some more information.  A dam was built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Tsimlyanskaya, which raises the water level by 27 meters.  Its length is 12.8 km.  Thus, the Tsimlyansk reservoir was formed.  It has a capacity of 21.5 km <sup>3</sup> , useful - 12.6 km <sup>3</sup> , an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2600 km <sup>3</sup> , stretching from Golubinskaya to Volgodonsk.  Of course, the dam provides benefits - a hydroelectric power station is located on it.  The waters from this reservoir are used for irrigation and irrigation of the Salsk steppes and other steppe territories of the Volgograd and Rostov regions. </p><h2>  Tributaries of the Don River </h2><p>  As already noted, Don stretches for almost 2000 km.  Throughout its length, it feeds on many tributaries, both large and small.  The largest are three: </p><ol><li>  Dipper, on the left side, 767 km - length, 34700 km¬≤ - area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pool. </li><li>  Hoper - on the left side, 1,008 km - length, 61100 km¬≤ - area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pool. </li><li>  Seversky Donetsk, on the right side, 1016 km - length, 99600 km¬≤ - basin area. </li></ol><p>  There are so many small influxes that only listing them will take a whole page.  Their length is from two kilometers to 1862. Some do not even have a name. </p><h2>  Rest on the Voronezh River </h2>

    <p>  It is clear that such a beautiful vast area could not be used for the rest of local residents, tourists and travelers.  Why are these places attractive?  For example, Voronezh (river) is characterized by: </p><ol><li>  The beauty of nature, crystal clear air, an abundance of fish in ponds. </li><li>  A variety of living conditions - for any wallet and desire.  Comfortable buildings, stylish cottages and summer houses with a minimum of amenities for every taste.  "Savages" can relax on the coast in their tents. </li><li>  Well-maintained life for those staying in sanatoriums, rest homes.  Three meals a day, dancing, a cafe - only part of everyday life. </li><li>  A relaxing holiday.  If desired, you can accommodate so that no one will bother you.  You will not even see the surrounding houses. </li><li>  An abundance of possible entertainment. </li><li>  Informative excursion programs. </li><li>  The possibility of a full beach holiday.  The water temperature in the Voronezh River allows this. </li></ol><p>  In order to more specifically consider options for recreation, we take one of these objects. </p><h2>  The recreation center ‚ÄùDivnorechye‚Äù is a good option to relax after working days. </h2>
