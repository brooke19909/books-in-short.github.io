    <h2>  Rest in the suburbs </h2><p>  With children it is not always easy to find a good place.  And the problem is not that they do not like hotels or too expensive resorts.  For most children, climate change affects health.  Not all kids (however, this applies to adults no less) endure long journeys easily and painlessly.  Acclimatization alone lasts at least a week.  Is it worth the risk?  If you are a resident of the capital and think about where it is better to relax with children, try looking for a camp site, a boarding house or a sanatorium somewhere nearby, in the suburbs.  This is both not so expensive and useful, and there is no need to be afraid of any acclimatization.  For those who choose a vacation in the suburbs with children, we recommend that you take a closer look at such park hotels as Atlas, Krankino, and Olympus.  If hotels do not surprise you, try settling in the territory of the Yakhonti natural resort.  Those who like the spirit of the Wild West will probably like the heliopark with the eloquent name of ‚ÄúCountry Resort‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Atlas" </h2><p>  Specially built for youth outdoor activities.  This is a high-level hotel, hidden in a mixed forest near the Rozhayka River.  There are almost two hundred rooms in the hotel building, and for those who prefer to live separately, there are two-story comfortable cottages.  For vacationers equipped sports and playgrounds with swings, ropes, bars.  Younger children may like the mini-club, in the program of which there are contests, sports contests, dances, and games in the water.  Parents who want to relax and truly relax will be helped by qualified babysitters.  In winter, little guests can ride on a skating rink or a slide.  Sports equipment can be rented by renting a car.  Children under three years stay free in the parents room.  Meals - buffet. </p><h2>  Krankino </h2>

    <p>  The real one.  Natural.  With a healing lake and relict forest.  Here, wonderful, virgin landscapes and at the same time - well-developed infrastructure.  And administrators promise a rich entertainment program for both children and adults.  None of your family will be bored. </p><p>  For a family stay, any of the three hundred rooms is suitable.  You can stay in a ‚Äúpersonal suite‚Äù, ‚Äúapartments with a kitchen‚Äù, ‚Äúfamily‚Äù or ‚Äúone-story cottage with a bathhouse‚Äù.  Children under 6 years old do not have to pay.  Know: if you come to rest with children, there will be no problems with food - a buffet, three times a day, is already included in the payment for the room. </p><p>  At the resort, professional animators will engage in the entertainment of children.  By the way, you can also take part in various shows, games, contests and sporting events.  A teacher will work with the smallest children. </p><p>  The resort also has its own aquacenter with a swimming pool, water slides, fountains.  If you wish, you can contact a trainer who will train your child in swimming. </p><p>  The resort has opened its own mini-zoo, where you can introduce children to various animals.  In a house with the sincere name "Russian Compound" you can arrange a real holiday (for example, to celebrate a birthday).  The services of governesses and babysitting are available. </p><h2>  Country Resort (heliopark) </h2><p>  The name alone speaks of an unusual style.  Planning a vacation in the suburbs with children and dreaming of the Wild West?  Then to you in the "Country"!  Rich entertainment is guaranteed here.  <span>The Dubna River</span> and the unique location in the pine forest will help to make your vacation unforgettable.  Couples are offered hotel buildings.  The rooms are improved layout.  ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù rooms are a kind of apartment with a kitchen area and several rooms (from one to three).  If you don‚Äôt want to cook, always help out the buffet. </p><p>  The choice of entertainment is also rich here: water slides, jacuzzi, swimming pools, donkey riding, horses, dog sledding.  There is a large playground, a zoo, a club.  And about daily contests, competitions, outdoor games, evening show programs and discos, let me worry about a group of professional animators. </p><p>  As you can see, a full-fledged vacation in Russia with children is not a problem, the main thing is to want. </p><h2>  Anapa </h2><p>  Where is it better to relax with children, if you don‚Äôt feel like staying in the suburbs?  Of course, at sea.  A great option - Anapa.  For children, this place is suitable in all respects: a mild climate, and a lot of entertainment.  By the way, there is a boarding house in Anapa with the name "Black Sea".  Of course, he is not one of a kind, but this is what you should be guided by when choosing a place to stay.  Holidays with children and the Black Sea are not always well compatible concepts.  Especially if you have to stand by the stove instead of bathing, or when the time allotted for a walk has to be spent on cleaning or washing.  It‚Äôs familiar, right?  So, such boarding houses solve many of your problems.  And among the pleasant surprises there are multiple discounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in egypt with children" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/471441.jpg" width="600"></div>  Holidays in September with a child, for example, will cost slightly less than in the same July.  And this despite the ‚Äúvelvet‚Äù season.  At this time, true connoisseurs of relaxation try to come to the sea.  This is understandable: the heat has already subsided a bit, the sea is still warm, the influx of holidaymakers has significantly decreased.  Real grace!  Importantly, do not forget to pay attention to the promotional offers of boarding houses.  Holidays with children "Black Sea" offers to extend for a day, and for free.  For almost three months in this boarding house there is a promotion ‚Äúfor a week of stay - a day as a gift‚Äù.  It turns out, and it is beneficial for you, and the children are pleased.

    <h2>  Spain </h2><p>  Why not?  If you still want to leave for a joint holiday abroad, take a look at Spain.  The most favorite place of all vacationers is the amusement park "Port Aventura".  It is considered the second largest in Europe after Disneyland.  Tens of thousands of visitors come here every year. </p><p>  The territory of the entertainment center is impressive in size.  It has its own parks, lakes, gardens, <span>water slides,</span> swings and endless attractions.  Want to ride a fire-breathing dragon on horseback?  Do you want to feel like the real cowboy from the Wild West?  Or decided to spend the evening on bright shows?  All of these features are available to visitors at Port Aventura.  While the children will have fun on the rides and eat cotton candy, parents can sit in a cafe (cuisines of different nations), ride on one of the many gondolas, buy souvenirs made by artisans in the same park.  Visitors to ‚ÄúPort Aventura‚Äù will no longer have a question about where to relax with their children. </p><p>  If you decide to come here, pay attention to the nearest hotels ‚ÄúPort Aventura‚Äù, ‚ÄúCaribe‚Äù, ‚ÄúEl Paso‚Äù, ‚ÄúGold River‚Äù.  They are located very close.  Level - "four stars."  Managers are well aware of what a family vacation with children is.  The proximity of their hotels to the amusement park simply obliges you to maintain a decent standard.  That is why cowboys can meet you in the halls, for living you can choose the room of Woody Woodpecker known to everyone, and only half the cost will be taken from you for placing a child.  In a word, there are many surprises, and you can talk about them endlessly. </p><h2>  Italy </h2><p>  Holidays with children in August here will be simply impeccable.  If you are not afraid of a sharp change in climate, come to Italy.  There is something to show the children.  This is an amazing landscape, and a lot of attractions, and local cuisine, and the gentle sun, and the warm sea.  This country is loved by many.  Italy offers vacationers wide sandy well-maintained beaches, beautiful nature and a rich infrastructure of resorts and individual hotels.  Many are equipped for families with children.  Here you can easily find restaurants with children's menus, specialized clubs, playgrounds, pools, animation programs.  Most hotels provide babysitting services (in case the couple decides to go face-to-face or go on an excursion). </p><p>  Vacationers respond well to the resort of Milano Marittima and the Mare e Pineta 4 * Super hotel.  This place is considered the most respectable: cedar and pine groves, sandy shores, gentle slopes, clean air and, of course, specially equipped playgrounds and rooms, mini-clubs, and a rich menu.  This is the place where it is better to relax with children, although for two Milano Martittima is a paradise ... </p><p>  ‚ÄúLe Soleil 4 *‚Äù is also noteworthy - this hotel belongs to the resort of Lido Esolo (Venetian Riviera).  It is located almost on the seashore.  The sand on the beaches is shallow, "golden".  Due to the microclimate of this area there are no strong winds, so the sea never storms.  A lot of entertainment is organized for children, including a moon and water parks, children's pools, playgrounds.  Babysitting services are also available.  This hotel is ideal for families: the cleanest sea, almost always good weather, amazing landscapes, rich fauna.  The surrounding towns are very colorful.  The hotel is almost immersed in the greenery of a beautifully designed garden.  You can stay in the bungalow and in the building.  Both children and parents will enjoy good animation, discos, aerobics, sports tournaments, windsurfing and much more.  Babysitting services are also available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest with children with meals" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/471465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cyprus (holidays with children, hotels) </h2><p>  Another wonderful place.  The main cities and resorts at the same time are Larnaca, Protaras, Paphos, Ayia Napa, Limassol.  What are the benefits of relaxation?  Firstly, here the summer begins a little earlier than in the Mediterranean as a whole.  The climate is dry and, most importantly, healing.  Therefore, people come here not only to relax and see the sights, but also for the sake of recovery.  True, the Russians cannot enter here without a visa.  This, of course, is a minus.  However, the visa regime is simplified, and registration does not take much time.  In Cyprus, there are many hotels adapted to the needs of children (with clubs, venues, animation, water hills).  Many of them are both comfortable and inexpensive, equivalent to four-star ones.  I must say that Cyprus is largely dependent on tourists and vacationers, so the competition here is healthy.  Even the ‚Äútwo stars‚Äù will be air-conditioned, and in stores you can easily buy everything that you took to your child at home. </p><p>  The level of service in hotels is high, regardless of level.  The food, as a rule, includes only breakfast.  The higher the category of the hotel, the greater the likelihood that there will be a private, adjacent beach.  True, in this case, the distance to the city center will also grow.  Please note that in the ‚Äútwo-star‚Äù animation will not be offered to you, and the range of services there is smaller.  But clean beds and the absence of cockroaches are definitely guaranteed.  In Ayia Napa, the ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù will be on the first line, without buildings and roads between the sea and the building, but to the beach - at least 150 m. But in Limassol, you can find "treshki" almost on the shore.  The territory of Cyprus is divided into "British", "Turkish", "Greek".  Russian tour operators are trying to pay attention to the latter, since it has been better mastered in the tourism sector, hotels are more comfortable, and there is more entertainment.  These are just the cities that were previously listed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family holidays with children" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/471416.jpg" width="419"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Egypt with children </h2><p>  If you decide to visit this corner, be sure to visit the water parks ‚ÄúCleo Park‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlbatross Jangle‚Äù.  These are impressive modern water sports complexes for people of all ages.  There are a lot of attractions (there are not for the faint of heart), bars, cafes.  The cost of visiting for an adult is approximately 30 cu, for children - cheaper (15-20 cu).  Safety requirements reinforced.  You can ride a roller coaster only with a rug and a circle.  Children under ten years old will not be able to visit part of the attractions (even if their parents are nearby).  Such strict rules are created solely for the safety of the little ones. </p><p>  Be sure to take a boat trip to the Tiran skeleton.  Here is a nature reserve with a truly stunning underwater world.  On the island you can go snorkeling, admire the fantastic coral reefs, the inhabitants of the sea. </p><p>  Another affordable activity is camel riding.  This is probably one of the main entertainment for those who come here for the first time.  You can make it both on the beaches and on field trips.  Do not forget to agree on the price of the trip before you sit on a camel. </p>
