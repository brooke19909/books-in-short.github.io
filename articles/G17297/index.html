But it is not in vain that experienced craftsmen recommend starting the path to perfection with simple, but effectively textured patterns.  They train hands perfectly, adjusting a certain tension due to repeating loops over and over.  And the finished knitted fabric, made by a small creeping pattern, will hide all the flaws, if the knitter is just going to mastery.  One of such universal patterns is considered "Corn." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting corn pattern" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993854.jpg" width="600"></div>  In different sources, this picture is called differently - "Hedgehogs", "Nodules", "Scales", etc., but various names only emphasize its versatility.  In this article we will talk about <span>how to knit the</span> "Corn" pattern with knitting needles, which tools are best used for this.  Let's talk about the composition of the yarn and its optimal thickness.

    <h2>  Features and properties of yarn </h2><p>  Usually they start work with the choice of yarn, which is most suitable for a particular pattern.  This is the basis of this type of needlework, such as knitting.  The Corn pattern is democratic: made of threads quite thick, it looks no worse than a fabric knitted from traditional medium yarn.  But in order to fill your hand in its implementation, it is better to start with threads of medium thickness, the meter of which is 250-350 m in a hundred-gram skein. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting corn pattern" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993833.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The composition of the yarn may be different.  Acrylic fits well into the drawing.  It is perfect for baby gizmos, small accessories, handbags, a sock, booties and slippers.  Clothing, especially copyrighted models, is best knitted from fibers of natural origin - wool, cashmere, merino, and other varieties of wool yarn.  Mixed threads are currently being produced, consisting of woolen and artificial fibers in various proportions.  Wool yarn, produced by many manufacturers today, is very popular: good quality is successfully combined with a low price, which makes it affordable and affordable.  Adding a stretch component to the composition of the thread improves the texture of the pattern and makes the knitted fabric more plastic.  In other words, from the yarn of any composition, you can make a pattern of "Corn" with knitting needles.  The knitting pattern for this weave is simple, but will require some skill and attention. </p><h2>  We select knitting needles </h2><p>  The most acceptable option for knitting needles for an average thread are sizes 2.5-3.  The material from which the spokes are made should be light and smooth.  An excellent option is a set of wooden, bamboo or teflon-coated knitting needles.  They are lightweight, fit comfortably in the hand, do not create unnecessary inconvenience when working, have a sliding surface.  In addition, these knitting needles, as a rule, are sharpened qualitatively and have smooth, but not pricking ends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern corn pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993815.jpg" width="500"></div>  A wide canvas is best done on circular knitting needles, the length of which is selected in accordance with the planned width.  Circular knitting line does not always meet the expectations of the craftswoman.  Today it is being replaced by light high-quality twisted cords, which are an excellent alternative to knitting needles on a fishing line.

A hobby such as <span>knitting</span> is no exception <span>.</span>  The Corn pattern is uncomplicated in the work, but some very important points should be remembered.  The texture of the pattern appears on the wrong side of the knitted fabric.  This is a feature of the pattern that must be taken into account if it is used in a canvas, where several different weaves are combined.  To carry out the sample, any even number of loops are drawn onto the spokes.  The dialing method also does not play a special role - both the most ordinary and Italian or cruciform are suitable.  So, we start knitting - pattern "Corn".  Its outline is simple and straightforward. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a corn knitting pattern" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993875.jpg" width="232"></div>  Recall that the edge loops are not included in the calculation, since they do not participate in the drawing, but only form the edge of the product: the first of them is always removed without tying, and the latter is knitted on the wrong side.

    <h2>  Knitting pattern "Corn": description.  First row </h2><p>  We remove the edge, we knit the first loop with the front for the front wall, the second - with the wrong one.  So, alternating front and <span>back loops, we</span> knit a row to the end.  We knit the last loop from the wrong side, we end the row of hem.  The first row fits like a 1x1 elastic band.  You can make a pattern of "Corn" with knitting needles (the scheme allows) with the so-called grandmother's knitting method, leading the knitting needle into the loop at the back from the inside.  In this case, the canvas will be smoother and denser. </p><h2>  Second row </h2><p>  We knit one edge, the first front loop, and remove the next (wrong) loop with the crochet.  In this way, we continue until the end of the row, remove the last loop with the crochet and draw the hem. </p><h2>  Third row </h2><p>  One hem, on the double crochet loop, throw another crochet and remove, without knitting, on the right knitting needle.  The yarn is thrown on a knitting needle with a thread on the front side of a knitted fabric.  It turns out a loop with two crochets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting corn pattern description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993851.jpg" width="600"></div>  The next loop, going along the wrong side pattern, is performed by the front one.  This alternation is performed until the end of the row.

    <h2>  <span>Knitting:</span> Pattern "Corn."  Fourth row diagram </h2><p>  1 hem, we knit the first loop with the front for the front wall, we sew the loop with two double crochets from the wrong.  Perform this wrong side gently, picking up all three threads.  For more convenient knitting, the thread does not need to be pulled too much, but it is also not recommended to tighten the fabric: beginner knitters need to monitor the tension of the thread.  It should neither sag or stretch unnecessarily.  As always, the golden mean is appropriate here - soft medium tension. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting corn pattern" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/993841.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <p>  From the fifth row, the pattern is repeated, i.e., the pattern repeat is four rows.  So the pattern "Corn" is made with knitting needles.  The scheme of this figure presented in the article is so simple that it usually does not raise questions even for beginner knitters. </p><h2>  Where is the Corn Pattern applied? </h2><p>  This pattern is a universally recognized pattern for knitting almost all children's things, from hats and booties to suits and rugs.  Pearl embossed medium-sized pattern contributes to its distribution in the knitting of children's clothing.  But this pattern is so versatile that it is also used when performing female and male models of clothes and hats.  The knitted pattern ‚ÄúCorn‚Äù with knitting needles proved itself perfectly, the scheme of which is understandable in the manufacture of the most popular accessories today - scarves and snoods.  Today's variety of models with emphasized invoice "corn" pattern, its various interpretations in combination with other patterns, plaits, braids and arana, amazes the imagination and surprises.  After all, the drawing is simple, and the possibilities of its use in modeling and execution of clothes are infinitely many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting corn pattern" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/995324.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is the paradox of many crafts - simple techniques give rise to many interesting ideas.  This kind of needlework, such as knitting, is also in tune with this.  The Corn pattern is a prime example.  It is unlikely that there will be any product that cannot be connected with this pattern.  Used in children's models and modern women's and men's knitted clothes, this pattern remains popular and loved for many years.
