    <p>  Despite the high level of technology development, information in our time is still easy to lose.  None of the <span>information media</span> is reliable enough, despite the precautions to maintain the confidentiality of data established by the developers.  After all, they can often play a cruel joke with the owner himself.  Surely many were faced with trouble when they lost all the photos, films and documents on a burned-out hard drive.  This also happens with smaller media such as flash drives or memory cards. </p><p>  Most often, misfortune happens at the moment when the devices break down, but also sometimes we just forget the password to them.  Data on our medium is lost: although in fact they are still saved, the user does not have access to them.  If the password cannot be remembered, it has not been recorded and saved anywhere, then you will have to look for roundabout ways to unlock the memory card.  Unfortunately, one way or another, it all comes down to formatting.  In rare cases, users can find a loophole.  Information on how to unlock a memory card is needed rather to calm one‚Äôs conscience before contacting a service. </p><p>  <strong>When the phone requires a password</strong> </p><p>  Phones typically use microsd cards.  Password problems on them arise in several cases.  Firstly, if the device is found on the street or bought by hand.  This means that the password was set by the previous owner of the device.  You can work around this problem, but sometimes even after flashing the card requires an access password.  Similar problems will arise if it simply breaks down (the flash drives are also ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù after a breakdown).  Something is unlikely to help here.  And of course, the user could set the password himself, and then forget it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>How to unlock <span>a memory card</span> on your phone</strong> </p><p>  The easiest way to determine if your card is broken or not is to take it along with the handset to a service center.  Professionals work there who will be able to give an approximate answer even for the model name alone.  In certain series of mobile phones, the problem of quick breakdown is much more common than in others.  In addition, in a specialized center there is always a device for unlocking cards.  With it, your media will try to bring into working condition.  But at the same time all the information on it will disappear. </p><p>  <strong>How to unlock a memory card manually</strong> </p><p>  If you do not want to contact the service center, then you can try to do everything on your own.  For example, use another phone (of course, the same model): insert the card there and format it.  Incidentally, the same method applies to other types of media, including flash drives for cameras. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can try to unlock the card through a computer.  But the process is not always successful, often it just does not see the device or gives an error when formatting.  The same is with card readers - some do not see password-protected media.  Then special utilities from third-party developers come to our aid.  On the Internet, you can find many programs that promise to show the password and save all the information on the media.  Alas, most of these utilities are ineffective. </p><p>  Of the few that are really capable of helping, it is worth paying special attention to the JetFlash Recovery Tool.  This utility supports a large number of cards, a full list of which can be found on the official website of the developer.  There you can download it for free.  The procedure for working with the program includes just a few simple steps.  You will need to insert a card, wait until the computer sees it, then run the program and show it the path to the problem carrier.  That's all - all that remains is to click on the start and wait for the formatting to complete. </p><p>  Good reviews on forums with related topics also leave a utility called Easy Recovery Pro.  If the first did not help, then you can always download it.  And it‚Äôs better to have several such programs at once that try everything.  This, at least, will make it clear whether it is time to contact a service center, or there is hope to cope on your own. </p>
