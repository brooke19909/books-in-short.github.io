Deciphering concepts, advantages and disadvantages, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most large, and even small companies prefer to pay their employees wages on bank cards.  This is done for many reasons, most of which can be combined with one concept - "convenience".  <span>A salary project</span> is a program that makes it possible to organize such payments as simply as possible.  In addition, it also allows you to receive certain bonuses in the process of its use by both the employer and the employee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pbs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer of money" class="if uuid-2993443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993443.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the essence of the concept? </h2><p>  A salary project is a special agreement between an organization and a banking institution that allows you to transfer salaries to employees of an organization not directly in cash, but to a bank card.  For this, the bank issues a specialized salary card, on which funds will be credited. </p><p>  Issuing a card, opening a special account, as well as servicing the entire project as a whole is carried out at the expense of the employer.  Each banking institution offers its own terms for such services.  For example, the proposals of the banking organization AK Bars: a salary project and Orion (information system for automation and maintenance). </p><p>  Due to the fact that there are a large number of different projects and specific products provided by credit organizations to customers, it makes sense to consider in more detail both the system as a whole and individual offers in the banking services market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is it for the employer? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourmembership.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paperwork" class="if uuid-2993442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993442.jpg"></div><p>  A company that connects to such a service has several goals at once.  The main advantages received by the organization through this service: </p><ul><li>  A salary project is a significant saving of time and money, since it allows you to reduce accounting costs, as well as to eliminate the cash desk, so necessary when issuing salaries to employees in cash. </li><li>  Employee earnings are completely anonymous. </li><li>  The project allows you to control remotely. </li><li>  In some cases, with him the company can get acquiring services at reduced rates, which is especially important for trade enterprises. </li><li>  It happens that banking organizations provide connected organizations with additional bonuses in the form of discounts on mobile communications, insurance, as well as on some office purchases. </li></ul><h2>  Why does the employee need him </h2><p>  Employees of companies, as a rule, are also happy to join salary projects, as individual users also have small bonuses: </p><ul><li>  An employee, as a rule, can issue additional plastic cards tied to his account.  They are intended for ease of use by family members. </li><li>  Some banks offer users of salary projects services that require payment outside of such projects. </li><li>  For other services, a banking organization can provide special conditions of service that will be much more profitable.  This may affect not only the size of commissions, but sometimes such clients receive a higher percentage on deposits and deposits or more convenient loans. </li><li>  The loyalty program for salary projects often has much more pleasant conditions. </li><li>  From time to time, holders of such cards may arrange additional promotions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="smallbizclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment by card in a coffee shop" class="if uuid-2993444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993444.jpg"></div><h2>  How to connect a salary project in a bank </h2><p>  Most banks connect using a single algorithm in all payroll projects.  This is primarily a contract that the organization must conclude with the bank and organize an electronic exchange of documents.  After that, the bank issues a set of cards for each employee connected to the project, which are registered in the accounting department of the enterprise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the need arises for the payment of wages, the accountant generates payroll sheets that are transferred to the bank, after which the banking organization transfers the money to the cards of the connected project. </p><p>  Cash withdrawals vary greatly from bank to bank.  For example, the AK Bars salary project allows you to withdraw money at any ATM of absolutely all banks in Russia without a commission, but the limit is set at 50,000 Russian rubles.  But such conditions will not be everywhere.  In another bank, cash withdrawals are not limited, but you need to look for an ATM of a particular bank, and in other credit organizations you can withdraw money at separate salary project rates. </p><h2>  What are the similarities between the various systems </h2><p>  Most of these projects are basically similar and are based on an agreement between the bank and the organization.  As a rule, an enterprise opens a salary project in the same bank in which its main financial assets are located.  This simplifies the interaction of accountants with finances.  Then the bank accepts the money with the help of a payment order, after which they are transferred to the employees in the right amount on cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pbs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hand with a banknote" class="if uuid-2993440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993440.jpg"></div><h2>  How salary projects of different banks differ from each other </h2><p>  Each credit organization tries to make its offer the most attractive.  Since any company prefers to keep its money in one bank, having covered the salary part of the organization‚Äôs finances, the bank can count on attention to its other products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most significant differences salary projects show in the bonus program.  Different banking organizations have at their disposal loyalty programs that the client can use.  In the Alfa-Bank salary project, the user has the same options as for ordinary cardholders, but in addition, an increased percentage on the savings account and preferential conversion rates appear. </p><h2>  Overview of the services of various banks </h2><p>  In order for a potential holder to better navigate in a large number of offers on the market, it is necessary to consider in more detail salary projects of the largest and most popular banks among people.  Each of them has its advantages and a certain number of minuses.  Any client will decide for himself which of the offers is best. </p><h2>  VTB </h2><p>  VTB Bank selects the salary project for each organization individually.  The financial institution does not offer uniform conditions for all, specific tariffs will depend on the contract, the number of employees and the size of the company.  In total, it is possible to connect three service packages: "Individual", "Basic" and "Premium".  An individual is concluded separately with each employee and is suitable for the user with an average salary of 10 thousand.  The basic one is suitable for the widest audience, requires more than 10 people in the state and is suitable for those with average salaries of up to 10 thousand.  The premium package is the most advanced, but its cost requires a salary of employees of at least 10 thousand and also from 10 people in the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.clearbooks.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Data Entry" class="if uuid-2993441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993441.jpg"></div><p>  Also, after concluding a contract for the connection of a salary project, VTB can establish an ATM on the territory of the enterprise.  It is advisable to use this opportunity in large enterprises with a large number of employees. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  To connect a salary project in Alpha, you first need to apply for registration.  You can do this at the telephone number indicated on the website, after which you will need to come to the bank and draw up an agreement. </p><p>  If the salary project was concluded without any additional requirements from the organization, then by default a free corporate tariff is included, under which gold and platinum cards can be issued. </p><p>  All users connected to this system have the opportunity to use individual tariffs for operations with the card, and the package of services needed to use the Alfa Bank card in the payroll project is provided completely free of charge.  Moreover, all bonuses of the loyalty program that the bank has on a specific card are included for salary customers.  Each person can order the type of card that suits him personally and will be most profitable. </p><h2>  Salary projects of other banks </h2><p>  Of course, the largest bank in the country - Sberbank, also has its own salary project, which is aimed at the widest possible audience.  However, despite the myth that this institution is the most profitable of all available, in fact, its offer is not much different from others on the market: classic and premium cards, participation in the bank's loyalty program, the possibility of issuing cards with an individual design and other conditions. </p><p>  AK Bars offers a rather original solution: the bank accompanies its offer with the Orion information system.  The salary project in this system is convenient to control, and the interface is user friendly.  Also, a payroll client, having connected to this payroll system, will be able to freely withdraw money from ATMs throughout Russia, albeit with a limited amount. </p><h2>  How to connect an employee to a payroll project? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mastercard.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card payment" class="if uuid-2993447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993447.jpg"></div><p>  The employee does not need any additional actions, it is enough for him to simply get his issued salary card at the office or in the bank's office and get acquainted with the tariffs. </p><p>  However, the company needs not only to conclude an agreement with the bank, but also to organize accounting for the salary project at the enterprise.  For this, data on an open project must be transferred to accountants so that they can configure it in 1C or another accounting program used by the organization.  Therefore, the process of such settings should be considered in more detail. </p><h2>  Accounting for a salary project in 1C </h2><p>  In all well-known software "1C: Enterprise" it is necessary to organize a separate accounting of funds paid with the help of a salary project.  Of course, you can get earned money through the bank without participating in the project described above.  However, if there is one at the enterprise, then accounting must be kept, just setting it up in accounting documents. </p><p>  To set up a salary project in "1C: ZUP", you need to open the menu item "Salary projects" in the "Payments" section. </p><p>  In the created card, enter the name of the organization and the bank with which the contract is concluded. </p><p>  Above the item ‚ÄúSalary projects‚Äù is ‚ÄúEntering personal accounts‚Äù, where you can enter the personal personal accounts of employees issued by the bank.  However, this is only worth doing if the electronic document management is not configured with the bank.  Entering personal accounts in this case is as simple as possible: after filling in the header of the card, click on the filling, after which personal accounts of all employees of the enterprise will be entered. </p><p>  Since there can be several salary projects in one company, you need to select the one that will be considered the main one in the settings.  This can be done in the "Accounting and payroll" tab.  Subsequently, the accounting program will automatically select it by default. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adjudicate.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paperwork" class="if uuid-2993445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2993445.jpg"></div><h2>  Key myths related to payroll projects </h2><p>  The first myth is that in order to join such a project it will be necessary to open a current account.  This is not so: most banks operate using an electronic registry, and a current account is not required to be opened, which additionally saves the company time and money. </p><p>  The second myth is the long process of changing the bank, if necessary, to change the terms of the salary project.  As a rule, the majority of large banks get it within a few weeks: they provide their employees for the quickest processing of all necessary papers. </p><p>  The third myth concerns the complexity of accounting for a payroll project in an enterprise.  As we could see above, setting up such a project in the program version itself is not complicated and most of the data can be entered automatically. </p><p>  Salary project is the most convenient method of paying salaries for both the enterprise and employees.  At the moment, most organizations recognize that the convenience of using this service more than covers the costs, and many employees prefer to use salary cards, as they provide more favorable conditions and tariffs for the user than on a regular debit card of the same bank.  Therefore, a salary project, without exaggeration, is desirable for any Russian organization, especially medium and large businesses. </p>
