    <h2>  Miklouho-Maclay Biography for Children and Adults </h2><p>  Nikolai Nikolaevich Miklouho-Maclay was born in the small village of Yazykovo, which was in the Novgorod province.  Date of birth - June 17, 1846.  There was a future traveler from a noble family.  Nikolai's father was a railway engineer, in connection with which the family often had to move from place to place.  Miklouho-Maclay's biography from an early age talks about his travels in the regions of Russia.  In 1856, his father was appointed head of the construction of the Vyborg Highway and, despite tuberculosis, got down to work.  The loads finally broke the health of the head of the family, and he died at the age of 41. </p><p>  The family had savings that were invested in stocks, so the children were not left without education.  In addition, Nikolai's mother was engaged in drawing cards, which brought additional income.  Miklouho-Maclay's biography tells that teachers who were invited to his home were engaged in his education.  One of them even revealed the boy‚Äôs ability to draw. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Miklouho-Maclay Biography: Gymnasium </h2><p>  In 1856, Nikolai, along with his brother Sergei, went to school, in grade 3.  However, very soon he persuaded his mother to transfer them to the state gymnasium.  The boy didn‚Äôt shine with excellent schooling, often skipping classes at all.  Even in grade 5 he was transferred by a miracle.  At the age of 15, he took part in a demonstration with his comrades and brother, for which he was imprisoned.  The brothers were released a few days later, citing an error during the detention. </p><h2>  University </h2><p>  Miklouho-Maclay was in the gymnasium until 1863, after which he decided to enter the Academy of Arts, to which Nicholas's mother reacted negatively.  As a result, he turned out to be a volunteer at the University of Moscow at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty.  Nikolai studied with zeal, he paid special attention to the natural sciences. </p>

    <p>  A year later, Miklouho-Maclay was expelled from the university.  The reason was a violation of the rules - Nikolai tried to lead his friend into the building.  As the traveler himself claimed, he was forbidden to study at any university in Russia. </p><h2>  Germany </h2><p>  After the misconduct, Nikolai had to look for a new place to study abroad.  The choice fell on Germany, where institutions did not require education certificates.  The family was in a difficult financial situation, but the mother did her best, and already in the spring of 1864 the young Miklouho-Maclay went to Germany. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  At Heidelberg University, the young man was involved in the uprising of the Poles.  Nicholas sided with them and even tried to learn Polish, which was opposed by the mother, who saw the son of a talented engineer.  Already in the summer of next year, Miklouho-Maclay moved to Leipzig, where he began to study as a manager in agriculture and forestry.  Here he spent the next 4 years of his life and moved to Jena, entered the faculty of medicine. </p><h2>  Canary Islands </h2><p>  In the spring of 1866, Miklouho-Maclay went on an expedition to Sicily, where Haeckel was invited as a scientific adviser.  Her goal was to study the Mediterranean fauna.  However, the expedition was almost frustrated due to the war.  Travelers had to change their route, which now ran through England.  By the way, there Nikolai Nikolaevich managed to communicate with Darwin himself.  The end point was the island of Tenerife.  The locals were surprised by the guests, mistaking them for sorcerers.  After this, the expedition reached Morocco, where Miklouho-Maclay remained to watch the Berbers. </p><p>  He returned to Jena only in the late spring of 1867.  He continues to perform the duties of Haeckel's assistant and issues his first scientific work, under which he signs as "Miklouho-Maclay."  A photo of a young traveler first appears in serious work.  The following year was the final year for him at the Faculty of Medicine.  Nikolai Nikolaevich begins to actively engage in scientific work. </p><h2>  Expeditions </h2><p>  Miklouho-Maclay made attempts to go on a polar expedition, but did not get into it.  Therefore, he again arrived in Sicily, from where he got to the Red Sea and studied its fauna.  Then there was a trip to Egypt and a lot of research work.  In 1869, the traveler returns to his homeland, to Russia. </p>

    <p>  First of all, he saw his family, who then lived in Saratov.  Then he took part in several scientific conferences and was included in the geographical society of Russia.  Made a project for the study of the Pacific Ocean, which was soon approved. </p><p>  In the fall of 1870, he began an expedition on the Vityaz ship.  Visited Brazil and some other places.  By the autumn of 1871 he reached the shores of <span>New Guinea,</span> where guests were met by a frightened local population.  He settled in a small hut and began to make contact with the natives.  At first they were wary of the researcher, but by 1872 they began to accept him as a friend.  The neighborhood Miklouho-Maclay named in his honor. </p><p>  In late December, Nikolai Nikolaevich left the shores of New Guinea and went to Hong Kong, where he was waiting for the glory of a researcher.  He traveled around Batavia for some time, and at the beginning of 1874 decided to visit Guinea again.  This time he stopped at Ambon and fought with the local slave traders. </p>

    <p>  For the third and last time, the traveler will return to his island in 1883.  By that time, many of his Aboriginal friends had already died, various diseases caused their death. </p><h2>  Marriage and death </h2><p>  In late February 1884, Miklouho-Maclay married Margaret Clark, and in the autumn they had a son.  In 1886, the traveler returned to Russia, where he made plans to organize a colony on the shores of Guinea.  However, the intentions of Nikolai Nikolayevich were destroyed by the disease - cancer, as it turns out later.  His health was seriously shaken in 1887, and in early April 1888 the <span>famous traveler</span> died. </p>
