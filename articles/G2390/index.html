    <p>  Inventive people invented Pen Spanning.  To put it very briefly, this is the ability to perform tricks of varying difficulty using a conventional ballpoint pen and hand.  With the development of the Pen Spanning technique, you will understand how to twist a pen on your fingers and you will know <span>what to do</span> in minutes of idleness. </p><p>  This way of entertainment will not only bring pleasure, but will also attract the attention of others.  Agree, having a skill that draws the attention of others to you is already a big plus. </p><h2>  Beginner Tips </h2><p>  Any business has its own rules and laws.  Want to know the story well?  Study the primary sources.  Want to learn how to run fast in 1 year?  Learn to walk to get started.  Pen Spanning has its own law and its own rules, which they follow when doing pen exercises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. It is necessary to completely relax the hand.  If your hand is tense during the exercise, then it is likely that you will not succeed.  Moreover, the more tense your arm is, the faster your arm will get tired. </p><p>  2. Do not look away from the pen.  For beginners, this is exactly what you need.  If you want to clearly understand how to twist the handle on your fingers, then you should look at it and at the hand at the time of the next trick. </p>

    <p>  3. A suitable handle.  It often happens that a person‚Äôs hand is small, and the handle is iron and massive.  Accordingly, it will be inconvenient for him to perform exercises with her.  Harmony is when the <span>hand is</span> comfortable to use the pen.  Pick one especially for yourself. </p><p>  4. Attention to detail.  To understand how to learn how to twist the handle with your fingers, you need to be as attentive to the small details of the stunt.  You should see how your hand moves and copes with the result.  You can specifically record tricks on video, so that later you can view conveniently and try to repeat what you did. </p><p>  5. Have a rest.  Hand strain must not be allowed.  Fatigue acts from overstrain, which does not allow you to perform exercises at the proper level.  Tricks done with a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù hand are much better than during fatigue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Special accessories </h2><p>  Your main weapon in this matter is your pen.  It is harmony with her that should be the initial key to success for you. </p><p>  It is recommended for Pen Spanning to get a special pen.  Another option is to make it yourself to fit your needs.  Ideally, you can use the kit to create a universal pen - a ballpoint pen shell and special rubber bands for better finger grip. </p><p>  To know how to twist the handle on the fingers correctly, you need to have the right tool for this. </p><h2>  Why is this necessary at all? </h2><p>  An adult is different from others in his ability to ask himself the question: ‚ÄúWhy do I need this?‚Äù  Moreover, this issue applies to any business. </p>
