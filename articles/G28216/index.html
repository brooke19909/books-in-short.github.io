It was first mentioned back in the 1330s in the spiritual letter of Prince Ivan Kalita.  Then the village was called as Irininsky, and it got its modern name in 1934 after the name of the polar pilot born here, Hero of the USSR Vasily Molokov. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In ancient times, the Moscow River was the main route from the east and east.  High hills, a good overview of the valley and favorable conditions for agriculture led to an extremely rapid settlement of this region.  In 1339, Prince of Moscow Ivan Kalita bequeathed the village of Molokovo, then called Irininsky, to his son Semyon. </p><p>  In 1646, there were already 29 peasant households and the wooden church of St. John the Evangelist.  In 1786, on the site of a dilapidated church, a new one was built with the money of Count Alexei Orlov-Chesmensky.  In 1810-1813, by order of Countess Orlova, the church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God was erected and consecrated in the village.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, in Irininsky, in addition to the Zemstvo school, a church parish was organized.  In 1912, the Ostrovsky hospital was built, and in 1930 they founded the Gorky collective farm, whose workers grew fruits, vegetables and flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mosculture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God" class="if uuid-3201043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3201043.jpg"></div><h2>  Pre-war and post-war development </h2><p>  In 1934, the village of Molokovo, Moscow Region, was given its modern name.  A year later, a new school opened its doors; telephone and radio communications were conducted.  A nursery, a kindergarten, and a veterinary station were built in the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the war, a cardboard factory was established in the village.  Subsequently, it became one of the leading manufacturers of packaging in the region.  In the 1970s, the Burevestnik culture house was opened, which is still operating, a new school building was built, a monument was erected for fellow soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War.  In 1994, the village of Molokovo, Moscow Region, became the center of the Molokovo rural district. </p><div class="photo" data-original="velo17.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pond in Molokovo" class="if uuid-3201048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3201048.jpg"></div><h2>  Currently </h2><p>  Now in the village there are about two thousand people.  In Molokovo there is a secondary school in which children from all over the village study.  On its territory there is a monument to Vasily Molokov, in whose honor the village is named.  He was a polar pilot and major general of aviation, in 1934 he participated in an expedition to rescue Chelyuskintsev from an ice floe. </p><p>  In 2010, the first two buildings of the Novo-Molokovo Housing Cooperative were erected in the village.  In 2016, the Gnome kindergarten opened its doors on the territory of the residential complex for children.  In 2018, a new building of the district hospital was built in the village. </p><p>  At the church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, a Sunday school for adults and children operates, there is a parish library, a social assistance service for the elderly and disabled.  The temple also has a judo section, a school for a young journalist and an English club.  In addition, the village has a cultural center, basketball, football, hockey and volleyball courts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ivens.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Novo-Molokovo&quot;" class="if uuid-3201046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3201046.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing and tourism </h2><p>  Nowadays, fishing lovers often come to these places.  In Molokovo, Moscow Region, there used to be a fish farm, but at the turn of the century it fell apart.  And the beautiful ponds abound in roach, perch, crucian carp and carp remained.  Although, according to the fishermen, now there is much less fish.
