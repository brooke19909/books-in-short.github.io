  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Andersen": reviews of residents, apartment planning, infrastructure, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is a multi-million megalopolis, the capital attracting people from the province.  A high standard of living, the possibility of self-realization and professional growth are the reasons why many abandon their small homeland.  A decent standard of living could not but affect the capital's real estate market: making money on apartments here, to put it mildly, is not easy, but impossible for someone at all. </p><p>  An excellent and more affordable alternative to Moscow square meters are new buildings located outside the Moscow Ring Road.  Currently, several promising directions for the development of the metropolis are highlighted.  For example, Kaluga highway.  By purchasing an apartment here, you get a Moscow residence permit and all the privileges of a resident of the capital.  The only question that worries potential buyers: how comfortable is it to live outside the city?  LCD "Andersen", reviews of which we will consider in the framework of this material, is an excellent option for active modern people who value convenience and comfort. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The rhythm of life of a modern person, especially living in a megalopolis, is exhausting.  Work, meetings, negotiations, household chores - all this contributes to the accumulation of fatigue and negativity.  That is why at home each of us wants to feel as calm as possible, to be protected.  Many people are attracted not by huge residential quarters and complexes with high-rises, but by low-rise buildings, which have become a modern and more affordable alternative to private houses.  The minimum number of neighbors, silence, space, comfort - those advantages that are obvious. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen customer reviews" class="if uuid-3005471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005471.jpg"></div><p>  RC "Andersen" - a project of low-rise residential facilities, occupying 19.6 hectares.  The developer tried to combine the comfort of the capital and the delights of suburban life in one territory due to its development and improvement.  Small areas, well-thought-out layouts, modern technologies and high quality of the materials used are the main principles of the company that led the project. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  In many respects, the quality of construction and its reliability depends on the prestige and experience of the company that led the project.  The developer of the residential complex "Andersen" is Desna-Land.  This is a young, but very promising company, on the account of which several successfully implemented projects.  Attention to detail, cooperation with the largest suppliers of building materials and the involvement of first-class specialists in the work are the principles that the developer adheres to. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Real estate experts recommend in the process of choosing an apartment to be based on the location of the object.  After all, you will live in this area for a long time, so you should feel as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  What can Andersen LCD offer?  In customer reviews, special attention is paid to the location of the object.  Indeed, for the implementation of the project, the promising direction of New Moscow - the Kaluga highway was chosen.  Only 11 km along a wide reconstructed road <strong>-</strong> and you are in the capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen tenant reviews" class="if uuid-3005474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005474.jpg"></div><p>  The buildings are located almost on the banks of the Desna River, just 50 m from it, in an ecologically clean place.  You can have picnics, swim in the river and enjoy all the benefits of country life.  Moreover, right on the territory of the complex there is an extensive green zone, which occupies 4.5 hectares.  It will surely become a favorite place for walking and relaxing in the fresh air with family and friends. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  This issue is relevant for those who purchase an apartment outside the Moscow Ring Road.  Future residents of Andersen residential complex were no exception.  The reviews confirm that there are no problems with public transport.  A sufficient number of routes have been sent to the complex, and you can get to the nearest metro station in just 35 minutes. </p><p>  If your family has a private car, you will reach the Moscow Ring Road in just 20 minutes.  on the new expanded Kaluga highway.  Congestion is rare in this area, so residents of the complex will not feel remoteness from the capital.  Moreover, they will be able to get to their destination faster than those who live within the Moscow Ring Road.  Kaluga direction is promising: in the near future a metro station will appear here, which will only add advantages to the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  According to the general plan, the entire microdistrict will be divided into quarters, each of which has its own architecture.  Low-rise buildings are represented not only by residential buildings of three floors, but also by townhouses of high comfort.  The facades are decorated in the best traditions of the Scandinavian style, which is characterized by laconicism and consistency.  Panoramic windows give the interior a modern look, filling the interior with light and lightness. </p><p>  Many people compare the project with the Andersen LCD of the same name in Krasnodar precisely because of its laconicism and external style.  But upon closer examination, it is difficult to find similar characteristics.  Perhaps only the restraint of architecture and the high level of comfort provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onovostroykah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen residents reviews" class="if uuid-3005480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005480.jpg"></div><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  The potential buyers are offered a choice of apartments of improved layout from 25 to 89 square meters, which depends on how many rooms there are - one, two or three.  In each, you can implement a redevelopment.  For example, combine the kitchen with the living room, which is so popular these days.  But this is far from all that Andersen LCD can offer.  The reviews of residents also mention rather high ceilings (three meters), which allows to realize even the most daring and extraordinary design ideas. </p><p>  Each apartment has a spacious entrance hall, a dressing room for storing clothes and other household trifles, and a real winter garden is also equipped.  The project does not provide for finishing, but if desired, each buyer will be able to order the project from qualified specialists of the company with its subsequent implementation.  Those who responded to this proposal emphasize how quickly and efficiently the work was done. </p><p>  Each apartment has a gas boiler.  You can independently adjust the temperature in the apartment to create the optimal microclimate. </p><p>  Are panoramic windows an advantage or a disadvantage?  In the customer reviews of Andersen residential complex, there is a unanimous opinion on this matter.  They write that the apartments are filled with light, while the German double-glazed windows themselves have excellent heat-holding and sound-proofing qualities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvartirazamkad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen property developer" class="if uuid-3005487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005487.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the low buildings, elevators are not provided.  But in each entrance there is a stroller and a concierge room. </p><h2>  Townhouses </h2><p>  This is perhaps the main difference between our project and the Andersen RC of the same name in Krasnodar.  Muscovites reviews regarding townhouses are mostly enthusiastic.  Each of them has two exits: one leads to the courtyard, the other to the terrace, which can be equipped with a barbecue and relaxation area.  All those who purchase a townhouse additionally receive their own parking space near the house. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  At the moment, the area in which the buildings are being built is not developed.  That is why the issue of comfort bothers potential buyers in vain.  Agree, to overcome several kilometers to the nearest store is the height of recklessness.  So, in addition to residential buildings, the project provides for the construction of a kindergarten for 250 children, a supermarket, as well as a shopping and entertainment center and an administrative building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrprice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen moscow reviews" class="if uuid-3005477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005477.jpg"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The territory of the Andersen residential complex is fenced and is under round-the-clock surveillance.  At the entrance, a checkpoint will be established, which will exclude the presence of unauthorized persons at the facility.  Residents of handed over buildings have a positive attitude to such a high level of security, because now you can not worry about the children playing on the court: they are always under supervision.  In addition, it is possible to isolate the territory of the complex from suspicious individuals who violate a quiet and peaceful life. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The developer put into the project the construction of sports and playgrounds, designed not only for children but also for adults.  Thus, it will be possible to provide leisure to all family members right on the territory of the Andersen residential complex.  The reviews tell about the gazebos that have already appeared, the walking areas that all residents managed to fall in love with - you no longer need to go out into the countryside, because everything you need for relaxation (including the forest, river and fresh air) is near the house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moskva.realtymarkt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen residents reviews" class="if uuid-3005482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005482.jpg"></div><p>  In the future - the construction of a bridge across the Desna, as well as the improvement of its own promenade.  A boat station will appear here, where all residents and their guests will be able to rent a watercraft for a walk.  The developer also took care of the pets, equipping the area for their walking and training. </p><p>  For car owners, zoned and house parking lots are provided that should fully satisfy the existing need and solve a problem so significant for all Muscovites. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  How is the construction of Andersen LCD in Moscow going?  Investors' feedback confirms that the deadlines have been met, everyone can interactively observe all the stages, and if you wish, personally visit the facility. </p><p>  The project provides for six phases.  Three of them have already been commissioned, that is, half of the apartments are occupied.  If you do not have time to purchase the cherished square meters, pay attention to the secondary housing complex Andersen.  Indeed, many have invested in the project at the stage of approval, and now they want to sell the finished apartment, making good money on the difference. </p><p>  Apartments in the Andersen residential complex (resale) are sold both without decoration and fully ready for living, even with furniture. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  Currently, an apartment in Andersen residential complex can be purchased from 3.3 million rubles.  This is an affordable price with a set of advantages.  After all, it is no secret to anyone that an apartment in low-rise buildings costs an order of magnitude more expensive than those that are rented in high-rises.  The developer offers many real estate acquisition programs, including installment plans.  And cooperation with the largest banks allows you to arrange a mortgage on the most favorable terms. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  Since the three phases have already been commissioned, we can draw the first conclusions about the project.  Are the expectations of equity holders met or not? </p><p>  The main advantage of the project is its location.  Pure fresh air, proximity to the river, the ability to spend a weekend in the fresh air right on the territory of the complex are those pluses whose value is simply impossible to diminish.  But the location in this case also became a drawback: at the moment, the complex is separated from the busy Kaluga highway by a clean field, the path through which becomes a real test, especially after rain.  It blurs the road in such a way that it is very difficult to pass and pass.  As a result, the 35 minutes promised by the developer to the metro station are delayed by an hour and a half, or even more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vsenovostroyki.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://vsenovostroyki.ru/expert/6181/"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc andersen property developer" class="if uuid-3005490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3005490.jpg"></div><p>  Of the stores, there is only a grocery tent that works out of schedule.  It is extremely inconvenient to drag bags from the nearest store in Vatutinki.  There is no kindergarten and school, and it is not known whether they will be at all.  Accordingly, you have to carry children every day, which is simply unrealistic without a personal car. </p><p>  At the same time, the apartments turned out to be excellent: spacious, bright, layouts are thought out to the smallest detail, which allows you to use every square meter.  Pleased with the presence of a wardrobe, where all things are placed.  Parking spaces are sufficient for all residents, at least for today. </p><p>  In general, the project is worthy of attention and detailed acquaintance, as it has a lot of advantages.  Another thing is that without a personal car you will not get comfort, because at a given point in time the district is not adapted for a full life.  In any case, visit the complex at least in order to form your personal opinion. </p>
