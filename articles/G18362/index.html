The main battles of the Russo-Japanese War</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The war between Russia and Japan, which occurred due to a clash of interests between the two states in the Far East, ended in defeat for Russia.  An incorrect assessment of the enemy forces led to the death of 100 thousand Russian soldiers and sailors, to the loss of the entire Pacific fleet. </p><p>  The winners established the Japanese medal "Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905" to reward their participants in the battles; Nicholas II also encouraged his army with similar awards. </p><h2>  The reasons for the outbreak of war </h2><p>  The rapid growth of capitalism in Russia during this period, the industrial revolution that took place, required the expansion of the country's influence zone in world space.  However, the colonial influence of large imperialist states on weak countries has already ended; almost all territories have been divided.  Then the emperor‚Äôs gaze turned east towards China, Korea, Mongolia. </p><p>  In 1900, the colonial invasion of Russia into this zone began: part of China (Manchuria) and Mongolia was occupied, the Chinese Eastern Railway was built, Russians began to move to Harbin, Port Arthur, a large Russian military base was built.  The introduction of joint-stock companies in the Korean economy and an active influence on it led to the accession of its territory to the Russian state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poster at the beginning of the war" class="if uuid-3200601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3200601.jpg"></div><p>  Japan, also recently embarked on capitalist development, had similar interests in the region.  She perceived the growing influence of Russia sharply negatively.  The government of Nicholas II, which convinced the emperor of the weakness and backwardness of the enemy, continued the planned activities, ignoring the ultimatum of the Japanese government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First fight </h2><p>  On January 27, 1904 (according to the old style), Japan attacked the Russian Varyag and Korean ships, which were stationed in the Korean port of Chemulpo.  Captains V.F. Rudnev and G.P. Belyaev, who did not receive information from the government in a timely manner, but felt the outgoing aggression from the Japanese, decided to break into Port Arthur. </p><p>  The "Korean", who went out for reconnaissance, was attacked by a Japanese squadron and was forced to return to the parking lot, where there were many foreign ships, the captains of which already knew about the beginning of the war.  From the "Varangian" and "Korean" the Japanese ultimately demanded to leave the port under the threat of execution on the spot.  Russian ships went into battle along foreign ships escorting colleagues to certain death.  The forces were too unequal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wiki.wargaming.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea battle" class="if uuid-3200600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3200600.jpg"></div><p>  The battle at Chemulpo, which lasted about an hour, demonstrated the heroism and high professional training of Russian sailors.  Withstanding heavy enemy fire, both captains reduced the distance between the ships as much as possible and answered with a blow.  In less than an hour, the "Varangian" used up more than a thousand shells, which was a record rate of fire, and received two large holes.  Damage and loss of personnel forced Captain Rudnev to return to the Korean port.  The Korean boat, which fought with the Varangian against nine Japanese ships, suffered less, as the main enemy fire fell on a new and powerful cruiser.  The Japanese squadron lost several ships. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order not to get to the enemy, both ships, by the decision of the captains, were sunk in the waters of the Korean port.  Teams accepted aboard by foreign vessels later returned to Russia, where the country honored its heroes. </p><h2>  The main battles of the Russo-Japanese War </h2><p>  In the early summer of 1904, having defeated the Russian fleet in the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese moved the battle to land.  The battle of Wafago (China) took place, as a result of which the Russian army was divided into two parts, and Port Arthur was surrounded. </p><p>  The siege of the Russian military base lasted six months.  After several fierce assaults, taking into account the enormous losses among the defenders (20 thousand people), Port Arthur in December 1904 was surrendered without command from the commandant of the fortress.  32 thousand soldiers were captured, Japanese losses amounted to 50 thousand. </p><p>  "Mukden meat grinder" (China) in February 1905 lasted 19 days.  The Russian army was defeated, the losses were enormous. </p><p>  The final and unsuccessful for Russia was the Tsushima battle at sea.  During the transfer of 30 Russian ships of the Baltic Fleet to the Pacific Ocean, the caravan was surrounded by 120 Japanese military ships.  Only three Russian ships were able to survive and escape from the environment. </p><p>  The Russian colonial movement to the east ceased, and the Portsmouth Treaty, difficult for the country, was concluded. </p><h2>  Japanese Medal "Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905" </h2><p>  The war, which made Japan the largest imperialist power recognized worldwide, was over.  The time has come to present the awards. </p><p>  During the war, the Japanese government encouraged its army with previously established state awards.  The edict on the creation of a special Japanese medal "Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905" was signed by the Emperor of Japan at the end of March 1906. </p><h2>  Description of the Japanese medal </h2><p>  A disk with a diameter of 30 millimeters made of gilded bronze has on the obverse two crossed flags of the land and naval forces of the state, and a coat of arms is located here.  The flip side is framed in a somewhat unusual style for this country, which had not previously used laurel and palm branches, familiar in Europe, to honor.  On this medal, these victory symbols are decorated with a shield with an inscription about the military campaign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wiki.wargaming.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese medal" class="if uuid-3200604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3200604.jpg"></div><p>  Japanese Medal "Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905"  was handed over to all soldiers and officers of the imperial army who participated in the hostilities. </p><h2>  Awards of the Russian state </h2><p>  Despite the defeat in the war, several awards were dedicated to this event in Russia.  In the course of hostilities, they were received by distinguished battle participants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fight at Chemulpo" class="if uuid-3200598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3200598.jpg"></div><p>  The first medals were awarded to members of the Varyag and Koreets warships who returned to St. Petersburg.  At a reception in the imperial palace, he was granted 30 mm in diameter silver awards on a special ribbon of the St. Andrew's Flag.  The obverse depicts the cross of St. George the Victorious and in a circle posted information: "For the battle" Varyag "and" Korean "Jan 27.  1904 CHEMULPO. "  A fragment of naval battle was struck on the reverse side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One medal" class="if uuid-3200618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3200618.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of hostilities, despite the loss, the emperor approved another award in gratitude to the participants in the battles.  In January 1906, a medal appeared.  Its front side is decorated with a picture depicting an eye, the years of the war are also indicated here.  The reverse side contains a quote from the New Testament.  Medals were made of three virtues: silver, bronze and copper.  Only the first ones were considered valuable.  Still others received all ranks that did not take part in the battles. </p><p>  In addition to the combined arms awards of the Russo-Japanese War, a Red Cross medal was also issued, issued to people of both sexes. </p>
