Negative reviews from visitors are received by Montessori and Teros private kindergartens.  A positive and neutral assessment have kirov kindergartens with the names: </p><ul><li>  "Stork". </li><li>  "Andrew." </li><li>  "Children's Village." </li><li>  "Cabbage". </li><li>  "Lion cub". </li><li>  "Naughty." </li></ul>

    <h2>  Battle of kindergartens </h2><p>  In order to decide which garden to give the child to (municipal or private), it is necessary to highlight the positive and negative sides of each of them.  The first and often decisive selection criterion is price.  The cost of attending a private kindergarten is usually ten times higher than the cost of attending a public educational institution. </p><p>  The second important aspect of choosing a private kindergarten is a small number of children in one group.  As practice shows, in the current municipal kindergartens, the number of children in one group is close to thirty.  In private, in a group of six to fifteen children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another important factor is the frequency and diet of children.  As for the number of meals, it is five times a day.  It is difficult to judge regarding quality.  But in private gardens, food is usually more delicious, high-quality and wholesome, since high-quality products of the corresponding price category are used for its preparation. </p><p>  Of course, in state kindergartens they also feed food that does not harm children, but it is not so tasty and varied.  It should be noted that these characteristics can be classified as ideal.  In practice, there are situations when in private kindergartens the level of education is lower and the quality of food offered to children is worse and the incidence rate is higher. </p>

    <h2>  Public kindergartens can be good too </h2><p>  There are a lot of opinions about any Kirov municipal kindergarten on the network.  So, for example, parents leave only the warmest words about the Golden Cockerel kindergarten, which makes it possible to glorify the city of Kirov in this segment.  The kindergarten receives reviews quite often, and in each of them the phrases “good kindergarten”, “best educators”, “teachers know the approach to the child”, and “competent teaching methods” are found. </p><p>  About the kindergarten “House of Joy”, parents say that the team in the kindergarten is wonderful, the head is tactful and well-mannered, and the program is very interesting for children. </p>

    <h2>  Streams of indignation towards the municipal kindergartens of Kirov </h2><p>  Parents of Kirov children are not stingy with negative reviews.  Kindergarten "Teremok" received its portion of negativity.  According to the parents, the groups in this educational preschool institution are constantly overloaded, which leads to the rapid spread of viral diseases.  As for child care, according to mothers, babies are always hungry and in tears.  But the fundraisers of the Teremka abuse it every now and then. </p><p>  In no case do not send children to kindergarten <span>"Forest Glade" is</span> recommended by many mothers.  First of all, this is due to angry educators, an absent learning process and a manager who turns a blind eye to all this.  As for the financial issue, this kindergarten absorbs the money of parents like a black hole in large volumes and into the void. </p>

    <h2>  Private kindergarten - window light </h2><p>  Investing in paid education and individual education of their child, parents are most often satisfied.  So it happened with the kindergarten "Yaselki".  According to a five-point system, parents put a solid “five” in kindergarten.  The garden is called amazing, for its spacious grounds, exciting educational activities, the ability to monitor the activity through online video surveillance, maximum protection from viral diseases.  Cost - fourteen thousand per month. </p><p>  With kind words, parents speak about the wonderful world’s private kindergarten.  Moms like that with children every day they are engaged in drawing and modeling, and also there are classes with a music worker and speech therapist.  An important aspect of the choice of this institution is tasty and healthy food for children. </p><h2>  Money down the drain </h2><p>  For parents who decide to choose a private kindergarten, the city of Kirov is not always ready to offer reliable options.  So, about the "Children's Village" parents respond with a note of discontent.  This is not surprising, because in this private kindergarten there are very small rooms (which can be seen in the photo below).  Also, here the child will not receive any knowledge and will not be able to adequately prepare for the next stage, since according to the established program in the "Children's Village" they work according to the Waldorf program.  This means that all developmental activities are prohibited. </p><p>  Also in the list of private kindergartens with negative experience of visiting include "Baby Garden".  This institution works without a license and does not engage in the development of children, that is, it does not conduct any educational classes. </p>

    <h2>  Work in kindergarten </h2><p>  It’s not so difficult to get a job in Kirov’s kindergartens.  Jobs are always there.  The main thing is that potential employees have a desire, education and love children. </p><p>  In kindergarten No. 35, an educator with a salary of thirteen thousand rubles is required.  The position of a nurse was opened in kindergarten No. 74. The estimated salary is fifteen thousand rubles.  The janitor needs kindergarten No. 120, the promised salary is 8625 rubles.  In kindergarten No. 138, the vacancy of a cook with a salary of ten thousand rubles is open.  In the "Planet of childhood", kindergartens No. 2, No. 202, No. 235, teachers are required to work in the nursery group.  Salaries are different everywhere and range from ten to seventeen thousand rubles. </p><p>  Kindergarten No. 26 is looking for a cleaner for production and office premises, and kindergarten No. 63 is ready to accept a <span>warehouse manager</span> into its staff <span>.</span>  Salary in both cases will amount to seven and a half thousand rubles. </p><p>  In total, all kindergartens for the two months published 114 open vacancies.  Such a large number of free jobs is due to low wages and a high load on specialists, because working with children is a constant tension and high responsibility. </p>
