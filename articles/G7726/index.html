    <p>  In a <span>fountain pen, the</span> writing unit is a pen.  For modern fountain pens, ink tanks are not necessary.  The latest cartridges are provided for them.  But there are also ink pens.  This is at your discretion. </p><p>  In a ballpoint pen, a writing unit is a conical or needle-shaped tube in which there is a ball (roller) made of solid metal or ceramic.  Ballpoint pens include a gel pen and a rollerball pen. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the latter type of pens in the ink supply system is its capillary.  Thanks to this, the core writes easily, a beautiful and even drawing remains on paper.  But if you stop for a long time on the point, then it will blur.  There are 3 types of <span>capillary handles</span> : </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  liner; </li><li>  isograph; </li><li>  rapidograph. </li></ul><h2>  What <span>is a roller pen?</span> </h2><p>  A rollerball pen is the best kind of ballpoint pen.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the ball is narrower.  Water based inks are less viscous.  Therefore, the line on paper is more even and clear.  Such a pen practically writes itself; it does not require a strong pressure on the paper during writing.  Also, these pens have a more economical ink consumption, and it ranges from 3,000 to 10,000 m. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages of a Rollerball Pen </h2><p>  The rollerball pen leaves almost the same footprint as the feather.  And, as everyone knows, the pen writes very beautifully.  But over time, it may begin to scratch the paper (even the most expensive model).  Scooter will not do this. </p><p>  If you have run out of ink in a fountain pen and do not use replaceable cartridges, refilling such a pen is a whole process.  And the ink runs out at the most inopportune moment.  And in the roller handle interchangeable rods. </p><p>  The core for the rollerball handle is made of metal or polymer (plastic).  Both materials are not affected by ink quality.  The process of replacing the rod is not more complicated than with a conventional ballpoint pen.  Opened, cleaned empty, put a new one, closed.  Ready for work! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are a huge number of <span>stationery manufacturers.</span>  They can be divided into 3 classes: economy class, business class and premium class.  Consider the products of three firms class-by-class: Pilot (expensive economy), Zebra (medium-priced business class) and Parker (premium class). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="handle roller pilot" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20147/416174.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Pens </h2><p>  Pilot is a large, international company that has existed in the stationery market for over 100 years.  Its regional offices were opened in the 50s around the world.  In 1991, Pilot came to Russia.  In the Pilot line, the rollerball pen is featured in the Frixion series. </p><p>  The BL-FRP5 Frixion point is the new Pilot rollerball pen in the series.  Accurate and easy writing with this pen will give you pleasure.  Ink does not spread on paper, dries quickly.  The writing unit is needle-shaped.  The diameter of the rod is 0.5 mm, the line thickness is 0.25.  The color of the body matches the <span>color of the ink.</span>  The core is interchangeable. </p><p>  The BL-FRO7 Frixion PRO is a unique Pilot pen-write pen.  In general, there are 2 types of write-erase pens. </p><p>  The peculiarity of the first is that special ink is erased with an ordinary eraser from the top layer of paper.  But there is a significant drawback: the ink is sometimes deeply absorbed into the paper and it is impossible to remove the writing. </p><p>  The second principle of erasure is the special ‚Äúwhitewash‚Äù that neutralizes the ink used for recording.  The disadvantage is that it is impossible to make a new one using the erased record. </p><p>  For two years, Pilot developed the write-erase pen handle.  They chose a new path: their ink disappears, or rather, discolors when exposed to temperature.  This is also done with an elastic band at the end of the handle.  Rub - and the ink will disappear.  You can do this repeatedly.  But there is one more trick for this pen.  Record, erase and then cool the paper.  For example, in the refrigerator, below -18 degrees Celsius.  The record will reappear.  General characteristics of such pens: ball diameter - 0.7, line thickness - 0.35, body color - black, ink 3 colors.  There is a replaceable core. </p><p>  The BL-FR-7 Frixion ball pens belong to the write-erase series.  They also have a bleaching special gum.  But their difference from the previous series is that there are more ink colors.  General characteristics are the same except for the color of the case: it matches the color of the ink. </p>

    <h2>  Zebra Pen </h2><p>  Zebra Pen Corporation was founded as an independent company in the United States in 1982.  But the history of this brand began even earlier, in 1914, with Zebra Co.  Ltd.  Its founder was Mr. Ishikawa.  His company kept pace with the times and in 1917 became the first to use a pump for ink pens.  In 1957, the company's employees were the first to develop a ballpoint pen.  And, of course, such an invention as a rollerball pen did not pass by this company. </p><p>  The Zebra rollerball pen is of high quality and corresponding price.  That is why they can be safely classified as a business class. </p><p>  The company has several lines of skaters.  Zeb-Roller DX5 and DX7 have needle-shaped and swept-like writing units, respectively.  The line thickness in the Zeb-Roller DX5 is 0.5 mm, and in the Zeb-Roller DX7 - 0.7 mm.  The letter is light, ink does not blur, you can even write upside down <strong>.</strong>  The ink consumption of a roller pen has been reduced to super economical <strong>.</strong> </p><p>  Zebra has a unique Zebra pencitil gel pen.  Its feature is read in the title.  Ink in it is gel based, not water based. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="handle rollerball parker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20147/416175.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Elite Pen Parker </h2><p>  Like all the best in our world, Parker began with need.  George Safford Parker, 17 years old, began working at the Janesville, Wisconsin Telegraph School.  The salary that he received was small, which is why he took up additional work.  Parker became an agent for selling fountain pens.  At that time they were not of high quality.  There were many complaints and returns. </p><p>  George began repairing pens on his own.  And, as it turned out, he did it very well.  Seeing from within all the flaws of these pens, he designed his model.  And already in 1889, the first <span>Parker fountain pen</span> appeared <span>.</span> </p><p>  The company was officially registered in 1892, and since then Parker has been synonymous with prestige and undeniable quality.  Today this company produces the best products of this category in the world.  The Parker rollerball pen is always in the hands of high-ranking officials and prosperous businessmen. </p><p>  Since 1931, Parker has developed and launched the new Quink ink, which is easy to wash off.  The writing unit will provide a neat and beautiful line in all conditions.  Such a rollerball pen will not let you down in the heat or cold, and even on the run you will record in any conditions. </p>
