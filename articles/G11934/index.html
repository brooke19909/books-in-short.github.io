Many tourists tend to visit it, so there are some features that attract travelers not only from other regions of Russia, but also from different countries of the world. </p><p>  So, we will consider in more detail some features of the city, its main attractions, and dwell on historical facts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thejunket.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnitogorsk - reviews" class="if uuid-2572495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2572495.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The reviews of Magnitogorsk indicate that this settlement is very picturesque and attracts tourists with a huge number of interesting places.  The city has some features.  One of them is that it is located at the intersection of the borders of Europe and Asia, and the second is that Magnitogorsk is one of the few cities in Russia that were founded relatively recently. </p><p>  However, according to local residents, this settlement began to exist in the distant 18th century, when a fortress was built on the site of its current location, and subsequently the Magnitnaya village. </p><p>  Locals say that the first settlement was defeated on the left bank of the Ural River.  Subsequently, its other coast was also populated. In reviews of Magnitogorsk, tourists note many picturesque places where you can make excellent photos on their background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  What is the main feature of the location of the village, it was said above.

A separate share of economic profit is accounted for by Prokatmontazh LLC, CJSC UralSpetsMash, as well as Magnitogorsk TPP.  Magnitogorsk shoe factory is famous in many regions of Russia.

According to them, the city does not have a sufficient number of places in kindergartens, and therefore there are certain difficulties with getting pre-school education. </p><p>  Reviews of Magnitogorsk kindergartens for children say that far from all of them are equipped with the necessary materials for the normal education and development of the child.  In this regard, many parents prefer independent learning of the child, and some of them practice hiring private nannies and teachers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ribttes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafe in Magnitogorsk reviews" class="if uuid-2572481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2572481.jpg"></div><h2>  Work </h2><p>  Finding a job in Magnitogorsk, according to local residents, is not particularly difficult.
