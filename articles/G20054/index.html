    <h2>  What events led to the Russian-Iranian war? </h2><p>  Nicholas 1 ascended the throne in the empire. This monarch was called the ‚Äúiron king‚Äù because of the reprisals against the Decembrists.  Nicholas announced that in resolving the "Eastern Question" he would continue the work of his predecessor.  The monarch sent an ultimatum to the Iranian sultan.  In it, he spoke about the threat of occupation of the Danube principalities and demanded the fulfillment of the Bucharest treaty, offering to negotiate.  The Sultan, in turn, accepted the key points of the agreement, sent the commissioners to Ackerman.  Mahmoud II was supposed to buy time.  Before the Russian-Iranian war began, the sultan was engaged in the suppression of the Greek uprising and military reforms.  Many historians agree that the start of the negotiation process in Akkerman and the invasion of the Sultan's troops occurred simultaneously.  This was due to the deliberate activities of Turkish and English diplomats.  Great Britain exerted pressure on the Sultan, imposing on him the enslaving treaty of 1814. Incited by England, Mahmoud systematically violated the world, demanding the return of territories that had ceded to Russia.  Some authors also suggest that as another reason for the <span>Russian-Iranian war of</span> 1826 was an increase in revanchist sentiment in the Shah‚Äôs court.  Their appearance and development was facilitated by the successes of the Sultan's troops in battles with the Turks.  In addition, the British diplomats, for their part, made every effort to foment conflict.  For them, the Russo-Iranian war acted as an effective means of weakening the position of the empire in the Middle and Middle East. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian-Iranian war 1826" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1250495.jpg" width="275"></div>

In the 20s.  the British began the development of a new trade road that went from the Black Sea coast into the depths of front Asia.  This path has been known for a long time - from ancient times caravans of merchants walked along it.  In 1823, the British first brought their goods to Iran on this road.  However, the competition here was very high.  The British could not defeat the Russian merchants by economic methods, and therefore decided to use political influence.  The English envoy at the Shah's court actually achieved the position of adviser.  As Vatsenko reported, the Persian court, incited by Great Britain, oppresses Russian merchants.  British diplomats sought to renew the disagreement between Persia and Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian-Iranian war 1826 1828" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1250500.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Russian-Iranian war of 1826-1828: preparation </h2><p>  Ammunition, guns, guns, equipment began to be delivered to the <span>southern ports</span> .  Numerous troops began to concentrate on the Russian-Iranian border.  In 1825, English weapons arrived for Isfahan for the soldiers of Abbas Mirza.  By the spring of next year, it became known that the East India Company had paid a subsidy to the Shah in the amount of 726 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the latter was warned that other revenues are possible only in the event of a war with Russia.  High clergy, the court, the British began large-scale propaganda.  At the same time, the Russian government was initially ready to conduct peace negotiations on cross-border disputes.  Menshikov was sent to the Sultan.  However, the shah did not accept him.  By this he made it clear that he did not agree to any negotiations.  On June 23, 1826, a religious signing was issued about the <span>holy war.</span>  Already in July, the army of the Shah suddenly attacked from the areas of Talysh, Karabakh and Yerevan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what events led to the Russian-Iranian war" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1250496.jpg" width="361"></div>

The state government did not anticipate such a turn of events and did not prepare for battle in any way.  The strategic plan was developed by English officers.  He assumed the advance of the Abbas-Mirza troops in the Karabakh direction and the capture of Ganja and Shushi, then the invasion of the cavalry assembled in Agar and Ardabil in Talysh.

    <h2>  Enemy offensive </h2><p>  The Russian-Iranian war began with the retreat of the army of <span>Nicholas I.</span> The enemy units launched an attack on Cuba, Nuhu, Lankaran, Baku.  Here the shah counted on an uprising among the Azerbaijanis.  However, the population of their khans did not support.  On July 16, the army of the Yerevan khan attacked the Russian border fortifications located near Mirak.  Abbas Mirza crossed the Araks and began to rob the territory of Karabakh.  His 60,000th army approached Shusha.  The <span>siege of the tower began,</span> which lasted 48 hours.  The Abbas-Mirza army failed to break the resistance of the defenders.  As a result, he was forced to lift the siege. </p><h2>  First victories </h2><p>  The Russian government hastily formed detachments.  One of them, under the command of Madatov, made a forced march.  On September 3, the detachment entered into decisive battle with the 10,000-strong Persian army at Shamhor and won a brilliant victory.  Abbas Mirza hastened to the rescue of the defeated army.  In mid-September 1826, the main Iranian forces approached Ganja.  They consisted of 15 thousand people.  regular infantry, 20 thousand cavalry with 24 guns.  The total number of Russian soldiers was 7 thousand people.  They were commanded by Adjutant General Paskevich.  Despite the numerical superiority, the Iranian combined army was defeated.  The remnants of the defeated troops fled for Araks.  Upon learning of the defeat, the remaining detachments of khans and the troops of the shahs also hastened to retreat.  At the Mirak tract, the Russian detachment commanded by <span>Denis Davydov</span> (the illustrious hero of the war of 1812) defeated the Iranian army.  By doing so, he eliminated the danger of an enemy invasion of Northern Armenia.  At this the Russian-Iranian war of 1826 ended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="results of the Russian-Iranian war" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1250497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Second phase </h2><p>  In mid-March 1827, Nikolai replaced Ermolov with Paskevich.  This decision was caused by assumptions that the commander-in-chief of the troops was closely connected with the Decembrists, and their secret societies were also present in the Caucasus.  According to the plan, which had been drawn up even under Ermolov, it was supposed to cross the border by independent detachments and capture the fortresses of Sardar-Abbad, Abbas-Abbad, Yerevan, Tavriz, after which they went up to Tehran and signed a peace treaty there.  Paskevich‚Äôs troops went to Nakhichevan, capturing it, then to Abbas-Abbad.  This fortress was considered a stronghold of Iranian rule in the southern territories of Yerevan region.  The battle ended with the complete victory of the Russian army.  July 7, 1827 the fortress was captured.  The fall of major cities forced the Iranian government to begin peace talks.  January 25, 1828 capitulated the fortress of Ardabil.  Paskevich‚Äôs troops captured Marag, Urmia and opened a free road to Tehran. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of the Russian-Iranian war of 1826" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1250498.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  results </h2><p>  The Russian-Iranian war ended with the signing of the Turkmanchay Treaty.  In accordance with it, a mutual obligation was established regarding the exchange of envoys and the right to open trade missions and consulates in any city of the other side.  In addition, a Special Act was signed.  It included 9 articles.  The Act confirmed the Gulistan Peace, which provided the merchants of both states the right to free trade within another country.  The results of the Russian-Iranian war were very favorable for the peoples of the Caucasus.  The end of hostilities meant the security of their borders, the elimination of an external threat.  After the annexation of Transcaucasia to Russia, endless destructive raids of Turks and Iranians ended.  All this contributed to the cessation of strife, feudal fragmentation.  The annexation of Transcaucasia dealt a powerful blow to the ambitions of England, which sought to subjugate the peoples of the Caucasus and Iran to its power, seeking the non-proliferation of Russian influence in this region. </p>
