The uniqueness of the resort is that almost all along the coast of Pitsunda there is a coniferous grove with relict pines.  Forest in some places grows right on the beach.  The air is saturated with the aroma of pine and sea, has healing properties. </p>

    <p>  Exotic nature, a unique climate, the cleanest sea and gorgeous beaches are what vacationers come to this wonderful place for.  Abkhazia is a picturesque and proud country with its own flavor, as if it was created specifically for recreation.  However, the political situation has done its job.  The resort infrastructure of Pitsunda is somewhat neglected.  Perhaps that is why rest here is quite economical.  There are no new hotels of the European level in Pitsunda, the number of vacationers is quite moderate.  They are located mainly in private households, guest houses and mini-pensions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guest House Sosnovy Bor (Abkhazia, Pitsunda) </h2><p>  When planning their vacation in Abkhazia, many tourists prefer quiet, picturesque places to relax, which give peace and peace of mind.

    <p>  There are also negative reviews full of negativity.  They are completely opposite to the previous ones, and it seems that they are written about different places.  They say about the carelessness of the administration, about various breakdowns of household appliances, about the poor condition of the rooms, mold and dirt.  Some are unhappy with the reservation, others with a beach, others with a lack of good internet. </p><p>  It is worth saying that there are more sincere good reviews about the hotel than bad ones, but the latter are nevertheless alarming. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Hotel </h2><p>  Based on such conflicting reviews, we will try to draw conclusions about the pros and cons of the guest house. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  beautiful nature around the hotel; </li><li>  unique climate; </li><li>  proximity to the sea; </li><li>  the presence of a playground; </li><li>  spacious, well-kept yard; </li><li>  green spaces in the territory; </li><li>  peace and quiet; </li><li>  simplicity and hospitality of the owners. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  lack of service; </li><li>  deterioration of some numbers; </li><li>  lack of food at the hotel. </li></ul><p>  For any vacation, mood and good company are very important.  A vacation in an economy room without amenities may be the best if dear people are nearby and have a good mood, while around there is magnificent nature and a warm gentle sea. </p><p>  If you want to spend your vacation in silence, surrounded by elegant pine trees on the banks of a clean bay, then you should visit this beautiful place - Abkhazia, Pitsunda, guest house "Sosnovy Bor". </p>
