The company "Policy Group" has gained great popularity in today's real estate market.  What is she like? </p><p>  It would be right to investigate, before investing in Polis Group projects, feedback on the developer.  It is important to get the opinion of real buyers who have already dealt with the company in question and who have something to tell about their market behavior, integrity, punctuality, and the quality of the materials used.  After all, acquiring housing from a particular developer, you actually trust him with your comfort over the next several decades.  This should never be risked.  That is why this article will tell you in detail about the features of the functioning of the Polis Group company and the current projects of this developer. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="policy groups developer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1585448.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Developer <span>"Policy Group":</span> company <span>reviews</span> </h2><p>  True responses about the developer in question can be easily distinguished from the general mass.  And, as a rule, they are positive.  Customers love the reliability and honesty of Polis Group.

Buyers are satisfied themselves and tend to recommend the company in question to their friends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Company "Polis Group": employee reviews </h2><p>  The network does not have much feedback about the work of this developer.  As practice shows, this is a positive sign, since, as a rule, offended workers tend to leave a response in order to "slam the door louder." </p><p>  However, reviews of employees will be able to say a lot about the Policy Group.  In general, employees are satisfied with the work in the company and consider their salaries commensurate with the responsibilities that they perform.  Disappointing applicants can be a bright negative review, which can often be found on various resources.  A trained eye will quickly distinguish such a biased response, and intelligent people will not listen to such emotional outbursts. </p><p>  What conclusion can be drawn about working at the Policy Group?  Reviews about the employer make it clear that working with him is mostly comfortable and pleasant.  If interested, check it personally. </p>

    <h2>  Subsidies </h2><p>  This payment method involves the use of a special certificate issued for a fixed amount.  This document is intended solely for the purchase of an apartment.  This certificate can be used to repay a previously issued loan or to make a <span>down payment on a mortgage.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a special opportunity for families in which a second or even third child was born.  They can receive maternity capital available for use as a down payment on a mortgage, as payment for installments, as a missing amount for 100% payment. </p><p>  There are also a number of specialized state programs, for example, <span>‚ÄúResettlement of communal apartments‚Äù,</span> ‚ÄúYouth - affordable housing‚Äù, ‚ÄúHousing for public sector employees‚Äù. </p><h2>  Installment plan </h2><p>  It is also possible to arrange an installment plan for no more than 48 months.  At the same time, if the client is able to immediately provide the full price of the apartment, he will receive a twenty percent discount. </p><p>  When applying for installments, interest is not charged.  The minimum allowable down payment should be thirty percent of the price of the apartment, however, under certain conditions, you can get an additional discount on this contribution (twenty percent if the installment plan is issued only for the period of construction work; fifteen percent if the installment plan is valid for thirty-six months).  The discount is not valid when applying for installments for the entire possible period (forty-eight months). </p><p>  The main thing that needs to be researched in order to form an opinion about the "Policy Group" is the feedback from equity holders. </p><h2>  "Colors of summer" </h2><p>  The housing complex under consideration should be ready before the second quarter of 2018.  The houses will be erected from thirteen to nineteen floors high. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the district as a whole is not yet very diverse, as new buildings are actively being built in the district.  However, even now there is a polyclinic, a school and several kindergartens. </p><p>  At the same time, the internal infrastructure in the future will include many facilities, including: a dance school, a beauty salon, a kindergarten and a school, sports grounds, shops, playgrounds, and parking. </p><p>  The price of apartments in the housing complex under consideration ranges from one million three hundred thousand rubles to three million seven hundred and fifty thousand two hundred rubles. </p>

The colors of the exterior decoration of the building and the decoration of the hall will match.  The use of only the highest quality materials for such work has long been a hallmark of the Polis Group.  Reviews about the developer confirm this fact. </p><p>  The territory under consideration is distinguished by a favorable environmental situation.  This complex, in fact, is adjacent to a forest park located next to the Okkervil River. </p><p>  The construction technology of buildings used in this case is frame-monolithic.  The buyer can choose the option that is ideal for his family: a one-room or two-room apartment, or a studio apartment.  At the end of construction, water supply, central heating, electricity, internet, television and telephone will be available in the houses. </p><p>  Nearby is the Mega-Ikea complex.  The construction of the new Kudrovo metro station will also begin very soon.  This will greatly facilitate transport links. </p><p>  The area already has its own rich infrastructure.
