Solar installation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the development of autonomous energy sources, it becomes more and more popular and economically feasible to install solar panels in the country and at home.  In our time, technologies have emerged that make it possible to receive not only electric current from the sun, but also thermal energy in an amount sufficient to heat a house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="solar battery kit for garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078069.jpg" width="600"></div>  Solar heating involves the use of a special system in which water circulates, converting kinetic energy into heat.  The heated liquid then enters the special radiator systems installed in the house, and it gets warmer there.

    <p>  So far, using the sun to heat the house can only be done in this way, because if you connect heaters, even economical infrared emitters, to ordinary solar panels, they simply don‚Äôt have enough power for normal operation. </p><p>  But let's talk about panels used as a source of electricity.  Installing solar panels as the main source of energy can help solve all problems with power outages at the same time. </p><h2>  What are the types? </h2><p>  They can conditionally be divided into two main types.  These are silicon batteries and film. </p><p>  Photosensitive film elements have just begun to produce.  Release them in Denmark.  The advantage is that by deploying a roll of a similar film on the roof, it can be cut and sized.  The battery is not very powerful, but it is cheaper than others, because for its manufacture not the most expensive materials are required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <span>Solar panels</span> for the home, which are based on silicon wafers, are still considered the most popular and affordable option.  When compared with other types of batteries, silicon can be called the most effective.  Silicon batteries can be single crystal or polycrystalline. </p><h2>  Monocrystalline </h2><p>  Monocrystalline panels are composed of interconnected cells, for the production of which the purest silicon is used.  This material is obtained by <span>the Czochralski method.</span>  When a single crystal hardens, it is divided into plates whose thickness does not exceed 300 microns.  These elements are covered with a network of copper conductors, with the help of which electric current is removed from them.  Such a set of solar panels for summer cottages is the most effective, it is able to provide an efficiency of 22% and higher.  But its price is rather big, because the manufacturing process of panels is rather complicated and expensive. </p><h2>  Polycrystalline Solar Panels </h2><p>  When slowly cooled, molten silicon forms the so-called polycrystal.  This process involves the use of not so much energy, so it is not surprising that solar panels made from polycrystal are cheaper for a home.  The disadvantage of polycrystalline solar panels is their relatively low efficiency (up to 17%).  However, there is an advantage (except for the price, of course).  It lies in the fact that these batteries are much less demanding on the quality of sunlight.  If the effectiveness of the previous panels drops sharply in cloudy weather, then polycrystalline work even at dawn and sunset. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  There are many options for systems for generating solar energy, but we will consider only one that is popular and in demand, but also not the most expensive.  This set of solar panels for summer cottages is designed for seasonal use.  It is a great alternative to the state power network.  The power of the solar cells in this kit is 1000 watts.  In a month, electricity generation reaches 130 kW / h.  The maximum allowable load is 3 kW.  The kit includes 4 solar panels, two rechargeable batteries, a collector and an inverter.  What are these devices and what are they for, described below. </p>

    <p>  When paying for the kit, the buyer receives a consultation with a specialist on the connection and the scheme.  The installation principle is very simple, it is quite possible to cope on your own.  But if you want, you can pay for the installation by qualified specialists. </p><p>  The price does not include the price of accessories, wiring, fixtures. </p><h2>  Solar and battery </h2><p>  A similar set of solar panels for summer cottage includes 4 single-crystal panels.  Each of them is capable of generating a sufficiently large amount of electricity.  The panels are made using cutting edge technology.  They are based on the optimal combination of materials.  If necessary, you can choose the battery system that is most suitable in a particular case according to its characteristics.  The frame of each element is made resistant to bending.  The design allows these photovoltaic modules to be mounted quickly and reliably.  In addition, two A12 series lead acid batteries are included.  These batteries are used in alternative sources of continuous power supply. </p><h2>  Charge controller </h2><p>  One of the devices that are necessarily included in the solar system is a charge controller.  It is needed to automatically control the process of charges and discharges of the panel.  The device operates in accordance with the algorithm incorporated in it, which allows to optimize the battery operation as much as possible.  Thanks to this, the device can last much longer and more efficiently. </p>

    <p>  In the event that the installation of solar panels was not done correctly, the device is equipped with a self-diagnosis system and protection.  Some controllers are equipped with liquid crystal displays, which display the necessary data on the functioning of the system.  So you can track the strength of the current in the network, temperature, duration of work and so on. </p><h2>  Inverter </h2><p>  This is the name of the device, which turns the direct current of solar cells and batteries into alternating current 220 V. The frequency of the current issued by the device is 50 Hz.  At the output, an alternating current is obtained, the graphic display of which is represented by a sinusoid.  With this energy, it is possible to power all household appliances in the house.  It is used not only in cases when the solar battery gives energy.  An outdoor <span>wind station</span> or a hydraulic turbine can also produce current that converts this device. </p><p>  Instrument manufacturers provide a warranty of 2 or 3 years.  The system is also equipped with protection against all possible malfunctions, such as high input voltage, overheating, short circuit. </p><h2>  How are kits installed? </h2><p>  Having bought a set of solar panels for gardening, you need to install it correctly. </p>

    <p>  A panel of photovoltaic cells, whatever type it is, is mounted on the roof.  It is advisable that the panel does not fall shadow during the day from trees growing nearby.  You may need to prune the branches or remove the plants completely. </p><p>  Panels to the roof are not screwed tightly, they are located from the coating at a distance of a decimeter.  This circulates air under the batteries.  In addition, the modules will not so bask on the surface of the tile or other coating. </p>

    <p>  The remaining devices must be installed in a special room in the house.  The room should be protected from children and free access should be provided to those who will be responsible for monitoring the functioning of the system.  All household devices that consume low power current can be connected directly to the controller.  Other devices must receive energy through the inverter. </p><p>  Installation of such systems is a simple matter, any adult who is familiar with the principles of conducting electrical circuits can do this. </p><h2>  How much does such a kit cost? </h2><p>  So, you decided to use solar panels for power supply of a summer residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="solar panels kit cost" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1078063.jpg" width="530"></div>  The cost of the kit depends on various factors.  Among them - the number of solar panels included in the set, their type, type of batteries.  That kit, on the example of which this article was written, will cost $ 3019.  This price is formed by summing the cost of all devices included in it.  Four batteries cost $ 908.  Another $ 877 will cost two batteries.  The controller costs 256 conventional units, and the inverter costs 977. Of course, you can find cheaper solar panels.  Their efficiency will be lower, and they will last not so long, but the problem of providing a country house with electricity will still be solved.
