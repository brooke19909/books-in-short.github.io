  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow Beach Beach Club: full review, services, prices, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beach Beach Club in Moscow is the most expensive in the city.  Why are they asking such money?  What services do they provide in return?  Where is the Beach Club located?  Is it possible to simply sunbathe and swim, or does the price of the entrance ticket include any entertainment?  Our article will answer all these questions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.the-village.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Beach Club Moscow" class="if uuid-2240492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240492.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the beach located and how to get there </h2><p>  An elite resting place for Muscovites and guests of the capital is located on the coast of the Khimki reservoir.  It should be noted that not only the sandy zone is fenced, but also the water area, which is regularly cleaned.  The official address of the Beach Club beach: Moscow, Leningradskoye Highway 39, Building 6. </p><p>  Getting to the place is easy.  The beach is located between the Voykovskaya and Vodny Stadium metro stations.  You can get out anywhere, but get closer from the second station, although beach regulars don't take the metro and don't walk. </p><p>  There is a car park nearby.  And for guests arriving by water, even a yacht pier is equipped.  Calling ‚ÄúBeach Club‚Äù simply a beach is not entirely correct.  After all, there is a yacht club, restaurants, a large stage where DJs, children's and sports grounds hold shows.  People come here not only to sunbathe and swim (although for the sake of this, too), but first of all to have a chic rest in a prestigious place.  The main and central point of this elite entertainment town is the Royal Bar, where resident DJs hold incendiary parties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sand Beach Beach Club" class="if uuid-2240493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240493.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description of the town </h2><p>  The sandy beach of the Beach Club is divided into two zones - regular and VIP, so the prices for sun loungers are very different.  Later we will find out the cost of tickets to the beach.  Now we will discuss why the Beach Club is asking for such money.  Firstly, the sand here is snow-white, as in the Maldives.  And this comparison is quite legitimate.  Indeed, sand was delivered to the banks of the Khimki reservoir exactly from the Maldives.  The ticket price includes the use of a wooden lounger with a mattress, a beach umbrella and a towel. </p><p>  What other services can a visitor enjoy?  This is a swimming pool.  Swimming in the Khimki reservoir is officially allowed, but many people prefer to splash around in a closed tank, where the water goes through a modern treatment system. </p><p>  The ticket price includes participation in recreational activities.  You can do water aerobics or gymnastics under the guidance of an experienced trainer.  Outdoor activities are available at Gold'sGym Fitness Center for outdoor enthusiasts. </p><p>  Many potential visitors are wondering: will it be crowded within the fenced area?  But the beach is designed for free accommodation of thousands of people.  There are 300 sun loungers in the VIP zone.  Naturally, on the coast there is a shower, toilet, storage rooms, wooden decking, lifeguards on duty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Club Beach Moscow reviews" class="if uuid-2240497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240497.jpg"></div><h2>  Paid service on the beach "Beach Club" (Moscow) </h2><p>  Now let's see what the majority of visitors come here for.  The RoyalBar dance floor is the main party place for the golden youth of Moscow.  There are no party schedules, but the poster of events is always published on the site.  You can have a bite here.  Moreover, the dishes in the beach bar of the Beach Club (Moscow) differ from those that are prepared in cafes on the coasts.  Here you can enjoy imported products: artichokes, asparagus, gorgonzola.  Of course, delicious cocktails, steaks and grills are prepared here.  Even real masters of their craft from Italy bake pizza here.  There are two restaurants on the beach: one with Japanese, and the second with European cuisine.  But not for the sake of filling the stomach, young people come here.  If we talk about purely beach activities, then you can rent water scooters, skis, boats and even yachts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Club Moscow beach how much is the entrance" class="if uuid-2240500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2240500.jpg"></div><h2>  How much does it cost to enter the Beach Club beach (Moscow) </h2><p>  Reviews characterize this elite holiday destination not only as the most prestigious, but also the most expensive.  If we talk about the beach, it is open only in the summer months, which is logical.  Open from 10:00 to 00:00.  The cost of renting a sunbed depends not only on the zone (regular or VIP), but also on the day of the week: </p><ul><li>  The cost of renting a sunbed is 1000 rubles / day (Monday-Thursday), 2000 rubles / day (Friday-Sunday, holidays). </li><li>  The cost of renting a sunbed in the VIP zone is 2,000 rubles / day (Monday-Thursday), 4,000 rubles / hour (Friday-Sunday, holidays). </li></ul><p>  But despite the high tariffs, Beach Club beach (Moscow) is characterized by reviews as very popular and popular.  If you still decide to sunbathe on the shore of the Khimki reservoir at the price of a trip to Egypt on an all-inclusive basis, then take at least a ticket or a receipt for payment.  There were times when employees demanded a fee from visitors twice. </p>
