About eight hundred shrubs and trees will be planted throughout the territory, there will be a pedestrian boulevard with barbecue areas, gazebos for relaxing, amazingly beautiful lighting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn--72-6kch9agsibavln.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of LCD Legend Park" class="if uuid-3078442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078442.jpg"></div><p>  New buildings are located on the territory of a fairly young and rapidly developing microdistrict near the Moscow highway.  In walking distance from here are a school, kindergartens and a clinic. </p><p>  The transport infrastructure of the Legenda Park residential complex attracts many potential buyers of real estate in the area.  In the immediate vicinity there is a roundabout with a lot of public transport, which allows you to quickly get to anywhere in the city. </p><p>  A large number of commercial premises are provided on the territory of the quarter, for which areas on the first floors of new houses under construction were allocated in advance.  Therefore, shops, cafes, beauty salons and a fitness center are located within walking distance. </p><h2>  A stone's throw </h2><p>  When developing the layout of the area, it was carefully thought out so that the territory of the residential complex was convenient for both adults and children.  In particular, it provides for the appearance of three entertainment areas for children of different ages, a skate park, bicycle paths, and playgrounds for workout. </p><p>  Clinic No. 5 is a ten-minute public transport ride from the new buildings, and the major Continent and Columbus shopping and entertainment centers can be reached on foot.  Recently, a new gymnasium has been opened on the territory of the Tyumen Sloboda, capable of accepting more than a thousand students.  Near the residential complex there are several municipal and private kindergartens, as well as a private elementary school called "Euro gymnasium". </p><h2>  House Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tyumen.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews in LCD Legend Park" class="if uuid-3078446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078446.jpg"></div><p>  The developer is building reliable monolithic-frame houses, which are considered very durable.  In addition, they are convenient for redevelopment. </p><p>  The applied technology called "Wet facade" helps to avoid major repairs for more than twenty years.  The whole complex is connected to a single telemetry system, which allows you to automatically collect all the necessary information from the meters. </p><p>  In the apartments themselves, communications are placed as thoughtfully as possible.  The wiring is made so that there are simply no risers and pipes in a visible place.  At the construction stage, equity holders can agree on a particular type of finish in which the apartment will be rented.  They are designed for different willingness to move.  It can be a rough finish, fine, standard, standard + or comfort. </p><p>  Potential buyers should be attracted by the increased ceiling height in the apartment, which reaches almost three meters, which allows you to create in each room a lot more space than exists in such a typical living space.  In addition to the pantries provided for storing things, there are balconies that can be skillfully turned into stylish and comfortable additional functional spaces. </p><h2>  Where is? </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.1323223" data-lng="65.45661599999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/2/8/14328.png"></div><p>  Location LCD "Legend Park" is considered very convenient.  The microdistrict in the district is developing rapidly.  It is especially convenient in terms of transport accessibility, as in the immediate vicinity there is a roundabout. </p><p>  Highways laid in this area are not loaded, even a bypass road, which allows you to get to any part of the city in a relatively small amount of time. </p><p>  A network of public transport has been developed.  For example, nearby is bus stop number 39, which is located near a residential quarter. </p><p>  In the neighborhood are several new residential areas of new buildings.  For example, "Intelligence Quarter." </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tyumen.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Legend Park" class="if uuid-3078444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078444.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of this residential complex is carried out by the Meridian group of companies.  This is a well-known developer in Tyumen who has been working in the local market since 2007. </p><p>  He considers the key standards in his professional activity to be the manufacturability and reliability of construction solutions, combined with responsibility to his partners and customers.  Great importance is attached to the continuous application and development of modern construction and finishing technologies. </p><p>  The company emphasizes that they conclude contracts with participants in shared construction in full compliance with 412 federal law.  Interest holders may not worry about the safety of their money, since in this case they are protected by the Mutual Insurance Company of developers.  This is a public structure operating at the federal level. </p><p>  The contractor of the Legenda Park residential complex in Tyumen is well known in the region, many trust it, since the company has a large number of completed projects on time, and tens of thousands of square meters of housing have already been commissioned.  Among them are the Siberian Meridian, Solnechny, Sovremennik, New Cape, Dobry, Znamensky, Zarechny. </p><p>  The company is headed by the manager Ivan Nikolayevich Druganov, the post of construction director is Denis Vadimovich Gulakov, and the personnel director is Svetlana Aleksandrovna Slivkina. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Currently, one, two, three and four bedroom apartments are for sale in a residential complex.  It is especially noted that affordability is one of the main advantages of new buildings. </p><p>  For example, an apartment in the Legenda Park residential complex can be purchased for 1.3 million rubles.  The studio area will be about 23 and a half square meters.  Almost 20 squares are occupied by a room combined with a kitchen, less than four square meters are allocated to a combined bathroom.  Interestingly, this area does not include a balcony with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 m2 <sup>.</sup> </p><p>  A three-room apartment can be bought for 3.2 million rubles.  Its area is about 55 m <sup>2</sup> .  Of these, 20 squares are occupied by a kitchen-living room, two rooms of 10 meters each, separate bath and toilet. </p><p>  Buyers note that the layout in the Legenda Park residential complex is so diverse that everyone can find something to their liking. </p><p>  The company notes that they strive to take care of the individuality of each family, therefore they are designing different layouts so that everyone can choose the option to taste.  In this regard, modern planning solutions for studio apartments, known as SMART, have been developed. </p><p>  SMART planning is considered an excellent solution for creating an individual living environment.  In apartments, literally every square centimeter is involved in special functional areas.  A unique zoned space has been created in which everything is thought out down to the smallest detail. </p><p>  In particular, modern studios are equipped with special areas that increase the comfort of your life.  For example, niches under the wardrobe in the living room, a dedicated area for the kitchen, a place in which a small corner kitchen set will fit.  There are several options, each family will be able to choose the one that she will like more. </p><p>  If you decide to purchase a studio of an unusual format, you will not need to do redevelopment or reorganize the space.  This means that you do not have to spend additional funds on arranging a convenient and comfortable life. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  There are many positive reviews about the LCD "Legend Park" in Tyumen.  Residents note that a small studio or one-room apartment is the best option for a young family or a young man who takes the first steps in his life </p><p>  The project attracted the participation of a reliable developer who has already earned a name for himself - local residents trust him.  In addition, there is a well-maintained, environmentally friendly and green area, and apartments are sold at affordable prices. </p><p>  The view from the window looks advantageous. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  At the same time, there are also negative reviews about the residential complex.  The main negative point is that for many LCDs it is still too far from the center.  However, the choice has to be made in favor of these new buildings because of already too attractive prices, since the secondary market offers real estate at inflated prices. </p><p>  Motorists admit: getting to the city center, one still has to deal with traffic jams that take up valuable time. </p><p>  Those who have already moved to new apartments complain that not all utility systems work flawlessly.  For example, residents of the upper floors suffer from a lack of water, especially in the evenings, when water is used by almost all apartments.  Of course, the management company and the developer promise to quickly fix the problems, but it is not known how the situation will turn out when all the tenants move into the apartments. </p>
