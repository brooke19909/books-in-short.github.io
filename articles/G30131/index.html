This technique does not require much effort in the work, allows you to show creative imagination, makes it possible to regularly update your wardrobe and give original gifts to loved ones.  Hand knitting is the oldest form of decorative art.  Such work gives pleasure, calms the nervous system, develops motor skills, which positively affects the state of health and mental activity of a person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.knittingmatters.com/free-easy-knitting-patterns-for-baby-blankets-for-beginners/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting horizontal patterns" class="if uuid-3036693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3036693.jpg"></div><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  The choice of yarn is of utmost importance.  Each thread is endowed with its own characteristics, which are usually written on the label.  Do not ignore the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the care of yarn, since the life of the knitted product depends on this.  The following types of yarn are presented in the assortment of specialized stores: </p><ul><li>  Woolen </li><li>  half-woolen; </li><li>  synthetic; </li><li>  cotton; </li><li>  mohair; </li><li>  wool of home spinning. <div class="photo" data-original="giftseshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Horizontal knitting patterns for hats" class="if uuid-3036718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3036718.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Practical tips </h2><p>  Knitting horizontal patterns are very suitable for making wool products.  They are perfectly worn and do not lose their shape with proper care of them.  For knitting hats, sweaters, scarves or any outerwear, thick threads are suitable.  Knitting dresses, blouses, vests, pullovers is recommended from fine wool, which is taken in three or four threads.  Sports things should be knitted from a thick thread or pet yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The yarn brought from the store should not be immediately rewound into balls.  It must be washed.  To do this, you need to collect water 30 - 40 degrees, put there a baby or bath soap, beat the foam.  Then lower the yarn there, gently squeeze it with your hands (no need to rub), using a delicate wash.  Rinse thoroughly in water and dry. </p><p>  For knitting, you can also use second-hand yarn.  To do this, it is necessary to undo the product parts, dissolve them (usually dissolve from top to bottom) and wind them into a skein (not to be confused with a ball).  Then wash according to the above method and start a new knitting. </p><h2>  Simple patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="newstitchaday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting patterns horizontal stripes" class="if uuid-3036713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3036713.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting horizontal patterns with knitting are very easy (even for beginners).  There are some simple drawings that are suitable for almost any DIY product.  Among them: </p><ol><li>  Facial surface.  The canvas fits as the loops look.  For example, the first row is knitted with facial loops, the second - with the wrong ones.  When the job is turned over, the front loops appear again, then the wrong ones again. </li><li>  Hosiery knitting.  This is a simple knit, in which all the loops are knitted facial.  At each turn of the work, knitting is obtained against the way the loops look, since the front loop on the other hand becomes seamy. </li><li>  Putanka.  This knitting involves the alternation of one front and one wrong loop.  When the job is overturned, the front loop is sewn on the wrong side, and the wrong loop - on the front. </li></ol><h2>  Horizontal finishing strip </h2><p>  This pattern is suitable for knitting scarves, blouses, cardigans, etc.  A one-way knitting method is used.  It is recommended to knit from different types of yarn of medium and thin thickness.  The description of the horizontal pattern with knitting needles in the form of a finishing strip looks like this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  dial a rapport of 27 loops plus two hem; </li><li>  1, 4, 5, 8, 22, 25, 26, 29 rows - knit all the loops wrong; </li><li>  2, 3, 6, 7, 15, 23, 24, 27, 28 rows - knit all the loops face; </li><li>  9, 10, 16, 17 rows - four out., Four persons., One out .; </li><li>  11 and 18 rows - two front, four out., Two persons., One persons .; </li><li>  12 and 19 rows - two out., Four front, three out .; </li><li>  13, 14, 20, 21 rows - four persons., Four out., One front. </li></ul><p>  Pay attention to the abbreviations (relevant for subsequent patterns): </p><ul><li>  out.  - this is the wrong loop; </li><li>  persons.  - front loop. </li></ul><h2>  Malinka </h2><p>  A horizontal knitting pattern called "raspberry" is suitable for making sweaters, pullovers, vests, hats, parts for outerwear.  Since it is not openwork, it is recommended to use medium or thick threads for knitting.  The quality of the yarn does not matter, although the wool will be much warmer.  Step-by-step execution looks like this: </p><ul><li>  dial a rapport that is a multiple of 12 loops plus three for symmetry and two edge; </li><li>  first row - three out., from one loop knit five loops, three out .; </li><li>  all even rows are knitted with facial loops; </li><li>  third and seventh rows - out.  loops; </li><li>  fifth row - one out., knit five loops from one loop, one out., five together out .; </li><li>  the ninth row - one out., five out together., one out., knit five stitches from one loop; </li><li>  starting from the eleventh row, repeat the pattern from the fifth row. </li></ul><h2>  Openwork Christmas trees </h2><p>  The horizontal openwork pattern with knitting needles in the form of Christmas trees is suitable for dresses, blouses, pullovers, wraps, etc.  Since the openwork knit should look gentle, it is necessary to use medium or thin threads.  An excellent solution would be to choose cotton, synthetic half-woolen or woolen yarn without lint (it will close the whole picture).  The knitting pattern looks like this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  dial a rapport of twenty loops plus two edging; </li><li>  first row - one out., eight front, two out., eight front, one out .; </li><li>  knit all even rows as the loops look; </li><li>  third row - one p., four front, three loops together, front with a slope to the right, yarn, one person., yarn, two out., yarn, one person., yarn, three loops together with tilts to the left, four persons., one out .; </li><li>  fifth row - one out., three faces., three loops with a right bend, yarn, one person., yarn, one person., two out., one front, yarn, one person., yarn, three loops with a left bend , three facial, one out .; </li><li>  seventh row - one out., two front, three stitches with a right bend, double crochet, one person., double crochet, two faces., two outfit, two facial, double crochet, one person., double crochet, two persons., one out .; </li><li>  the ninth row - one out., one person., three stitches with a right bend, yarn, one person., yarn, three people., two out., three people., yarn, one person., yarn, three stitches together .  with a tilt to the left, one person., one out .; </li><li>  eleventh row - one out., three loops together of persons.  with a slope to the right, double crochet, single crochet, double crochet, four double crochet, two p., four single crochet, single crochet, single crochet., double crochet, three stitches together.  turning left, one out. </li></ul><h2>  Small openwork leaflets </h2><p>  A horizontal openwork pattern with knitting needles in the form of small leaves is also suitable for making models for the warm season.

You can alternately alternate two colors, you can repeat the pattern every three, four, etc., or you can make the product in the form of a gradient or rainbow.  In the case of simple stripes, remember that the finished product will stretch in width.  That is why for this method it is recommended to type a little less loops.  It is recommended to choose an option that suits the taste of the customer: </p><ol><li>  Knit the first row with facial loops, turning over, knit the wrong side.  Then again, the face and the wrong side.  The fifth row is knitted with the wrong side (against the way the loops look), then with the front ones, etc.  The result should be a drawing in which four rows of facial and four rows of purl alternate. </li><li>  Similarly, knit six rows of front and back.  It is thus possible to make 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.  It should be remembered that the more identical rows there are, the wider the strips. </li></ol><h2>  Openwork paths </h2><p>  The pattern of "horizontal track" with knitting needles is repeated from the first to the twelfth row.  Before and after rapport, knit two loops.  Knit the wrong side as the loops look, knit the crochets on the wrong side. </p><ul><li>  first row - knit all the loops inside out; </li><li>  third row - knit all loops face; </li><li>  fifth row - knit all the loops inside out; </li><li>  seventh row - knit two loops with a slope to the left (remove the first loop, knit the second and stretch the loop removed through it), double crochet, two loops with a left slope, double crochet, two loops with a left slope, double crochet; </li><li>  the ninth row - persons., two loops with an inclination to the left, yarn, two loops with an inclination to the left, yarn, persons .; </li><li>  eleventh row - fits, similar to the seventh. </li></ul><h2>  Original strip </h2><p>  The pattern "horizontal strip" with knitting needles will decorate any product (hat, sweater, skirt, socks).  To execute it, you need to work as follows: </p><ul><li>  the first and eleventh rows - knit all the loops face; </li><li>  second and twelfth rows - knit all the loops inside out; </li><li>  third row - four facial alternate with four out .; </li><li>  the fourth and seventh rows - one out., four persons., three out .; </li><li>  the fifth and eighth rows - two front, four out., two persons .; </li><li>  sixth and ninth rows - three out., four persons., one out .; </li><li>  10 row - four facial, four out. </li></ul><h2>  Chain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="picmia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting chain" class="if uuid-3036709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3036709.jpg"></div><p>  The knitting pattern "horizontal chain" is knitted with the usual facial smoothness with delicate chains periodically running horizontally.  This pattern can be used to separate some parts of the product or as the main canvas.  Knitting should begin with the front surface with an arbitrary number of rows.  Place the chain evenly through the same number of rows or make a drawing as you wish.  The horizontal line in the form of a chain is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Remove the edge loop without knitting. </li><li>  Add an extra loop by pulling. </li><li>  To put an additional loop on the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Knit the second loop on the left knitting needle behind the back wall (leave on the left knitting needle). </li><li>  Knit the first loop on the left knitting needle behind the front wall. </li><li>  Reset both loops (one of them turned out). </li><li>  Put the loop on the left knitting needle. </li><li>  In a similar way, knit to the end of the row. </li><li>  Knit the end of the chain (the last loop) together with the edge seam. </li></ol><h2>  Braids </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imaginegnats.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pigtail pattern" class="if uuid-3036720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3036720.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting pattern "horizontal braids" is suitable for products intended for the cold season.  This can be outerwear, sweaters, jumpers, pullovers, etc. A reasonable decision would be to choose thick or medium yarn, mainly from natural fibers.
