Almost every ancient state had its own characteristics of this technique.  The English patchwork, which is famous for the simplicity of forms and the accessibility of fabrics, received worldwide recognition.  But no less interesting is the Japanese patchwork.  Like everything else, the inhabitants of the land of the rising sun managed to bring this technique to perfection and turn it into real art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese patchwork" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of Japanese patchwork </h2><p>  Unlike European craftswomen, Japanese have their own special techniques and techniques.  The first feature is the presence of the <span>line ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù.</span>  She decorates the finished canvas, creating and emphasizing unusual patterns and drawings.  Thus, simply sewn together rags become like a work of art. </p><p>  Secondly, special attention is paid to floral designs and ornaments.  It can be either prints on fabric or embroidered patterns. </p><p>  Thirdly, the use of applications is not typical for English technology.  Patchwork in Japanese often uses this technique to create a more picturesque picture. </p><p>  Masters from Japan never use sewing machines for work.  For them, this technique is a way to enjoy and create a truly valuable thing.  And this is only possible with manual work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well and, of course, fabrics.  Japanese patchwork uses mainly silk, while cotton fabrics are preferred all over the world. </p><h2>  Patchwork as art </h2><p>  The Japanese know how to turn ordinary affairs into a whole philosophy.  Sewing from the remnants of the fabric was no exception.  The combination of different flaps, their colors and shapes allows you to create real picturesque paintings.  They are complemented by applique and embroidery.  This is no longer just a patchwork.  Japanese technology has improved to such a level that it has long ceased to be just a craft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese patchwork bags" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700017.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  There are cases when Europeans and Americans took these works for painting on silk, they looked so incredible. </p><p>  Moreover, this technique is essentially close to religious beliefs that endow the soul with living and nonliving objects.  Patchwork means the revival of the soul of dying textile products, their transformation in a new improved form. </p><h2>  Basic block layouts </h2><p>  As is known from history, the ancient Japanese patchwork is an applique.  The layout of its blocks in modern times is dictated by this particular feature.  In most cases, a fabric blank is taken for sewing, on which shreds are applied in a certain order.  Their location is dominated by clear geometric lines, circles and squares, and various arcs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese patchwork applique scheme" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700018.jpg" width="400"></div>

From multi-colored rags laid out the petals of flowers and the crown of trees.  This feature is not typical for English technology, since it is more complex in execution. </p><p>  In fact, an inexperienced master is unlikely to distinguish a Japanese patchwork from a European one.  The main distinguishing feature of the latter is simplicity and comprehensibility.  The Japanese strive to make each product as complex and bizarre as possible.  It is worth considering an example of a simple motive. </p><h2>  Simple Block Assembly Example </h2><p>  In one or two times it is difficult to fully master the Japanese patchwork.  The master class of this technique, although simple, but the general concept is akin to philosophy.  First you need to learn the basics. </p><p>  To work, you need 3 cardboard blanks: 2 circles of different diameters and a square that fits exactly in a smaller circle. </p><p>  Cut a flap over a large circle.  A dashed seam is made along the edge with a contrasting thread.  The ends of the thread are not fixed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese patchwork master class" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700020.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  We take a smaller circle, place it in a fabric blank and smooth it inside its edges.  We tighten the thread so that the workpiece keeps its shape better.  We take out the cardboard circle, and in its place with the front side we put a square rag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Next, in the form of a square, bend the edges of the circle and fix them with pins.  The workpiece is ready for further needle stitching forward.  This is the simplest example that demonstrates to the uninitiated Japanese patchwork.  The master class of this technique is understandable, but it itself will require a certain skill from the performer. </p><h2>  Needle forward stitch </h2><p>  Anyone who wants to learn Japanese patchwork, the patterns of which are widespread, will encounter such a thing as a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù line.  This is one of the basic seams in sewing and embroidery. </p><p>  It is performed by passing the needle through the fabric at equal distances.  This is precisely the complexity of the technique: you need to learn how to make the thread perfectly perfectly dotted.  The stitches and gaps between them should have equal distances.  Otherwise, the product will look ugly. </p><p>  Whoever knows how to perfectly master this seam will be able to create beautiful products using the Japanese patchwork technique.  The application, patterns and patterns in it are impossible without possession of the stitch forward.  In addition, in this patchwork it is not allowed to use any technical means for stitching flaps. </p><h2>  Fields of application </h2><p>  Initially, the patchwork was used to update old clothes.  There were also examples in history of how products in this technique performed the role of chain mail, protecting from arrows and a gliding blow with a sword. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese patchwork scheme" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700021.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Today it is an original decorative technique.  Many designers use Japanese patchwork in their work.  Bags in this technique are especially popular because they are not only beautiful, but also convenient and practical. </p><p>  Also often found home <span>decoration (pillows,</span> bedspreads, rugs, curtains), sewn from shreds in the Japanese style. </p><p>  Use it for sewing clothes.  Even in ancient times, it was believed that a gift is very expensive if it was made using the patchwork technique.  Japanese technology makes every thing unique, because it is created only by hand and for a specific person. </p><h2>  The simplest bag </h2><p>  To sew a bag in this technique, it is necessary to make a sufficient number of block blanks.  Using the example of the previous workshop, consider a simple way to assemble a bag. </p><p>  Since our blocks are square in shape, it is not difficult to create a box with their help.  It will be the beginning for our bag.  We sew the blanks together, sew the lining and handles - we get a practical and convenient shopping bag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself japanese patchwork" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700019.jpg" width="303"></div>

    <p>  In the future, you can try and learn how to sew the other blocks that make up the Japanese patchwork.  Bags in this technique will complement any outfit, will become an integral part of its ensemble. </p><h2>  Seamless japanese patchwork </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the Japanese have elevated this type of needlework to the level of real art.  Proof of this is the seamless pattern in this technique.  They arose at a time when Japan introduced a restriction on the import of <span>Chinese fabrics.</span> </p><p>  The essence of "drawing with a cloth" is as follows: a smooth board was taken as a blank.  A contour drawing was applied to it.  Small narrow grooves cut along the contours.  Thanks to them, the fabric was held on to the future canvas. </p><p>  Further, the work of the master was to cut the desired color and size of the flap and tuck it into the prepared furrows.  A piece of fabric seemed to be pulled on a wooden blank. </p><p>  The paintings in this technique, called Kinusaiga, are a bit like stained glass windows, with the only difference being that they are opaque. </p><p>  Today, this art has changed a bit.  Today, foam is used as a preform, which does not require preliminary grooves. </p><p>  Of course, products made using the kinusaig technique are exclusively applied in nature and cannot be used in everyday life. </p><h2>  Some tips for beginners </h2><p>  Those who want to create a Japanese patchwork with their own hands need a lot of time and effort to master this art to perfection. </p><p>  First you need to study the basic shapes from which the blocks for the patchwork are created.  Japanese technique is a bit like origami, just as sophisticated and requires perfect execution in everything.  Slightly inaccurate bending, uneven stitching, skewed block can seriously spoil the appearance of the finished product. </p><p>  It is also worth learning to sew by hand.  And it will be necessary to master not only the ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.  For a long time, Japanese craftsmen have been using embroidery as one of the main elements of patchwork.  The more seams the master knows, the more original the product is. </p><p>  Although the patchwork is sewn from rags, these days it is necessary to buy special fabrics for this art.  Moreover, they must be of the same quality, thickness and density, otherwise the product will be swollen and skewed.  This is one of those cases where saving can be expensive.  Only good, expensive <span>silk fabrics</span> guarantee success. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork japanese technique" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700015.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <p>  Contrast applications perfectly complement the finished product.  At the same time, they are made from the same blocks, and not from individual flaps.  The latter is quite rare when it is necessary to focus on a particularly small element. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to experiment.  Color and shape can be complemented by beautiful lines of seams and light applications.  Or vice versa - a patchwork canvas becomes an excellent background for a real embroidered picture. </p>
