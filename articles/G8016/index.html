    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Well, this is the first criterion that travelers are guided by when deciding on a hotel.  Corallia Beach Hotel Apartments is located on one of the best beaches in Cyprus - on <span>Coral Bay.</span>  It is such because its coast is covered with soft and fine sand of light yellow color with a reddish tint.  The vast majority of the <span>beaches of Cyprus</span> and Paphos are covered with a mixture of pebbles and shell rock.  Many people do not find this surface comfortable. </p><p>  So the beach, which can be reached in just a minute, is the first reason why the hotel became popular.  The second is located in close proximity to the hotel airport.  It can be reached in half an hour.  And the port of Limassol is only 45 minutes away.  Kato Paphos (lower part of the city) is located 12 kilometers from the hotel.  And right next door were numerous taverns, souvenir stalls and grocery stores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, the notorious beach is marked with the EU Blue Flag, which is awarded places for cleanliness and good, safe water for swimming. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Corallia Beach Hotel Apartments provides guests with various services.  If guests are freezing, then they can offer a central heating connection.  Bridal suites, family rooms and facilities for disabled people are also available. </p><p>  The territory has its own mini-market with food, water and other goods, as well as a souvenir shop.  There is also free private parking, car and bicycle rental, luggage storage, tour desk, currency exchange, conference room and a 24-hour reception desk. </p><p>  In addition to the above, there is dry cleaning, laundry and ironing.

    <h2>  Guests staying </h2><p>  Corallia Beach Hotel Apartments gets mostly positive reviews.  The first thing people who have visited here is to note the fact that the staff working in the hotel speak several languages, namely: French, English, Greek, German, Bulgarian, Romanian and, of course, Russian. </p><p>  Naturally, the location of the hotel was also not disregarded.  The beach is understandable, but the guests also liked the fact that there is a bus stop nearby with free buses that take people to the zoo.  And along the way you can admire the exotic local vegetation.  There is also a stop nearby, from where buses go to Paphos.  So for transport accessibility this place also received a plus from the guests. </p><p>  By the way, guests with children paid attention to the <span>services of nannies, a</span> children's menu, and also that in restaurants, if you ask, they can bring a special chair.  Here they treat this with understanding. </p>

    <h2>  Other nuances </h2><p>  There are several more points that guests note with attention.  Wi-Fi - it is, and also it is free.  It would seem that this is not a moment to which it would be worth paying attention.  However, the bottom line is that many hotels promise free Internet, but in reality you have to pay extra for it. </p><p>  There are safes, they cost 2.5 euros per day.  In restaurants you can have dinner, even if guests did not take the service "boarding house".  It will cost about 10 euros per person.  The portions are huge, some even advise taking one for two. </p><p>  It is also encouraging that one cook and the main bartender speak Russian.  The latter, by the way, knows a lot of cocktails, and you should not be shy to ask him to make them. </p><p>  If you ‚Äúlook through‚Äù the channels on the TV, you can find several Russian speakers, which is also nice.  In general, in Paphos there are many of our compatriots or just people who speak the language.  Even on the radio in buses, sometimes Russian songs are heard.  For most, this is a huge plus, since there are no problems with misunderstanding what is happening around and in communicating with the locals.  Minus is only for people who want a break from Russia. </p><p>  Many note a huge plus - silence on weekdays.  Paphos has a very active nightlife, a lot of young people who like to have fun.  However, here on weekdays it is really very calm, quiet and peaceful.  This fact should be borne in mind by those people who wish to spend their holidays in just such an environment. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say: this is a good option for not very whimsical travelers who want to sunbathe, see the sights and have plenty of fun.  The hotel has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  It is at least illogical to expect a luxurious service and VIP services from a hotel with such modest prices. </p>
