Due to some features of the origin of the rocks of these places, a lot of hydrogen sulfide wells have been drilled here, one of which became a source discovered in the 1990s.  Proven its healing. </p><p>  This is a hot spring Biragzang, beating from the depths of the earth near the village of Upper Biragzang.  Its water can effectively cure people of many diseases. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.01134820000001" data-lng="44.23477839999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/1/7/5/16175.png"></div><h2>  Village Information </h2><p>  Upper Biragzang is a village located in the Alagir district of North Ossetia.  It belongs to the Biragzang rural settlement.  Near the river flows Ardon.  The distance to the village of Nizhny Biragzang is 1.5 km, to the urban settlement Alagira - 1 kilometer. </p><p>  Ossetians live in a village consisting of five streets.  There is a school, a medical facility of the FAP and a village administration.  The Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker operates (building 2005, consecrated in 2010).  The peculiarity of the local church is that in church murals prayers are performed not only in Church Slavonic, but also in Ossetian, and one of the tiers has frescoes with Alan saints. </p><p>  In 2010, on the site of the healing hot spring Biragzang, the Gabuev entrepreneurs laid the foundation for the construction of a medical facility.  Since 2008, a rehabilitation center has been operating in the village, where disabled children and refugees with toddlers can recover their health (designed for 100 families).  In the same year, a capital dam 310 meters long was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nudeblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of the village" class="if uuid-3170445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3170445.jpg"></div><h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  According to the stories of local residents, drill specialists from the city of Rostov appeared in the vicinity of the Ossetian village of Verkhny Biragzang in the mid-1990s.  They were searching for oil, but instead of ‚Äúblack gold‚Äù a hot fountain of water burst from the well they drilled.  The first that it had excellent healing properties, local residents were convinced.  After that, the rumor about the hot spring Biragzang spread throughout North Ossetia, and then to neighboring regions. </p><p>  According to the stories of local residents, visitors from other regions of the country took baths here.  Many of them cured skin diseases, polyarthritis and other pathologies.  The conditions of stay here at that time did not meet the standards of sanitation.  The area around this spring was dirty, like a swamp.  But people came and came here, and the head of the village had to install bathing tanks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nudeblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain landscapes" class="if uuid-3170447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3170447.jpg"></div><p>  Further, the improvement of the territory adjacent to the water artery, and the creation of amenities took up the local family.  A plot was fenced, a pool was built, and a water analysis from this source was made at the Pyatigorsk research institute.  As a result, it was attributed to the type of low-mineralized medicinal-table liquids. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rest at the Biragzang Hot Spring </h2><p>  Vladikavkaz is located about 40 kilometers from this famous village.  Therefore, travelers who have gathered in the <span>capital of North Ossetia</span> can make a healthy trip to a healing spring.  Moreover, there are interesting sights here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of st. Nicholas the Wonderworker" class="if uuid-3170454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3170454.jpg"></div><p>  The source area is being actively landscaped today.  There is a swimming pool with locker rooms, quite comfortable recreation areas, and there is also night-time lighting.  It offers a beautiful view of the mountains of the Caucasus. </p><h2>  Beneficial features </h2><p>  The water of the hot spring Biragzang (Ossetia) rises from a great depth - 2,300 meters.  It is effective in the treatment of diseases of the heart, vascular and nervous system.  It also benefits in chronic intoxication, gynecological and skin diseases.  Baths are good for the musculoskeletal and endocrine systems, as well as for the normalization of metabolism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biragzang Spring" class="if uuid-3170450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3170450.jpg"></div><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Like most mineral springs in North Ossetia, the Biragzang hot spring is located in a valley protected from various atmospheric factors.  Weather conditions favor the combination of wellness treatments with walks in the picturesque highlands.  Winds and rains in these places are rare, and there is no prolonged snowfall here.  All this creates benefits for recreation at any time of the year. </p><p>  Especially good in Biragzang during the cold season.  The temperature of the pool water is +40 degrees.  It should be noted that it is recommended to sit in it under such conditions for no more than 40 minutes.  This place is very popular among women, as water procedures contribute to skin rejuvenation, nourishing it with oxygen.  At a very affordable cost of services (150 rubles per person for entering the pool), the effect of treatment in these sources is the same as with therapy in similar European resorts.  Therefore, today many Russians are sent to Biragzang. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Changing rooms" class="if uuid-3170442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3170442.jpg"></div><p>  Schedule of the Biragzang hot spring: daily from 7:00 to 23:00, except Mondays and Thursdays (sanitary days - a change of water in the pool takes place). </p><h2>  Legend of Origin </h2><p>  During the USSR, the collective farm in the rural settlement of Upper Biragzang was one of the largest in North Ossetia.  But after perestroika, investors (Germans) came here who decided to invest in the development of agriculture in this area.  They decided to heat the greenhouses using water from thermal springs.  The springs were explored, but the Germans lost the desire to revive the collective farm at that time.  Here is a version of the appearance of the source that goes among the locals. </p><p>  By the way, the above option for oil searches is also a legend.  The geologist who worked here in those days claims that they purposefully searched for hot springs. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If you want to get treatment in the hot spring of Biragzang, by phone you can clarify emerging issues. </p><p>  It is important to remember that there are contraindications to treatment in the spring.  First of all, you should refrain from procedures during the period of exacerbation of any disease.  In addition, there are pathologies in which you should not visit the pools with thermal waters at all.  Before the trip, a consultation with the attending physician is mandatory. </p>
