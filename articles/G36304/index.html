    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Vorobyovy Gory (in the years 1924-1991 - Lenin) are located in the southwestern part of the city of Moscow, opposite the Luzhniki sports complex.  Like all Moscow mountains, and these do not correspond to this status, because it is just a hilly part of the bank of the Moscow River (part of the Teplostanskaya Upland), washed by the current.  The Vorobyovy Mountains are one of the seven hills on which the city of Moscow was erected.  They stretch from the mouth of the river.  Setuni to the <span>St. Andrew's Bridge.</span>  The southern border of the hills is in contact with Neskuchny Garden. </p><p>  The Vorobyovy Mountains are located almost in the center of the capital of Russia, about 5.5 kilometers from the Kremlin, and 13 from the MKAD. </p>

    <p>  The observation deck, which stands opposite the skyscraper of Moscow State University (main building), has long been a popular vacation spot for many residents of Moscow and guests of the capital.  Its height is about 80 meters above the river.  Moscow, which allows you to see the breathtaking panorama of the city. </p><p>  Not far from the observation deck on the Sparrow Hills is the Trinity Church of the Life-Giving.  This miraculously survived <span>architectural structure</span> during the years of the struggle against the fascists <span>.</span>  When it was erected, it is unknown.  But Tolstoy L.N. mentions him in his world-famous novel War and Peace. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this area (Lenin mountains) goes back to ancient times.  Its name comes from the ancient village of Vorobyevo.  It is known that Princess Sophia (daughter of the Lithuanian Grand Duke and wife of Prince of Moscow Vasily I) at the end of the 15th century acquired from the Orthodox priest (his nickname Sparrow) a village called Vorobyevo.  According to inaccurate data, it is likely that this village is the oldest settlement that once existed on the territory of modern Moscow.  It turned into the residence (summer) of the Grand Duke, and subsequently the king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Numerous tourists have long been visiting the Lenin <span>Hills.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> from this place is viewed beautifully.  Vorobyovy Gory - a kind of viewing platform for some of the conquerors of the city.  From this place I looked at <span>Moscow Kazy-Girey</span> (Crimean Khan) and Khotkevich (Polish Hetman).  In the XVII-XVIII centuries, at the foot of the Vorobyovy mountains (northern part), there was a monastery called Andreevsky, and the second half of the 19th century was significant in that this corner gained popularity as a summer residence. </p><p>  It is not known exactly when the Vorobyovy Gory was renamed the Lenin Hills.  There are 3 dates: 1924, 1935 and 1936. Many historians claim that this happened in memory of V.I. Lenin, in the year of his death.  Some argue that the renaming is the result of the construction in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãa major physical education center named after  Lenin. </p><p>  In 1999, the old historical name was officially returned to the mountains.  At the same time, the Moscow metro station was renamed. </p><p>  Today, the microdistrict, unlike the metro station and the park, was not renamed the Vorobyovy Gory.  For example, the address of the main building of the main Moscow University is officially written as follows: Moscow, 119991, Lenin Hills, Moscow State University, building 1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow river" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1669278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Lenin Mountains in 1987 were declared a natural monument.  In 1988, the Vorobyovy Gory State Nature Reserve was established on this site.  And today the reserve is engaged in projects whose goal is to protect the heritage (historical and natural) of the city of Moscow.  Within the framework of these projects, various ecological and tourist routes have been developed, along which excursions are conducted, environmental education is conducted among schoolchildren, and research is also being conducted. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Sparrow Hills never underwent construction and the land was not used for agricultural purposes.  This is due to the fact that large relief changes are observed in these places, as well as quite active landslide processes. </p>
