    <h2>  Varieties of tricks </h2><p>  In order to learn how to knit a rhombus with knitting needles, we will understand the features of knitting a knitted fabric. </p><p>  All patterns according to the technique of execution are divided into several groups: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ based on front and back loops; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ openwork; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ with displacement and rewinding of loops; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ combined patterns that use all of the above styles. </p><h2>  Instruments </h2><p>  Knitting needles should match the thickness of the chosen yarn.  A thin thread (450-500 meters in a hundred-gram skein) will look most advantageous if the fabric from it is connected with rather thin knitting needles (No. 1,5-2).  Knitting needles No. 2,5-3 are ideal for medium yarn (250-300 m / 100 g), No. 3,5-4 - for thick yarn (150-230 m / 100 g).  The exception is only knitted with thicker knitting weightless shawls and stoles made of very thin yarn, for example, kid mohair (230 meters in a twenty-five-gram skein).  They are effective, since they imply a strong stretching of the canvas and drying it in this state.  But back to the pattern "rhombuses" with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rhombuses knitting scheme" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/639398.jpg" width="400"></div>  Schemes and a description of the operating procedure can be both simple and complex, but they will require not only the correct selection of tools, but also a very careful attitude to the knitting process.

    <p>  Performed from the front and <span>back loops, the</span> drawings are among the simplest patterns.  They consist of all kinds of combinations of these loops, creating varieties of the pattern ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù with knitting needles.  The schemes of these patterns, as, for example, in the presented photo, are almost primitive, but the knitted fabric made on them looks quite impressive. </p><p>  To connect the pattern you like, you need to learn how to use patterns that graphically represent the knitting process.  This pattern entry is read from bottom to top.  The numbers below the bottom line of the diagram, or the colored selection of a fragment, indicate the loop of the pattern repeat, i.e., the repeating part of the pattern.  The numbers to the right of the schematic record indicate the numbers of the front rows.  If the wrong rows are knitted, repeating the pattern, then they are not indicated in the schemes.  <span>Edge loops</span> never enter either a drawing or its graphic image.  The hinge designations in the diagram of our example are as follows: the horizontal line is the wrong side, and the vertical line is the front one.  A schematic image makes it easy to figure out how to knit a rhombus with knitting needles.  The executed pattern in the technique of knitting facial loops on the wrong side - ‚Äúinclined rhombuses‚Äù, looks simple and excellent in various knitwear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loop calculation for dialing </h2><p>  In order not to make a mistake with the size of the future product, you should make the necessary calculation of the required number of loops for the set.  The number of loops of the initial row depends on the diameter of the knitting needles and the thickness of the thread, so they knit a sample of a loop test from yarn intended for the product to check the conformity of the tools and establish the knitting density horizontally and vertically - the number of loops and rows is 10 cm. </p><p>  To complete the sample, 20-30 loops are typed, or the number corresponding to the rapport + two edging.  They knit 12-14 cm. If several patterns are used in a product, then all patterns should be knitted on one sample.  This will help to determine the correspondence of patterns in relation to one to another.  For example, the same number of loops knitted with a garter stitch will be wider than hosiery, and English gum will be wider than the garter stitch.  Therefore, if the width of the patterns does not match, the number of loops is calculated, which must be added or decreased in order to maintain the desired width of the knitted part. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork rhombuses knitting scheme" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/641969.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The basis of these patterns was the use of lace (holes), obtained by knitting open yarn, which usually make the technique "on my own" and perform the wrong side of the loop, and are indicated on the diagrams by a circle.  The combination of lace and loops on the front or back side with the imagination of an experienced knitter gives a huge number of different patterns.  The most elegant and beautiful in handmade knitted fabrics are openwork patterns for knitting.  Rhombuses in them can take the most bizarre and unusual forms.  The choice of yarn for working with openwork patterns is of the utmost importance: a thin mohair is perfect for knitting light stoles and shawls, medium-thick yarn makes excellent sweaters, cardigans, cardigans and dresses.  The presented sample is a classic version of knitting the pattern "openwork rhombuses" with knitting needles.  Schemes for it are given with the image of the wrong side and contain additional notation: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ m - knitting 3 loops of one; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ / - 2 loops together with one loop to the right; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ \ - execution of 2 loops together with one loop to the left. </p><p>  When knitting the ‚Äúopenwork rhombus‚Äù pattern with knitting needles, it is necessary to control the number of loops in a row, since due to the crocheting, their number increases, and novice knitters sometimes forget to balance the resulting holes by knitting several loops of one in accordance with the pattern of the row.  Therefore, when performing work, it is necessary to strictly follow the scheme of the selected drawing.  In order not to stray in the counting of rows, it is better to use a row counter in the work, on which you need to manually translate the row number after it is knitted. </p><h2>  Re-knitting technique </h2><p>  Knitting interweaving today is more often called "Aran", or "braids".  This is one of the common ways of knitting diamonds.  A canvas of yarn of any texture, made in this way, is effective and embossed.  The <span>thicker the yarn,</span> the larger the pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted rhombuses knitting patterns" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/639461.jpg" width="460"></div>  It should be borne in mind that when performing such patterns, the yarn consumption increases.  The patterns ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù with knitting needles, the schemes and description of which are given in the article, are used not only to fulfill the basic motifs of the canvas.  They are magnificent both in fragments and in decoration.  One product can be made from combinations of several types of arana with other patterns.

    <p>  Transplantation can be performed from a different number of loops and knit in different techniques.  In addition, rhombs can be made with arana both on the front and on the wrong side of the knitted fabric.  Crossing, consisting of two or more loops, is usually knitted only on the front side.  When performing a pattern with an offset of one loop, you can work without using an additional spoke.  If the rhombuses consist of 2 or more loops, an additional knitting needle will be required, on which the loops are reset during the pattern.  An important condition for the use of this tool is that the diameter of the spokes, both primary and secondary, must be the same in order to prevent fluctuations in the density of the fabric. </p><h2>  Knitting pattern "rhombus".  Scheme, description of the pattern with displacement and re-looping </h2><p>  Any pattern, even the most uncomplicated one, requires attention, and knitting rhombuses with arana is a really laborious process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns rhombuses" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/639467.jpg" width="432"></div>  A thorough repetition of the knitting procedure involves the execution of the pattern ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù with knitting needles.  The schemes and description proposed in the article are quite clear, and the main condition for the correct execution of the work is attention and accuracy.  The rapport of a pattern of 41 loops and 27 rows consists of a rhombus (17 loops) and a relief strip (24 loops).  Knotting a rhombus begins with the entrapment of 4 loops in the 3rd row.  Further, in each front row, the walls of the rhombus are displaced by one loop.  In the 11th row in the middle of the rhombus there are 8 seam loops.  Two central loops cross each other, forming a small pigtail in the center of the rhombus.  Such interventions - 3 times, in the 11th, 13th and 15th rows.  From the 15th row, the displacement of the rhombus walls towards the center begins.  The relief strip consists of the displacements of the tracks of 2 front loops along the back field.  The rapport of this figure is 6 rows.  The pattern is "rhombuses" with knitting needles, the patterns of which are easy to read, effective and elegant on the finished product.

    <h2>  Combined patterns </h2><p>  Representing a mixture of various execution techniques, patterns are called combined.  Arana, openwork inserts, front and back surface can participate in them.  A knitted fabric made in this way is refined and elegant.  In particular, the pattern ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù with knitting needles, the diagrams and description of which are also presented here, fully confirms this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern rhombus knitting pattern description" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/639391.jpg" width="395"></div>  The drawing, which imitates leaflets with openwork veins on the first half and front stitch - on the second, is a classic combination of various knitting techniques that are organically intertwined.
