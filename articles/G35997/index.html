Bonuses "Kyivstar" - reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ukraine has several large <span>mobile networks</span> that actually occupy the entire communications market.  This is life, MTS, Kyivstar, as well as 3mob.  Each of the operators, of course, has its own set of tariff plans and various conditions that they offer the subscriber.  The user can only make a choice in favor of a particular plan in order to use communication services for the benefit of himself. </p><h2>  Kyivstar is the leader of the Ukrainian mobile market </h2><p>  In today's article, we will talk about the leader in the field of mobile communications in Ukraine - Kyivstar Company.  This is the second oldest operator who began operations in the territory of an independent country.  And it differs in that it offers subscribers favorable service conditions, as well as high quality service in the form of an uninterrupted signal almost throughout the territory of Ukraine. </p>

    <p>  All tariff plans include certain conditions.  This is a fixed cost of services (for example, calls within the network of 10 kopecks), a certain amount of bonuses, and also minutes for making calls.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to give examples of bonus points in the mobile communications sector.  Bonuses Kyivstar currently provides only home Internet users.  However, this is a completely different direction of the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the minutes, they are still widely used in the company's tariff plans.  Customers are offered to use them, in particular, for calls within their network and communication with other operators.  On how to check the minutes at Kyivstar on a specific tariff plan, as well as on the conditions of each of them, we will describe further. </p><h2>  Tariff ‚ÄúFor calls‚Äù </h2><p>  The simplest, most affordable and practical tariff plan, which contains the minutes allotted for calls, contains a plan called "For calls to all networks."  Its cost is only 50 hryvnia per month. </p><p>  For this money, the subscriber receives 60 minutes for calls to other networks, as well as an unlimited number of minutes for calls to Kyivstar numbers.  This tariff does not provide for extraordinary charging of minutes - it‚Äôs just that the cost of each minute after spending is 60 kopecks. </p><p>  You can check the number of minutes accrued using the combination * 112 #. </p><p>  As a small bonus, the subscriber is provided with 50 megabytes of Internet traffic per month. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúFor smartphone +‚Äù </h2><p>  The next interesting plan is ‚ÄúFor Smartphone +‚Äù.  It, as you can see for yourself on the operator‚Äôs website, costs more - 95 hryvnias per month.  Users are again offered an unlimited number of minutes for calls on the network and 60 minutes for calls to numbers of other operators.  To use Internet services, 1,500 megabytes of traffic per month are offered.  Checking the minutes is no different at this rate.  Kyivstar serves a single combination to obtain such information - * 112 #. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The good news for those who currently use this tariff is the lack of tariffing for traffic when working with social networks - VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Facebook and Twitter. </p>

    <h2>  Tariff ‚ÄúFor smartphone extra‚Äù </h2><p>  An increased number of minutes can be obtained by switching to a different tariff.  ‚ÄúFor Smartphone Extra‚Äù provides the subscriber 200 minutes per month for conversations with other networks, as well as 2500 megabytes of Internet.  If you don‚Äôt know how to check the minutes at Kyivstar, use the same combination of 112. </p><p>  The cost of the tariff is 150 hryvnias per month of use. </p>

    <h2>  All for 500 and All for 800 </h2><p>  The last two tariffs that we will characterize can be combined, since they are connected on a contract basis and offer similar conditions with the exception of the volume of the data package.  So, for both tariffs unlimited free minutes are provided to Kyivstar, as well as 1500 and 2500 minutes for calls to other networks, respectively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The volume of Internet traffic that comes in the package with both services is 5GB and 7GB, respectively.  As you can guess from the name of the packages, their cost is 500 and 800 hryvnia per month of service.  Again, the answer to the question ‚Äúhow to check minutes on Kyivstar for these packages‚Äù is repeated - use * 112 #. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúFree roaming‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  Above, we characterized Kyivstar tariffs for use in national roaming - within Ukraine.  You can also order the service in order to make cheaper calls while abroad.  In this case, the operator provides you bonus minutes for a conversation at a lower cost.  You can find out how to book Kyivstar minutes for calls from abroad on the website in the Free Roaming tariff, which we did. </p><p>  First of all, it is important to mention the company's division of all countries in which subscribers are served into two groups.  The first includes Russia, Italy, Georgia, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.  The cost of a minute of conversation with them will be 1.50 UAH (provided that the user is provided 25 minutes for a daily fee of 37.50).  True, as noted on the Kyivstar website, extraordinary charging of minutes at this tariff is not allowed - after you use them, you will have to pay much more. </p><p>  The second group of countries is a much larger list.  For conversations with them, 15 minutes per day is provided for 60 hryvnias (per day) worth 4 hryvnias. </p><p>  After the subscriber exceeds the limits set by the option (25 and 15 minutes), the cost of calls increases to 2.25 UAH and 3.60 UAH, respectively, for both groups. </p><p>  If you are looking for how to check the minutes on Kyivstar for a conversation in roaming, there is an answer on the site with information about the service: you need to use the combination * 106 * 1 * 2 #. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúFavorite countries‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  Another interesting tariff, also aimed at providing minutes for conversations with subscribers from other countries, is Favorite Countries.  Choose where you want to call, enter a special activation code and get an exclusive tariff for each individual direction.  The cost of connecting with all countries will be equal to 2 hryvnias, and the price for activating the service (from each country) is equal to 5 hryvnias. </p><p>  Billing for each of the states is given on the official website of the company.  It is noteworthy that the number of minutes is unlimited, so it makes no sense to check them, in the context of this option. </p><h2>  Bonuses on the home Internet </h2><p>  It would be useful to mention services that are not related to mobile communications.  We are talking about the home Internet and how bonuses are awarded for working with it.  Kyivstar offers a reward just for the fact that you replenish your account in the system.  Each bonus is equal to the number of hryvnias paid for the service.  The exceptions are periods when you had a debt or the Internet was not active due to the current ‚ÄúPause‚Äù option. </p><p>  You can use bonuses at your discretion.  This can be payment for mobile communication of your account in the system, as well as repayment of debts for working with ‚ÄúHome Internet‚Äù.  The validity period of bonuses is 20 days, it is during this period that you will need to use them.  If we talk about paying for home Internet from the company, then in this case you can connect the Internet package ‚ÄúDay‚Äù or ‚ÄúNight‚Äù at the price of 50 bonuses for 7 days, and also activate the option ‚ÄúDouble speed‚Äù, according to which you will receive 50 bonuses doubled connection speed for 90 days. </p><h2>  Bonus Check </h2>

    <p>  Since the bonuses provided by Kyivstar can be used in two directions - to pay for the Internet and mobile services, there are two accounts, which means there are two ways to check your remaining bonuses. </p><p>  The first is a combination of * 110 #, which shows how many of them you have on your mobile account.  The second - this * 460 # - shows how many bonuses are directly on the account of the stationary Internet. </p><h2>  Control minutes, bonuses and more </h2><p>  We would recommend that you use a special accounting system for all data relating to your subscriber account.  We are talking about the My Kyivstar application, which is available both on the Internet and in the form of a program for any of the mobile platforms presented to this day.  With its help, you can not only see how much and what is left on your account, but also keep track of expenses statistics.  And the main advantage - all this is free and in real time.  As a result, you get exactly the same information about which you had to ask contact center consultants or company representatives in the service center. </p><p>  To start using the application, it is enough to register in it using the phone number and temporary password that will come to it in the form of SMS.  For subscribers who are interested in the home Internet service, instead of a phone number, they should use the number of their contract for the provision of services. </p><p>  The capabilities of the system are such that you can even transfer some <span>types of bonuses to</span> other subscribers!  A lot of those advantages that the platform provides, you definitely need to try! </p>
