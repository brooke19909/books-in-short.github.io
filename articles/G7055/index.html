    <h2>  History of the complex </h2><p>  The well-known company Gazprom started planning the construction of this facility back in 2009.  In the same period, the basic foundation of the future complex was laid.  For a long time, the founders decided where it will be located.  Ultimately, they preferred Krasnaya Polyana, located in the city of Sochi.  The Laura ski and biathlon complex was completed at the end of 2011, and in 2014 large-scale Winter Olympic Games were already held here. </p>
