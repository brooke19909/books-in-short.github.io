  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 Star Egypt Hotels - Gourmet Holidays</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Resorts may vary in level.  The main sign of these differences is the type of hotel to stay.  In Egypt, they are graded according to the European star system.  It is characteristic that, despite the entire "east" of the country, <strong>hotels in Egypt fully meet all the requirements of the international level.</strong> </p><p>  Egyptian 5-star hotels are incredibly beautiful and comfortable hotel complexes, almost small towns, the territory of which fully meets the needs of people who have come to have a good rest. </p><p>  If it weren‚Äôt for the natural need to take on new experiences, then during a vacation you could not go outside the walls of the hotel.  It has everything: large, clean and comfortable rooms with all amenities, restaurants and bars, pools and jacuzzis, spa treatments and massages, entertainment programs for adults and children, discos.  Thousands of additional services will be glad to offer you at any time of the day or night.  This is what is called 5 star Egypt hotels - the highest quality of the service provided. </p><p>  Hotels of this class are located on the first coastline.  This means that the path to the sea lies along the hotel and will take no more than a few minutes.  The beaches at these hotels are guarded, also related to the internal territory.  Naturally, sun loungers, umbrellas and towels here will be free.  This service is already included in the bill. </p><p>  Catering for tourists is organized on a buffet basis in the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant.  Usually, the package includes breakfast and dinner, but in some cases you can stipulate your desire to eat at lunch.  The local cuisine is quite colorful.  Arabic traditional dishes may not be to everyone's taste.  Therefore, on the table there are also European dishes, as well as a lot of fruits, vegetables and fish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Studying the <span>reviews of 5</span> star <span>hotels in Egypt</span> , we conclude that the best of them are in Luxor, Cairo, Alexandria, Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada. </p><p>  Choosing a place to stay is necessary based on the goals set before the trip.  If you want to carry out an excursion tour, then it is better to go to Cairo, Luxor or Alexandria. </p><p>  <strong>In the capital of Egypt,</strong> you will discover many monuments of architecture, art and history.  From here, not far to Giza, where the pyramids and the Sphinx are located. </p><p>  The best 5 star Egypt hotels in Cairo are Concorde El Salam, Fairmont Nile City, Conrad Cairo, Intercontinental City Stars, Grand Hyatt Cairo, JW Mariott Hotel, Semiramis Intercontinental, Le Meridian Heliopolis and some others. </p><p>  <strong>Luxor</strong> is good for connoisseurs of ancient architecture and <span>Nile cruises.</span>  If you decide to go here, then consider the options of these hotels.  They are the best in Luxor: Steigenberger Nile Palace, Maritim Jolie Ville Luxor Island Resort, Stella Grand Hotel, Sonesta St.  George Hotel, Stella Golf Hotel. </p><p>  <strong>Alexandria is</strong> also rich in history.  For many centuries, it has been a significant cultural center of Egypt.  Here you can see masterpieces of architecture - ancient monuments, mosques and monasteries.  The best hotels of this city: Helnan Palestine, Four Seasons, Hilton Green Plaza, Hilton Borg Elarab, Jaz Crystal Resort, Maritim Jolie Ville Hotel Alexandria, Jaz Almaza Beach Resort and others. </p><p>  If the purpose of your train is a beach vacation, then it is better to go to Sharm El Sheikh or Hurghada.  However, it is generally accepted that the level of resorts in <strong>Sharm el-Sheikh</strong> exceeds Hurghada.  Here the living conditions are the most comfortable and the hotels are amazing with luxury and splendor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This resort is one of the best not only in Egypt, but also in the world.  It is located along the coast of the Red Sea.  Hotels here have a developed infrastructure and provide many opportunities for entertainment and relaxation.  The 5 star hotels in Egypt are recognized as the best: Amwaj Oyoun Hotel &amp; Resort, <span>Concorde El Salam Front Area,</span> Baron Palms Resort, Baron Resort, Coral Sea Holiday Village Resort, Sea Oriental Resort, Coral Sea Oriental Resort, Coral Sea Imperial Resort and several others. </p><p>  <strong>Hurghada</strong> also boasts magnificent five-star hotels: Melia Pharaoh Hotel &amp; Resort, Oberoi Sahl Hasheesh, Marriott Beach Resort, Le Meridien Makadi Bay, Intercontinental and many others. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Egypt has a huge number of hotels, they do not stop being built.  Each year, new luxurious designs appear, ready for the arrival of tourists. </p><p>  <strong>New hotels in Egypt</strong> , of course, mainly appear in resorts - this is where a massive influx of foreigners is expected. </p><p>  Over the past year, the following hotels have appeared in the resort areas.  In Sharm El Sheikh, this is Melia Sharm Hotel 5 stars, Iberotel Il Mercato 5 stars, The Cleopatra Luxury Resort Collection 5 stars, <span>Faraana Heights</span> Resort 4 stars, Sharm Bride Resort 4 stars.
