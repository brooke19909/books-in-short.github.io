Thanks to a set of impressive features, he stood out quite well compared to the nearest competitors.  Although a significant role in the phone <span>Philips W8510</span> Xenium played, probably only a sufficiently capacious battery.  This decision saved the company more than once, and potential buyers made their choice in favor of this device.  Using the example of the Philips W8510 Xenium smartphone, we can see that sometimes it‚Äôs enough to just increase the capacity of the battery source so that people pay attention to it and forget about competitive devices.  It is interesting that the companies that produced similar devices relied on the appearance and dimensions.  Therefore, the Philips W8510 Xenium was the leader.  After all, it is much more practical to have a smartphone that will last longer, and not just please with its forms. </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  <span>Philips Xenium W8510</span> (the price in the official store is about 8500 Russian rubles) is equipped with the Android operating system.  More specifically, this is version 4.2, which users call ‚ÄúGeli bin‚Äù.  The screen size is 4.7 inches.  Thanks to a similar solution, Philips Xenium W8510, the price of which ranges from 8 to 9 thousand rubles, was not bulky, but not ultra-compact.  That is the middle ground that many users are looking for. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the image display quality, then it is displayed on the screen in HD mode.  This is 720 by 1280 pixels.  The <span>Philips Xenium W8510 smartphone</span> has an eight megapixel main camera. </p><p>  The processor operates at a clock frequency of 1200 megahertz.  The chipset, by the way, has four cores.  The amount of internal flash memory is only four gigabytes.  RAM - 1024 MB.  In general, as we see, the characteristics are quite averaged, but they are enough to maintain stable performance and use the device in multitasking with virtually no friezes and lags. </p><p>  Of the additional parameters, support for two SIM cards should be noted.  They should not be processed according to micro or nano standards.  The highlight of the Philips Xenium W8510 phone, whose characteristics we are currently describing, is the battery, whose capacity is 3300 milliamps per hour.  According to the manufacturer, this parameter provides eighteen hours of continuous conversations in third-generation cellular networks. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2>

The manufacturer‚Äôs concern for the security of the screen of the manufactured devices simply touches, of course.  Case for Philips Xenium W8510 is not included in the factory package, it will have to be purchased in the store for a fee.

    <p>  Philips Xenium W8510, whose screen has a diagonal of 4.7 inches, has a classic look.  The smartphone is made in a rectangular shape.  Both its upper and lower faces have small bulges, barely perceptible to the eye.  The designers did not dare to mow the sides, but there is still a slight tilt closer to the back panel from the top and bottom.  In general, it is unlikely to find fault with the ergonomics of the device.  Everything was done poorly and without frills, but according to the mind and unwritten rules.  By the way, a similar approach of the company is typical for many devices.  A quality standard exists, and designers and engineers stubbornly continue to follow it.  <span>Philips Xenium W8510, reviews</span> of which you will find at the end of the review, can be described as a smartphone, made in accordance with strict standards, but at the same time with a certain taste. </p><h2>  Screen protection </h2>

    <p>  Philips Xenium W8510, whose battery, as already mentioned, is designed for 3300 milliamps per hour, is additionally protected by a glass layer.  Rather, the protection was designed exclusively for the display of this unit, and not for its entire surface.  Interestingly, the manufacturer did not comment on this.  What glass is, is known.  But what it is - ordinary or created according to the <span>Gorilla Glass</span> standard <span>,</span> is still unknown.  Nevertheless, tests showed that even with active use, scratches rarely and very slowly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the first unpacking, you can immediately notice the sensor grid.  However, its detection is possible only when the light falls at a certain angle.  Nevertheless, we are unable to fix this, which means we‚Äôll just have to put up with such a tiny flaw. </p><h2>  Perimeter </h2>

    <p>  An insert made of metal materials passes through it.  An interesting solution was applied by the developers of the device: this frame immediately captures the counter of the spoken speaker at the top of the smartphone.  We can see a similar approach in the design, for example, of such a phone as the iPhone 5. The insert on the front side rises in some way above the case.  Why is this done?  A similar move is used by many designers in order to protect the device‚Äôs screen from physical influences from the outside.  Imagine that you put the machine face down on a horizontal surface.  If there is no elevation in the frame, then the smartphone will lie on it directly with the screen.  Accordingly, the occurrence of scuffs and even scratches.  On the side you can see that the frame is polished.  This solution makes the appearance of the device stylish, while emphasizing the elegance of the case as a whole. </p><h2>  Back part </h2>

    <p>  The back side can be conditionally divided into two parts at once.  The first of them is removable, while the second (bottom) is not.  The manufacturer made the lid from a rather durable (which should be mentioned) plastic of a semi-gloss type.  If we talk about color, then this is a dark blue hue.  Fingerprints are clearly visible on the lid.  Nevertheless, if you regularly process your phone and monitor it, then nothing bad will happen, since prints are erased from a half-gloss surface as easy as shelling pears.  Again, the same tests showed that the cap has a load margin.  It lends itself to mechanical stress with difficulty, and leaving scratches on it will not be very easy.  Together, these two parameters can be called a significant advantage, which is sent to the ‚ÄúXenium‚Äù piggy bank. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  Here everything is already somewhat worse.  If desired, you can identify a real set of minor flaws.  Nevertheless, this is no longer our task, but the work of experts, and we will just tell you what you can, if not fear, then at least expect.  It is possible that you will be lucky and you will get a high-quality sample, since the engineers and designers still took certain steps after the release of the first batch.  Nevertheless, we will not hope for luck.  If you shake your smartphone, then most likely you will feel a slight backlash.  Probably, it‚Äôs the device‚Äôs battery that walks inside the device.  The smartphone does not cover it tightly enough.  This means that after a considerable time of use, you will have to contact the service center to replace the battery.  Or purchase another device.  I was glad that no crunch was heard during compression. </p><h2>  Dimensions and dimensions </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, in the design of this unit, experts relied on a compromise.  And this decision was made and embodied as never before successfully.  The device reaches a height of 138, a width of 69, and a thickness of 10.4 millimeters.  Such indicators make it possible to feel all the advantages of using a smartphone.  In his hand he lies surprisingly neat and comfortable.  If you try to translate this into disadvantages, then it can be noted that the increase in battery volume had an effect on the thickness and weight of the devices. </p><h2>  The location of the elements.  Front panel </h2><p>  From the front, you can find the speech speaker, which is located at the very top.  For additional protection, the designers and designers decided to cover it with a mesh made of metal materials and disguised with a dark shade of paint.  Well, since we are talking about dynamics, we note a good supply of volume.  Almost all medium and low frequencies are perfectly audible, and it will not be difficult to make out the interlocutor‚Äôs speech even with noisy surroundings immediately from both ends of the wire.  Of the shortcomings - sharp edges.  Sometimes it is not particularly pleasant to hold the device directly close to the ear, and even a little painful.  If you talk a lot on the phone, we recommend that you pay some attention to this point.  Such a flaw can deliver a mountain of inconvenience. </p><p>  To the right of the earpiece you can find a light level sensor.  On the opposite side is the proximity sensor.  There is also a peephole of the front camera.  We drop below the frame of the screen.  Here are the touch controls specific to devices running on the Android operating system family.  There is a white backlight, which can not but rejoice. </p><h2>  Left and right sides </h2><p>  On the left side, the user can find a switch that has been added specifically to choose between normal and energy-saving modes.  On the opposite side there are buttons designed to change the overall volume level.  They are made of metal materials.  To distinguish between these elements is quite simple, you can also feel without much difficulty.  They are compressed at a standard load level, so there should not be any problems with handling. </p><h2>  Upper and lower ends </h2><p>  On the last is a conversational microphone.  Of the elements, that‚Äôs all.  But at the top end we have a whole set of tools, if they can be called that.  We are talking about the input standard MicroUSB, audio output at 3.5 millimeters, as well as the power control button.  By the way, on the back of the phone you can see a camera whose module is literally recessed into the plane of the cover.  There is also an LED flash with a high-volume sound speaker. </p><h2>  Under the hood </h2><p>  If we remove the back panel, we can detect the slots.  They are designed to integrate an external drive standard MicroSD, as well as embed two SIM cards. </p><h2>  Reviews  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  What can users who have purchased this smartphone model say?  As a plus, they usually distinguish a fairly high-quality matrix of the screen, for example.  This also usually refers to its resolution.  A good performance during the tests was also demonstrated by the processor, which copes well with multitasking.  Reviews are noted by good, one can even say high-quality materials, of which the device case is made.  Of course, the highlight of the device was a capacious battery, which makes it possible to spend more time on the Internet, for example.  The speaker has a good volume margin, and the interlocutor's speech is legible.  Well, one can not help but mention the presence of two slots for SIM cards. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, the reviews highlight the grid on the display.  In later models, this minus may be absent due to the timely intervention of engineers.  This also includes play inside the device.  This is a problem with the same battery, which could not be firmly fixed.  Well, the dimensions complete the composition.  Rather, it is a relative disadvantage, because not everyone can think it is an obvious minus.  In general, the device turned out to be quite neat, made with taste.  The "filling" cannot boast of anything special, but nonetheless, it provides above-average performance. </p>
