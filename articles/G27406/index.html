    <p>  Sometimes it happens that you really need a voice recorder.  Despite the fact that a lot of technical solutions are offered on the market today, his choice is becoming very difficult.  If you are interested in how to choose a voice recorder, then the material will be laid out just for you.  First you need to determine the type.  They can be digital and microcassette. </p><p>  With the latter, everything is quite simple: usually the level of the resulting recording depends on how high-quality the cassette and the apparatus itself are.  As a plus, one can name the low price of the tapes and the fact that with their large volume you can not worry about the recording time.  Additional features include auto-stop, auto-reverse, voice activated recording, recording indicator and tape counter.  But the fact is that such voice recorders are gradually becoming obsolete, so it‚Äôs worth considering digital ones. </p><p>  How to choose a recorder: some subtleties </p><p>  Let's look at this issue in more detail.  The digital voice recorder records information in internal or removable memory.  Since it is not a very cheap <span>type of memory,</span> you have to constantly monitor its condition, that is, to clear it, to drop records on a computer or to stock up large amounts of free space.  You should not buy devices that do not support memory cards, as this will limit your possibilities. </p><p>  Digital voice recorders can have many more advanced features.  In addition to the standard ones for microcassette, there may be means for processing sound, an alarm clock, a diary, and others.  These recorders are able to connect to a computer.  The best option is to connect the device via a USB interface, and if it is connected directly to the <span>sound card</span> through the headphone jack, the recording quality can significantly deteriorate.  When buying, it is worth paying attention to which interface the recorder supports, it is better if it is USB 2.0, since it gives the highest recording speed.  If we talk further about how to choose a voice recorder, then you should pay attention to the size of the connector, as it is better to coincide with some other device so that you do not have one port constantly busy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The recording quality obtained through a digital voice recorder usually depends not only on how good the device itself is, but also on the input path, microphone, <span>signal sampling rate,</span> its encoding technique and other factors.  Understanding how to choose a voice recorder, you need to know about some features.  The human ear can perceive the sound range of 20 Hz-20 kHz, and the main format of speech is directed in the range of 0.3-3.4 kHz.  This suggests that if you want to record only voice, you need to select a voice recorder with a band of up to four kilohertz, and if you want to record all the other sounds, you need a device with a band of up to 20 kilohertz.  However, it is worth remembering that the speed of memory consumption of the device depends on the bandwidth. </p><p>  Now we can say about the design, which can be very diverse.  They can be made in a classic form, or they can resemble different objects, for example, a fountain pen, if you need to record secretly.  They can be equipped with a power supply for operation from the city electric network, a module for connecting to a telephone line to record conversations.  And if we talk about the design of the device, then you should be guided only by your taste.  It can be considered as an option mini-voice recorders digital, they are convenient because they are easily hidden and invisible to others. </p><p>  At the moment, the most popular brands of voice recorders are the following: Olympus, Sony and Ritmix. </p><p>  Now you can imagine in general terms how to choose a voice recorder, you just have to go shopping. </p>
