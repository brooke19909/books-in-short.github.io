It is perfect for those who want to get acquainted with this OS personally, although they are not without drawbacks caused by a rather low cost - about 7 thousand rubles.  The model was released in 2013. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Nokia Lumiya 620 received a bright and concise design, typical of many Lumiyas.  The back covers come in 6 colors: white, yellow, hot pink, green, blue and black.  All of them are not only very bright and saturated, but also easily removable.  So you can buy covers of different colors and change them to suit your mood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 620" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But at the same time, ‚ÄúNokia 620‚Äù looks not only bright, but also a little bulky, which reduces the cost of appearance.  With dimensions of 11.5 <span>x 6.1</span> x 1.1 cm and a weight of 113 g, the smartphone seems small and chubby. </p><p>  The screen is quite small, 3.8-inch, with a resolution of 480 x 800. Of course, this is not the largest and brightest display, but this is enough for a budget model. </p><p>  A speaker is located above the screen, to the left of it is the front camera, to the right is the manufacturer's logo.  At the top there is a headphone jack and a microphone, at the bottom there is a microphone and a MicroUSB connector, which is responsible for connecting the smartphone to the computer and charging the battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The back side, in addition to a bright <span>acid color,</span> boasts a camera with flash, Nokia logo and speaker. </p><p>  The left end remained completely smooth, but on the right all the necessary physical buttons are located: volume, enable / unlock and cameras.  The first 2 are very convenient to press with one hand, and the last, on the contrary, does not hurt.  But then, when switching to shooting mode and horizontal orientation of the smartphone, the camera button appears just below the index finger. </p><p>  The connector for the MicroSIM card is located under the battery, and to change the microSD card, you do not have to turn off the power: the connector is located just under the back cover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Lumia 620" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Stuffing" smartphone "Nokia 620" </h2><p>  The characteristics of the model correspond to its price category and even slightly surpass it.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 dual-core processor runs at 1 GHz, and the smartphone has 512 GB of RAM.  This is enough for stable and fast operation of Windows 8. </p><p>  The internal memory of the smartphone is 8 GB.  But we should not forget that about half of it is occupied by system files.  So the use of microSD cards up to 64 GB is a necessary step for comfortable work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the model supports Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, as well as 3G. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 620 phone" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interface and individual settings </h2><p>  Nokia 620 is literally created for Windows 8, so the operation of the operating system will pleasantly surprise you. </p><p>  When you turn on or after unlocking the smartphone, the user is greeted with a screen with time, date, battery level and signal.  All this is against the background of wallpapers that can be changed independently.  After scrolling up, the start screen appears.  Applications on it are presented in the form of tiles, the size of which can be changed (3 options).  You can arrange them in a convenient order, while they are optimally stacked in the overall picture, regardless of the size of each individual icon.  Some applications have live icons, for example, the photo gallery icon constantly shows different frames from there. </p>

    <p>  The color of the tiles mainly depends on the theme used and massively changes when it changes.  But the settings of the background itself for the tiles are small: you can only choose a brighter or darker option, you can‚Äôt install the picture in its place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Interestingly, all applications are arranged in a list that goes down, and not to the side, as is customary with iOS or Android.  Good or bad is a matter of taste, but definitely non-standard. </p><p>  In addition to the standard settings, such as themes, connections, signals, and others, there is an interesting option "Children's Corner".  It allows you to restrict access to the contents of the smartphone, i.e., a new user will be able to open only those applications, media files and games that have been included in the exclusion list.  In addition, the mode does not allow you to pay for purchases in games and in the Windows store. </p><p>  Applications are quickly and easily installed, directly from a smartphone or in the form of downloaded files received when connected to a computer.  Therefore, setting up the Nokia 620 takes a minimum of time. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  In this regard, the Nokia 620 phone is not much different from its competitors.  Two cameras - the main 5 megapixels and the front 0.3 megapixels - will allow you to take clear and beautiful shots on the go and communicate in video chats. </p><p>  The shooting application has a considerable number of settings for photography: exposure, white balance, ISO, autofocus.  There is a flash, as well as several shooting scenarios, such as ‚ÄúNight‚Äù or ‚ÄúMacro‚Äù.  There is an option to scan QR codes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumiya 620 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The quality of the photographs is satisfactory, of course, it is inferior to a digital camera, but for a budget smartphone it is quite worthy. </p><p>  There are much fewer video settings: <span>white balance,</span> quality level (maximum - 720 pixels for the main and 480 pixels for the front camera), focus on / off.  No shooting modes. </p><h2>  Battery "Nokia 620" </h2><p>  The hero of our review has very good characteristics, despite a modest price, but still a place for a fly in the ointment was found.  It was the smartphone battery.  1300 mAh - this is its nominal capacity, which in itself does not sound impressive.  The manufacturer promises 14 hours 40 minutes of talk time, 331 hours of standby time or 61 hours of listening to music. </p><p>  In general, if you make several calls a day and listen to music a little, then the battery charge will be enough for a day, or even more.  But if you actively use the Internet, games, watch movies or do any other tasks associated with the constant operation of the screen, then in the middle of the day the smartphone may run out. </p><p>  But you can significantly delay this moment by lowering the screen brightness or turning on the energy-saving mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 620 setup" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  What do users themselves say about the Nokia Lumiya 620?  Reviews about the smartphone are most often positive. </p><p>  First of all, the build quality is worthy of praise: a strong case and good glass made it possible to survive more than one fall of the device by its owners (but we do not recommend purposefully checking their durability). </p>

    <p>  The operating system, although it differs from the more popular Android and iOS, is not at all for the worse.  Its design is clear, convenient, aesthetic and easily customizable. </p><p>  The work of the software is perfectly coordinated with the technical capabilities of the smartphone, which ensures stable operation without freezes.  In the rare case when they occur, the smartphone is easy to ‚Äúbring to life‚Äù by pressing the unlock button.  When you turn on the system reboots, leaving open applications that were launched earlier. </p><p>  The simultaneous execution of several tasks is also not a problem for the Nokia 620.  For example, the Internet, maps, listening to music and WhatsApp do not slow it down at all. </p><p>  The quality of the pictures is more than satisfied with the buyers, the same goes for the video. </p><p>  Convenient free maps that can be downloaded in parts to use, even if the smartphone is offline, liked and useful to many buyers. </p><p>  Many reviews agree that this purchase exceeds expectations. </p><h2>  The main disadvantage </h2><p>  The most controversial issue - the battery life - also surprisingly does not cause indignation of buyers. </p><p>  The smartphone is so precisely designed that even such a small battery is enough for full work during the day.  Of course, constantly playing videos or using 3G quickly drain the battery, but not every day you watch movies on the go for hours, and 3G so far has a similar effect on all models. </p><p>  The disadvantages of smartphones running on Windows 8 are often a limited number of applications.  But today, this item is confusing to users less and less.  Firstly, their number is growing rapidly.  Secondly, they are better and more debugged than many analogs on Android.  And thirdly, they completely close the main tasks, and it‚Äôs up to you to decide whether the applications of each store or website where you once were, which malfunction or cause the smartphone to freeze, are so necessary.  The Microsoft team is primarily concerned with the quality, not the quantity, of its software. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 620 battery" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1024272.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Nokia 620 is to some extent the opening of the smartphone market.  But not in terms of brilliant features or huge displays.  This is a model that has clearly demonstrated that a budget smartphone does not have to be boring, ill-conceived design, with freezes, poor quality materials and even worse camera.  On the contrary, it has become a model of accessibility and quality.  The only significant gripe is the battery, but whether it will cause inconvenience to the user depends solely on the goals that he sets when using a smartphone.  If you are determined to watch and play videos often and for a long time, then you are better off with another model, with a large screen, battery and fast processor.  If you need a beautiful and productive "workhorse" - "Nokia 620" is perfect for its role. <strong></strong></p>
