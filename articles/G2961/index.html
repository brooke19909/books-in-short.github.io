    <p>  Having left at the Arsenalnaya metro station, we immediately turn left.  After about 10 minutes of walking in front of us with its golden domes, the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, located on the hilly high banks of the Dnieper, will sparkle.  This historic place, they say, was once pointed out by Andrew the First-Called himself, who declared that the glory of God would shine on these hills.  The monastery dates back to 1051.  It was then that the Monk Anthony, the founder of Russian monasticism, dug here, in distant caves, the first dugout.  The influx of people who want to devote their lives to serving God increased over time so much that in the caves they all no longer had enough space. </p><p>  Since its inception, the monastery has attracted influential and noble people who have been looking for solutions to vital and moral issues in it.  Thanks to their contributions and donations, it expanded and developed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The educated advanced part of the religious community, in addition, turned this monastery into a cultural center.  Over time, he became a kind of academy preparing Orthodox pastors.  For example, from among its monks by the beginning of the 13th century more than 50 bishops were appointed.  They traveled to different parts of the country to fulfill their pastoral mission. </p><p>  The most tragic events in its history occurred in 1917, after the October Revolution.  Lavra, like other churches in Kiev, was ruined.  Her property, according to a decree of the Soviet government, was nationalized.  In 1930, ceased to exist as a monastery Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (Kiev).  Today it is divided into 2 parts - a museum and a working monastery.  On its territory, in addition, are the buildings of the Seminary and the Kiev Theological Academy. </p><h2>  Sophia Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  The capital of Ukraine is famous for its churches, temples and cathedrals.  The most popular churches in Kiev: St. Sophia Cathedral, St. Andrew's Church, St. Vladimir Cathedral, the Tithes and Cyril Churches, St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral, St. Nicholas Church, Holy Trinity Cathedral and others.  Let's tell a little more about <span>St. Sophia Cathedral.</span>  Today it has actually become a museum.  Only in strictly allotted days can one pray to God here.  Other Kiev cathedrals are open to the public. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 11th century, the order for its construction was given by Yaroslav the Wise.  According to one version, its construction was associated with the arrival of Metropolitan Theopempt to the city.  The cathedral was originally a 13-domed structure.  After several centuries, 6 more chapters were added to it.  The building was reconstructed by the 17th century, performing in the style of Ukrainian Baroque. </p><p>  The cathedral was repeatedly attacked by invaders more than 10 centuries ago.  In the 13th century, he survived the invasion of Batu, whose hordes destroyed almost the entire building and removed all the precious utensils from here.  Two centuries later, the <span>Crimean Tatars</span> also robbed the temple <span>,</span> who killed Makarios, the Kiev metropolitan.  With the onset of the Soviet regime, the cathedral was decided to close.  It has become a museum reserve.  After Ukraine left the USSR, services were resumed there.  However, the building was soon included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and services were banned in the temple in accordance with this. </p><h2>  National Museum of the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  What to see in Kiev, except for religious monuments?  There are many options.  Another attraction of the city, the National Museum of the Second World War, is located near the laurels.  Back in 1943, the countdown of its history begins.  Then it was decided to create this museum.  However, the pressing need to restore the national economy postponed the solution of this issue for almost 30 years. </p><p>  In 1974, on October 7, as part of the events dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the liberation of the country from the Nazis, the museum was opened in the building that used to be the Klovsky Palace.  In May 9, 1981, the <span>Memorial complex</span> was also opened <span>.</span>  According to the historical value of the exhibits and size, it is one of the largest in Ukraine.  Today this museum is a leading methodological and scientific-educational center dedicated to the military history of this country.  During the existence of the memorial, more than 24 million visitors from about 200 countries of the world got acquainted with its exhibits. </p>

    <h2>  Statue "Mother Motherland" </h2><p>  The museum is located at the base of the statue called "Motherland" with a height of more than 60 meters.  There are exhibition halls around the circumference of the foot.  Their total length is about 5 km.  The statue of the observation deck located at the top of the shield, located at an altitude of about 30 m, offers a beautiful view of the expanses of Kiev.  If you are not afraid of heights, we recommend that you also admire the city views that open from the lower platform, which is located at the base of the statue, at the height of a 9-storey building. </p><h2>  Mariinsky Park </h2>

    <p>  Leaving the Great Patriotic War Museum, we will return back to the side of Art.  Arsenal.  Passing it and walking along the street Grushevsky a little forward, you will get to the entrance to the Mariinsky Park.  This is an amazingly beautiful example of park architecture of the period 18-19 centuries.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Mariinsky Park is approximately 9 hectares.  It is considered one of the oldest in Ukrainian territory.  The laying of the park took place in 1874.  O. G. Nedzelsky, an experienced gardener, created his project. </p><p>  The atmosphere in the park, seated with old chestnuts, maples and linden trees, is very cozy and quiet, conducive to philosophical reflection and a quiet pastime.  Once upon a time, a children's railway functioned on its territory, funny screams and children's laughter were heard.  Here you can see a monument to the participants of the January uprising, the heroes of the October Revolution, <span>General Vatutin</span> and many others. </p><h2>  Mariinsky Palace </h2>

    <p>  The Mariinsky Palace is one of the main attractions of this park.  It was erected in the 18th century according to the project of V. Rastrelli, a famous architect from Italy.  Completed a baroque palace.  He served as the temporary residence of Elizabeth, Empress.  The second floor of this palace, made of wood, burned down in 1819 during a fire.  And only at the end of the 19th century the palace was rebuilt according to the project developed by Mayevsky.  This was done at the arrival of Alexander II and his wife, Empress Maria.  The palace was named Mariinsky in her honor. </p><p>  Today it serves as the official residence of the Ukrainian president.  He uses it for meetings with foreign delegations and statesmen of the world.  The Supreme Council of Ukraine is located next to this palace.  The area in front of the building is called <span>Constitution Square.</span> </p><h2>  Summer scene and stadium them.  V.V. Lobanovsky </h2><p>  Today, the Mariinsky Park has a small observation deck.  It offers an amazing view of the left bank of Kiev from the height of the Pechersk hills.  From here you can also see the Dnieper, the Kiev river with many green islands.  Having walked deep into the park alley, you will come to the summer stage, where various charity concerts and performances are arranged periodically.  The stadium named after V.V. Lobanovsky, the greatest coach, is located a little lower.  Now it belongs to the famous football team of Ukraine - Kiev Dynamo. </p><h2>  Other attractions in the Mariinsky Park </h2><p>  A little lower is the most romantic place in the city - the bridge of lovers.  It connects two parks: Khreshchaty and Mariinsky.  There are many beliefs and legends associated with this bridge.  Young people who have been here consider it necessary to leave small locks, napkins and scarves tied with a ribbon knot on the bridge as a sign of eternal love.  In the Mariinsky Park, in addition, you can find the <span>Peoples' Friendship Arch, the</span> Puppet Theater and the Water Museum.  The prices for visiting the latter: 30 hryvnias for adults, 20 for children (when converted to Russian rubles, the cost may vary depending on the exchange rate, but on average the amount is expressed in 71-73 and 47-50 rubles, respectively).  Going down even further from here, you will exit onto European Square and Khreschatyk Street. </p><h2>  Khreshchatyk </h2><p>  This, of course, is the most beautiful street of the city, its modern face.  Here's what you need to see in Kiev!  Here, for more than 200 years, the whirlpool of business, cultural and political life of Kiev has been seething.  The first high-rise building in the city appeared here, first gas and then electric lighting began to be implemented, as well as the sewage system and water supply, later carried out to other streets of Kiev.  For the first time, the first Kiev tram rang on Khreshchatyk, its residents were the first to experience the benefits of telegraph and telephone communications. </p>

    <p>  On this street, one of the shortest among other central streets of European capitals (the length of Khreshchatyk is only 1200 meters), Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Taras Shevchenko, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Joseph Mandelstam, Fedor Chaliapin and others walked.  Looking at it, buried in the green of chestnuts, it is hard to believe that even 300 years ago there was a Khreshchatynsky stream - the place where Prince Vladimir the Great christened his boyars and squad. </p><p>  This district, the center of Kiev, underwent a grandiose reconstruction already in the 19th century, and from an abandoned place turned into the cultural center of the city and its main highway.  It can be said that Khreschatyk has since become the historical site of the capital of Ukraine, its hallmark, like New York Broadway or Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg.  It was here that once housed the most sophisticated and expensive shops, luxury hotels, banks.  And on the Independence Square was the building of the City Council. </p><p>  The events of 1941 tragically changed the face of Khreshchatyk.  Almost all of its buildings were in ruins.  But by the efforts of Kiev, the street was rebuilt again.  The center of Kiev offers tourists and other attractions.  One of the most popular is Independence Maidan. </p><h2>  Independence Square </h2>
