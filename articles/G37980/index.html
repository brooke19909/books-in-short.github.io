And this is no accident.  Reserves of the Voronezh region are places where nature has been preserved almost in a virgin state.  These picturesque corners are carefully protected not only by the Russian government, but also by some international organizations.  One of these sites is Divnogorye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marvelous reserve" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/457692.jpg" width="550"></div>  This reserve is characterized by a unique natural landscape.  It is located at the confluence <span>of the Don</span> and Silent Pine.  This museum reserve annually attracts lovers of nature, clean, fresh air.  In this unique place, various architectural monuments are collected.  So, here is the Holy Assumption Monastery complex, which in different years housed either a sanatorium or a rest house, although this was originally a monastery.  The second popular place is the Voronezh State Nature Reserve.  How rich is this land untouched by man and what inhabitants inhabit it, we learn further from the article.

    <h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  Voronezh Biosphere Reserve is located 40 km from the city center.  It was created with the aim of preserving the number of river beavers.  Thanks to timely care, this species of animals not only did not disappear, but also significantly increased its population.  By the way, this <span>natural complex</span> is the only beaver nursery in the world.  At the end of the 20th century, the reserve received the status of UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  And at the beginning of the next century, the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation instructed him to protect two nature reserves.  They became <span>"Stone steppe"</span> and "Voronezh". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Territorial borders </h2><p>  The Voronezh Biosphere Reserve from three sides outlines the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ancient Usman pine forest.  The natural complex is located on a flat terrain, on the left bank of the river.  From the west, the border of the reserve for 5 km runs parallel to the channel of the water stream.  On the south side, it runs along the railway line.  By the way, just a few kilometers from the Grafskaya station, which is located on this stretch of the track, the Central Estate of the reserve is located.  It contains a tour and administration complex, an experimental beaver nursery and research laboratories.  In addition, here you can visit the famous Museum of Nature. </p><h2>  Ponds </h2><p>  The Voronezh and Usmanka rivers pass through the territory of this natural complex.  The first, rather deep, water flow is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Ramon.  The second river is a tributary of Voronezh and consists of a number of low-flow lakes - reaches.  These objects are interconnected by narrow streams with swampy backwaters and shores.  The path of Usmanka mainly runs through forests.  In dry years, river channels are very shallow. </p>

    <h2>  Natural wealth </h2><p>  Almost the entire territory on which the Voronezh reserve is located is covered by the Usman forest, whose forests are of an island character.  In addition, representatives of the steppe flora and plants of mainly northern forests are found here.  The name "boron" is not entirely applicable to this natural massif.  Although there is mainly pine, here, mixed terrain, heterogeneity of soils, and different depths of groundwater have led to a significant diversity in vegetation.  The man had a great influence.  As a result, today the pine forest occupies no more than one third of the reserve's area.  What is characteristic, in the western part of the natural complex, pines have sizes unusual for this breed.  That is, trees do not have a "ship" scope, and their trunks are very curved.  Such natural manifestations are associated with poor moisture supply in these places and, accordingly, poor nutrition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the territory where the Voronezh Biosphere Reserve is located, depending on the moisture content of the soil, rowan, broom and cherry steppe can grow next to the oak.  Grass cover consists mainly of boron plants.  This is sedge heather and palmate, hairy hawk, veronica gray and so on.  Almost the entire soil of the natural complex is covered with lichen and moss.  Broad-leaved forests occupy 29% of the territory of the natural complex.  They are mainly located on the slopes of the Voronezh-Usmanka watershed.  Also, these natural massifs can be found in the eastern part, along the border with the steppe.  In this forest area, dubbed oak forests are common, bird cherry and sedge-chrysanthemum.  In the first tier of the deciduous massif, mainly centenarians predominate (oaks up to 160 years old).  Among them, ash is also found.  In the second, besides these breeds, elm and linden grow.  And in the undergrowth, mainly euonymus, hazel and bird cherry are found.  The soil of broad-leaved forests of the reserve is covered by sedge, hairy, rot, lunatic and other types of herbs.  In addition to pine and oak forests, birch forests and aspen forests are common in the natural complex of Voronezh.  Almost 2.5% of the territory is also represented by marshland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reserves of the Voronezh region" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/458025.jpg" width="600"></div>

Near the streams and tributaries of the Ivnica River in shady places you can find a very spectacular plant - an ordinary ostrich fern.  Also in the territory occupied by the reserve Voronezh, ordinary false spaghetti grows.  According to many botanists, this plant is a relic of postglacial time.  This miracle of nature can be found only in one place of the reserve - near Lake Chistoye. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  The fauna of the reserve is mostly forest species.  Of the number of ungulates, wild boars predominantly inhabit deciduous forests.  Roe deer numbers are also quite high.  Their habitat are places densely overgrown with trees or shrubs.  There are few moose, representatives of the taiga zone, and red deer.  The highest point of growth in their number occurred in 1970.  Then their number reached 1200 individuals.  But the wolves that appeared in the forest almost destroyed the deer population.  Currently, there are only a few dozen.  <span>Raccoon dog</span> and fox are common in the land. </p>

He developed vigorous activity there, building dams and digging deep holes.  On the heights of deciduous forests are badger "towns".  In solid burrows, connected by a system of complex moves, these animals live for more than a dozen years.  Common for the reserve are ermine, weasel and marten.  An <span>American mink</span> tracks its prey near water bodies <span>.</span>  From here she ousted her European "relative" in the thirties of the 20th century.  Mouse-like rodents inhabited the island forest-steppe forests.  The habitat of the secretive forest dormouse is oak groves.  There are more than protein.  In the steppe steppes, jerboas and <span>speckled ground squirrels</span> live <span>,</span> but their numbers have fallen significantly over the years.  Hollows of old trees serve as houses for various species (there are 12 of them) bats.  Brown ear-flaps, bat-birds (forest and dwarf) are popular.  Some of these types of mammals differ in frequency and limited distribution.

    <h2>  Birds </h2><p>  137 species of birds inhabit the Voronezh reserve.  Owners of oak forests and mixed forests are passerines, which make up almost half of the total number of all types of birds.  On damp meadows overgrown with shrubs, in the floodplains of the rivers, bluethroats with a multi-colored ‚Äúapron‚Äù and yellow-headed wagtails settle.  Shore cliffs near the water chooses an <span>ordinary kingfisher</span> as a dwelling <span>.</span>  This small but dexterous diver for fish can be distinguished from other birds by a red breast and a blue-green back.  Shrike-Zhulan prefers glades with shrubs.  Here you can meet the greenfin with a greenish plumage and hawk warbler.  This original name the bird received for its resemblance to a hawk.  With yellow eyes and light breasts with dark streaks, she is very similar to this predator.  <span>Gray cranes</span> choose black alder thickets in the lower reaches of their shelter.  The number of pairs living there varies from 6 to 15. The Ivnitsa River has sheltered a large colony of these birds (150 pairs).  In the marshy areas a large bittern settles, while a small bittern prefers only steppe bodies of water.  <span>The white stork</span> - one of the graceful and beautiful birds - has also recently been nesting here.  Small grebe, a very rare species of birds, can be seen on a forest pond, and on the steppe - a large or black-necked.  A variety of waders have chosen riverbanks and streams as their place of residence. </p>

    <h2>  Predator birds </h2><p>  Their fauna is estimated in fifteen species.  Along with the usual representatives of the middle band, rare individuals live here.  We are talking about a snake-eater, a dwarf eagle, a beetle, a large spotted eagle, a burial ground, a golden eagle, a white-tailed eagle.  Common birds such as the owl, eared and marsh owl are widespread.  The latter creates semi-colonial type settlements in the meadows.  In autumn and spring, the Voronezh Reserve, a photo of which can be seen in the article, and 39 bird species migrate from it.  Some stay there in packs of several hundred individuals.  In spring, it is rooks, and in autumn days - geese (white-faced and roasters). </p><h2>  Reptiles </h2><p>  Marsh turtles live in deep water bodies.  There are not many of them, because there are few places suitable for laying eggs.  Previously, it was thought that fish is the main food of this reptile species.  Therefore, the turtle was considered harmful to water management.  But in fact, it feeds on worms, insects and their larvae, tadpoles, newts, small fish, caterpillars, various species of locusts.  In the ecological system, the turtle takes the place of a kind of orderly and a selector that removes sick or dead insects. </p><h2>  Amphibians </h2><p>  Often you can find an ordinary newt.  There are five species of frogs.  The most common of them is an <span>ordinary garlic maker.</span>  It is named so by chance.  Living near ponds, this light gray with brown spots toad emits a smell similar to that of garlic through the glands.  With the help of the hind legs, she deftly digs into the soil in an almost vertical position.  Feeling danger, she can meet her face to face.  Pouting, making warning sounds, the toad will hit the enemy with his head. </p><h2>  Fish </h2><p>  The diversity of their species can be proud of the Voronezh River.  It is rich in both large representatives of the animal world of water bodies (pike, burbot, catfish), as well as medium and small ones.  One of them is a tsutsik goby.  Such a ridiculous name, he owes his appearance.  Elongated nostrils in tubes, similar to spaniel ears, hang over the upper lip.  Appearance and a peculiar manner of moving under water, as if sniffing everything, are the main reasons why the fish got a funny name. </p>
