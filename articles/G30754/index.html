It attracts people not only the warm sea, but also the unique architecture of the city.  Dubai is hardly a place for a budget holiday.  If desired, tourists can find an inexpensive hotel in an area remote from the sea, however, most resort complexes have a five-star category, so accommodation is expensive.  But the service here is fully consistent with the prices. </p><p>  For example, the Waldorf Astoria Dubai <span>Palm Jumeirah</span> 5 * hotel is considered respectable.  Where is she located?  What level of service does it offer?  Did you like the local service for tourists?
