The ambassadors of the Crimean Khan Mengli-Girey came here, and Polish troops stopped when approaching the city.  Napoleon was waiting here in 1812 when they brought him the keys to Moscow.  Nearby is the Kutuzov hut, in which a meeting of generals took place before the Battle of Borodino. </p><p>  Previously, the capital was much smaller, and the mountain was higher, with it a beautiful view of the city. </p><p>  In the 20th century, Victory Park was founded on Poklonnaya Hill.  On the occasion of the 50th anniversary, a memorial dedicated to the Victory in the Great Patriotic War was built.  In front of him is a stele 142 meters high; the territory is decorated with fountains.  There are exactly as many as the days of the war. </p><h2>  Shrines of Poklonnaya Gora </h2><p>  In 1992, the famous architect A. Polyansky created the design of the St. George Church on Poklonnaya Hill, which was built with some modifications and consecrated in 1995 by Patriarch Alexy II. </p>

    <p>  George the Victorious himself was a talented military man.  He was born in Cappadocia into a believing family, his father was killed during the persecution of Christians.  Having entered the service, his exploits and courage George soon attracted the attention of the Emperor Diocletian, who promoted him and made him governor, which was a very high rank in those days. </p><p>  However, the fact that the holy martyr George professed the Christian faith caused the fury of his patron when he found out about it.  The emperor highly appreciated his military merits and promised the saint forgiveness if he renounced the faith.  He subjected him to terrible torture for several days, and then cut off his head. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fearlessness of George, his faithfulness to faith, the way he courageously endured suffering for Christ, made him one of the beloved and revered saints.  He is considered the patron saint of soldiers in many Orthodox countries. </p>
