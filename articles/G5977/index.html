But in practice, everything is somewhat different.  Firstly, such housing today is simply not affordable for an ordinary person.  Secondly, today even those people who can afford to get luxury apartments are thinking about the advisability of such a purchase due to the very poor environmental situation in megacities.  Of course, they have a choice. </p>

    <p>  You can buy a comfortable house in the country with a huge plot and not worry about clean air.  People who have little income can only dream of buying such a property.  Nevertheless, they also want to live in a good apartment and breathe clean air.  And developers come to their aid who are actively developing suburban lands, erecting multi-storey complexes there.  Moreover, when choosing a place, they try to put not only the infrastructure, but also the environmental component at the forefront.  One of these complexes is the Progress residential complex in Kudrovo.  It will be discussed. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district, whose territories are famous for its good ecology and are popular among developers, has provided its land for the construction of Progress residential complex.  Kudrovo is one of his villages, next to which a <span>residential complex</span> is located <span>.</span>  This place is attractive because it is located not far from the metropolis, there is a metro station two stops from it, a ten-minute walk is the Mega-Dybenko shopping and entertainment complex, and a huge park zone is literally nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, when planning the location of Progress residential complex, the developer - the Mavis company - very competently approached the solution of this issue.  <span>The residential complex</span> consists of six houses of different floors - from 9 to 23. Three buildings have already been commissioned, the rest are being built.  Construction is using brick-monolithic technology. </p><h2>  Progress </h2><p>  Work on the construction of the complex began in 2012.  Due to the fact that the development is a large-scale project, it was decided to work in stages.  In 2014, in full accordance with the planned dates, three first-stage buildings were commissioned.  In the second half of 2016, it is planned to hand over the fourth building, and in 2017 - the fifth and sixth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd progress" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1303260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Apartments in houses of the first stage are already almost sold out, but at this stage, you can purchase housing directly from the developer in the built housing of Progress residential complex.  The company‚Äôs contacts are published on its official website, however, there is only a general phone number for the main office: +7 (812) 642 27 90. However, you can contact representatives of the IC directly at the facility by phone: +7 (960) 243 36 60. B weekdays you can call from 11:00 to 20:00, on Sunday the office of the representative office is open only until five in the evening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Mavis is a real estate developer on the real estate market, which has been operating in the real estate market since 2006.  Ten years is a long enough period for the UK, so its assets include many completed projects in the field of commercial real estate and economy class housing.  LCD "Progress", by the way, also applies to this segment. </p><p>  Mavis does not focus on the original design of facades and layouts, but on simplicity and functionality.  In this regard, housing differs from the developer at affordable prices, and the apartments themselves are thoughtful and ergonomic.  In addition, SK is famous for the fact that it always rents out its facilities in strict accordance with the deadlines, and erects them using only environmentally friendly materials and purely using modern technologies. </p>

    <p>  You can‚Äôt refuse a company a competent approach to the question of choosing the location of <span>residential complexes.</span>  LCD "Progress" (Kudrovo) is a vivid example of this.  As proof, we will give the main advantages of the complex below. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district is generally considered the cleanest in the Leningrad region in terms of ecology.  There are no manufacturing enterprises that poison the atmosphere, there are many forests and ponds.  As for Kudrovo directly, on the territory of which the Progress residential complex is being built, its distinctive feature is the close location of the Okkervil park zone, the Okhta River, Lake Ladoga and the Karelian Isthmus.  In addition, next to the complex there is a park to them.  Yesenin, however, he is practically unfortunate.  Nevertheless, he has a positive effect on creating a good ecological environment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure component </h2><p>  Each potential buyer of an apartment in a new building considers and evaluates not only the quality of housing, but also the security of the district with social and commercial infrastructure.  As already mentioned, in this regard, the future residents of the Progress residential complex are really lucky.  A ten-minute walk away is the huge Mega-Dybenko shopping and entertainment complex, where you can find almost everything that a modern person needs: from shops of various kinds to cafes, restaurants, sports clubs and even a movie theater.  In addition, all the first floors of the Progress housing complex will be given over to commercial facilities.  They will house pharmacies, shops, hairdressers, bank offices and much more.  However, the village of Kudrovo itself is developing so rapidly that even today you can find decent infrastructure facilities there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in lcd progress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1303296.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  As for the social component, there is a kindergarten near the LCD.  In addition, after the delivery of the last buildings in one of them will also open a similar institution.  In the immediate vicinity of the residential complex there are seven schools; there is a large medical center, several clinics, and a network of pharmacies near the metro.  Even immediately after checking in, residents will feel quite comfortable.  When the area is at least a little inhabited, then you can completely forget about the notorious center. </p><h2>  Transport security </h2><p>  The proximity of the metro station is a great blessing for the inhabitant of the metropolis, who lives even in the center, not to mention the outskirts.  And in this regard, the current and future apartment owners are lucky.  Three and a half kilometers separate them from Dybenko, the station of the <span>orange subway line.</span>  Minibuses and buses, the stop of which is located next to the buildings, will reach her in about 15 minutes, and if necessary, you can walk.  In addition, there is another huge plus.  Not far from the houses in the near future, another station should be opened - Kudrovo. </p><p>  As for motorists, they are also satisfied.  A kilometer from the residential complex is a roundabout, a convenient exit for which is equipped next to the houses.  Thanks to this highway, you can quickly reach the center, as well as go to the roads of the Leningrad region. </p><h2>  Housing Fund </h2><p>  All apartments in Progress residential complex belong to the economy class segment.  In total, it is planned to commission 2,316 residential premises.  In already commissioned buildings, almost all vacant apartments are sold out, but, as mentioned above, housing is being sold in houses under construction.  The housing stock is represented by studios, as well as 1-2-3-room living quarters.  Their area is from 24 to 89 "squares". </p><h2>  LCD "Progress": apartment plans </h2><p>  Mavis company is trying to pay more attention to the affordability and functionality of housing, rather than its exclusivity.  In this regard, the apartments presented in the residential complex are distinguished by a simple, but at the same time thoughtful layout. </p>

    <p>  True, not everyone, as the Progress LCD testifies to the reviews, likes the fact that in all living quarters, except for several types of three rubles, there is a combined bathroom.  However, the developer motivated this by the fact that this was done in order to expand the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhallways and kitchens.  The latter, incidentally, are quite spacious.  The minimum area is at least ten "squares", the maximum is almost 22 square meters.  m. Ceiling height - 2 m 70 cm. </p><p>  The designers tried to use every centimeter of usable area as rationally as possible, and therefore they managed to stand out in the hallway with a niche for a dressing room or a spacious wardrobe.  In addition, in any living room there is a spacious glazed loggia with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãat least four "squares", so that, if necessary, it is quite possible to equip it with a small study or game area.  Regardless of the format, each <span>type of residential space</span> has several layout options, so choosing the right one for yourself is not difficult. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  It is worth noting that many experts in the real estate market consider the cost of housing in Progress residential complex to be the lowest in this region.  Which, of course, cannot but please the potential buyer and is a huge plus for the developer.  To build a good and well-maintained housing at affordable prices today, not every UK is capable of. </p>

    <p>  A studio apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 to 29 squares can be purchased for 2,235,000 rubles.  One-room apartments (from 37 to 41 sq. M.) Will cost from 3 million to 3,295,000, two-room apartments (55-71 sq. M.) - from four and a half to five million. As for the "three rubles", they are offered not so much.  Such an apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã80 to 90 squares will cost from 5,450,000 to 6,300,000 rubles. </p><p>  All dwellings are rented with pre-finishing. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  The pre-finishing involves the presence of screeds on the floor, glazing of window openings and balconies, installation of an entrance metal door, installation and connection of utilities.  In addition, there are all metering devices, sockets and switches are installed. </p><p>  However, if the buyer expresses a desire to move into an already fully prepared housing, he can conclude an agreement at the office of the company‚Äôs representative office, according to which the IC specialists will <span>finish the</span> apartment.  And you can even choose your own materials.  As a result, the owner will see a laminate on the floor, wallpaper on the walls, tiles in the bathrooms and in the kitchen, painted ceilings, installed interior doors and plumbing.  True, such an agreement can be concluded only with the purchase of housing in the buildings of the last turn. </p><h2>  LCD "Progress": feedback from equity holders </h2><p>  Today, apartments offered in new buildings are not scolded except by the lazy one.  But about Progress LCD there are practically no negative reviews.  Either the developer is really well done, or St. Petersburgers, due to their mentality, are especially undemanding customers, it's hard to say.  However, they are satisfied with almost everything.  Some do not like except the presence of combined bathrooms and the proximity of the ring.  True, the last circumstance, motorists just consider it a plus.  And the rest of the people are satisfied with the quality of housing, and the timing of construction. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, everyone praises the location of the residential complex.  Many emphasize that the windows of the houses offer stunning views.  In addition, residents consider the availability of their own boiler room to be a big plus, due to which hot water is always present in the houses, regardless of the ‚Äúwhims‚Äù of the administration, and the heating works well.  The developer is also praised for having provided a sufficient number of parking spaces, conducting massive landscaping, and also intends to commission a kindergarten, although there are enough such objects in the microdistrict. </p><p>  As for the cost of housing, everyone considers it to be more than acceptable and corresponding to the level of economy class. </p>
