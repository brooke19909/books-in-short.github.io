You can get carried away with something familiar, or you can discover something new.  Like, for example, tatting.  Schemes and job descriptions will help and clearly show what can happen in the end. </p><h2>  Types of needlework </h2><p>  The word "needlework" means "to do with hands."  You can do it from different materials: from fabric, threads, natural materials, paper, glass ... The same goes for the way you work: you can glue, knit, embroider, weave, burn ... </p><p>  There are very popular classes, but not very, there are complex and simple, traditional and modern ... In any case, if you want to do something with your own hands, then from all this great multitude of hobbies you can choose a lesson to your liking.  This article will focus on an unusual hobby - tatting. </p><h2>  Tatting </h2><p>  This is weaving lace using a shuttle.  It came to Russia from France, therefore it is translated from French as ‚Äúfrivolity‚Äù.  Fashionable tatting was in the seventeenth century.  Gloves, handbags, umbrellas, and also curtains and napkins were made in this technique.  Such things breathed some special lightness, and they were the property of every woman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatting.

    <p>  After the revolution, tatting was declared a lordly whim and undeservedly forgotten. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, against the backdrop of hobbies of all kinds of needlework, tatting was remembered.  It has become a type of hobby with which you can decorate things and give them personality. </p><p>  Doing shuttles using the tatting technique is simple and very exciting.  No special, expensive fixtures are required.  Weaving is mastered very quickly, and the end result is so beautiful that you want to improve your skills again and again. </p><h2>  Simple weaving </h2><p>  Lace tatting is performed from just one node, which alternates with broaches.  They are called "pico" and are connected in circles and arcs.  Various combinations of this duo form a pattern.  If you master the implementation of this knot in the manufacture of lace using the tatting technique, pattern patterns will be easier to read. </p><p>  The assembly is carried out using a needle or shuttle.  Consider a <span>tatting starter</span> needle. </p><p>  The knotting of a double knot is performed as follows.  Press the thread with a needle to the finger, leaving a small end.  We take the working thread on the index finger, make a torsion and put it on the needle.  Gently tighten the knot.  Again we take the working thread on the finger and do the torsion, as in the first case, only in the other direction.  We drop it on the needle, tighten it, and the double knot is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatting.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now let's see how pico is done.  First, make five double knots, as shown above, then leave a little free thread and again make a double knot.  Now we pull it to weave and get a picot.  Its value will depend on the length of the free thread that we leave between the nodes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatting for beginners needle" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1106321.jpg" width="400"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  We continue weaving to such a length: the needle should have three pico and four segments of five double knots.  Let's make a ring, which is the main element of tatting lace.  To do this, we put the working thread into the eye of the needle, pull the weave onto it, stretch it to the end and make a ring. </p><p>  Now let's see how these rings connect to each other.  We leave a little thread, approximately, as in pico, and we knit five double knots.  We connect them with the first picot on the previously made ring, for this we conduct the thread with a needle.  And then we knit as the first ring. </p><p>  By learning how to make these simple elements, you can move on to more complex patterns that are executed using the shuttle. </p><h2>  Crochet </h2><p>  There is another way to weave - this is a crochet tatting.  Let's see how the flower is made.  We‚Äôll take a hook instead of a needle; it‚Äôs very convenient for them to drag the thread into the finished circles. </p><p>  The main element of the flower is a circle, the implementation of which is described just above.  We will execute it from four double knots.  When the first circle is ready, we make a connection: we collect four double knots, we knit the fourth and third together and we collect one more knot.  The connection is ready.  Next we perform weaving in a similar way.  In total, we will make six circles, connecting the first and the last.  It will turn out a wonderful flower. </p><p>  It can be used as a separate craft, such as an earring.  It can also be an element of more complex weaving.  For example, it can be seen in the center of the napkin shown in the first photo. </p><h2>  Tatting world </h2><p>  Remarkable things are obtained that are made using the tatting technique.  Photos of such products are proof of the beauty obtained. </p><p>  Such an adornment will be a wonderful addition to the outfit and will even more shade the personality of its owner. </p><p>  Lace in the tatting technique, the schemes of which are presented in the article, can be an independent product and an element of decor for both things and premises.  This diagram shows a lace element that can be used in any product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatting.

    <p>  An example of the first group can be hats, dresses, jackets, lace traces, <span>handbags,</span> bookmarks for books. </p><p>  Decorative potholders, napkins, tablecloths, birds and animals, vases, snowflakes are designed to decorate the room. </p><p>  As an element, collars, flowers on the dress, cuffs can be used.  The diagram clearly shows how to make a collar using the tatting technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1109392.jpg" width="446"></div>

    <p>  And, of course, you can make all kinds of jewelry in the form of earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces, hairpins. </p><h2>  Masters of tatting </h2><p>  The art of weaving lace using the tatting technique, patterns and photos of finished products are so fascinating that, having met them once every time you return to this needlework, improving your skills. </p><p>  For many needlewomen, this hobby has become a lifelong business, and they willingly share their skills. </p><p>  Such tatters as Elena Ignatova from Kharkov, Olga Meshkova from Abakan, Tatyana Romanovskaya from Odessa, Elmira Kukhtichenko from Donetsk are known in wide circles.  Their works are so exclusive and magnificent that looking at them one really wants to try oneself in weaving these circles.  Many of them have their own sites where they share the secrets of mastery or talk about new works.  They are creative and offer innovative design solutions that translate into original products.  They are regular participants in various exhibitions where they can purchase their work. </p><p>  And of course, I must say about the world famous Pole Jan Stavash, who did a lot to popularize tatting, he also dispelled the myth that needlework is not for men. </p><p>  So this unusual kind of needlework appeared before us. </p>
