    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Claude Bernard was born July 12, 1813 in the city of Villefranche near Lyon (southeast France).  Young Claude mastered classical education at the Jesuit College. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He worked for a very long time in his laboratory.  These works were not in vain.  Bernard gained success and fame in certain circles.  He had his own disciples and followers. </p><p>  An outstanding French scientist died on February 10 in 1878.  He was 65 years old.  The professor found death when he experimented with his talented student Arsen Darsonval.  The French authorities held a public funeral for the scientist, and a little later he was named after a university in the city of Lyon.  Today, scientists are awarded the Bernard Prize for discoveries in endocrinology. </p><h2>  Literary beginning </h2><p>  Bernard Claude was a very serious boy.  He was distinguished from his peers by dreaminess and silence.  From a young age, he saw himself not in science, but in literary work.  But since his father was not rich, his family needed money, Claude had to drop out of school.  He became a student of a pharmacist, at which time he composed the first literary work - vaudeville.  It so happened that <span>this vaudeville was</span> staged on the stage of a theater in Lyon. </p><p>  Encouraged by the success, the young author wrote a historical drama entitled "Arthur of Brittany".  The writer took the manuscript to Paris for review criticism of literature Girardin.  But he urged the young man to leave poetry, and to begin to practice medicine again.  Claude Bernard followed the advice, and later he said that he did not regret that he had left the writing. </p><p>  A few years later, in 1834, he entered the Higher School of Medicine in Paris.  There he becomes a student of the physiologist Mojandi, who at that time was a member of the National Academy of Sciences in Medicine.  Mojandi was also her vice president. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Work with a scientist </h2><p>  In 1839, Claude completed his studies, and at the same time Mozhandi invited him to his work in the laboratory of the College de France.  Eight years later, Bernard is deputy Mojandi. </p><p>  Claude's laboratory was housed in a small room.  Nearby was an audience for students, and in front of the benches was a table for experiments.  It is impossible to imagine, but in this cramped environment, the scientist has discovered a lot in the field of experimental physiology. </p><p>  The scientist Claude Bernard worked in all areas of physiology known at that time.  Claude's activities in science and medicine are divided into two periods: </p><ul><li>  1843-1868; </li><li>  1868-1877 </li></ul><p>  In the first period he was engaged in the ideas of pathological and normal physiology.  The year 1843 was especially fruitful.  Then the thirty-year-old physician published the first scientific works on the role of one of the glands in the animal body, on the importance of the pancreas in the digestion of fats, and on the process of their absorption. </p><p>  Bernard became the founder of endocrinology when he conducted successful classical studies of one of the glands - the pancreas.  Soon, the doctor defends a doctorate devoted to studies of the properties of gastric juice and its role in the digestion process.  In 1849, a physician opened the Society of Biologists, and in 1867 was appointed its president.  This year in the scientific career of Bernard was also significant.  He made another major discovery.  Bernard Claude found out that sugar from the intestines entering the liver turns into glycogen. </p><p>  The scientist also thoroughly studied carbohydrate metabolism, what role does the liver and central nervous system play in it.  The doctor also proved that they are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, and also that the liver is the most important producer of heat in the animal body. </p>

    <h2>  Claude Bernard Syndrome </h2><p>  This syndrome is most often called Horner's disease.  And it should be noted that the syndrome was discovered by Dr. Horner, but Claude Bernard noticed and described the symptoms of the disease much earlier.  Bernard-Horner syndrome is a disease that causes damage to the sympathetic system of nerves in the body.  The syndrome has another name - oculosympathetic.  From the Latin ‚Äúoculus‚Äù - the eye.  The syndrome acts not only on the muscles around the eyes, but also on the visual organ itself. </p><p>  Bernard described these symptoms in his years: </p><ul><li>  slowing the adaptive abilities of the pupil; </li><li>  heterochronism; </li><li>  enophthalmos, or sinking of the body of the eyeball; </li><li>  miosis, or unnatural narrowing of the pupils, etc. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is impossible to overestimate Bernard's contribution to the development of medicine, and in particular endocrinology, physiology and pathophysiology!  About his works and discoveries can be written for a very long time.  But in conclusion, a few more words and facts should be noted.  In addition to physiology and endocrinology, Professor Bernard laid the foundations of pharmacology and even toxicology. </p><p>  In 1964, the scientific world of physicians was shocked by Bernard's next fundamental work, Introduction to Experimental Medicine.  It was this scientist who introduced the <span>method of</span> experimental research into the science of <span>physiology</span> . </p><p>  His students were residents of different countries, among them researchers from England, Germany, America.  In the scientific and experimental laboratory of Claude Bernard, our domestic doctors and biologists also worked: N. M. Yakubovich, I. M. Sechenov, F. V. Ovsyannikov, I. R. Tarkhanov. </p><p>  The scientist was noticed even in philosophical science, his work was of great importance for the science of wisdom, and also significantly influenced physiology and other related sciences. </p>
