The amount of compensation payments "Rosgosstrakh"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the article, we will consider what the compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh are. </p><p>  Agreements concluded in the Soviet period on life insurance, protecting children to reach adulthood, and so on, were long considered lost.  According to a government decree, Rosgosstrakh is currently making compensation payments to those citizens whose insurance contracts were still valid until January 1, 1992. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideiforbiz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh compensation payments" class="if uuid-2975166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975166.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  Those entered into agreements are recognized legally binding for which Rosgosstrakh had certain obligations at the date of the reorganization.  Payments are made in a multiple amount, which directly depends on the age of the insured and the balance of contributions on January 1, 1992.  The rules are as follows: </p><ul><li>  For citizens born before 1945, compensation is provided in the amount of three times the equivalent of the balance of the deposit. </li><li>  For persons from 1946 until 1991, the payment is provided in half. </li></ul><p>  In the event of the death of a citizen to whom insurance payments were due, his relatives will be able to take advantage of such compensation directly under the inheritance procedure.  The organization also provides some assistance in the provision of funeral services, which is done in the amount of six thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gid.volga.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh Ryazan compensation payments" class="if uuid-2975168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975168.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I get compensation payments from Rosgosstrakh this year? </h2><p>  Persons who are entitled to receive compensation under an insurance agreement, or their relatives are required to apply to the local branch of the settlement center for compensation payments at Rosgosstrakh in accordance with the inheritance procedure.  Such centers exist in absolutely every city.  Their task is the collection of documentation and the formation of relevant applications to the federal treasury. </p><h2>  The procedure for receiving payments </h2><p>  The Russian government has charged Rosgosstrakh with processing compensation payments.  The company, in turn, makes a decision on conducting money transfers on the insurance premium and transfers the application for the transfer of funds with the details of the recipients to the Treasury Department (UFC).  Any procedures for considering applications for compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh and making decisions on them occur at the Settlement Center.  In order to receive financial compensation for impaired insurance, you must go through a certain procedure associated with the formation of a set of documents.  For example, citizens will need to provide: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A copy of the passport of the citizen who is the recipient of such a payment.  In this case, a photocopier is necessarily removed from the second, third and fifth pages of the document. </li><li>  Submission of a document confirming the change of surname.  This is required if appropriate. </li></ul><h2>  What documents do the heirs need? </h2><p>  In the event that the heir seeks compensation, it will additionally be necessary to provide the following documents: </p><ul><li>  Death certificate of the insured citizen or policyholder. </li><li>  A document confirming the right to inheritance (we are talking about a certificate of inheritance, a notarial order or a court decision). </li></ul><p>  Where to get compensation payments at Rosgosstrakh in Ryazan?  We will talk about this at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideiforbiz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compensation payments Rosgosstrakh statement" class="if uuid-2975170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975170.jpg"></div><p>  When presenting documents that confirm the inheritance is not possible, you must contact the notary directly in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence of the deceased in order to send a request to the RCSC for calculating the amount of financial compensation.  The institution, in turn, draws up a certificate of the amount of compensation, on the basis of which a notary prepares for the citizen a certificate of the right to receive an inheritance under the insurance certificate.  Next, a complete set of documents is sent by mail.  Now let's talk about what should be contained in the application when filling out an application for a payment. </p><h2>  Statement </h2><p>  It will also be necessary to draw up an application for compensation payments from Rosgosstrakh.  It is desirable to indicate the most complete information on the insurance certificate in it.  For example, the name, surname and patronymic of the insured or the insured citizen are indicated on this paper.  In addition, the type of insurance is indicated along with the terms of the agreement and the place of its execution. </p><p>  Payments with acceptance of the application are made until December twenty-sixth of the current year inclusively.  Further, the formation of civil applications for payments will be suspended until the next government decree next year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.express.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh insurance compensation payments" class="if uuid-2975187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975187.jpg"></div><h2>  The amount of compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh </h2><p>  It is important to say that on the basis of old Soviet insurance, it is envisaged to compensate not for the amount paid, but for the amount of contributions made before January 1992.  In this case, the rule for determining the amount of compensation directly depends on the agreements specified in the agreement with the insured person.  It is worth noting that the citizen himself can act as an insurance object.  In this case, the issue of personal insurance is resolved.  But the service could also be provided with respect to third parties.  For example, child insurance is very common. </p><p>  In addition to being able to compensate for actually paid contributions, they also provide a service to reimburse the burial expenses of insured citizens.  True, in the event that compensation has been previously made for insurance at Rosgosstrakh and reimbursement of expenses for performing funeral services, re-provision of funds is no longer carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirror.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the amount of compensation payments to Rosgosstrakh" class="if uuid-2975177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/2975177.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the contributions that were made according to the insurance certificate issued before 1992, Russia recognized as an internal debt.  Since 2001, the company "Rosgosstrakh" a certain category of citizens makes transfers of compensation payments under Soviet insurance agreements.  This year, for the corresponding purposes, the budget provides for financing in the amount of five billion rubles, and they plan to allocate the same amount in the coming 2019. </p><p>  Compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh in Ryazan can be obtained at the settlement center (RCSC of Ryazan) at 390046, ul.  Vvedenskaya, house 110. </p>
