And all the more meticulously it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, to assess the risks if you are traveling abroad with a child.  Everything needs to be considered here: beach cover, sunset, the climatic characteristics of a given area, noise or, on the contrary, the seclusion of resorts, well-developed infrastructure, the availability of baby food and entertainment.  The countries of the <span>Balkan Peninsula</span> have long become a tourist Mecca because of the comparative cheapness.  The beautiful <span>Adriatic Sea, the</span> ancient architecture of cities, delicious cuisine and charming locals, with whom often there is no language barrier, - what more could you want?  But if you want to go to a country like Montenegro with your children, where to go?  Which resort to choose?  Where to live?  We will try to answer these questions in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Hotel for families with children" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577666.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  When is it better to come on vacation </h2><p>  Montenegro - this is what the Italians-neighbors call this Balkan country.  And we call it <span>Montenegro.</span>  <span>A hotel for families with children</span> can be found here in almost any resort.  The child here is a kind of cult.  Your child will be pampered, as their own, by the hotel staff, waiters in restaurants and just ordinary citizens.  Therefore, the country is positioning itself as a place of family vacations.  But still, you should choose a period when there will not be so many people on the beaches and streets.  The peak season in Montenegro lasts from the second half of July to the end of August.  If your child needs to be in time for school by the first of September, then choose June to relax.  There are not many people yet, but the air temperature is already summer.  But do not forget to grab a protective cream with numerous filters - the sun here is southern, evil.  And with the baby, the best time to go to Montenegro is in September.  The sea has already warmed up completely, the heat begins to subside, and the abundance of fruits will replenish your child‚Äôs body with vitamins for a whole year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro with children where" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577668.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Relief </h2><p>  Naturally, if you are going on vacation with a baby, it is better to choose a hotel on the front page.  But Montenegro can sometimes play a cruel joke with an inexperienced tourist.  The fact is that the country's relief is mainly mountains.  They come very close to the sea.  Map of Montenegro with hotels is full of front-line hotels.  But often they turn out to be buildings towering on cliffs or hanging like swallow nests over the sea.  And so you are waiting for frequent hikes up and down endless stairs or steep paths.  Agree, with the baby, and even with the stroller, such walks will turn into hard labor.  Therefore, it is worth choosing hotels located on a flat terrain, or those that provide their guests with a shuttle to the beach.  Sometimes hotels have an elevator to the coast.  Plain areas are near Budva, Petrovac, in Becici. </p><h2>  The best beaches of Montenegro for children </h2><p>  Honestly, Montenegro is not a country of "seal" rest.  Due to the mountainous landscape, the coastal strip is a narrow space, strewn with stones or (at best) small pebbles.  And sometimes these are just cliffs breaking off cliffs into the sea.  And in the summer months, due to the small space, there is nowhere for an apple to fall on these coasts.  Often the beaches in hotels are pontoon.  What does it mean?  A pier departs from the shore, from which one can go down the stairs into the water, immediately to the depth.  Now imagine how the whole process of bathing with the baby will look like.  Not only that, he does not blind sand castles, but also does not splash in shallow water.  But natural sandy beaches are found in the south of the country.  Not everything is so bad in other parts of a country like Montenegro.  A hotel for families with children, if it positions itself as such, must have a beach with imported sand and shallow entry into the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Montenegro for children" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cuisine of the Balkan peoples is tasty, but completely not designed for children.  The basis of the diet of the local population is meat and fish on the grill, as well as a variety of pizzas and pasta.  But your little sweet tooth will be satisfied: delicious pastries, desserts, ice cream are sold at every corner in Montenegro.  But seriously: how to provide a child with nutritious and wholesome nutrition when you plan to go on vacation to a country like Montenegro?  A hotel for families with children, as a rule, offers its guests half board.  If the hotel is a high class, in its restaurant there will be a so-called children's table.  And this means that your child can be fed with porridge, cheesecakes, cottage cheese and all that crumbs used to eating at home.  There is another vacation option - rent apartments with a kitchen.  But then part of his time will need to be devoted to cooking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro where to relax with children" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  Unlike Egypt and Turkey, Montenegro hardly practices an all inclusive food system.  Basically, hotels offer only breakfast, less often you can find half board (with lunch or dinner - to choose from).  But he who seeks will come to terms.  Those who like to eat ‚Äúhow much will fit‚Äù are waiting for the hotels of Becici (Montenegro): Montenegro and Iberostar Bellevue.  In Budva, these are the Avala Star Resort and Alexander hotels, and in Tivat - the Montenegrino Hotel.  There are hotels with similar services in Ulcinj and Kotor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro map with hotels" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577676.jpg" width="235"></div>

    <h2>  Walking and entertainment </h2><p>  Montenegro surprises with its landscapes, ancient architecture and history.  As a rule, children, especially preschool children, have little interest in antiquities with the beauties of nature.  This must be taken into account if you plan to recover in a country such as Montenegro with children.  What to do with the aching child in the streets of ancient Budva or the fabulous Kotor?  A long excursion to the reserve will probably only tire them.  It is best to choose for small families small resorts such as Petrovac, less than 20 kilometers from Budva.  In addition to the city beach, there are also outskirts: Lucice, Buryalitsa - with excellent infrastructure and good entry into the sea.  There are many shady parks.  The local Palace Hotel hosts theatrical performances for children every night.  Circus performers, mimes, various contests - your child will be delighted.  And recently, almost every beach can not do without a water slide and other attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Becici Montenegro" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577680.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Montenegro: where to relax with children </h2><p>  The choice of resorts in this country must be approached responsibly.  There are towns that position themselves as places for active youth recreation.  It is unlikely that your baby will fall asleep calmly if there is any nightclub or disco nearby.  Therefore, you should not choose a hotel in the very center of a big city.  But small villages are not a good option for a good family vacation.  In them, as a rule, there is no entertainment.  Such secluded places are good for newlyweds in love.  When planning a vacation with a child, it is important to find a middle ground.  And the choice is quite large.  After all, this is a tourist country - Montenegro!  A hotel for families with children can be located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHerceg Novi or on the outskirts of Budva, in small satellite towns such as Petrovac or in the ancient villages of Becici, Tivat with its three parks and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Plaza Montenegro" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/577681.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  It would seem that everything is simple.  If the travel agent assures that the hotel is for family holidays, then that is the way it is.  But what does he mean by this concept?  Basically, hoteliers write on their sign "Family Hotel" if they have rooms with an adjacent door.  But if you are a mother with a small child, then you do not need such a service at all.  Ask better if there is a children's menu in the restaurant and high chairs, whether it is possible to arrange a small crib in the room for the crumbs, and whether the hotel has a shallow pool.  What can I recommend offhand?  In Petrovac, these are the Quartet Riviera, Monte Caza Wellness &amp; SPA and Villa Oliva.  In Kotor it is Forza Maare, and in Budva it is the charming Splendid Conference Resort.  Hotel Plaza (Montenegro, Herceg Novi) is also suitable for families with children, although the hotel is located in the heart of the city.  The wonderful <span>Boka Kotorska Bay</span> is just across the road.  The private beach is covered with bulk pebble sand.  And do not be limited only to them.  In Herceg Novi, which is not typical for Montenegro, the beaches stretch for four kilometers.  And the hotel has an outdoor pool for children. </p>
