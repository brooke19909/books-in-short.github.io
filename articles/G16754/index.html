Nevertheless, it is one of the most ancient European states and has existed for more than eight centuries.  The brief history of Portugal includes the period of the formation of the nation, the era of the greatest geographical discoveries, many wars and a rich cultural heritage. </p><p>  The history of the development of this small southern European state demonstrates to the world the proud and unbridled nature of its people, which managed to go beyond the boundaries permitted by religious ministers, step into the unknown, accumulate considerable wealth, guard the scientific research and visit the center of political life of the Middle Ages.  The Portuguese built and built a great nation, successively and continuously transferring experience to the next and next generations. </p><h2>  First Settlements and Roman Empire </h2><p>  The history of ancient Portugal begins in the Paleolithic era, when settlements of the first people appeared on the territory of the modern state.  From the second half of the 2nd century BC.  e.  until the first half of the 5th century AD  e.  lands were part of the Roman Empire.  In these areas, about 30 tribes of Lusitans, the indigenous inhabitants of the country, fearlessly protecting their possessions, native language and traditions, lived.  Modern Portuguese believe that the Lusitans are their first ancestors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archaeology.institute" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman architecture in Portugal" class="if uuid-2526057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526057.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, the power of the Roman Empire weakened.  From the 5th to the 7th centuries  AD  hordes of Visigoths and Suevs conquered the country, but quickly lost the conquered territories.  In the 7-11 centuries, Arabs reigned here, actively moving west and planting their culture.  Muslim influence is still strong today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Portuguese successfully adopted the method of conquering without a fight from the Romans.  Like representatives of the Empire, they assimilated their language through trade, the development of education in neighboring and overseas lands, and the publishing of books.  This method was applied in the process of colonization of Brazil, Angola, Morocco, Siam, India.  This approach allowed Portugal to significantly strengthen its position and dominate unhindered, trading in diamonds, spices, silk and cotton, accumulating wealth. </p><h2>  The emergence of the state of Portugal </h2><p>  The history of Portugal is associated with hostilities.  The appearance of Arabs in the Mediterranean upset the current balance, so that the rulers of independent principalities were forced to unite and together oppose the spread of Arab culture.  During this period, the influence of the Christian church intensified.  After the conclusion of an alliance between the Roman emperor Charles V and the Pope at the beginning of the 11th century, a war of liberation began, Arabs and Moors were driven out of Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pwr-portugal.ics.ul.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The emergence of Portugal" class="if uuid-2526060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526060.jpg"></div><p>  During the war, the state of Portugal was formed, which in 1143 declared its independence and Afonso Henriques called himself king.  After almost four decades, Pope Alexander III officially recognized the claims of the self-proclaimed ruler.  On May 23, 1179, Portugal was officially declared a separate country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fight for the crown </h2><p>  In the 14th century, the state found itself engulfed in a power battle.  King Fernando I passed away without leaving an heir.  Queen Regent Leonor Teles remained with the country, along with her lover, Duke Andeiro.  Both the aristocracy and the common people were unhappy with this state of affairs.  The king of Castile, Juan I, married to the daughter of the deceased overlord, declared his rights to the Portuguese throne.  However, the parliament rejected these claims and declared Ferdnand, Juan, the king of the illegitimate brother, and Andeiro was executed.  Juan I twice tried to seize Portugal by force, but both attempts were unsuccessful. </p><p>  <span>The internecine war</span> strangled the young state.  The development of technology, science and culture has almost completely stopped; the history of Portugal has slowed down.  To finance the army, the government was forced to raise taxes.  Although the country had rich deposits of uranium, tungsten, iron, the budget was still based on primitive herding and fishing. </p><p>  Amid the internecine war and the ongoing confrontation between the Arabs, the power of the Catholic Church is being strengthened.  Violence spread to all disagreeable Catholic clergy.  Plague waves rolled one after another across Europe.  In such difficult times, the formation of Portugal took place. </p><h2>  Henry the Navigator </h2><p>  The further history and culture of Portugal was determined by the heyday of navigation.  At the beginning of the 15th century, the wars stopped and peace was restored in the country.  Stability allowed the Portuguese to retain the magnificent title of world power.  The son of Juan I, known as <span>Heinrich the Navigator,</span> laid the foundation for a new round of development.  He organized many marine expeditions to the south along the coast of Africa and played a key role in the history of the country of Portugal.  He opened an observatory and a navigation school, where the best mathematicians and cartographers taught future sea explorers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyagevirtuel.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Henry the Navigator" class="if uuid-2526071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526071.jpg"></div><p>  Ship pines grew abundantly on the ocean coast.  The Portuguese built a fleet and began marine expansion.  Ships set off to unknown lands, carrying on board the brave explorers and sentenced criminals.  Merchants generously financed dangerous ventures in the hope of discovering new lands and developing trade with India. </p><h2>  Discovery of new lands </h2><p>  The interests of Henry the Navigator were diverse: land colonization, geographical research, the spread of the Christian religion.  However, his main goal was to find the sea route to India.  By order of the prince, the ships sailed to various parts of the world.  It is these expeditions that have the honor of discovering Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic. </p><h2>  Seafaring development </h2><p>  At that time in the history of Portugal, sailors still believed that the Earth was flat, that Africa was a solid barren desert and stretched all the way to the South Pole, so that the Atlantic Ocean could not be connected to the Indian.  Myths have passed down from generation to generation that deadly monsters are hiding in the ocean waters, the southern sun is so hot that it burns ships to the ground, and the water behind the equator is not suitable for swimming at all, but this did not stop Henry the Navigator.  By his decree, expeditions were equipped one after another, heading towards Africa.  Each time, moving further and further, the sailors brought home black slaves, as well as Guinean gold, enriching the state treasury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.historydiscussion.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portuguese ships" class="if uuid-2526059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526059.jpg"></div><h2>  Sea Route to India </h2><p>  This path was important for further development.  Summarizing the history of the country of Portugal, it should be clarified that its territory was located at a considerable distance from the main trade routes and the state could not claim to be the leader of world trade.  The volume of exports was small, and the Portuguese were forced to purchase the most valuable imported goods, such as spices, at a fabulously high price. </p><p>  Depleted by the war, impoverished Portugal could not pay such a high price, so research ships set sail at sea one after another.  The journey of the unsurpassed Vasque da Gama was also funded from the treasury of the Portuguese prince.  The crew of the caravel, risking his life, managed to overcome the stormy waves at the junction of the Indian and Atlantic oceans, swim along the coast of Africa and finally reach India. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dmhomeworkyqfc.antiquevillage.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasco da Gama expedition" class="if uuid-2526075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526075.jpg"></div><h2>  The development of science and culture </h2><p>  Maritime trade and shipping played a key role in the development of science.  In the brief history of Portugal, it is worth mentioning that during this period close attention was paid to the development of cartography and shipbuilding.  Masters of many specialties from various countries were invited and generously paid for the work in the country.  During this period, new types of ships were invented, capable of sailing against the wind, accelerating to record speeds and transporting unprecedented volumes of valuable goods.  New technologies were gradually introduced in other areas of the economy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maritime trade development" class="if uuid-2526065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526065.jpg"></div><p>  Researchers have used subtle diplomacy in relation to the lands they discovered.  Unlike Spain, the history of Portugal is not rich in wars.  The Portuguese proclaimed that they "carry civilization" and are not conquerors.  Each ship was attended by priests who instilled in the natives a Christian religion, taught their language and other sciences.  This policy of assimilation, adopted from the ancient Romans, made it possible to do almost without violence. </p><h2>  The development of culture, architecture, art </h2><p>  A brief history of Portugal includes the development of culture.  Medieval art combined the influence of eastern and western traditions, especially French.  The role of the Arab and Moorish invaders is also felt, but is less evident than in neighboring Spain.  The most famous architectural structure is the Cathedral in Evora, built in 1185-1204 from gray granite.  At the turn of the 15-16 centuries, when the state reached a high level, art continued to actively develop. </p><h2>  Conquest of Portugal by Spain </h2><p>  In the brief history of Portugal and its relationship with neighboring Spain, there is another chapter related to hostilities.  In 1578, the <span>Portuguese king</span> Sebastian I died tragically during a trip.  The king of <span>Spain, Philip II,</span> who was a distant relative of the deceased ruler, referred to blood ties, sent generous gifts to the representatives of the Portuguese aristocracy, and claimed the throne.  A small group of Portuguese tried to offer little resistance, but their attempt was a failure, the Spanish troops quickly occupied Portugal and Philip II was proclaimed king.  The state remained under Spanish rule until 1640. </p><h2>  A series of new wars and revolutions </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, Portuguese troops entered the war for the Spanish inheritance, however, failed.  As a result, an enslaving peace treaty was signed with Great Britain and Portugal came under the influence of a new ally.  Britain literally strangled the Portuguese economy, not allowing it to grow.  In 1807, the Napoleonic army invaded the territory of the state, but was soon expelled by the British and Portuguese patriots. </p><p>  In the 19th century, two revolutions swept through the country, the Portuguese in 1820 and the September in 1836, the monarchy fell, the royal family was expelled.  Civil wars followed one after another.  In the second half of the century, the state was declared a republic, the socialist movement intensified.  For almost the entire 20th century, the dictatorship of Salazar reigned in the country, overthrown in 1974 as a result of a bloodless revolution.  Since then, stability has come in the history of Portugal, the country has adopted a democratic vector of development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dentistry.umn.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Portugal" class="if uuid-2526087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2526087.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the state takes 5th place in the ranking of the safest countries in the world.  A brief history of Portugal ends here.  Convenient geographical location, excellent climate, highly developed economy makes it a comfortable place to live. </p>
