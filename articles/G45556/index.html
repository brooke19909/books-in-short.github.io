    <p>  Here are presented as restored witnesses of the hot fighting, as well as models assembled by Ural craftsmen according to the drawings.  According to technical characteristics, the history of each exhibit of the visitor will be guided by an individual plate of the machine. </p><p>  Today in the museum of military equipment there are 17 vehicles - both contemporaries of the Great Patriotic War, and post-war models.  In July 2013, a restored patrol boat that survived 1941-1945 became a neighbor of tracked and wheeled vehicles.  The very last element of the exposition in the same 2013 was the ZPU-4 (anti-aircraft machine-gun mount), presented to the Museum on City Day. </p><h2>  Monument "Good angel of the world" </h2><p>  The second most popular attraction of the park, adorning many photos from the Victory Garden in Chelyabinsk, is a 10-meter column, which is crowned by a gilded fragile figure of an angel.  If you look closely, you can see that the celestial is standing on a small hemisphere - the image of our Earth.  In the hands of an angel is a dove, a symbol of world peace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This touching composition was cast in the workshops of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  The unveiling of the monument on May 30, 2008 was timed to the 75th anniversary of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, one of the city-forming enterprises. </p><p>  The Chelyabinsk "Angel of Peace" has brothers and sisters across the globe: in Moscow, Pyongyang, Krasnodar, Bishkek and other cities.  The closest neighbor emits rays of good in Emanzhelinsk - a small town in the same Chelyabinsk region.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinstalling "Good Angels" belongs to the charity "Patrons of the Century."  Compositions are built exclusively on funds donated by her associates. </p><h2>  Monument "Defenders of the Fatherland" </h2><p>  The monument "Defenders of the Fatherland", which can also be found on the territory of the "Victory Garden" in Chelyabinsk, is dedicated to the workers of ChTZ who did not return home from the front.  This is a grandiose 36-meter stele, to which a cube adjoins - a symbol of eternity.  On one side of the last bas-relief in the form of a warrior's head in a helmet, on the other - the same three-dimensional image of a worker standing on the background of tanks.  The composition is crowned with the inscription "To tractor builders who fell for their homeland." </p>

    <p>  Four small steles are located near the main part of the memorial - you can read the names of 1657 workers of ChTZ who gave their lives for their homeland in the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  The authors of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe monument are G.M.  Sukhorukov and A.S.  Bovkun.  The construction of the monument was carried out under the supervision of B.N. Novokreschenov and I.V. <span>Shiryaev.</span> </p><h2>  Monument to the South Ural border guards </h2><p>  Another decoration of the Victory Garden in Chelyabinsk was the monument to the Border Guards of the Southern Urals, which was built entirely with charity funds.  This monument, inaugurated in May 2012, is the first of its kind in the Chelyabinsk region, which, incidentally, is one of the border regions of Russia.  It is dedicated to all military personnel whom fate somehow connected with the border troops: conscripts, personnel, young people who are preparing for such a service. </p>

    <p>  The monument is a slab of dark serpentine mounted on a small elevation.  It depicts a map of the Russian Federation, a border guard with a faithful four-legged colleague, a military ship and a helicopter.  A symbolic border pillar with the mark ‚Äú2012‚Äù, the year the monument was unveiled, is installed next to this composition. </p><h2>  The history of the "Victory Garden" in Chelyabinsk </h2><p>  The park is the same age as ChTZ - it was pitched in the 1930s on the site of a birch grove.  In those days, it did not have a specific name - it was called the ‚ÄúChTZ Park‚Äù, and the garden of the tractor plant, and the garden of the social city of ChTZ. </p><p>  In wartime, the park was completely abandoned.  He was in this state even in the fifties - goats grazed on his lawns, the fence fell in places, only the central avenue was lit.  At the same time, the move was paid - at the cost of one ruble.  Naturally, in such conditions the park was deserted and deserted. </p>

    <p>  Later, they took up the garden thoroughly - renting sports equipment and children's toys, a ski base, a reading pavilion, and a summer stage opened here.  In 1965, the district executive committee of the Traktorozavodsky district decided to assign the hitherto unnamed park the modern name "Victory Garden" - in honor of the 20th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.  In 1975, a monument to the Defenders of the Fatherland, a Soviet worker and soldier, was unveiled on the main avenue. </p><p>  Not so long ago - in 2006-2010.  - a large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the park, as a result of which there was an Alley of Peace, an Alley of Veterans, an Alley of Youth, a modern playground, a summer theater.  And in 2007, the military-patriotic open-air museum mentioned at the beginning of the article was opened in the park. </p><p>  <span>Victory Garden</span> in Chelyabinsk is a museum, memorial and recreational park at the same time.  On its territory, children and adults can both get acquainted with the sights and take an active rest. </p>
