How to repeat the costume of a female cat?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most mysterious, exciting and at the same time sensual images at various events can be called a woman-cat costume.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreincarnation into it has not lost its relevance for several decades.  Today you will learn a little about the one whom many women in the world want to be like.  And also about how to make a female cat costume with your own hands. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  For the first time, the world learned about a cat woman in the distant 40s of the last century.  Then she appeared on the pages of the Batman comic.  Since then, this couple has excited and excited the minds of more than one generation.  A bit later, namely in the mid-60s, the movie about Batman was released, where the viewer could see firsthand the image of a woman cat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="batman and cat" class="if uuid-2430305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2430305.jpg"></div><p>  Then her fame inexorably increased, and her character began to flicker in more films.  Many Hollywood stars tried on the image of an insidious seductress, copying the habits and general style in their performances.  Such a bow does not lose its popularity today, attracting new followers who are interested in the story of Batman and his beloved woman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="batman.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="female cat 1960" class="if uuid-2430306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2430306.jpg"></div><h2>  Variations of costumes and general style </h2><p>  In fact, carnival outfit shops are simply full of a variety of catwoman costumes.  The choice is so great that it is not immediately clear what should be preferred.  Let's determine what is included in the image and costume of a woman cat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the basis of all her costumes is black.  The apparel usually consists of latex or leather-fitting overalls.  Or from leggings, tight-fitting shirts and long gloves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="image of cat woman" class="if uuid-2430273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2430273.jpg"></div><p>  On the face of a female cat is a mask with <span>cat ears.</span>  She is also black, made of the same material as the costume.  Long pointed nails, lips are most often red.  On his feet are black high heeled boots. </p><h2>  How to make a costume yourself </h2><p>  In order to make a female cat costume on your own, you will need: </p><ul><li>  leather leggings; </li><li>  black fitted shirt; </li><li>  long gloves; </li><li>  faux fur and leather; </li><li>  hair band; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  false nails; </li><li>  cosmetics. </li></ul><p>  The most important thing in the image is to convey the essence of the depicted hero.  To do this, you must observe the color palette characteristic of the character, and some behaviors, copy the elements of an image familiar to everyone.  For the costume of a female cat, we take black, cat ears and a tail as a basis. </p><p>  Let's start with the ears.  To do this, cut 2 large triangles of black color from the fur and two more pink or white triangles (slightly smaller in size).  Sew small ‚Äúears‚Äù to large ones and fix them on the hair band. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.playandparty.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat woman costume" class="if uuid-2430280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2430280.jpg"></div><p>  From thin skin, you can cut out an eye mask and gently stitch the edges or buy a finished mask. </p><p>  The tail can also be made of fur by simply cutting a long strip and sewing it on the leggings belt. </p><p>  To create cat claws, you need thin and long (preferably leather) gloves.  It is necessary to paint false nails with silver varnish and glue them firmly to the gloves with glue. </p><p>  For greater resemblance, trim the shirt with black fur neckline.  And also on all clothes to make stitches with white thread. </p><p>  Makeup is also important.  It should be bright.  The main emphasis should be on the eyes and lips.  Eyes should be summed up with black liquid eyeliner and thickly apply mascara on the eyelashes.  And make the lips as sensual as possible by applying red lipstick.  Before applying red lipstick, lightly peel your lips with a toothbrush. </p><p>  Try to create the image of a female cat yourself by watching movies with this character.  This will help you get even more inspired and capture the essence of the image. </p>
