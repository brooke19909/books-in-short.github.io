If the date of the event is already very close, then it's time to take care of making a children's carnival costume.  In this article, we will consider how to make a snowflake costume with your own hands for a girl. </p><h2>  Carnival costumes </h2><p>  The tradition of changing clothes and reincarnating for the holidays has been maintained for several hundred years.  Currently, events using carnival costumes are held mainly at children's parties, when the kids take on the image of the hero of a fairy tale or cartoon. </p><p>  Children dressed in various costumes create an atmosphere of fairy tales and magic at the matinee.  Costumes of fairy-tale characters are used for staging children's theater scenes. </p><p>  Before buying or making a costume, be sure to coordinate the design with the child, because it is for him to walk in this costume.  Take care of the functionality of the outfit.  If competitions will be held at the festival, then the costume should not hamper movement, its structure should be strong and reliable. </p><h2>  Snowflake costume for girls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snowflake costume for girls" class="if uuid-2419572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2419572.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The snow-white</span> color of the dress made of airy fabric and shiny accessories will become attributes of the holiday.  <span>New Year's</span> snowflake costume is a great reincarnation option.  To give the image magical properties, you can add a magic wand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Making a snowflake costume for a girl can take several hours.  Prepare the necessary material and accessories.  For the base of the dress, you can take a satin fabric, it has a smooth shiny texture and is affordable.  The skirt that will be worn on top of the dress should be airy and layered. </p><p>  The carnival costume of the snowflake should be not only beautiful and elegant, but also convenient for the child.  When choosing fabric, decor and color, consult with the child, let the baby also participate in the manufacturing process. </p><p>  To make a snowflake costume with our own hands, we need: </p><ul><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  glue gun with rods; </li><li>  marking pencil; </li><li>  scissors, pins; </li><li>  paper for patterns; </li><li>  fabric for the base of the dress, fabric for the skirt; </li><li>  rhinestones, sparkles, sequins, beads, beads, tinsel. </li><li>  linen gum; </li><li>  cardboard, head hoop; </li><li>  shoes for decor. </li></ul><p>  You can modify the accessories for the costume, use other materials, add your own decor elements and decorations. </p><h2>  Patterns for a suit of snowflakes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vy-krojka-kostyuma-snezhnaya-koroleva.urbanobutik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patterns for a suit of snowflakes" class="if uuid-2419775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2419775.jpg"></div><p>  So where does creativity begin?  To create a snowflake costume with your own hands, you will need templates that you need to prepare for cutting.  They must be adapted to the size of the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Transfer dimensions to graph paper, cut out patterns.  Attach them to the fabric and secure with pins.  Apply the contours of the patterns to the fabric, make allowances at the edges, as shown in the diagram.  Cut fabric blanks. </p><p>  To ensure that the edges of the fabric do not crumble, the perimeter of each pattern must be processed using a zigzag stitch.  If the fabric is satin, you can just burn the edges, but in this case, such an outfit will ‚Äústitch‚Äù from the inside, which is not very convenient. </p><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  For a corset and a main skirt, you need to choose a flowing, smooth fabric.  Here are some fabric options you can use to make your snowflake costume: </p><ol><li>  Atlas.  Smooth, flowing material. </li><li>  Velvet.  Rough material with a small pile.  The surface of the velvet is pleasant to the touch, the hairs form an iridescent surface. </li><li>  Polyester.  Synthetic material that is breathable.  Smooth to the touch, has a semi-gloss surface. </li></ol><p>  In order for the skirt to be magnificent, and the baby feel like a real princess, you need to use a fabric that will keep its shape well.  For a voluminous overhead skirt, fit: </p><ol><li>  Fatin.  This <span>transparent fabric</span> has a mesh texture, does not crease, holds its shape well. </li><li>  Organza.  Transparent fabric of small weaving.  It can be made with spraying elements in the form of drawings or patterns.  Very light and airy. </li></ol><p>  It is more convenient to use tulle, it is cheaper and holds its shape better.  The hem of the skirt will not hang down, the edges will be located horizontally, this will betray the skirt with magnificent shapes. </p><h2>  Costume Sewing Process </h2><p>  Connect the parts in the desired position, fasten with pins and bast the side and shoulder sections of the corset.  Sweep the junction of the details of the skirt and sleeves.  Sew the cream lines.  For processing the neck, as well as the edges of the sleeves and the hem, a hem is used with a closed cut.  Try to make straight lines, as they will be visible on the front side of the suit.  Iron the seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the junction of the halves of the back of the corset, zipper must be sewn.  Better to use the secret option.  The edges of the patterns are processed overlock or silk trim.  Attach the zipper to the pattern so that the top of the zipper tape matches the edge of the pattern.  Start zipper up from above.  Make sure that the fixation is uniform, without the formation of waves on the fabric and deformations.  Stitch so that the seam line is between the braid and the zipper teeth.  Follow the stitch until the foot rests against the dog. </p><p>  In order to simplify the process of making a costume, you can only sew a corset or make a body suit.  Perhaps you already have a ready-made blouse in white, then you just have to make a skirt. </p><p>  How to sew a snowflake costume with your own hands if there is no sewing machine?  Very simple.  Use ready-made white clothing.  Make a tulle skirt with a glue gun.  You can decorate with tulle sleeves and the neckline of a blouse. </p><h2>  Tulle Petticoat </h2><p>  To make the skirt voluminous and fluffy, you will need about 3 meters of tulle.  Choose white or pale blue material.  A gum of 2 cm width will serve as a belt.  Connect the edges of the elastic to form a circle.  Determine the length of the skirt, multiply the result by two, you get the length of the blanks from tulle.  Cut the tulle into pieces with a width of 10-15 cm and fix it on the belt in the same way as shown in the picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunshineshoppeblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a tulle skirt" class="if uuid-2419876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2419876.jpg"></div><p>  If you filled the entire circumference of the elastic band with tulle, but the volume of the skirt does not suit you, then add a few more segments to obtain the desired splendor. </p><p>  The second method of manufacturing a tulle skirt involves fixing the edge of a piece of a single piece of fabric in the form of a zigzag.  For this purpose it is not necessary to use a sewing machine, you can use a glue gun, and stitch the finished result to a belt or elastic band. </p><h2>  Costume decoration </h2><p>  Consider how to decorate a snowflake costume so that it looks elegant and festive.  To do this, we need a variety of decorative elements: sequins, rhinestones, beads, beads, sparkles.  Rhinestones can be glued to the finished product with a glue gun.  The arrangement of the rhinestone does not have to be uniform, you can lay out the contours of a snowflake or make an ornament along the edge of the neck and sleeves. </p><p>  To create a pattern of sequins, you can use a sewing machine or the same glue gun.  Sequins are sold both separately and in stripes.  It is easier to attach and stitch whole strips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jewelry for corset" class="if uuid-2424069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2424069.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate the costume, you can use beads and large beads.  This is done by hand sewing.  First sew large beads in the center of the composition.  Use white and blue shades.  Then fill the remaining spaces with small beads. </p><p>  If it is supposed to carry out volumetric work on the decor of the corset, then the fabric for the manufacture of this element of the dress should be more dense.  You can hem a thicker lining. </p><p>  Use beads to decorate the airy skirt.  Attach them evenly over the entire surface of the skirt with a glue gun.  In some places you can fix small balls of tinsel.  The costume should shimmer in the light and shine like a snowflake in the cold. </p><h2>  Crown for snowflake costume </h2><div class="photo" data-original="jezebelsfascination.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crown for snowflake costume" class="if uuid-2424073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2424073.jpg"></div><p>  As a basis for the crown of snowflakes, you can use an ordinary children's hoop.  If it is already white, then it remains to attach to the plastic base an element cut out of cardboard that resembles the appearance of a kokoshnik.  If the hoop is of the wrong color, then wrap it with satin ribbon or other suitable material to hide the bright color of the case. </p><p>  The crown of snowflakes can be weaved from a wire on which tinsel is wound.  Do not use too wide tinsel, in this case the crown will be bulky.  Wrap the wire with tinsel, make bends that follow the contour of the crown, fix the structure to the hoop with a glue gun. </p><p>  The second option is a bezel made of thick cardboard or elastic plastic.  Take measurements from the child‚Äôs head, cut a strip of cardboard 3-4 cm wide. Try on and fix the circle.  You can decorate such a crown with the help of large plastic snowflakes covered with sparkles.  Before the new year to buy them will not be difficult.  Place the snowflakes around the perimeter, cover the PVA terminals and powder with sparkles. </p><p>  You can cut the crown frame from a regular plastic bottle.  In this case, it is necessary to carefully decorate the surface of the plastic so that there are no transparent elements.  Use sequins, rhinestones and beads of different sizes. </p><h2>  Snowflake Costume Shoes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dressing children's shoes for the holiday" class="if uuid-2420043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2420043.jpg"></div><p>  Usually for matinees, girls buy sandals or ballet shoes.  If you have white or blue shoes, then simply decorate them so that the shoes fit into the image of the suit. </p><p>  For temporary decor, you can use liquid spangles, which if necessary can be removed from the shoes.  On the straps you can tie small pompons from tinsel. </p><p>  If you do not mind shoes, then for decoration you can use anything you want.  Using a glue gun, glue the lace elements to the toe and heel of the shoe.  Symmetrically arrange large rhinestones and iridescent sequins.  Fill the space between them with glue.  Without waiting for the adhesive to dry?  sprinkle the product with sparkles.  After this decor, the shoes will turn out to be just magical. </p><h2>  Magic wand </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magic wand for snowflake costume" class="if uuid-2424081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2424081.jpg"></div><p>  Choose a tube that is suitable for length and thickness.  If this was not found, then make it out of paper by twisting it in several layers.  Wrap the stick with satin ribbon to hide the texture of the paper, fastening can be done using the glue gun. </p><p>  Make the tip of the magic wand in the form of an asterisk.  To do this, cut a star 5-6 cm in size from thick cardboard, you can connect several layers to get a tough figure.  For decor, use rhinestones or any other elements that shine in the light.  The easiest way is to fix the decor with a glue gun.  The entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cardboard must be covered.  You can make the tip of a magic wand in the form of a fluffy ball of tinsel. </p><h2>  Handbag and gloves </h2><p>  The easiest way is to make a bag in the form of a bag.  To do this, we need a dense fabric.  Prepare the details: </p><ol><li>  Round bottom of the bag.  The diameter of the circle is 10 cm. </li><li>  Wall bags.  Rectangle 20 * 31.5 cm. </li><li>  Braid 31.5 cm. </li></ol><p>  Sew the tape to the blank of the bag wall from the wrong side so that there is a place for threading the lace.  The distance from the edge should be 3-4 cm. Sew the edge of the products with a zigzag and connect the parts with seams.  The bag is ready. </p><p>  In the manufacture of gloves, it is not necessary to take as a basis a complex model of the classic look of these accessories.  You can make cute and smart mitts - gloves that are held on the hand with the help of jumpers between the fingers.  The material for the manufacture of this accessory should stretch well, otherwise the gloves will not hold on hands. </p><p>  Using rhinestones, sequins and beads, give the gloves and handbag a chic look, make the same decor as you used when decorating the corset. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Whatever snowflake costume design you choose, the base should be this: white or blue fabric, airy skirt and lots of shiny jewelry.  The outfit should sparkle and shimmer in the light.  Your baby will feel like a real princess at the holiday. </p>
