She examines the relationship of living objects and their communities between themselves and the physical environment.  One of its sections - synecology - studies ecology and its living organisms, which are part of biogeocenoses: plants, insects, fungi, animals in interaction with each other.  Science itself originates in the works of such scientists as L. Dollo, O. Abel, D. N. Kashkarov, V. N. Sukachev. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will get acquainted with the basic concepts of this <span>section of ecology</span> and find out the structure and mechanisms of functioning of ecological systems. </p><h2>  Biogeocenoses as components of the biosphere </h2><p>  The collections of individuals of various biological species - populations - live separately.  They are united in larger communities - biocenoses.  Moreover, various kinds of relationships arise between individuals within a given ecosystem, for example, such as allelopathy, parasitism, mutualism, competition, and trophocenotic connections.  Synecology studies the relationship between organisms that are part of the biogeocenosis, and also explores the specifics of interspecific relationships of plant and animal subsystems that make up a living community. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is meant by the ecological system </h2><p>  Currently, environmental science is actively using not only the term ‚Äúbiogeocenosis‚Äù, but also such a thing as ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù, introduced by A. Tensley.  Both words are used to denote <span>natural complexes</span> and their components: phytocommunities and animal populations, which are studied by synecology based on ideas about the relationship of all living organisms with their environment.  It should be noted that there is no equal sign between the two terms.  The definition of "biogeocenosis" given by V. Sukachev carries a great semantic load, as it considers natural complexes taking into account the circulation of substances and energy flows that occur in them.  But the concept of "ecosystem", which has become widespread, especially in popular science literature, due to its streamlining is now used to characterize a wide variety of biocomplexes, both natural and artificial. </p><h2>  The theory of biogeocenosis V. N. Sukachev </h2><p>  The scientist‚Äôs views were formed under the influence of prominent biologists in Russia: V. Dokuchaev, who worked in soil science, and V. Vernadsky, the founder of the doctrine of the biosphere.  Combining the knowledge of geochemistry, forestry, geobotany, V. Sukachev created a new discipline - biogeocenology.  It, like synecology, is a section of ecology that studies the interconnections of living organisms within a biome, examines the patterns of interspecific and population relationships of individuals related to phyto- and zoocenoses.  Based on the ideas of the scientist, all layers of the biosphere are saturated with life, processes of interconversion of biomass and energy occur in them.  Their basis is the power circuit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  They include producers - autotrophic organisms, especially plants.  This is followed by consumers of the first, second, third order, which are heterotrophs. </p><p>  The final link in <span>trophic chains</span> are utilizers of dead organics - reducers.  These include <span>soil bacteria,</span> saprotrophic fungi, and also some insects.  All <span>factors of inanimate nature</span> included in the <span>biogeocenosis, such as</span> soil, water, atmosphere, are called biotope. </p><h2>  Synecological research methods </h2><p>  At the beginning of the formation of science, scientists received experimental material through research - expeditions.  In the middle of the 20th century, such methods as stationary year-round experiments, the method of labeled atoms, and radio tracking became dominant.  In the 21st century, tracking using the artificial satellites of the Earth over the movement of animal populations began to be actively used.  For example, large artiodactyls labeled with radio chips.  Given the fact that synecology is a branch of ecology that studies the relationships of a large number of organisms with each other, scientists use both mathematical analysis and cybernetics.  The latter is used to model and predict the components that make up natural systems. </p>

    <h2>  What functional phytocenology studies </h2><p>  Plants are essential participants in ecosystem life.  As a result of photosynthesis, they provide all other living beings with food, which provides a certain energy reserve.  Synecology studies the relationship between the components of the phytocenosis and populations of heterotrophic organisms: insects, plant and carnivores. </p><p>  The floral composition of the plant communities of most biocenoses is quite complex and is called species richness.  Plant organisms are represented in ecosystems in the form of tiers, which is of great importance for creating a variety of ecological niches.  The horizontal heterogeneity of plants is called mosaic and, in contrast to the layering, is little dependent on the length of daylight hours.  But it is directly determined by the types of relationships, such as allelopathy and competition.  Phytocenoses are changing, their dynamics is due to circadian rhythms and successions, such as deforestation, geocataclysms, forest fires. </p>

    <h2>  Causes of animal population dynamics </h2><p>  Such famous scientists as S. A. Severtsov, N. V. Turkin, and Ch. L. Elton studied the changes in the number of individuals in intraspecific communities.  And C. Hewitt coined the term "waves of life."  They occur in natural complexes and, together with trophocenotic processes, are indicators of the biotic potential of the ecosystem.  The study of the quantitative dynamics of individuals is of great practical importance for anti-epidemic measures that control the circadian breeding rhythms of rodents that spread zoonoses such as plague and tularemia.  Synecology also studies the influence of human activity on the state of zoocenoses, in particular, a decrease in the populations of rare and endangered species, and a decrease in the number of valuable commercial animals in the communities. </p><h2>  Types of relationships of organisms in biomes </h2><p>  Recall that synecology is a section of ecology that studies the relationship between individuals of the plant and animal world.  These include mutualism, competition, allelopathy.  For example, in phytocenology it has long been known that some plants are incompatible with each other: black walnut releases substances toxic to pome fruits and stone fruits, inhibits their growth and fruiting, and also leads to the death of plants. </p>

    <p>  Mutualism is a form of coexistence of populations of various species from which organisms benefit each other (hermit and sea anemones, flagellates living in the intestines of insects and helping them break down fiber). </p><h2>  Energy exchange in the biosphere </h2><p>  Biogeocenoses that make up the living shell of the Earth, transform both biomass and energy, and are open systems.  These natural complexes need an influx of light energy.  Phototrophs use it for the synthesis of organic substances, ATP and NADPhN <sub>2</sub> molecules.  Synecology is a science that studies the mutual transformations of biomass and energy. </p>

    <p>  They have the appearance of an ecological pyramid and its food chains.  The energy dynamics from the lowest trophic level to the highest is subject to general physical laws, moreover, the difference between the energy potentials of neighboring levels is 10-20%, and the rest of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat.  In this work, we familiarized ourselves with the section of ecology - synecology, and found out the methods of its research, as well as the importance for the life support of the biosphere. </p>
