Currently, in Russia there are a huge number of financial institutions that offer citizens various deposit programs.  If potential depositors believe that a good bank is one where the maximum interest on deposits is reached, then experts recommend approaching the issue comprehensively.  A high rate does not guarantee that the client will earn on their investments.  It is worth paying attention to the reputation of the bank, as well as the terms of cooperation. </p><h2>  How to determine the profitability of a deposit </h2><p>  Modern marketers use high-profile statements for promotions, in connection with which you can often see a video with a proposal to invest money at very high interest rates.  However, do not rush and invest your money in the first bank that comes to you, where a 16% return on a deposit is promised.  In fact, this may look different, for example: </p><ul><li>  you need to invest several million for several years; </li><li>  the 16% rate is valid only for the first 3 months; </li><li>  The offer is available only to corporate clients. </li></ul><p>  Equally important is the urgency of the contribution.  As a rule, the best rates apply to deposits with a longer term.  Any good bank has views on the money of depositors, and it is beneficial for him to keep the savings of his clients longer, to put them into circulation and make money on it.  As a result, rates on short-term deposits are less attractive than on deposits for several years.  Experts say that the best option for making a profit is to invest money for 1 year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="good bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1513906.jpg"></div>

Thanks to this option, the client receives even greater income, because the interest is charged on the entire deposit amount, which is constantly increasing.  This parameter of the future deposit is not critical, because when you open an account for 12 months, capitalization will increase the deposit amount quite a bit.  However, when you deposit about 2-3 million rubles into the account and the deposit term is 24 months, thanks to this option you can get good dividends. </p><h2>  Deposit operations </h2><p>  Considering the proposals of financial institutions and choosing which bank has good interest on deposits, it is worth paying attention to the possibility of making income and expense transactions on the account.  You need to choose a program based on your own goals.  If the client wants to save money, then you need a program with the possibility of replenishment, and if you need to have money for some personal expenses in the near future, it is better to open a deposit with the possibility of partial withdrawal of funds from the account.  The terms of the transaction should be studied carefully.  As a rule, banks significantly lower their rates for withdrawing funds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1513901.jpg"></div>

Today, the most popular product is term deposits.  They are conditionally divided into: </p><ul><li>  settlement; </li><li>  cumulative; </li><li>  savings. </li></ul><p>  The largest percentage today can be obtained through savings programs.  The fact is that such deposits cannot be replenished and any expenditure transactions are made on them, and the term is always significant.  It is precisely such deposits that are beneficial to any financial institution, therefore the rates on them are the most attractive, and the client receives interest only when the account is closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank is better to take" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1513912.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Accumulative programs have wide functionality.  On them, the client can receive interest on a monthly basis, there is a capitalization of the account and regular replenishment is provided.  This option is especially beneficial for those who plan to save money.  However, the percentage on such a contribution will be lower.  The current account will bring the least profit due to the lowest interest.  At the same time, the client has access to credit and deposit transactions. </p><h2>  Promotions and seasonal offers </h2><p>  As a rule, the most favorable rates on deposits are offered to clients on the eve of the holidays, at the opening of a subsidiary and other promotions.  There are also seasonal offers, within which it is necessary to open a deposit until a certain day.  Such shares are needed by financial institutions to attract the target audience.  As a rule, any good bank offers special programs the most favorable conditions for customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best offers of banks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1513904.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Currency deposits </h2><p>  In Russian banks, you can open a deposit not only in national currency, but also in any other.  Moreover, offers are not limited to dollars or euros; you can even choose the <span>British pound</span> or the RMB of the Republic of China for your account.  This investment method is characterized by low profitability.  It is beneficial to open such a contribution to those who plan to spend their savings in the future without converting into rubles.  Otherwise, you can lose a lot of money when exchanging currencies. </p><h2>  Bank reliability </h2><p>  In Russia, there are a huge number of financial organizations that provide citizens with the opportunity to open a deposit or use other products.  When choosing a bank in which it is better to take a loan or <span>open a deposit,</span> it is worth paying special attention to its reputation.  As a rule, the loudest promises are given by those institutions whose market position is very precarious.  Attracting investors is one way to solve your own problems. </p><p>  A good bank cannot promise a deposit at a rate of 15% per year, since there is a certain order of prices and the rate cannot vary more than within 0.5-2%.  Before you entrust your financial organization with your money, it is worth checking its reliability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank has good interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1513910.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The best offers of banks on interest </h2><p>  If the client chooses where to invest at the highest interest rates, then it is worth considering the following proposals: </p><ol><li>  "Rentier".

Tempbank offers citizens to open a deposit of 50 thousand rubles at a rate of 10.7%. </li><li>  "Central".  This program is a proposal of Centercombank.
