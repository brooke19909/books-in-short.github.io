    <p>  It is interesting that when the Byelorussian <span>Soviet Socialist Republic</span> existed <span>, the emblem</span> hardly changed. </p><h2>  History of education </h2><p>  Between states such as Poland, the Lithuanian SSR, the Latvian SSR, the RSFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, after the revolution, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was created.  Its territory numbered about 207,600 km <sup>2</sup> .  Initially, the BSSR belonged to the RSFSR and only two years later became an independent republic.  Immediately after the separation, the BSSR merged with the Lithuanian Soviet Republic and formed the Lithuanian-Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, or, as it was also called, the SSR LitBel, but only for a year and a half.  The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic of 1919 was actually part of a larger republic.  The Lithuanian-Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic consisted of two.  The Moscow-Lithuanian treaty, which was signed on July 12, 1920, was an omen of the collapse of the Soviet Socialist Republic of LitBel.  And already on July 31, the Lithuanian-Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic completely collapsed.  Thus, the BSSR was created in 1919, then it entered a larger association, after, from 1920 to 1991, it existed in its former status and became an independent state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Economic characteristic </h2><p>  In 1980, 4.3 billion rubles were invested in the BSSR for the development of industry, economy and infrastructure.  The most developed industries of this state can be called the chemical, petrochemical and food industries.  Rapid economic growth (from 1940 to 1980) was achieved through abundant investment and labor of the Belarusian people.  People who lived in the republic after the war rebuilt cities, many of which, one might say, were rebuilt, and adjusted production and <span>mining.</span>  The production volume has increased 29 times in just 40 years.  Fuel of the BSSR, as well as the Republic of Belarus, was provided and is ensured by means of its abundant reserves of natural gas, oil, coal and peat.  Rich mineral deposits were also developed and equipped with the help of investments of the USSR.  The length of railways in the BSSR for 1982 was as much as 5513 km, and roads for vehicles - 36 700 km. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The BSSR was one of the most densely populated parts of the Soviet Union, in 1984 the population density was 47.6 people per 1 km <sup>2</sup> .  The uniform population of the republic is determined by relatively equal <span>environmental conditions</span> throughout its territory.  However, the center of the country was the most populated, which can be explained by the location of large cities here, including Minsk.  Between 1950 and 1970, the urban population grew faster than the average for the USSR. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/789083.jpg" width="483"></div>

The flat type prevails.  However, the area is characterized by the alternation of hills and lowlands, which are heavily bogged in places, in addition, a large number of lakes were located on the territory of the BSSR.  Quaternary glaciation determines this feature of the relief.  In the northwestern part of the state is a whole system of end moraine ridges.  In the northeast are elevations. </p><h2>  Relief </h2><p>  In the direction from west to east on the territory of the former BSSR, the Belarusian ridge stretches, which consists of individual parts, hills formed in the Moscow glaciation.  Parallel to it are glacial plains.  Belarusian Polesie, located in the south of the state, is called a special case of the plain.  Hills and ridges also appear in the south, next to Belarusian Polesie. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The BSSR was in the temperate zone, from which it follows that the climate is temperate continental.  January temperature is about -4 ¬∞ C, but due to the relatively large extent from north to south, this value can vary.  The average July temperature is about 17 ¬∞ C, but for the same reason, the value may not be accurate for absolutely all areas of the country.  The climate is continental, which means that there is little rainfall - 550-700 mm. </p><h2>  Rivers </h2><p>  In the BSSR there were a large number of rivers, both small and large in length.  Their total length is considered a value of 90,600 km.  All of them belong to the basin of the Atlantic Ocean, namely to the Black and Baltic Seas.  Some rivers are used for transportation.  The BSSR was very rich in forests, which occupied 1/3 of the entire territory, the vegetation of swamps and shrubs were located in 1/10 of the territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The territory of the BSSR was not on the edge of the East European plate, which means that seismological activity could not be strong, the most powerful earthquakes did not reach 5 points. </p><h2>  Minerals of the BSSR </h2><p>  The most important minerals, which are still located in Belarus in large quantities, can be called gas, oil, coal and various salts. </p><p>  The region of the northern part of the Pripyat trough is very rich in oil and gas.  A distinctive feature of oil deposits is the massiveness and arrangement of their layers.  Natural gas is not represented in large volumes, and therefore is produced along the way. </p><h2>  <span>Brown coal</span> and shale </h2><p>  Also on the territory of the BSSR huge reserves of brown coal were discovered.  Peat is represented by 39 species.  It is one of the main types of fuel in Belarus.  As many as 7000 coal deposits, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is about 2.5 million hectares, simply cannot be unused.  The total amount of peat is 1.1 billion tons, this is truly rich reserves. </p><p>  In addition, in the BSSR, oil shale began to be produced, which, according to geologists, is located at a depth of up to 600 m. Huge reserves of oil shale are as actively used as fuel. </p><h2>  Salt </h2><p>  Potash and rock salts are mining raw materials.  The thickness of the layers is 1-40 m. They occur under carbonate-clay rocks.  Reserves of potash salts amount to about 7.8 billion tons. They are mined at various deposits, for example, at Starobinsky and Petrikovsky.  Rock salts are represented by 20 billion tons; they occur at a depth of up to 750 meters.  They are mined at such fields as Davydovskoye and Mozyrskoye.  In addition, the BSSR was rich in phosphorites. </p><h2>  Building rocks </h2><p>  The territory of Belarus also has rich reserves of building and facing stone, chalk rocks, clays and building sands.  Reserves of building stone - about 457 million m <sup>3</sup> , facing - about 4.6 million m <sup>3</sup> .  The southern regions of Belarus are richest in building stones.  Dolomites, by contrast, come to the surface in the north.  Their reserves are about 437.8 million tons. The BSSR was also rich in Cretaceous rocks, whose reserves today amount to about 3679 million tons. Clays of various types are represented on the territory of Belarus with reserves of 587 million m <sup>3</sup> , they are located mostly in Minsk and Grodno , Gomel and Vitebsk regions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic flag" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32931/786143.jpg" width="422"></div>

    <h2>  The development of mineral resources </h2><p>  On the territory of the BSSR, as already mentioned, mineral resources were actively mined.  Their development began 30,000 years ago, in the era of the Late Paleolithic.  At that time, the people who lived in this territory mined flint from the surface of the earth.  About 4,500 thousand years ago, siliceous mining was already developed.  A large number of mines were discovered that were still used in the Cretaceous periods.  Their depth is not more than 6 meters, however, given the time of their occurrence, it can be considered that flint mining was very developed among the inhabitants of these areas.  There were also entire complexes of mines connected by passages, usually up to 5. </p><h2>  Production development </h2><p>  Ancient mines were found in the mines, which were intended for stitching the bags needed to transport the mined mineral.  The material was processed near the exit.  Flint served to make axes.  Already in the fifth century BC  The development of metal deposits began, of which people living in Belarus created household items and weapons.  In addition, clay made dishes for various needs.  From the 16th century, glassworks began to appear, and in the 18th the first manufactories appeared in this area. </p><h2>  Peat extraction </h2><p>  Peat extraction in the BSSR has become an independent industry.  Volumes are constantly increasing due to increased use.  Peat enterprises appeared that strengthened the industry.  But during the Second World War almost all of them were destroyed.  Only by 1949 the volume of peat extracted reached its previous values. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic 1919" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32931/786174.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Salt production </h2><p>  As already mentioned, potassium and rock salts in Belarus are in large quantities.  But only in 1961 began their active mining.  An underground mining method was used.  The richest of them is Starobinsky.  The mechanization of most of the production entailed an increase in salt by 60% in 1965 and by 98% in 1980. </p><h2>  Subsoil Protection </h2><p>  Minerals were actively mined in the BSSR; it is easy to guess that this had a significant impact on the environment.  Huge territories were hit hard.  Therefore, recreational activities aimed at enriching the bowels and restoring resources, such as fertilizing the soil and planting trees, began to take place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BSSR in 1920 1930" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32931/786145.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Education industry specialists </h2><p>  The Belarusian Polytechnic Institute, formed in the BSSR, prepares personnel for work in the mining industry.  It was founded in 1933 in Minsk.  Already in 1969, there were as many as 12 faculties.  There are also other educational institutions.  Technical schools still provide education in the development of peat deposits, underground processing of ores and non-metallic minerals and in other industries. </p><h2>  Arena of confrontation </h2><p>  In 1920, the BSSR, one might say, was the center of confrontation between bourgeois Europe and the USSR.  The last side wanted to keep power in Poland, the interests of the Soviet Union were represented by a delegation from the RSFSR.  The decision was not made in favor of the BSSR.  The resolution did not allow the expansion of Belarus at the expense of Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BSSR is" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32931/786153.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <p>  The socialists of the BSSR were unhappy with the location of borders with their neighbors, namely with the RSFSR and Poland.  They believed that borders could not be established on an ethnographic basis.  There was no unity on the problems of the territory. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the BSSR and the Ukrainian SSR suffered more than other parts of the Soviet Union.  More than 2 million people died in the BSSR, and about 380 thousand were also removed from the country. The population living before the war was reached only by 1971.  Hitler's invaders destroyed 209 cities and regional centers, many of which had to be rebuilt, only 2.8 million square meters of housing remained from almost 10.8. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BSSR was created" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32931/786157.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Gaining Independence and Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In 1990, the Declaration on <span>State Sovereignty of the</span> BSSR was signed, which meant its imminent separation.  September 19, 1991 it became officially called the Republic of Belarus.  In the same year, an agreement was created and signed on the creation of the CIS.  The association included the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus.  An interesting fact in the history of this state is that for 46 years this republic, like the Ukrainian SSR, was one of the members of the UN (United Nations), although it remained a dependent state - the BSSR.  In the 1920-1930s, constitutionalism was developing in the republic. </p>
