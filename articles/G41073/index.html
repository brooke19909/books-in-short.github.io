It will take about a meter of leather lace to make one bracelet.  Let's start tying the figured knot.  Fold the lace in half, and then start one of its tails back, wrap the thread in front and now we push the working end into the hole formed by the first fold.  It remains to tie a knot at the end of each lace.  In order not to fit the bracelet on the arm, you can build a movable clasp from the rest of the leather lace. </p><h2>  Heart bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart bracelet" class="if uuid-2416477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416477.jpg"></div><p>  This bracelet is also universal.

To make a bracelet from threads, first choose the right material.  To make this bracelet, it is better to take simple natural threads, similar in structure to iris.  Each cut rope must be folded in half and attached to each end of the decorative pendants.  It can be ordinary thread tips, glass beads or a chain.  Now we start weaving.  We knit the upper edge of the threads and begin to weave the pigtail.  When 3 cm is ready, you need to wear a decorative heart on the central thread.  Such accessories can be metal, plastic, ceramic or wooden, decide for yourself.  Continue weaving and through the next 3 cm put on the heart again.  Such a decoration can have any design.

You can make a bracelet of thread with your own hands in this case.  You should use shiny beads.  You can find suitable beads or use metal balls.  And which threads to choose?  It is advisable to use something dense and natural.  Perfect iris.  And if there is nothing suitable, how to make a bracelet?  You can make a fashion accessory out of mouline thread.  But in this case, do not divide the threads into fibers, but use immediately 10 twisted threads.  Cut the material of your choice into 3 equal parts.  Now knit the threads at the base with a knot and start braiding.  When 4 cm of lace is ready, you can begin to insert decorative balls.  To do this, you need to string decor on each thread.  Balls should only be inserted in the center.  Weave the required length in this way, and then make the second part of the bracelet strap. </p><h2>  Simple accessory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple bracelet" class="if uuid-2416479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416479.jpg"></div><p>  And you can also make a friendship bracelet from threads.  It can be made even by a person who is far from needlework.  Many people endow red woolen threads with special sacred meaning.  Therefore, believers are often made of this material bracelets.  It is also customary to give such bracelets to people dear to their hearts.  That is why some may call this jewelry a symbol of friendship or a talisman.  To make a bracelet of red thread, you will need to string <span>metal beads</span> on a thick woolen thread <span>.</span>  Moreover, the decorative elements need to be selected rather small so that they walk tightly along the thread, and do not move freely around the bracelet.  If you want the beads to remain in your chosen position, you can fix them with knots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lonely Heart </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lonely Heart" class="if uuid-2416480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416480.jpg"></div><p>  Have you ever made jewelry?  Making a bracelet of thread for beginner needlewomen is not difficult.  Consider this option.  Despite the fact that it will not take you more than 20 minutes to make such an accessory, the bracelet will turn out spectacular.  And if you do it carefully, many acquaintances will not even believe that this is your first job.  How to create such beauty?  Take a long thick white thread, fold it in half, and then cut it.  Thread a metal heart of suitable size.  So that the resulting pendant does not travel along the ropes, you will need to fix it with a drop of glue.  Now you should decorate the ends of the ropes.  Attach small metal balls or metal cylinders to them.  These decorative elements should not be larger than the central heart.  The bracelet is ready.  In a similar technique, you can make a lot of jewelry, changing the color and shape of the fittings. </p><h2>  Chain bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet with chain" class="if uuid-2416485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416485.jpg"></div><p>  Such an ornament will simply be created from a dense thread and a large chain.  If you don‚Äôt like such massive jewelry, choose more fragile materials.  Believe me, it is very easy to make a bracelet from threads.  Take the thick rope first and cut it into two parts.  Now take a large chain of suitable length.  Insert the two ends of the same thread folded in half into the outer ring.  Now you need to fix the rope bracelet.  The two ends of the thread must be threaded into the loop formed in the front.  Similarly, you need to put the second thread on the opposite edge of the chain.  Now close both ends of the rope in the clasp.  The bracelet is ready.  To make the jewelry look even more stylish, put some pendant on the chain. </p><h2>  Leather shoelaces </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather laces" class="if uuid-2416488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416488.jpg"></div><p>  If you have old leather goods at home, do not throw them away.  They can be an excellent basis for crafts.  If you cut the skin into thin threads, you can make modern bracelets.  It will be easy to make such an accessory if you handle not only scissors well, but also with pliers.  What needs to be done?  In addition to leather threads, for making the accessory you will need an inscription bent from wire.  To create it, you need to draw a sketch, and then bend the wire along it.  It is advisable to take metal for needlework.  The red wire looks unpresentable.  When the inscription is ready, it will need to be attached to pre-cut threads.  If you do not have skin, you can replace it with a thick rope or an unassembled thread floss.  We attach the inscription to the front side of the rope, and you need to attach the lock to the back. </p><h2>  Large Bead Bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2416490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416490.jpg"></div><p>  Such an accessory is more suitable for a lady of about 40 than a young lady.  Although extravagant girls can afford to wear such a catchy decoration.  If you do not want to attract increased attention to your person, make a bracelet of light threads or use the classic black or white color scheme.  But if, on the contrary, you want to attract the views of others to your unusual style, then give preference to bright ropes.  How to make a bracelet?  We prepare the necessary threads for work.  We take 4 pieces and bend them in half.  Now weave a braid.  Gradually add threads to it.  Toward the center, your braid should already consist of 10 threads on each side.  Now we make a knot on half the threads and put a large bead on this part.  On the second side of the bead we also make a knot.  We try on a bracelet and cut the threads of the desired length.  We pack both ends of the bracelet in the fastener using pliers. </p><h2>  Braid with chain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chain braid" class="if uuid-2416491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2416491.jpg"></div><p>  An unusual and lightweight accessory can be obtained by combining the chain and threads.  To make this bracelet you will need a medium chain with slightly large links.  A thick thread should be threaded through them well.  Of the threads you need to give preference to those that are made from natural materials.  Then you will have confidence that the bracelet will not cause irritation and does not fade from time to time.  How to make an accessory?  Take a chain and tie three threads to one end of it.  Now we begin to weave a braid.  If the chain lies to your right of the braid, then you need to cling the threads to it whenever you are going to use the right thread.  Thus, you will evenly attach the chain to the bracelet.  If you want, you can sew another row of threads to the other end of the chain.  Or let the chain run along the two edges of the braid.  Choose the option you like best. </p><h2>  Amulet </h2><p>  And how to make a bracelet made of red thread?  As already mentioned above, most often for the manufacture of such decorations choose a red wool rope.  It symbolizes the blood of Christ and means a lot to pilgrims who traveled to Israel.  But if you do not have the opportunity to visit the sacred land, you can order such a thread on the Internet.  Even if you take an ordinary red thread, but in the process of creating a talisman you think only of good, then luck will definitely come to you.  If not thanks to the accessory, then thanks to the magical placebo effect. </p><p>  To make a charm bracelet from a thread, we proceed as follows.  On the red thread we string the balls.  In the middle we fix a large decorative element, and two smaller ones we fix with glue a centimeter from the center.  One ball will serve as a fastener, and two more will be attached at the ends of the threads. </p>
