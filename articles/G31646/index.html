All that is needed from beginner needlewomen is to stock up on yarn, scissors and pick up the right sized hook.  And, of course, carefully study the simple crochet crochet patterns presented in our article.  And then boldly get to work! </p><div class="photo" data-original="hobilendik.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple crochet crochet patterns" class="if uuid-2840883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2840883.jpg"></div><p>  In this article we tried to collect the easiest and at the same time beautiful options for creating flowers - chamomiles, roses, sakura and forget-me-nots.  We hope that with the help of our diagrams and detailed descriptions you will succeed! </p><h2>  Charming forget-me-not.  Description for beginners </h2><p>  Let's learn how to crochet the simplest flower - a cute forget-me-not.  It is quick and easy, and it looks very beautiful, gentle and romantic.  Having connected several flowers, a stalk and a leaf, you can use this composition as an unusual brooch. </p><p>  For work you will need: hook number 2 or number 2.5 and mercerized cotton yarn (180 m per 50 g) in three colors - blue, yellow and green.  Scissors, a needle and sewing threads are also useful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.melibondre.com" data-author=": Meli Bondre, "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet simple flower scheme 5" class="if uuid-2844563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2844563.jpg"></div><p>  We will work according to the following scheme.  We begin to crochet a simple flower with yellow yarn from four air loops (VP), which we close into the ring with a connecting column.  Perform 1 lifting loop.  We knit 10 single crochet (SB) in a ring.  We complete the row with a connecting loop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Attach the blue thread and make 1 VP.  We begin to knit the first petal.  In the base loop, we make 1 single crochet (SB), 1 single crochet (C1H) and 1 double crochet (C2H).  Half the petal is ready. </p><p>  In the next loop, we knit these three elements again, but in the reverse order, first one double crochet, then one double crochet and single crochet.  The first forget-me-not petal is ready. </p><p>  The remaining four are performed by analogy, repeating the rapport 1-11-12, 12-11-1.  We complete the row with a connecting loop, cut off and fasten the thread.  The first forget-me-not is ready!  According to this simple flower crochet pattern, we carry out two more of the same details for the future composition. </p><h2>  Keep knitting forget-me-not </h2><p>  Now we begin to make the stem and leaf.  Take the green yarn and knit ten air loops.  In the second loop from the end we make 1 half-crochet without a crochet.  Next, we perform another 8 half-columns.  Now we knit a chain of 8 VP.  Skipping the first loop, we knit 7 single crochets.  We make 18 air loops and 17 half crochets.  The stalk is ready. </p><p>  We begin to create a leaf.  We carry out a chain of 18 VP.  We skip the first two loops, make 16 single crochet and 3 VP, rotate.  We knit 3 double crochet stitches, 5 double crochet stitches, 4 double crochet stitches, 4 single crochet stitches, 1 stitch loop. </p><p>  In order to complete the second half of the leaflet, we turn the part with the initial chain up.  We make 4 single crochet, 4 half crochet, 5 double crochet, 3 double crochet and 3 VP.  We attach the sheet to the stem (connecting column), sew the forget-me-nots with the thread.  Delicate and romantic composition is ready!  Now you know how quickly and easily crocheted flowers are performed, the patterns are simple! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  With schemes and description we knit a beautiful daisy </h2><p>  We offer novice needlewomen a simple scheme of a beautiful flower.  Such a decorative element is well suited for decorating knitted children's products - hats, scarves, snoods or cardigans.  To do this, you will need to prepare hook number 2 and yarn in two colors - white and yellow, with a thread thickness of 250 m per 100 g. A simple crochet flower pattern is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers simple patterns with patterns" class="if uuid-2841274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2841274.jpg"></div><p>  We begin to work with a yellow thread.  We make 8 air loops (VP) and close them in a ring.  We perform 1 VP (for lifting), 1 single crochet and 2 VP.  Next, we knit 23 single crochet columns in the ring.  We close the row with a connecting loop.  We break off the thread and fix it.  Chamomile core is ready. </p><h2>  Knit the petals of a sunny flower </h2><p>  To create the petals, we attach a white thread to the air loop of the beginning of the first row.  We perform 7 EPs, two of which are necessary for lifting, and a petal will form out of five.  In the second loop from the end, we knit 1 single crochet.  In the next two loops of the chain, one double crochet.  In the fifth loop from the end, we perform 2 columns with one crochet.  Petal number 1 is ready.  We attach it to the core of the daisy: having skipped one loop, we perform a single crochet (we introduce a hook for both half loops). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The remaining 11 petals are knitted by analogy with the first.  We finish the row by fastening the first and last petals with a connecting loop.  Cut the thread and fasten.  Now you know the simple crochet flower pattern.  We hope you will have no difficulties in your work. </p><h2>  Sakura flower.  Delicate and beautiful element of decor </h2><p>  This simple and beautiful flower, even beginner needlewomen can perform quickly and easily.

The color of the threads can be white, light and dark pink or burgundy.  Also, scissors and a needle will come in handy. </p><p>  <span>The simple crochet flower scheme</span> is as follows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intheyarngarden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers with patterns simple and beautiful" class="if uuid-2841436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2841436.jpg"></div><p>  The center of the flower will be knitted with a burgundy thread.  We start work with the amigurumi ring.  We knit 5 single crochet into it and end with a connecting loop.  The second row begins with a lifting loop.  We knit 2 columns (single crochet) in each loop. <span>We</span> get <span>10 sc.</span>  <span>We close as usual - with a connecting loop.</span>  <span>The core of the sakura flower is ready.</span> </p><h2>  We carry out the third and fourth rows </h2><p>  To knit the petals, take a pink or white thread and attach it to the base.  We knit 1 single crochet and 1 single crochet in the first loop of the base.  In the second - first 1 double crochet and 1 single crochet.  Continue rapport to the end of the row, repeating 4 times.  Do not forget to close the row using the connecting loop. </p><p>  We knit the fourth, final row like this.  We carry out a chain of three VP, 4 double crochet, two in each loop of the base.  We knit 3 VP again and with the help of the connecting loop we attach it to the single crochet from the previous row.  In the interval between the columns we do 1 sc. </p><p>  The first petal of the sakura flower is ready, we perform four more.  Close the knitting, cut and fasten the thread.  That's all, our beautiful decorative element is ready!  To consolidate the skill, we perform several more of the same beautiful colors with a crochet.  Schemes with a description simplify the process and allow beginners to quickly master the technique! </p><h2>  Openwork crochet rose for beginners </h2><p>  A lush, voluminous rose can become a highlight of any wardrobe, a bright emphasis on everyday sweater, scarf, hat or an independent accessory - an original brooch or a beautiful hair clip.

Next, we type 4 more VPs.  In the fifth loop from the end, we perform a double crochet (hereinafter C1H).  We knit 1 VP.  We skip the loop and in the next we knit 1 S1N-1VP-1S1N.  Repeat the rapport to the end of the row.  We make an air loop and continue to knit in the opposite direction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flowers crochet patterns 1" class="if uuid-2842034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2842034.jpg"></div><p>  In the arch between the two columns of the previous row we knit 6 1, in the next loop we make the connecting column.  Repeat rapport 17 times.  In the next six arches we knit 5 1, then twice 4 1.  In the last arch of the row, we perform 3 columns with one crochet.
