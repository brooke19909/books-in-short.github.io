There is the possibility of two-way and one-way traffic.  The railway began to function in 1975, and in 1981 a highway already appeared.  The bridge ends in the city of Khabarovsk. </p><h2>  Technical miracle </h2><p>  The bridge across the Amur River <span>in Khabarovsk was</span> built between 1913 and 1916.  He had one way.  The author of the project was L. D. Proskuryakov.  It was planned to put the railway into operation. </p>

The bridge has nineteen supports of an intermediate type, the rest were built using caissons laid to a depth of 19.2 meters.  Nine of them were made using steel, and the rest - reinforced concrete and wood.

    <p>  The structures of the spans closer to the left bank have the shape of an arch and are accessible for riding.  G.P. Peredery, who planned their creation from reinforced concrete, became the designer of the hingeless arches.  Buildings on top are a composition of pillars and ballast trough.  The belt on top has a parabolic shape.  The foundations were solid, the supports were lined with granite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction near Komsomolsk-on-Amur </h2><p>  The construction of a bridge across the Amur was planned during the construction of the village of Komsomolsk-on-Amur in 1932, when it was necessary to connect the two river banks of the future Baikal-Amur Railway. </p><p>  Lengiprotransmost, the institute, was involved in the development of the project, from which a proposal was received that included three options for constructing a crossing.  According to one of them, it could be located within the city under construction, according to the second and third - in its line and a little lower. </p><p>  At that time, while the bridge across the Amur was still not working, citizens had to use the <span>ferry.</span>  When the railway began to function from Khabarovsk to Sovetskaya Gavan, railway-type ferries began to be used.  In winter, I had to specially freeze the ice and create a temporary path. </p><p>  In 1961, a river-type icebreaker was launched, which worked in winter and autumn.  With its help, it was possible to extend the navigation period.  However, this site still needed changes and development. </p>

    <h2>  From words to deeds </h2><p>  After long delays in 1969, they began to build a bridge over the Amur.  Construction work was completed in 1974.  The last element was one of the nine pillars on which the bridge rested.  The last structure of the span type was installed on September 26, 1975. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The opening was solemn, since this object is of great practical importance for all its users.  It became possible to cross the railways.  On the first day when this point began its work, a train carrying passengers passed along it.  The work of ferries, which had been used thirty years before, ended here. </p><p>  The design took into account the temporary load on the railway and road in the framework of the existing technical conditions and construction standards.  The structures that make up the bridge across the Amur were recreated by the forces of the Komsomolsk bridge squad belonging to the Mostostroy-8 trust. </p>

    <h2>  Hi-tech </h2><p>  The main support is made up of reinforced concrete structures that support spans, forming a single road for trains and cars on two lanes.  The territory intended for the passage of cars is on the brackets.  They are located in the lower side, when correlated with railway spans. </p><p>  A rather massive structure is a bridge over the Amur.  Its length is 1.4 thousand meters, while the height above sea level is 24 meters. </p><p>  When construction took place here between 1970 and 1971, the first and then unique method for creating supports was used for the USSR.  Distinctive is the use of columns standing on the foundation of reinforced concrete shells with a diameter of 3 m. This technique was drawn from the work of K. Silin, with the only difference being that they excluded the caisson foundation, usually used in the construction of large-sized objects filled with the Trans-Siberian Railway . </p><p>  To anchor the shell deep into the bedrock, reactive pipe drilling was used, which again became a unique experience of similar work with rocky soil. </p><p>  A special unit used in such drilling was involved in the work - RTB-600.  It consists of 3 pipelines, thanks to which the tool rotates and can destroy the rock.  Outwardly similar to cone bits. </p>

    <h2>  Fundamental </h2><p>  When the shells were submerged and reached the desired level, concrete was filled with a pipe moving vertically.  Then there was a union of structures using a reinforced concrete slab, <span>a sheet pile</span> type <span>fence was</span> used, to which supporting structures were attached.  Each shell reached 3 meters in diameter.  The total number of such elements is 304 units. </p><p>  Monolithic structures act as supporting devices.  Intermediate elements have granite lining and tapering at the top.  These were ice cutters with a sharp edge located vertically.  In these works, granite was used, which was mined in the Trakratninsky and Kiesovsky quarries. </p><h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  Not only an important transport, but also a military strategic object can be called a bridge across the Amur.  Photos of him are able to reflect the entire scale and fundamental nature of the design. </p><p>  On both banks there are wire fences, arranged in a couple of rows, with guard towers and bunkers.  By design, cyclists and pedestrians are not allowed to move.  On the left you can see the part where the military is working.  For training purposes, a miniature transition model was previously used there.  If you find yourself on a bridge at a time when the wind is especially strong, you can feel how the structure is swinging.  This is due to its impressive length. </p>

They can be called not just roads between the two banks, but also transitions from the past to the future in science.
