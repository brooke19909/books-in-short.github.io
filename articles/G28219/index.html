To begin with, we note the basic facts of his biography in order to understand the scale of his personality. </p><h2>  Biography Pages </h2><p>  On April 22, 1870, the long-awaited son appeared in the family of the school inspector <span>Ilya Ulyanov</span> .  Why did he choose such a pseudonym?  Historians claim that Lenin was not the only pseudonym for the leader of the world proletariat.  In fact, he used more than a hundred different fake names for the purpose of conspiracy: Meyer, Petrov, Frey, Old Man, Tulin. </p>

    <h2>  Alias ‚Äã‚ÄãFacts </h2><p>  But in history there is only a mention of only one surname.  <span>The Ulyanov family</span> was friends with the Lenin family living in St. Petersburg.  That is what played a role in Ulyanov‚Äôs choice of a pseudonym.  Lenins helped the young revolutionary lead political activity and hold meetings of revolutionaries. </p><p>  Since the beginning of the 20th century, the imperial authorities have been monitoring Vladimir Ulyanov; there was a real threat of his failure to leave the country. </p><p>  In 1900, one of the Lenins gave Ulyanov a foreign passport of his father, who at that time was mortally ill.  Then Ulyanov didn‚Äôt have to use fake documents, but he showed this passport to the owner of the printing house where the Zarya magazine was published.  After some time, it was the name of Lenin, Vladimir Ulyanov began to sign his articles and monographs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for the absence of children in the family </h2><p>  Why didn‚Äôt Lenin have children?  Some of his biographers believe that the leader of the world proletariat did not start offspring due to systematic congestion.  They are sure that Vladimir Ilyich was afraid that children could become his weak spot.  Through them pressure will be exerted. </p><p>  Arguing over why Lenin did not have children, historians note that one of the reasons can really be considered the fear of kidnapping, of causing harm to the leader of the proletariat through children.  Of course, they would become the subject of pressure on the communist government, revolutionary forces. </p><p>  Recently, historical documents have been found that partially explain why Lenin did not have children.  His wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, had serious problems with the reproductive organs.  Historians admit that she acquired an incurable disease due to emigration or during prolonged exile. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the gynecologist diagnosed her with genital infantilism, at that time there was no cure for this disease.  This partially explains why Lenin did not have children. </p>

    <h2>  Memories </h2><p>  Skeptics consider this version unreliable, and they explain their position by the fact that in a letter to mother-in-law Krupskaya notes that there are no problems with her health. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is likely that at that time, and the letter was sent in 1899, the wife of the leader of the world proletariat really believed that she was absolutely healthy.  There is also a position according to which Nadezhda did not want to upset her mother-in-law and talk about why Lenin did not have a child. </p><p>  The closest associates of Vladimir Ilyich repeatedly mentioned in their memoirs how seriously Lenin and his faithful companion lived in the absence of children.  For example, Zlata Lilina (wife of <span>Grigory Zinoviev)</span> wrote about how he played with her son, could carry a child on his shoulders for hours, and crawled along with him on the floor.  Given her recollections, the question of why Lenin <span>did not like children</span> is absolutely inappropriate. </p><p>  The Social Democrat Solomon Golddellman has repeatedly said that the couple envied those families in which they had children. </p>

    <h2>  Did the leader have other women </h2><p>  We continue the conversation about why Lenin did not have children.  <span>Little-known facts</span> indicate that he eschewed women, did not know how to behave with them.  Sister Olga noted that her friends, whom Volodya helped do homework, were afraid of her well-read and serious brother. </p><p>  Young Ulyanov avoided beautiful girls, for example, he simply ran away from his sister's girlfriend, not even trying to start a conversation with her. </p><p>  Reminiscences of his entourage were preserved, according to which Vladimir Ilyich showed sympathy for Apollinaria Yakubova, who visited him in prison.  After leaving prison at the gates of the colony, Apollinaria kissed the young revolutionary, and the next day, at a meeting of revolutionaries, Lenin accused Yakubova of anarchist views. </p><p>  After some time, Ulyanov handed the copper ring to Nadezhda Krupskaya, who was in prison, making her an offer in a similar way.  The wedding rings were made of a simple copper nickel. </p>

    <h2>  Was Lenin sick? </h2><p>  How did Lenin and Krupskaya live?  Why were there no children for this legendary couple?  There is reliable information that in childhood Volodya was ill with malaria and measles.  In Simbirsk, where the Ulyanov family lived, there were malaria mosquitoes under the floor of the house, it was they who caused the boy's illness.  Anna, Lenin‚Äôs sister, recalled that her parents seriously thought about moving to Italy or the Crimea, but the Ulyanovs did not have material opportunity. </p><p>  The optometrist Adamyuk repeatedly told the mother of the future leader that the boy does not see with his left eye.  The doctor discovered strange changes in the fundus, and therefore made such conclusions.  Only at a conscious age did the leader learn about his myopia. </p><h2>  Attitude to alcohol and smoking </h2><p>  Despite the rather poor health, Lenin at a young age tried to smoke.  He told his comrades-in-arms about how, after he had smoked the shag in the gymnasium, he became ill. </p><p>  During the period of Kazan exile, he tried to return to this bad habit, not listening to the entreaties of his mother.  Only after the parent reminded him that he was purchasing cigarettes on her retirement, Lenin lost interest in this bad habit.  After leaving for Munich, he began to abuse beer, he could sit for hours in a restaurant tasting new varieties of this drink. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin) is one of the few politicians who have virtually no autobiography.  Only one leaf was found in the archives in which he tried to describe part of his life, but the attempt was completed. </p><p>  For example, he never owned the phrase that any cook can manage the state.  He wrote that the laborer and cook are not able to rule the state.  There are suggestions that during training at the gymnasium, Ulyanov was friends with Alexander Kerensky.  The fact of their residence in one city is not disputed, but a significant difference in age could not contribute to such a tandem. </p><p>  By right, Vladimir Ulyanov can be considered the youngest lawyer in Russia.  At the age of 21, having passed exams externally, he became a lawyer. </p><p>  Lenin was an Orthodox Christian, he was married in a church.  Information about the fact that in 1905 the leader of the world proletariat met with priest Gapon and presented him with an autographed book is considered a little-known fact. </p><p>  Rumors are circulating about Lenin's relationship with <span>Inessa Armand.</span>  Until now, historians have no clear answer to this question.  But in the Krupskaya family album, the photographs of Inessa and Vladimir were on the same page. </p><p>  The last hope for the birth of children in Krupskaya and Lenin collapsed in Shushensky.  Krupskaya‚Äôs Bazedov‚Äôs disease led to a miscarriage, after which the couple could not have their own children. </p><p>  So far, doctors and historians have not found a clear answer to the question of why they did not have children.  Some believe that the cause was Krupskaya‚Äôs disease, while others are sure that Lenin could not have children. </p>
