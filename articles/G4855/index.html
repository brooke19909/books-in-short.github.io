They can be very thin and dense, connected from motives or in a single cloth.  Whatever option is chosen, it will not leave anyone indifferent.  It is easy to crochet a jumper.  The scheme and description most often goes along with the model, which means that it will not be difficult to link the product.  If the hand is full and the needlewoman is fluent in the hook, then the work will advance faster, but everything is achievable, and skill comes with experience.  Schemes, motives, their location are gradually remembered.  Over time, the needlewoman begins to determine the consumption of yarn by eye and which thread will look better in the finished product.  But this does not come immediately. </p><h2>  Simple crochet sweater </h2><p>  One of the simplest models is <span>a jumper knitted</span> from motifs called Grandma‚Äôs Square.  It is truly universal. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to its simplicity, even a beginner needlewoman can easily crochet a jumper.  The schemes and description are simple for him. </p><p>  Base - 6 air loops in the ring.  The first rad consists of four elements of three columns with crochets and three arches between them.  The second and subsequent rows consist of the same elements, but the columns fit in place of the arches.  As a result, you can tie a motive of any size.  Its versatility is that you can use all the remains of yarn, which is, including a thin thread, weaving it into the main thread to achieve interesting color effects.  Therefore, this model can serve as a good example of the appropriate consumption of working material.  Assembly of the product can be carried out either by stitching, or directly during operation.  Despite the fact that in the initial version the motives are located at an angle, their position can be changed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Noble color and unusual cut - this is the secret of success </h2><p>  Indeed, nothing gives such freedom in self-expression as crocheting.  The jumper presented below only seems complicated.  Its base is a simple canvas made of double crochet posts.  All uniqueness is in non-standard inserts.  Instead of the usual openwork elements here are simple chains of air loops.  Due to their location, they attract attention to the model itself and its carrier much stronger than standard jumpers. </p>

    <p>  This is an elementary psychology that allows even the simplest pattern to be presented in the best possible light.  Since these chains are the main decorative element, it makes sense to decorate them with beads or wooden beads with accessories.  This will make the finished product look like a store one, while adding completeness to the look. </p><h2>  Crochet green sweater: schemes and description </h2><p>  The first of the presented models was knitted from motifs, the second - with an integral canvas.  This model also fits in with motives.  For her, it is preferable to take a thin thread.  Such a women's crochet jumper is well suited for a cool summer evening or a warm spring day. </p>

    <p>  It is advisable to think of a cover for it, but you can do without it.  Unusual bottom of the product form motifs placed at an angle.  This visually makes the figure a little taller and slimmer, therefore it is recommended for short girls with an implicit waist.  This model has sleeves that extend to the bottom, which can be made longer or shorter.  Because of the peculiar silhouette, crochet a jumper is best worn with jeans and tight skirts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of motive </h2><p>  Despite the apparent complexity, the motive for this model is quite simple.  It is much simpler than the vast majority of options.  The first row is a traditional ring of eight loops, the second - 16 half columns.  The third - seven columns with one crochet, between which three loops.  The role of the eighth is performed by the lifting loops.  Fourth - five columns with one crochet in the arch, one loop over the crochet of the previous row.  The fifth is almost the same, but instead of one loop now five.  The sixth row completes the formation of the flower.  Over five columns, an element is knitted, which is five columns knitted with a common vertex. </p>

    <p>  After - five loops and a half-column in the third loop of the arch, again five loops and the repetition of the element.  The seventh row consists entirely of arches, including 5 loops in each.  The eighth and last row of the main motive forms its square shape.  In addition to arches and half columns, five columns with one crochet, a loop and again five columns are knotted in the corner parts.  This forms the corners of the motive. </p><h2>  Product assembly </h2><p>  There is no one way to put this crochet cardigan together.  The diagrams and description suggest that this will be done during operation.  The connection points are indicated on the motif diagram above by crosses.  The second option is stitching.  For this model, it can be used, since it is openwork, and the combination of high-quality thread in tone will also look good.  The main thing is to remember about fixing at the very beginning and at the very end of the work.  In order to prevent motifs from opening in the corners, the thread is selected so that the end of one and the beginning of the other fall not on the corner, but on the side. </p><h2>  Melange as an alternative to patterns </h2><p>  Melange thread and products from it always look unusual.  A crochet sweater, for knitting which used melange yarns, will always attract attention.  The pattern is not important here, due to the motley coloring of the finished product, minor flaws and blots are not so noticeable.  This means that melange is a good alternative for beginner needlewomen. </p>

    <p>  In order to crochet such a jumper, the scheme may not be needed.  Enough ready-made patterns and knowledge of how to fit an ordinary canvas from half columns, columns or columns with crochets.  The ability to do simple but beautiful things makes melange thread one of the most popular products in the respective stores.  Moreover, such a thread can be both thin and thick.  Even the motive connected from it will look completely different both in a single version and in the finished product.  Crochet a jumper can also be crocheted using the Irish lace technique, which in some ways resembles knitting from motifs. </p>
