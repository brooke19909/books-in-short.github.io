It is located on both sides of the Yenisei River, which divides the city into several areas: left-bank and right-bank.  Each has its own unique places of recreation and entertainment.  The historical center of the city (over 300 years) is well preserved.  Streets and avenues are now cultural and architectural heritage.  Here you can find old log houses with beautiful carved shutters, as well as massive stone buildings in which rich merchants previously lived. </p><h2>  Description of Krasnoyarsk </h2>

    <p>  The central part is small, it can be bypassed in just a couple of hours.  The specific geometry of this magnificent city will not allow tourists to get lost.  The streets are flat, very beautiful, with interesting buildings.  Newly arrived guests are wondering "where to go in Krasnoyarsk."  We must say right away that there are many places and attractions in the city for different tastes and abundance. </p><p>  The right bank is less saturated with cultural and entertainment facilities, unlike the left bank of the Yenisei.  Rather, it is the industrial part of the city, on which there is a <span>large Circus,</span> founded in 1964 and regularly hosting prominent artists in its arena.  A special attention was paid to the railway bridge, which received in 1900 at a competition in Paris a gold medal for perfect architectural performance and the Grand Prix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
