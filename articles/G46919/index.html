He lies on the Pearl River.  This is one of the largest cities in the Middle Kingdom.  He is considered many-sided, in connection with this he has several names, for example, Yang chen - the city of goats, or Sui chen - the city of rice ears. </p><p>  The metropolis is famous for its modern, avant-garde-style multi-storey buildings, some of which occupy the best hotels in Guangzhou.  Also noteworthy is the opera house, which resembles a sea stone and was designed by architect Zaha Hadid.  Every year, the city is visited by millions of foreigners, as well as residents of other regions of the country.  The purpose of the trip is different for everyone - tourism, business, shopping, etc. For their stay in the city there are various types of guest establishments - hostels, guest houses, hotel complexes, and, of course, representative offices of the world's best hotel chains - magnificent hotels in the center of Guangzhou.  In this article we will present you the best of them, but first we‚Äôll talk a little about the city itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Guangzhou" class="if uuid-2290123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290123.jpg"></div><h2>  Pearl of China on the Pearl River </h2><p>  Guangzhou after Beijing and Shanghai is the third largest and fourth largest city in the Middle Kingdom.  It was founded in the 8th century BC and is considered one of the oldest cities in the world.  Despite this, he managed to preserve his history, rich culture and unique flavor to the present day.  At the same time, Guangzhou is today an ultramodern commercial and industrial center of world significance.  According to history, it was from here, from the port of Guangzhou that the legendary Silk Road began.  True, in those days, the city was called differently - Canton. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical value </h2><p>  What attracts Guangzhou tourists?  Any guide will tell you that here in the city are concentrated more than 150 different attractions - natural and historical monuments.  The symbol of the city is a statue of five goats, which is located in the largest city park of Yuesu.  Other sights are located on its territory: the ancient observation tower, the Zhengheilou Museum, the obelisk in memory of the revolutionary, the first president of China, Sun Yat-sen, as well as a fragment of the unique city wall dating back to the Ming era.  In another beautiful park, Haichung is the oldest monastery in Guangzhou.  There are many other religious temples in the city, each of which is distinguished by an unprecedented beauty of architecture. </p><p>  For lovers of fauna there is an amazing night zoo in which, among other things, circus shows are organized.  Hotels in Guangzhou are especially crowded during the various festivals that the city is full of.  This is a flower festival (January 28), culinary, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnificent hotels in Guangzhou" class="if uuid-2290185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290185.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Guangzhou? </h2><p>  From Moscow you can get to Guangzhou by direct flight on the airliners of the Russian company Aeroflot, and with transfers - on the Turkish Airlines, Emirates and other carriers.  A two-way ticket costs about 24,000 rubles, and travel time with a direct flight is 9.5 hours.  You can get to Guangzhou from other cities of the Middle Kingdom, and Hong Kong is closest to it.  The city‚Äôs air gate is called Baiyun, one of the largest airports in South China.  From here, the city can be reached either by train, or by metro, or by bus or taxi.  By the way, as in the entire civilized world, hotels in China in Guangzhou are no exception, they provide tourists who have booked a room with a transfer from the airport to the hotel itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beaches of guangzhou </h2><p>  Is this city considered a seaside resort?  Unfortunately, no, but on the banks of the <span>Pearl River</span> there are even very good beaches, especially in the Lebanon area.  They have sun loungers with umbrellas, changing cabins, showers - in short, everything that relies on the beach.  If there were no showers, then here you can very well rest. </p><h2>  Guangzhou Hotels </h2><p>  Of the many thousands of tourists arriving daily in this metropolis, the majority stay in hotels.  There are many representatives of famous hotel chains in the city, many of which belong to the 5 * category.  These are Sheraton, Hilton, Shangri La, etc. However, three and four star hotels are quite comfortable and provide tourists with ideal conditions for a stay.  Prices in Guangzhou hotels are different and can vary from 100 to 1000 NCY and higher (1 yuan is ‚âà 9 rubles). </p><p>  In the days of international festivals, as well as during the celebration of the Chinese New Year, prices rise significantly, and then comes the ‚Äúdiscount period‚Äù.  Does the service in the hotels of this city comply with international standards?  One can safely answer this question: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù  In all respects, Guangzhou hotels can be considered the best in the entire region.  Since there is no central heating system in the city, each of them has its own autonomous station or split system.  A mandatory attribute of five-star hotels are spa centers.  Many of them are equipped with ultramodern conference rooms with business centers, which is why they often host various international conferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheaptickets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baiyun hotel" class="if uuid-2290142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290142.jpg"></div><h2>  Shangri-la hotel </h2><p>  This is one of the best five-star hotels in Guangzhou.  Its windows offer wonderful views of the Pearl River, as well as magnificent landscaped gardens.  ‚ÄúShangri-La‚Äù is perfect for stopping businessmen, as it is located within walking distance from the international conference center.  It can be reached from the airport in 40 minutes.  The interior of the hotel is made in a modern style, but with an oriental accent.  The rooms, regardless of category, have everything you need for a perfect holiday.  The internal structure of the hotel includes a well-equipped fitness center with a gym, a giant indoor pool, and another, outdoor, located in a landscaped garden.  There are tennis courts.  Shangri-La has several restaurants and caf√©-bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelscombined.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Shangri_La_Hotel_Guangzhou.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel &amp; quot; Shangri-La &amp; quot; in guangzhou" class="if uuid-2290135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290135.jpg"></div><h2>  Sheraton guangzhou </h2><p>  Another five-star hotel belonging to the famous Sheraton hotel chain can also be attributed to the best hotels in Gianzhou.  It is located in the very center of the city.  It has a superb spa, fitness club and outdoor pool.  The hotel rooms are simply magnificent both for leisure and for work, and in the public area there are many rooms for business negotiations, various conferences, seminars, etc. The hotel restaurant is known throughout the district for its delicious cuisine (mainly Chinese).  However, for lovers of European cuisine there is a restaurant Feast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fnetravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Hotel" class="if uuid-2290139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290139.jpg"></div><h2>  Baiyun hotel </h2><p>  But this 5 * hotel does not belong to any hotel chain, and nevertheless, here you can find the highest quality service.  The Baiyun Hotel in Guangzhou is located in the business center itself.  Within walking distance from it is the department store "Friendship".  This is a real paradise for shopping lovers, in the department store you can find boutiques of almost all famous world brands: Chanel, Dior, GUCCI, Versace, Fendi and others. Nearby you can find an incredible number of restaurants, as well as bars and nightclubs.  In a word, life around the hotel is in full swing, but the Baiyun Hotel itself is always quiet and calm, all thanks to its excellent soundproofing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viamichelin.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="three star apartments in Guangzhou" class="if uuid-2290169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290169.jpg"></div><h2>  Guangzhou Planet Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  And this hotel can be called the best among the four-star hotels in Guangzhou.  It is located on Zhanqian Street.  Buyers from all over the world love to come here, as the wholesale clothing market is located 500 meters from the hotel.  The interior of the Planet is very interesting, the theme of the universe, that is, space, is used.  The hotel is also convenient as a starting point for excursions to many attractions.  All rooms are well equipped and comfortable for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Each of the tourists will tell you that the ‚ÄúGuangzhou 4 * Planet Hotel‚Äù is just the perfect service, and it is in no way inferior to the five-star one.  At the same time, prices here are an order of magnitude lower than in high-class hotels. </p><h2>  Guangzhou Yi Long International Apartment (Pazhou Exhibition Center Branch) 3 * </h2><p>  I would also like to introduce you to one of the economical hotels in Gianzhou, which consists of self-catering apartments and bathrooms.  It is also located nearby (just 3.4 km) from the International Exhibition and Convention Center.  The hotel is very convenient for families, as each room consists of a bedroom, living room, kitchen and work areas.  The bathroom includes a hairdryer, towels, cosmetics and toiletries.  Despite the fact that this is a three-star hotel, room cleaning is carried out daily. </p><p>  Since the city has a shopping spree, and sometimes guests can buy a huge number of different things that can‚Äôt fit in the room, then the hotel has a left-luggage office (for a fee). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Planet Hotel in Guangzhou" class="if uuid-2290148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2290148.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the metropolis of Guangzhou you can find a huge variety of options for accommodating guests.  These are the most economical hostels, and guest houses, and hotels of various categories, including the first class.  Each of the tourists chooses according to their means and preferences.  However, it should be noted that, regardless of category, service in China is at a fairly high level. </p>
