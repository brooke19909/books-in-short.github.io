It is interesting in that it presents the most complete list of events in Russian history that are not found in other manuscript sources. </p><p>  In addition, the book contains information about neighboring peoples, which determined the interest of scientists in this code.  He had a great influence on the annals of our country, since it is the most complete among other similar works. </p><h2>  Introduction to Science </h2><p>  Nikon's chronicle became known to the general public thanks to the famous researcher V.N. Tatishchev, who used it when writing his main work on the history of Russia.  He gave a brief description of this most important monument, noting that it was brought to 1630 and signed by <span>Patriarch Nikon.</span> </p><p>  In the second half of the 18th century, the source was published by Shletser and Bashilov, who used the manuscript of their predecessor as a basis.  At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, a new publication was carried out, and new lists were brought in.  In pre-revolutionary historiography, the Nikon chronicle was studied very actively. </p>

    <p>  Scientists paid the main attention to the sources that served as the basis for its writing.  Interest in her did not fade in the Soviet era.  During this period, researchers also determined the time and place of its compilation, established the identity of the author, and also conducted a deep analysis of the socio-political situation of the era in which it arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the author and his views </h2><p>  The Nikon Chronicle was compiled on the initiative of Metropolitan Daniel, who held this post in 1522-1539.  He was fond of ancient literature, had access to ancient manuscripts and showed interest in all-Russian affairs.  In addition, he was interested in political history, supported the actions of Moscow rulers.  Therefore, the monument compiled under his leadership is imbued with a general Russian character, which determined its significance in socio-political thought. </p>

    <p>  At the center of listening to the compiler were many relevant and important problems of his time.  Among them, a prominent place was occupied by the question of the property status of the metropolis and the relationship of the spiritual and secular authorities.  In addition, Daniel was interested in the cooperation of Russia and Lithuania, as well as the history of his homeland - the Ryazan principality.  He also devoted a great place to the fight against heresy. </p><h2>  Sources </h2><p>  Nikon's chronicle, the origin of the name of which was connected with the name of the patriarch of the 17th century, was actually compiled in the previous century.  Tatishchev mistakenly suggested that this monument was compiled under Nikon, who owned one of the lists. </p><p>  The writing of the annals was based on novels, ancient legends, the lives of saints, folklore, as well as archival materials.  When writing the tex, the compilers drew on other annals, for example, Iosafovskaya, Novgorodskaya and many others.  We should not forget that a whole series of information of the monument in question is unique and has survived only in its composition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church issue </h2><p>  The most important issues of its time reflected the Nikon Chronicle.  The origin of the name of this monument is associated with a mistake made by Tatishchev at one time.  However, it has become so firmly entrenched in the scientific community that it is still preserved.  The manuscript compilers did an important processing of the material, the analysis of which allows us to understand what problems they were worried about. </p>

    <p>  The authors defended the property of the church.  The debate about whether monasteries should own land and other property was one of the most acute in medieval Russia.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the chronicle holds the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need to preserve the property status of the metropolis.  Nikon's chronicle, whose origin should be considered in the context of the era, holds the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need for a union of secular and spiritual power. </p><h2>  Themes of the Cathedral of 1531 </h2><p>  At this meeting very important questions were raised about the position and status of the church and monastery hierarchy, which was reflected in the monument under consideration.  One of the most controversial issues of the era is the issue of whether monasteries can own villages or not.  The monument claims that they have the right to own land plots.  This was the prevailing point of view at that time, which the princely power adhered to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another important question for that time about church life was the decisions of the Russian metropolitans without the sanction of Constantinople.  In the 15th century, the Russian church gained independence.  And therefore it was necessary to fix its new status.  In addition, heresies arose at this time, the struggle against which was very fierce.  Therefore, this topic is also reflected in the monument. </p><h2>  Editorial </h2><p>  Nikon's chronicle, whose names came from her lists, was subsequently supplemented by other materials of an official nature.  Processing the original was important.  She contributed both to the systematization of accumulated archival documents, and the development of socio-political thought.  The arch of Metropolitan Daniel was supplemented by the Resurrection Chronicle and the Chronicler of the beginning of the kingdom. </p>

    <p>  Thus the famous Patriarchal list appeared.  This new code was widely used primarily in church circles, where in the second half of the 16th century the famous Stepbook appeared - a work that tells about the rule of the Old Russian princes, the life of the metropolitans.  This monument is also interesting in that it is the first attempt to systematize Russian history. </p><h2>  New list </h2><p>  The most important source in medieval time is the Nikon Chronicle.  Briefly about this codebook, the following can be noted: this is a valuable manuscript, which formed the basis for the subsequent all-Russian annals of the 16-17th centuries.  Its original was kept in the Treasury order, which speaks of the importance that official authorities attached to it in the preparation of new codes. </p><p>  After some time, it was supplemented by the already mentioned materials.  Also, a part was added to it that told about the events that took place in 1556‚Äì1558.  Thus arose the famous list of Obolensky.  This is the most complete version of the original.  After some time, sheets were added to it that expanded the chronology of the narrative. </p><h2>  Impact on official historiography </h2><p>  The basis of the new princely vault of the second half of the 16th century was again the Nikon Chronicle.  Oprichnina became the time of the formation of a new ideology.  Ivan the Terrible sought to explain the autocratic nature of imperial power.  Therefore, under him, active work began on the creation of literary works substantiating this idea. </p>

    <p>  In the years 1568-1576, the compilation of a large new vault, called Litsov, began in the <span>Alexandrov settlement</span> .  It reflected the events of both world and domestic history.  It was decorated with miniatures, as the narration was conducted "in person".  Nikon's chronicle, the contents of which corresponded to the plan of the tsar and the compilers of the new monument, was used in its writing.  After <span>this, the manuscript</span> was handed over to the Trinity-Sergius Monastery, where it was stored until 1637. </p><h2>  Further processing </h2><p>  In that year, the vault was sent to the order of the Grand Palace.  Therefore, a copy was specially made for the monastery from the manuscript.  She formed the basis of another list, which was supplemented by materials.  Subsequently, he continued the story based on the official monument of the 17th century Russian socio-political soap - the Chronicler of New.  This new edition has retained several listings.  One of them belonged to Patriarch Nikon, whose name gave the name to the whole monument. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The most important events in Russian history were reflected in the Nikon Chronicle.  The summary of this monument can be described as follows: this manuscript sets forth events from the 9th to the 16th centuries. </p>

    <p>  At the beginning a monument of church character was placed: a list of bishops.  Next is a chronological weather account of the incidents.  Sections describing the 12th century are consecrated in more detail than those devoted to other centuries.  Additional texts are added to the original, telling about the history of the 16th century, in particular about the reign of Ivan the Terrible. </p><h2>  Continuation </h2><p>  Nikon's chronicle, whose composition is complex due to several editorial processing, has additional inserts.  They also deserve attention.  Separately, mention should be made of fragments of the Royal Book, from which a description of the incidents from 1533-1553 was taken.  This monument is an important part of the <span>Personal Code,</span> which pursues the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe autocratic power of the ruler. </p><p>  The mentioned fragment is especially interesting because Ivan the Terrible himself worked on its content.  The ruler was particularly interested in justifying the ideologically unlimited power of the monarch.  It is also worth mentioning separately such a monument as the tale of the life of his son and heir. </p>

    <p>  This manuscript describes the <span>reign of Fedor Ivanovich.</span>  The author notes that he was very devout and spent most of his time in prayer and fasting.  From this monument looms the image of the new ruler - a quiet and meek man.  Also in the source there is news of her one important event from church life - the establishment of the patriarchate in Russia.  The head of the Russian church was Job, who wrote the story.  In it, he also gave a laudatory characterization to Boris Godunov.  He also described the king‚Äôs campaign in Ivan the city. </p><h2>  Tales </h2><p>  A number of interesting literary works are attached to the Nikon Chronicle.  Some of them are devoted to religious topics, the other to battles and battles from domestic and world history.  One of them is about the capture of Constantinople in 1204.  This is an event that shocked the consciousness of contemporaries. </p><p>  Another story tells about the struggle of the Russian princes for the main, Vladimir throne.  Several works are devoted to the fight against the Mongol-Tatars, Swedes.  Some tell of the fate of princes, boyars, metropolitans.  Also included in the vault were the lives of the saints, stories from the life of rulers and famous people of medieval time. </p><h2>  Additions </h2><p>  In addition to these monuments, in the annals there are more detailed descriptions of some political events.  Separately, we should mention the story of the <span>wedding of Ivan the Terrible to the kingdom.</span>  This is a very important fragment, because it tells of one of the most significant events in Russian history - the adoption by the ruler of the royal title. </p><p>  Taking into account the fact that the chronicle was in the center of attention of Ivan Vasilievich, who used its text to substantiate the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe autocratic monarchy, it should be noted that the insertion of such a story was of great ideological significance.  It is also necessary to mention the story of the capture of Kazan - one of the key events in the history of his reign. </p><p>  However, the Nikon Chronicle does not contain a number of important texts that can be found in other monuments.  For example, in the manuscript under consideration there is no ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù - an important legislative document.  Nevertheless, this code is the most important source of all-Russian character.  He had a great influence on socio-political thought of the 16-17th centuries. </p>
