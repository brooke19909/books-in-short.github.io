But surely everyone has a cell phone, which for some time can replace a computer.  How to set up Beeline mobile Internet will be described below. </p><p>  First, make sure that you can connect to the network from your mobile device.  On very outdated and primitive models, this is not possible.  Once in the menu, find the <span>"Internet"</span> icon <span>("Internet Connection"</span> , etc.). </p><p>  <strong>How to <span>set up the Internet</span> on Beeline: call the operator</strong> </p><p>  As a rule, a service such as GPRS Internet is already connected by default when an operator registers a new subscriber (that is, when buying and activating a SIM card).  In the same case, if during the operation of the phone you accidentally disconnected it, you should do so.  Call 0611 Beeline technical support and select "Mobile Internet settings" in the voice menu.  Then follow the instructions of an automatic technician.  If you prefer to communicate with a live assistant, then wait until you are connected to the operator.  Say that you want to know how to set up Beeline Internet for your phone model (write it down on paper in advance).  Subsequently, an SMS with the appropriate settings will come to your number, which you just need to activate. </p><p>  <strong><span>How to set up the Internet</span> on Beeline: go to the site</strong> </p><p>  Go to the official website of your operator (in this case, www.beeline.ru).  On the resource you can find detailed information on setting up WAP- or GPRS-Internet.  Here, immediately familiarize yourself with the various rates that correspond to a particular tariff, and choose the one that will best suit your needs (usually, a subsequent transition from one tariff to another is provided to subscribers for a fee).  Go to "My Account" by entering your phone number and receiving a password code via SMS.  In the menu "Service Management" select "Internet" and activate the appropriate tariff. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>How to set up the Internet on Beeline: we act manually</strong> </p><p>  If the settings that were supposed to come to you in SMS from the operator, for some reason, were not automatically set (for example, a "gray" phone, etc.), then proceed as follows.  In the menu of your <span>mobile phone, select</span> "Settings", then "Wireless Networks" and "Mobile Communications".  It is possible that in the pop-up list you will find a Beeline-Internet entry, which then simply needs to be activated. </p><p>  If you could not find the right one, you will have to act manually.  To do this, select "New Entry" and give it an arbitrary name.  So that later there is no confusion, call it simply "Beeline."  In the menu, select "New Access Point" (APN) and type "internet.beeline.ru".  You will then be asked to provide <span>a username</span> ("beeline") and a password ("beeline"). </p><p>  After you have entered all the necessary data, make sure that mobile data transfer is enabled in the settings.  If the Internet connection fails, check the balance of your phone, and then turn off and on your mobile device. </p><p>  <strong>How to set up Internet on Beeline: download a browser</strong> </p><p>  Logging into the network on the phone, as well as on the computer, is carried out using a browser.  In some phone models it is already installed by the manufacturer, in others - you must download it yourself from the Internet first to a computer, and then transfer it to a mobile one. </p><p>  Select and download one of the special mobile browsers to your computer.  Insert the software disk that relied on the mobile phone into the drive and download the necessary drivers that will allow the device to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the phone.  Then, using the data cable, connect the mobile phone and copy the downloaded browser into its memory. </p>
