Despite its uniqueness, a metal detector is the dream of many people.  Most try to purchase such equipment, but you can do it yourself.  Detailed terminator 3 metal detector instructions and diagrams are offered by many specialized forums.  Look for this information in this article. </p><h2>  Metal detector "Terminator 3" </h2><p>  This model of a metal detector is considered by many to be one of the most popular.  The developers of the device are users of one of the forums on the Internet. </p><p>  It is worth noting immediately that assembling a metal detector according to detailed instructions will be very difficult for those who have never before been interested in and have not used such equipment.  It will be really difficult to carry out such work, but do not be afraid: it‚Äôs enough to carefully prepare for the process and collect all the necessary details and elements. </p>

    <h2>  Metal detector circuit </h2><p>  In its design, the Terminator 3 metal detector is a standard coin box that has undergone some changes that allowed it to detect gold and ignore other non-ferrous metals.  When using a circuit with a special ‚Äúall metals‚Äù mode, the device can search for any scrap metal.  The standard scheme allows the metal detector to search for coins, nothing more. </p><p>  The non-standard application of logic as an op-amp is the basis of a metal detector circuit.  The disadvantage of this is unnecessary noise and unknown KU of all microcircuits.  Of course, it is possible to use domestic logic to create the device, but this threatens with too much variation in the parameters.  It is possible to reduce damage and avoid additional problems by replacing the sound chip with a domestic analogue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Metal detector cost </h2><p>  The price of the Terminator metal detector is in the middle range.  If compared with similar devices of the same category, then ‚ÄúTerminator 3‚Äù bypasses them in such parameters as the accuracy of identification of the object and the depth of the search.  Cheaper analogues are significantly inferior to "Terminator 3" in all respects. </p>

    <h2>  Metal detector setup </h2><p>  On the metal detector circuit, certain nodes are marked, which are taken into account, since during further assembly it will be necessary to focus on them.  It may also be needed during the metal detector setup process. </p><p>  The emission of current oscillations by the generator is carried out after connecting the transmitting coil to it.  Such oscillations come out of the MC1 chip in the form of a meander. </p><p>  The current induced by the TX and creating the field is transmitted through the receiving coil.  The search coil is balanced with TX along the generated field: in other words, the RX field is subtracted from the TX field.  For this purpose, a compensation coil CX is used.  Depending on the sensors, its presentation changes: in the case of the DD CX sensor, the coil is virtual, in the ‚ÄúRING‚Äù sensor the CX is real.  It is connected in such a way that the direction of current flow in it is opposite to the receiving coil.  The balancing of RX and TX is achieved by rewinding from the compensation coil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The oscilloscope controls the balance, due to which the minimum amplitude is set in all positions of the handle.  One end of the compensation coil goes to the production of the tuning loop, which is activated after the amplitude reaches a certain point at which it begins to grow again.  TX and RX must be pre-tuned in frequency, while TX should be higher than RX by 100 Hz.  You can tune all the coils to the desired frequency by connecting them to the Terminator 3 metal detector generator and the oscilloscope. </p><p>  You do not need to tune the CX in frequency.  When a metal object appears under the sensor, the balance is disturbed, which provokes the current entering the RX, which is then fed to the preamplifier and a synchrodetector, which captures the phases of the incoming signal and outputs them to the amplification channels.  In the latter, all the obtained parameters are amplified and fed to the comparator MC8, which compares the received signal levels and activates the sound generator. </p><p>  The principle of operation of almost all metal detectors is similar to each other, with the exception of some nuances.  In most cases, they affect the detuning of the device from the ground.  In the case of the Terminator M metal detector, phase detuning. </p>

    <h2>  Checking the instrument board </h2><p>  After soldering all the parts of the circuit, the metal detector printed circuit boards are checked.  This is done in order to verify the quality of the solder circuit and its performance. </p><p>  Verification is performed as follows: </p><ul data-id="6c89b1d7b8b35"><li>  The printed circuit board of the metal detector is thoroughly washed out from traces of flux left after soldering.  It is advisable to remove all residues, since in the future they can cause breakdowns and malfunctions. </li><li>  The board power is turned on without activating the sensor. </li><li>  The sensitivity knob is twisted until a steady sound signal appears from the speaker. </li><li>  To interrupt the speaker signal, just touch the sensor connector with your finger.  Interruption of the emitted sound when touched indicates that the metal detector board has been soldered correctly. </li><li>  After turning on the power, the LED blinks and goes off.  When the power is turned off, the diode lights up and gradually fades. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Battery Discharge Indication </h2><p>  When the battery is discharged, the metal detector emits sound signals at regular time intervals.  This is accompanied by continuous burning of the LED and a sharp decrease in the sensitivity of the sensors. </p><p>  The frequency settings of the detector are made using the cable with which the device will be used in the future.  The cable length remains unchanged after making all the necessary frequency settings. </p><h2>  Metal Detector "Terminator Trio" </h2><p>  "Terminator Trio" - a two-tone metal detector, equipped with a DD-coil with dimensions of 250 x 300 mm.  It is equipped with four settings modes - "Sensitivity", "Volume", "Discrimination" and "Ground Balance" - and a switch between non-ferrous and non-ferrous metals. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The advantage of the Terminator Trio metal detector is the confident identification of non-ferrous metal objects.  The device finds non-ferrous metal in 85% of all operations, the remaining 15% falls on iron and rusty objects. </p><p>  Another plus is the absence of false positives.  Many analogs react to the edges of dug holes, grass stems or small wires, than the Terminator Trio does not sin. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The only minus of the metal detector is a poor definition of rusty iron.  In almost all situations when the device gives a dirty signal, that is, mixing black with an admixture of color or, conversely, color with an admixture of black, there is a rusty metal object. </p><p>  Of course, this drawback can simply be ignored, but there is a chance of losing some of the finds due to an incorrect signal.  You can only distinguish between a clear color signal and a dirty signal when gaining experience with a metal detector. </p><h2>  Search depth </h2><p>  Feedback from users on the Terminator suggests that the maximum search depth of a metal detector exceeds that of another model - Asi 250 with a standard coil.  Despite such assurances, in practice it turns out that according to this criterion, ‚ÄúTerminator‚Äù is equal to ‚ÄúAsa‚Äù.  When searching in the air for 50 Ukrainian kopecks, the detection depth is 32 centimeters, while the search on the soil of the same coin is limited to 26‚Äì28 centimeters with reduced sensitivity.  Basically, a metal detector allows you to detect objects at a depth of no more than the bayonet of a shovel, which, however, can be a very good indicator for such a device. </p><p>  The Terminator Trio metal detector cannot be attributed to devices that can start searching immediately after switching on.  The cost of the device is several times less than the cost of the new ACE 250 model, but the Terminator is more suitable for those searchers who want to try their hand at instrument search. </p>
