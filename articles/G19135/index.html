There is no fuss and noise, dust and big roads, and all that surrounds is snow-white hot sand, warm waves of the turquoise Indian Ocean and the sun that shines brightly over the islands all year round.  Nevertheless, in different months the temperature regime and the amount of precipitation here are somewhat different.  In the article we will tell you about what the Maldives will face in August and what you need to consider when going here in the last summer month. </p><h2>  What are they, Maldives? </h2><p>  The Maldives is a huge archipelago that spans the waters of the <span>Indian Ocean.</span>  Within it, there are over 1100 atoll islands, which, like small and large paradise oases, are scattered in the vast blue waters.  Local residents are immigrants from various <span>countries of the Middle East</span> who brought here culture, traditions and customs.  Therefore, the <span>Republic of Maldives,</span> although it is an autonomous state with its own individual attributes, is very multifaceted and interesting.  It mainly professes Islam, although Buddhists are rarely found.  It is also important to know that this state has a very small population.  The overwhelming majority of people who are here are tourists who, regardless of the time of year, come to the islands and stay in expensive hotels and cottages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives in august" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/476561.jpg" width="577"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  August weather conditions </h2><p>  As in Moscow, the weather in the Maldives in August is very humid and rainy.  It is at this time that the maximum amount of precipitation falls, which is why the air itself becomes filled with moisture.  Nevertheless, the Maldivian rains do not last long - no more than half an hour, and immediately after the rain subsides, the southern sun begins to bake again.  With all this, the air on the coast of the islands warms up to 32-34 degrees, and the temperature of the sea waves reaches 28 degrees Celsius.  Note that the Maldives in August is also characterized by increased windiness.  Then in the evening a very cool breeze can rise, which will force you to put on a blouse.  In the daytime, the street is always hot and even a little stuffy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Maldives" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/476559.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water activities in the Maldives in August </h2><p>  Due to the fact that at the end of summer on the islands the weather becomes completely unpredictable, but at the same time warm, a huge number of divers and windsurfers come here.  You can also do one of these sports by renting all the necessary equipment at your hotel.  Also, having ordered the services of an instructor at a very reasonable price, you can master one of the water sports and get a lot of new experiences.  Another common activity in the Maldives is snorkeling.  If you are afraid to dive under water with balloons, then diving at shallow depths will be a very exciting experience for you.  And, of course, <span>water skiing,</span> parachuting and other extreme entertainment are popular here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives in august prices" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/476560.jpg" width="600"></div>

Both resorts have a very developed infrastructure, full service and high quality service.  Here, almost all year round, people are engaged in windsurfing, parachuting and <span>speedboating</span> and <span>jet skiing.</span>  Also in this tourist center you can always rent a helicopter and go on it on a tour, during which to see all the sights of the area.  In addition, it is from Male that the paths to various other resorts of the state lie, among which there is a completely unexplored exotic: deserted, <span>uninhabited islands.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in the maldives in august" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/476557.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Desert surrounded by ocean </h2><p>  The atoll called Baa includes fifty islands, but only fifteen are equipped for a good rest.  The resort is famous for the fact that there is no fuss, there is no huge influx of tourists.  Everyone who comes here settles in their bungalows and cottages, and rest in the areas allotted to them personally for the ocean.  Here you can also rent a boat and go to one of the uninhabited islands to fully enjoy the peace and quiet.  However, do not forget that in August the Maldives can "please" all its guests with rains.  Therefore, review the forecast in advance, and then poison yourself where the roof is - the sky is blue. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  An amazing archipelago surrounded by the Indian Ocean can please every tourist with the variety of its services.  There is everything from standard surf schools to underwater fishing and feeding stingrays.  Therefore, a surefire way to relax and use the saved up money is to travel to the Maldives in August.  Prices for tours at the end of summer will be very affordable for everyone.  For 10 days of being here, you will pay something in the range of 50-70 thousand rubles, taking into account the flight from Moscow and insurance. </p>
