    <p>  <span>Civil war in Russia:</span> briefly about the reasons </p><p>  So, large-scale armed conflicts in the territory of one country cannot arise for no reason.  Be sure to have any prerequisites for this.  Firstly, the contradictions in the country have intensified sharply due to the fact that the Bolsheviks came to power.  Secondly, a covert but large-scale intervention was carried out.  Thirdly, the outcome of World War I ‚Äî the Brest Peace shameful for the country ‚Äî provoked dissatisfaction not only with the authorities, but also with the majority of the population.  Fourth, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and the collapse of all people's hopes.  Fifth, the tough economic policy of the Bolsheviks.  Thus, the period of the Civil War in Russia was caused by complex phenomena.  Moreover, they influenced all spheres of society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="period of the civil war in Russia" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218564.jpg" width="250"></div>

Firstly, they are red.  These were the followers of the Bolsheviks, workers and soldiers, as well as people who were inclined to their side by force and at the risk of death.  They, with the help of violence and terror, made the majority speak for them, and, as the result shows, they did it very successfully.  Secondly, this is a white movement.  It was the Russian aristocracy, the followers of conservatism and tsarism: admirals and generals of the Russian army.  This movement formed in the south of the country in the fall of 1917.  Thirdly, the so-called green peasant movements, which consisted of simple peasants who fought for their own interests and often supported one of the parties. </p><p>  Civil war in Russia: briefly on the course of action </p><p>  As mentioned above, the Reds (or Bolsheviks) carried out their policies in the country with the help of terror.  Later it was such a strict discipline that would lead them to victory.  What has been done over this period?  Denote the most striking events.  Undoubtedly, the execution of the royal family is in the first place.  Thus the Reds wanted to show that tsarism was over once and for all.  Also, one cannot help but recall <span>war communism</span> with its surplus-appropriation service and <span>universal labor service.</span>  Another significant event is the rout of the <span>armies of the white</span> generals: one by one the young red commanders won. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia after the civil war" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218565.jpg" width="454"></div>

    <p>  As for the reasons for the victory of the Reds, the following points can be noted here: </p><ul><li>  Control of the central part of the country. </li><li>  Tough discipline. </li></ul><p>  Of course, after the Civil War, Russia became a weakened state, but we know that in a few years it will be this country (already the USSR) that will become the world leader in all industries. </p>
