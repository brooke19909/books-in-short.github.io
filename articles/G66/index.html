History of Mount Arafat</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What kind of associations do most people have when they hear the word ‚ÄúArafat‚Äù?  Right!  Before my eyes immediately appears the image of one of the most famous and radical politicians of the second half of the last century - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.  But few people know that this is the name of the <span>sacred mountain,</span> where once a year Muslim pilgrims from all over the world gather in order to perform the hajj.  From this article you will learn the history of the shrine, as well as how the Prophet Muhammad and Mount Arafat are related. </p><h2>  Ancient legend </h2><p>  The Qur'an says that when Eve (Havva) and Adam, yielding to the temptation of Satan, were expelled from paradise, they wandered for a long time on the earth, experiencing all kinds of sorrows and sorrows.  They lost not only God's mercies, but also each other.  Their complete loneliness and confusion continued until they realized the essence of the sin they had committed and sincerely repented.  Adam and Eve, having received forgiveness, met on a plain in the middle of which was a small hill of Jabal ar-Rahma, or Mount Arafat.  Where is this place so revered by all Muslims, read on. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Twenty kilometers northeast of <span>Mecca (Saudi Arabia)</span> is the Arafat Valley.  Its length is about 11, and the width is 6.5 km.  In the middle of the valley rises the 70-meter Arafat Mountain.  The height, albeit small, but in these places it is considered quite serious, since all the surrounding area is clearly visible from here.  That is why this hill was called the Arabic word "arafa", which means "to get to know", "to know" (meaning the area). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the north side, the Arafat valley borders a mountain range.  Therefore, in order to get here, pilgrims need to go through a gorge called Mazamayn. </p>

    <h2>  Arafat Day </h2><p>  It is the most memorable of all days of Allah.  Believers who do good deeds during these hours will be rewarded many times.  At the same time, the weight of the committed sins will also increase several times.  To atone for them, believers stand on the mountain from dawn to sunset, begging for their sins.  In Saudi Arabia, they are sure that such mass rites, as well as Mount Arafat itself (photos of it are brought to your attention) should be visible even from space. </p><p>  Muslims believe that aspiring to Allah with all their hearts and committing pious deeds, they will certainly be rewarded for them on Judgment Day.  One of the most significant actions that bring believers as close as possible to Allah is considered strict fasting on the day of Arafat.  According to legend, when the prophet was asked about this, he replied that such a refusal to eat is the cleansing of sins for both the previous and the next year. </p>

    <h2>  Last sermon </h2><p>  As you know, Mount Arafat, whose history goes back to ancient times, is extremely revered by Muslims.  It was here that the Prophet Muhammad delivered the words of his last sermon.  In it, he addressed not only his followers, but also to humanity as a whole.  The Prophet urged all people to accept Islam as the only correct teaching.  In addition, Muhammad summed up the results of his life on earth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The last sermon was built on the dogmas of the holiness of human life and property.  In this regard, the exploitation of people and usury was prohibited, and the rights and obligations of Muslim women were also determined.  According to them, the husband is obliged to patronize his wife and control her behavior.  As we see, there can be no talk of any equality between men and women in this religion. </p>

    <h2>  The Five Pillars of Islam </h2><p>  Muhammad himself listed them.  These include 5 daily prayers (namaz), worship only before Allah (shahada), giving alms (zakat), obligatory fasting in the <span>month of Ramadan,</span> and finally a pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).  After this, Muhammad proclaimed the equality that should be between all Muslims, regardless of their skin color and nationality, since the ancestors of the entire human race are Adam and Eve. </p><p>  Mount Arafat also witnessed Muhammad declaring that he is the last of the prophets of Allah and others will never be again.  Muslims inherited the Qur'an and the Sunna from him.  The latter recorded examples from the life of the prophet himself.  According to him, the path of righteousness consisted only in strict adherence to the dogmas of the Koran and Sunnah. </p><p>  Muhammad delivered his last sermon in 632 on the 9th day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar, called Zul-Hija.  On this day they make a hajj - pilgrimage to Mecca.  Ritual standing on Mount Arafat is the end of the pilgrimage of believers. </p>

    <h2>  Final rite </h2><p>  The last day of the Hajj begins with the fact that the whole valley is filled with pilgrims awaiting sermon.  The action takes place at noon.  Mount Arafat itself is decorated with a minaret.  60 steps lead to it, cut right in the rock.  On the last of them a flat platform was made, from which the sermon was delivered. </p><p>  As mentioned above, standing on the holy Mount Arafat is considered the end of the hajj.  At the end of the sermon, at sunset, all the pilgrims rush to return to Mecca.  Along the way, in the Mina Valley, another ritual is carried out, during which every believer must throw 7 stones.  These actions symbolize the beating of Satan.  The first who committed it was the prophet himself.  It happened just on the day of Muhammad‚Äôs farewell sermon. </p><p>  Mount Arafat is a sacred place for believers.  Therefore, it is not surprising that millions of pilgrims seek to get here.  In this regard, it is worth noting that this place is considered the most dangerous of all where the Hajj events take place.  Unfortunately, over the past few years, due to the poor organization of the festivities, strong crowds have repeatedly appeared here, which invariably led to numerous victims. </p>
