    <h2>  Pavel Alexandrov </h2><p>  The future scientist was born in the city of Bogorodsk, today - Noginsk.  He was educated at the gymnasium, where he immediately began to show a penchant for mathematics, which he became interested in under the influence of the teacher Alexander Eiges.  Once a teacher told schoolchildren about Lobachevsky and young Aleksandrov immediately decided to take up geometry.  In search of knowledge, he entered a university in Moscow.  There, he began to study the ‚Äúcontinuum problem,‚Äù but unsuccessful attempts for a while disappointed him.  However, the problem was not solved even by other famous <span>scientists of mathematics.</span>  Aleksandrov was carried away by the world of pedagogy for a couple of years, but then he again returned to his beloved science.  He laid the fundamental foundations of abstract topology - his scientific works serve as a basis for specialists around the world.  In addition, for thirty years Aleksandrov headed the mathematical society, which published a journal with the latest discoveries.  His achievements are recognized by other countries - Paul was elected an honorary member of the Gottingen, American and Berlin Academies of Sciences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Russian mathematicians" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758397.jpg" width="374"></div>

In a completely different way, everything happened to <span>Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov.</span>  He managed to prove <span>the Goldbach problem</span> and at one moment become famous.  According to the theorem, starting beyond a certain value, any <span>odd number</span> is the sum of three prime numbers.  In addition, from the calculations of Vinogradov, you can understand that there is a solution for even ones.  Such numbers represent the sum of four primes.  What is interesting: Goldbach did not even raise this question.  Vinogradov also owns about one hundred and twenty scientific works.  They made him a real star, bringing him such glory that not all great mathematicians can boast.  The history of mathematics preserves his memory as an outstanding scientist and honorary member of scientific societies and academies around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great mathematicians of Russia" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758400.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <h2>  Mstislav Keldysh </h2><p>  Many great mathematicians in Russia showed their amazing abilities at a fairly early age.  So Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh - he received the title of academician already in 35 years.  Such achievements are quite expected - the scientist was distinguished by incredible ability to work and real talent.  By the age of 16, he graduated from high school and decided to enter the <span>Physics and Mathematics Department of</span> Moscow <span>State</span> University.  After training, he went to aviation, where for four years he completed a number of important scientific experiments and received <span>a degree.</span>  Keldysh earned several State Prizes for his achievements in the field of aircraft engineering.  He was able to calculate ways to eliminate the vibration in the wings and wheels during a run, take-off and landing.  Based on his calculations, a speed boat was created.  In addition, Keldysh made important observations in computational mathematics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous mathematicians of Russia" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758404.jpg" width="345"></div>

Sophia Kovalevskaya is the most famous scientist in the country.  Since childhood, she was not like other children, preferring thoughts to all entertainments.  She decided to study mathematics, in order to understand other secrets of the universe with her help.  The wall of Sofia‚Äôs children's room was covered with sheets of a textbook by Ostrogradsky, who was the first to introduce the girl to the world of science.  Then she began to study Professor Tyrtov‚Äôs book, with the help of which she learned the basics of physics and trigonometry.  Thus began her path to science, but at home it was impossible to get an appropriate education for a woman, and she went abroad to Berlin.  Scientific works brought Sophia a doctorate in philosophy, she made a number of outstanding discoveries and became a celebrity around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gallery of Great Mathematicians" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758406.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  Andrey Kolmogorov </h2><p>  The gallery of great mathematicians cannot be complete without this scientist.  He became the first representative of cybernetics, created world-famous works that apply scientific analysis to literary works.  He began to study mathematics at the university, in addition, he wrote various works on philosophy and logic.  Kolmogorov's contribution to cybernetics was noted not only at home, but also abroad - he was accepted at the Polish and Romanian Academy of Sciences, and also noted a doctorate at <span>the University of Paris.</span>  The foundations of probability theory and <span>mathematical statistics</span> that he developed not only advanced the knowledge of mankind, but also helped many students of Kolmogorov achieve significant success in their own careers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous mathematicians, world" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758417.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <h2>  Alexey Krylov </h2><p>  The boy grew up in a rather poor family - his favorite toy was an ax.  Little Alyosha was entertained by chopping firewood.  Relatives often thought that such a child would turn into a robber, but everything turned out quite differently.  He decided to become an engineer, and for this he needed mathematics.  Krylov began independent studies and by the age of 15 had mastered a serious reserve of knowledge.  During training, he hit professors and stood out among fellow practitioners.  Krylov went to serve at the Geographical Directorate, where he wrote a scientific paper on compasses, and then decided to engage in shipbuilding.  Many of the great Russian mathematicians were theorists, and only a few stand out by their narrow practical specialization.  Krylov is one of them.  For shipbuilding, his knowledge turned out to be key.  His works, combining mathematical theory with engineering practice, serve as the basis now.  In addition, he conducted a number of successful studies.  His main works on the structure of the ship are used in shipbuilding to this day, moreover, not only in Russia, but also in other countries of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great mathematicians, the history of mathematics" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/758423.jpg" width="246"></div>

    <h2>  Yuri Linnik </h2><p>  Many of Russia's great mathematicians worked at the beginning and middle of the twentieth century.  This also applies to Yuri Linnik, who graduated from Leningrad University in 1938, shortly after which he published a paper on the Frobenius theorem.  By 1943 he already had the title of professor.  Stunning work in the field of number theory made him a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences.  He devoted his whole life to solving complex problems, trying to find the simplest methods for them.  Among other things, he examined several important issues of probability theory, exploring in more depth the basics created by the English Hardy and Littlewood.  He formulated a theorem that a large positive integer can always be represented as the sum of a prime and two positive integers squared.  The name of Yuri Linnik is known to learned mathematicians around the world. </p><h2>  Alexander Lyapunov </h2><p>  Many great mathematicians in Russia studied at St. Petersburg University.  Alexander Lyapunov was also his graduate.  For a scientific work written in his fourth year, he received a gold medal.  Lyapunov was distinguished by phenomenal performance.  In addition, he was a talented teacher - students noted that for a short lecture he was able to tell what was unknown to even the best students of the course, going far beyond the program.  Alexander Mikhailovich Lyapunov developed many assumptions about the stability and equilibrium of moving mechanical systems, developed laws by which it is possible to determine the surface shape of a rotating fluid, and developed the foundations for controlling production processes that are used today.  Finally, Lyapunov wrote several works on probability theory, mathematical physics, and other key areas of science. </p>
