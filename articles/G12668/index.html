What is the secret of such popularity, and what is the difference between an iPhone and an iPod?  The answers to these questions are simple and complex at the same time - a kind of paradox.  In order to understand its reasons, you need to go a little deeper into the story and remember why the developers of the iPhone and iPod chose just such a concept for their devices.

    <p>  The first iPod was released in 2001.  The white case, small dimensions, minimalism in the controls and a fairly large display - this is what people with the first generation of iPods will forever remember.  The player's hard drive capacity was sensational 5 gigabytes.  The very appearance of such a player was already an event.  Of course, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpersonal players for listening to music was not new at that time - the Walkman cassette was the pioneer, but with the advent of the MP3 format, there was no need to carry a bunch of tapes or discs with you - now it‚Äôs become possible to store a large media library in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first generation ipods" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14039/147148.jpg" width="600"></div>  the device itself.  Convenient control, high-quality sound and the ability to easily download music directly from a personal computer won the hearts of fans of Apple products forever, and the corporation itself brought huge profits from sales.

So, in 2004, the iPod mini went on sale, which has even more compact dimensions.  The next step was the release of iPod Photo, which was equipped with a color display and the ability to store and view photos.  It was at this point that the idea came to the bright mind of the CEO of Apple Corporation - to create a product that can combine all the useful gadgets that users have to carry separately.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an Iphone came up.  Here you can already dot the ‚Äúi‚Äù, and the question asked at the very beginning is ‚Äúhow does an iPhone differ from an iPod?‚Äù  - give a detailed answer.  Iphone is nothing more than an iPod with advanced features. </p><p>  Initially, the project for developing a smartphone was called differently, and they were developing, by the way, not a smartphone at all, but a tablet, as Jobs later admitted.  In 2005, a project called Purple-1 failed miserably, and for some time the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone and iPod developers" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14039/147154.jpg" width="460"></div>  The multi-gadget has been delayed in a distant box.  They returned to this idea only two years later, and codenamed "Purple-2", the company's engineers began developing a smartphone that will be released in January 2007.  The smartphone combines a multimedia player, a PDA and a phone.  The smartphone will receive its real name - Iphone-2G - just half an hour before the presentation.  This step by Jobs will be the beginning of a long lawsuit with Cisco Systems, the owner of the trademark "Iphone".

    <p>  Iphone-2, went on sale in the summer of 2007, was a sensational success.  The company also did not abandon the iPod and continued to release new versions of this line.  The player‚Äôs capabilities expanded more and more and kept up with the times.  At the moment, the iPod and Iphone have approximately equal capabilities, and the question "what is the difference between an iPhone and an iPod" can be answered - only by the ability to make calls via Iphone. </p>
