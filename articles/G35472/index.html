After that, you need to make a statement addressed to the employee of the company, which deals with issues of lost documents.  In this case, for a period of up to 30 days, a special temporary certificate is issued to the citizen, which acts in the same way as the original document. </p><p>  If you turn to another insurance company, in this case we will not talk about how to restore the MHI policy in case of loss, but about getting a new one.  Accordingly, for this it is enough to make a request to issue a <span>certificate of health</span> insurance.  As soon as the full package of documents is submitted to the insurance company, the lost policy is canceled automatically.  This means that all the data about the person, which are compiled on the basis of the documents provided by him earlier, will be necessarily added to the file cabinet.  However, it is worth considering that in this case the new form will not be free. </p>
