One of these curious devices was the C90 from Lenovo.  A lot of people compare it in appearance with an Apple product, but is that so? </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the device turned out to be very entertaining.  Among the mass of devices of the same type, the Lenovo S90 phone definitely stands out.  There is some similarity with the sixth iPhone, but the evolution of technology has made almost all smartphones similar. </p><p>  It is worth starting with the fact that all the similarities with the "apple" representative are in the use of similar materials. </p>

    <p>  The front part only slightly resembles an iPhone, the rest of the company remained true to itself, and all the design elements are in the usual places.  So, the touch buttons took their place from the bottom of the screen, and from above the speaker, camera, sensors and an interesting novelty in the form of a flash were sheltered. </p><p>  But the back of the device is more like a sixth iPhone.  It is immediately worth noting that this part of the body is made of aluminum.  On top is a camera, of course, with a flash, as well as the company logo.  All parts are exactly the same as Apple. </p><p>  Glass has <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> which allows you not to be afraid to stain the device with fingerprints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The light weight, given the aluminum used in the case, makes the Lenovo S90 smartphone convenient to use.  The weight of the device is only 129 grams.  The thickness of 6.9 mm will also please the user.  Of course, the firm completely adopted these parameters from the sixth ‚Äúapple‚Äù. </p><p>  Two speakers were located at the bottom of the device, but one of them is just a snag.  Also, the bottom end has become a haven for the USB jack and microphone. </p><p>  On the left side there is a place for a SIM card, and on the right there is a volume control, as well as a power button. </p><p>  Even if we assume that the design absolutely mimics the iPhone, the phone turned out to be excellent.  High-quality assembly and pleasant body material allow the device to look more expensive than its price. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Mighty screen got <span>"Lenovo S90".</span>  <span>The characteristics of the</span> diagonal are 5 inches, Super Amoled technology is applied, of course, this feature has not grown to the Samsung level.  Given the lack of additional screen settings, the picture is still saturated and quite bright. </p>

    <p>  C90 got a resolution of 1280 x 720. If you look closely, you can notice minor pixels.  There are no particular claims to the display, the price requested for the Lenovo S90 justifies it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  A rather strong side is the <span>Lenovo S90</span> camera <span>.</span>  <span>The</span> main <span>characteristics</span> are as much as 13 megapixels.  Given the huge resolution of 4208 x 3120, the pictures are excellent.  The photo shows sharpness and detail, but a little lack of brightness.  Nevertheless, this is a minor minus for such an apparatus. </p>

    <p>  An interesting feature of the C90 is its front-facing camera with as many as 8 megapixels.  An incredible situation when the additional camera of the device is better than the main one.  Here, the resolution is also not small - 3264 x 2448. There is also a flash, which allows you to take a selfie even in low light. </p><p>  Both cameras leave only the most pleasant experience.  Manufacturers did a great job. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  They equipped the device with the SnapDragon processor often used in Lenovo.  This device has four cores with a capacity of 1.2 GHz each.  For graphics, the usual Adreno 306 was installed for the middle class. The video accelerator is definitely rather weak, but it copes with its tasks. </p><p>  The company took into account its flaw, sometimes slipping in middle-class devices, namely weak RAM.  Equipped C90 memory in the amount of two gigabytes.  This will be enough to satisfy most of the emerging needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There is also a model designed only for the Chinese market.  The difference is that the device for the Celestial Empire has only 1 GB of RAM. </p><p>  The smartphone has two variations of internal memory - 16 and 32 GB.  Of course, fewer will be available.  It is worth preparing for the fact that approximately 4 GB will go to the Android system right away.  When making a decision when choosing a memory variation, it should be remembered that there is no connector for a flash drive in the phone. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  A device based on "Android 4.4.4" is functioning.  Perhaps the choice of version is not the best, but if necessary, you can upgrade to a more modern analogue. </p><p>  The VibeUI shell used by the company in all devices shows excellent results.  Everything is worked out in detail, as well as the problems arising in previous models are fixed. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone is designed for two SIM cards.  All popular networks as well as LTE are supported.  In addition, there are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and, of course, mobile Internet. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speaker of the device gives a perfectly acceptable sound.  Waiting for something special is not worth it, but no noise will arise.  It is the expected sound for the device on the "Android". </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  An unpleasant situation has developed with the Lenovo S90 battery.  The battery review will upset the user with the presence of only 2300 mAh.  The battery is built-in. </p><p>  In fact, this is the weakest side of a powerful device.  The charge, if you do not use the device, is enough for a day.  In case of active use, the time will be reduced to only 3-4 hours. </p><p>  Definitely installing a built-in battery is a huge miss for the company.  And the point is not even the impossibility of a replacement, but its capacity, which is more suitable for a budget device. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The price established on the Lenovo S90 device will pleasantly surprise customers.  The approximate cost is 15 thousand rubles, which is very good for such parameters.  Compared to competitors, the C90 looks in a more favorable light. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The C90 delivery set is the most standard - a USB cable, an adapter, headphones, an instruction manual.  If necessary, you can buy the required accessories.  For example, a cover on the Lenovo S90 will be an excellent solution to protect the device from damage. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  There are many advantages in the device.  To begin with, the pleasant design of the device is striking.  Although some details were adopted from the flagship Apple, but the appearance of the smartphone is noteworthy. </p><p>  It should be noted and the filling "Lenovo S90".  Owner reviews speak of the excellent performance of the device.  A fairly average processor was perfectly implemented in the C90 and perfectly harmonizes with all the filling. </p><p>  The smartphone copes with most of the tasks and will be an excellent companion in both entertainment and work. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to the smartphone camera.  And not one, but both.  Based on the <span>feedback</span> received about the <span>Lenovo S90,</span> we can judge the sound quality of the images. </p><p>  The cost of the device should also be attributed to the advantages.  The low price makes the phone attractive to customers. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Much less in the smartphone minuses.  The most significant of these is the battery.  Given a rather gluttonous system, as well as a powerful stuffing, the conclusion suggests itself.  There is not enough battery for all phone requests.  The owner will be dependent on finding outlets for charging. </p><p>  The already installed system will be a little upsetting 4.4.4.  The fact is that against the background of all the advantages, the outdated Android looks strange. </p><p>  Oddly enough, the design can be attributed to the disadvantages, similar to an iPhone.  It will definitely be unpleasant to constantly compare with the eminent flagship. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Before buying, it will be useful to find out what the owners think of the Lenovo S90.  Reviews are mostly only positive.  All owners of this miracle rejoice in the performance and camera apparatus. </p><p>  Some users opted for the C90 only because of the similarities with the sixth iPhone.  In fact, almost all owners in one way or another recognize this detail. </p>

    <p>  However, not only the appearance attracted the attention of many.  The availability of such a device has become the main factor of choice. </p><p>  Of course, giving your own opinion on the Lenovo S90 will not help.  You should try this new product yourself. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Once again, Lenovo was able to surprise its fans.  Moreover, both the ability to create amazing devices, and the ability to copy design decisions. </p><p>  We must pay tribute: appearance has undergone several changes, no doubt, for the better. </p><p>  The phone is very attractive in all respects and, most likely, will receive due popularity. </p>
