Moreover, the maximum depth of its hollow does not exceed one and a half meters.  Almost from all sides, Chokrak Lake (photo of the hydrological object can be seen below) is surrounded by rocky ledges, which gives it additional picturesqueness. </p>

    <p>  On the shores of the lake fragrant herbs grow: Ivan tea, immortelle, wormwood and thyme.  From the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov the reservoir is separated by a narrow sandy isthmus, so it‚Äôs a stone's throw to the beaches from here ... </p><p>  The word "chokrak" is translated from the <span>Crimean Tatar language</span> as "spring".  And this is not at all accidental: powerful sources of mineral waters go to the bottom of the reservoir and along its banks.  However, Chokrak Lake is more famous today for its mud.  By the way, the healing properties of Chokrak waters and mud were known in the first century BC!  Even then, they were not only successfully used on the spot, but also delivered to Ancient Hellas. </p><h2>  Chokrak Lake: where is it located and how to get there? </h2><p>  The lake is located in the eastern part of the Crimean peninsula.  The nearest village is the village with the corresponding name Kurortnoye.  And twenty kilometers away is the large city of Kerch.  Chokrak Lake annually attracts a huge number of vacationers.  Especially in the summer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In what area is Chokrak Lake located?  How to get to it the easiest? </p><p>  The resort is located in the Leninsky <span>district of Crimea.</span>  From the Kerch bus station, minibuses leave here every thirty minutes.  You can get to the lake and on your own, by car.  In this case, you need to go through the village of Voikovo.  But you should be prepared for the fact that immediately after the village the asphalt road will end.  Further, up to Kurortny, you will have to drive along a dusty primer, along pits and potholes. </p><h2>  Chokrak Lake: a unique balneological resort </h2><p>  Lake Chokrakskoye is a unique natural formation, the fame of which spread far beyond the borders of Crimea.  Some come here to soak up the golden beaches of the Azov coast.  Basically, people go to Chokrak to cure their arthritis and radiculitis. </p><p>  The main healing factors of Chokrak are: </p><ul><li>  healing mud; </li><li>  hydrogen sulfide water from local sources; </li><li>  sandy beaches on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </li></ul>

Albov, a professor who has devoted more than one year of his life to the study of the nature and healing factors of Chokraki Lake, about this resort. </p><p>  These places are also attractive for fishing enthusiasts: a goby and other small fish are perfectly caught here. </p><h2>  Mud Chokrak: composition and medicinal properties </h2><p>  The mud of Lake Chokraks is distinguished by great environmental cleanliness.  And due to its healing properties, Chokrak is one of the most famous mud deposits on the planet. </p><p>  The composition of the local mud includes hydrogen sulfide brine, sludge, as well as various trace elements.  The sludge mud is saturated with the latter due to numerous mineral springs located at the bottom of the reservoir.  The colloid content in the Chokrak mud is quite high (about 3.5 percent). </p>

    <p>  A full course of treatment involves at least ten mud procedures.  It should be noted that Chokrak mud is effectively used not only medicinally, but also for cosmetic purposes. </p><p>  At the same time, the use of therapeutic mud of Lake Chokraks has a number of contraindications.  This is arrhythmia, bronchial asthma, tuberculosis (in active form), diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, cirrhosis of the liver, as well as pregnancy.  In addition, treatment may be accompanied by fatigue and slightly elevated body temperature.  Some vacationers feel numbness of the fingers, tingling in the joints.  However, after a few days, these symptoms usually disappear. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about Chokraka </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists and vacationers visit Lake Chokraki annually.  The reviews they leave are positive. </p><p>  For many, Chokrak Lake becomes a real discovery.  After all, mud treatment is not only useful, but also quite a pleasant and fun procedure.  And after taking mud baths it is very cool to plunge into the waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  To the nearest beach from the lake - no more than 500 meters! </p><p>  True, they do not advise sitting in the lake for a long time (no longer than 10-15 minutes).  And before you go to Chokrak, you should consult your physician, because mud treatment has a number of restrictions on the state of human health. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are strongly advised to take with them from the lake not only positive impressions, but also local mineral salt.  It also has healing properties.  In particular, she is recommended to gargle with sore throat and colds. </p><p>  The only drawback of Chokrak, which is noted by almost all recreants, is the lack of a normal infrastructure, in particular, roads.  So, to overcome a distance of twenty kilometers from Kerch to the village of Kurortny, you will have to spend at least an hour.  But even this factor does not overshadow the rest on Lake Chokraks. </p><h2>  Surroundings of Chokrak: interesting places and attractions </h2><p>  The surroundings of the lake are very picturesque and interesting.  First of all, it is worth mentioning the so-called <span>General's beaches</span> (or the coast of a thousand bays, as it is also called).  This is a series of wonderful sandy beaches, rocky cliffs and cozy coves.  These places in a striking way attract yogis, esotericists and simply creative personalities.  The coastline of General's beaches is pretty rugged.  Therefore, here you can swim under the arched rocky arches and even find small grottoes.  Water in the bays, as a rule, in the summer is very fast and warms up well. </p>

    <p>  There is a lake near Chokraksky and its own <span>mountain Ararat.</span>  She, however, is much lower than her Armenian namesake.  Its height is 175 meters.  The mountain is located five kilometers south of the lake.  In the relief - this is a pronounced plateau massif, completely covered with shrubs and herbs. </p><h2>  Finally... </h2><p>  Lake Chokrakskoye is a unique and unusual corner, a real miracle of Crimean nature.  It is located on the <span>Kerch Peninsula,</span> twenty kilometers from the city of Kerch.  With a sufficiently large area (9 square kilometers), the maximum depth of the reservoir does not even reach one and a half meters. </p><p>  The main wealth of Chokrak is its healing mud, saturated with hydrogen sulfide and trace elements.  The bottom and coast of the reservoir is rich in sources of valuable mineral waters.  People come here to get rid of arthritis, sciatica, gynecology problems and many other ailments. </p>
