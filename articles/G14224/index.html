    <h2>  Industrial LED Downlights </h2><p>  Often in industry, <span>metal halide lamps</span> or fluorescent <span>lamps</span> are installed.  Their choice is determined by the low cost of the devices and the uniform diffusion of light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial led ceiling lights" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1410413.jpg" width="600"></div>  The most commonly used LED lights.  They will reduce lighting costs by up to 70%, while not losing quality.  Products will significantly help increase the profits of the enterprise.

Such lamps require less power, so it is fashionable to direct the released energy to other processes. </p><p>  - Durability.  Industrial LED lights remain operational for 50 thousand hours, with proper use, this figure doubles.  At the same time, the luminaires do not require additional maintenance. </p><p>  - Payback.  Despite the high price of the fixtures themselves, they pay for themselves after 2-3 years, while not requiring repair costs, which allows the company to increase profits. </p><p>  - Increased degree of protection.  For rooms where high humidity, produce special industrial LED lamps, which are additionally protected from the external environment. </p><p>  - Quick turn on.  Lamps do not flicker before starting work, which reduces the load on the eyesight of personnel. </p><p>  - Uniform distribution of light. </p><h2>  Hanging option </h2><p>  Industrial <span>LED ceiling lights are</span> produced without additions and frills, because the scope of their application is not office premises, but work shops and other production facilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pendant industrial led lights" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1410414.jpg" width="600"></div>  When choosing a pendant lamp, the following parameters must be considered:

It will not require changes in the architecture of the building, while providing the entire room with high-quality light. </p><p>  Pendant industrial LED lights can be mounted on one or two suspensions.  They also vary in shape.  They are: round or square, rectangular, in the form of narrow panels or with shades in the shape of a sphere, as well as non-standard. </p><p>  Select industrial LED pendant lights should be based on the shape and area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room.  Not least is its purpose.  It is better to order lighting products in batches, so the risk of discrepancies in design or form is reduced. </p><h2>  Lamp protection level </h2><p>  Many manufacturing processes have a significant amount of dust, and sometimes moisture.  The best protection of lighting devices from the external environment will be the timely installation of lamps such as industrial ip65 LED lamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led industrial lighting ip65" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1410415.jpg" width="600"></div>  These elements are made in a metal or plastic case.  The last protection option is used for lamps up to 40 watts.  IP65 luminaires can be used with temperature fluctuations from +40 to -40 degrees.  These devices have sufficient economy, are easy to install and do not require special skills or equipment, they are also safe and easy to operate, requiring a minimum of care and cleaning.

    <p>  It is for many reasons to opt for such devices as LED lamps for industrial premises, in particular, they are indispensable for lighting places where work is done manually and requires special accuracy. </p><h2>  Differences of LED devices from analogues </h2><p>  <span>Halogen lamps are</span> efficient, compact and economical, it is with these qualities that they attract consumers.  They can work both on direct and alternating current.  Buffer gas is present in the halogen lamp, which reduces the operability of the device to only 4 thousand hours.  The lamp can glow up to very high temperatures, so during operation it should not come into contact with objects.  This is the main minus of such devices.  Modern lamps are coated with an infrared composition, which doubles their service life. </p><p>  <span>Luminescent lamps</span> have a wide range of advantages: long service life, increased efficiency, independence from voltage surges, they heat up to a maximum of 50 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lighting for industrial premises" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1410416.jpg" width="600"></div>  Lamps in fluorescent lamps are made of mercury or sodium.  They have a power of up to 400 watts.
