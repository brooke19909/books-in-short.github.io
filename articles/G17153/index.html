    <p>  The ability of these beautiful animals to positively influence the human psyche has been known for a very long time, and is widely used in many countries of the world.  Dolphins are much smarter than other mammals.  They are at the top of the smart parade among animals.  Therefore, it is so interesting to watch them.  Zoologists say that dolphins are much like humans, they can experience feelings such as love and affection, and some even jealousy.  There are many legends about how dolphins helped sailors in a shipwreck to get to the shore.  The military has long appreciated their intelligence.  Now these marine mammals are in the service of the fleet of many countries.  It is known that fighting dolphins helped our fleet in clearing the Black Sea during the Second World War.  So communication with our smaller intelligent brothers living in the seas and oceans will benefit absolutely everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dolphin therapy </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the dolphinarium in Sormovsky Park in Nizhny Novgorod offers a swim with these amazing animals.

    <p>  Adults note the care of the staff about their viewers, because the issued oilcloths are not at all superfluous after such jumps.  Young visitors to the show admire not only the work of dolphins, fur seals, showing the wonders of training, they also like the opportunity to stroke wonderful marine artists and take pictures with them.  Spectators are pleased that the water arena hall is conveniently equipped and with excellent visibility from all places. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, it was noted that on hot days it was stuffy enough.  Therefore, air conditioners would not hurt. </p><p>  Many thanks to people not only to the organizers of the show, but also to the employees of the dolphinarium, their friendliness and responsiveness are worthy of all praise.  Separately, the purity and lack of smell of chlorine, which, unfortunately, is characteristic of pools, was noted, so the dolphinarium in Sormovsky Park received the most flattering reviews.  For those who have not had time to enjoy the performance, I advise you to do it without fail.  After all, the pleasure received by the child is a double pleasure for parents. </p><h2>  Address </h2><p>  Where is the Dolphinarium in Sormovsky Park?
