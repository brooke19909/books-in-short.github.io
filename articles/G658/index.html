    <h2></h2><h2>  Monisto </h2><p>  So, if a person has a lot of coins that can no longer be paid in the store, you can usefully attach them.  Why not create DIY crafts from coins?  What could it be?  First of all - jewelry.  You can make a chic necklace that our ancestors wore in antiquity.  It is called monisto.  How to make a similar product?  To do this, you need to take a cord or chain, as well as a lot of coins.  It is worth noting that the necklace can be in one row or several.  In order to fasten the coins with each other, it will be necessary to drill small holes in them and thread thin wires.  If the necklace is in several rows, you need to fasten the pennies below and above, if desired, and on the sides.  You can also attach coins to the chain using a wire that will be threaded through the hole in the chain and into the hole in the coin.  If the pennies are attached to the cord, then it can simply be threaded into holes.  You can attach a special hook to this necklace to close it, but it can also simply be tied at the back of the neck to a bow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY coins" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/344389.jpg?1393503991937" width="580"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Ring </h2><p>  What else can be crafts from coins?  Why can't a man make his lover a ring?  In her collection of jewelry, it will definitely be the most valuable, because it will be created manually.  So let's get started.  First of all, in a coin, you need to drill a hole strictly in the center.  How to achieve this?  To securely fix the money, you can make a hole in the tablet in which the penny will lie.  Next, with a small diameter drill (about 10-13 mm), you need to make a hole in the coin exactly in the center.  So that the tool does not come off, the center can be marked with a core.  After these manipulations, something like a puck should turn out.  If this is so, then everything is in order, and you can move on.  Next, this workpiece must be put on a metal rod and hammer it evenly over the entire surface (as if pressing it to the rod).  An important point: in order for the inscriptions that were on the coin to be preserved, all manipulations must be carried out with a rubber hammer.  It‚Äôs also better to pre-heat the money a little, so it will be more malleable, and the process will not take much time.  However, it must be said here that the first time such crafts from coins may not work, for an excellent result it will be necessary to spoil a few cents.  So, this is the rough result of the decoration.  Now you need to bring the product to a beautiful state.  To do this, you just need to polish the ring well.  This can be done with a special paste and a soft cloth.  It is worth noting that these manipulations can take a lot of time, so it‚Äôs better to be patient.  Another secret: before <span>polishing, the metal</span> must again be heated and lowered into cold water, so the scale will come off, and polishing will be more successful and faster.  That's all, the ring is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class crafts from coins" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/344386.jpg?1393504016377" width="383"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Photo Frame </h2><p>  If the previous options were quite difficult to implement, then there are lighter handicrafts from coins, which you can create with your own hands pretty quickly.  Why not make an interesting photo frame?  To do this, you need to take a cardboard of good density (preferably color) and a photograph, as well as stock up on various coins.  The photo is placed in the center of the cardboard, now it remains to decorate the frame with a penny.  To do this, they will only need to be "planted" on superglue.  It is worth noting that you can decorate the frame in different ways.  It may seem sufficient to someone to glue a few coins at the corners of the cardboard and stop there.  And someone will want to glue the paper thickly with coins, leaving no room for clearance.  You get such a money photo frame. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Tree </h2><p>  You can also make a <span>money tree</span> from coins.  Craft, by the way, is not only beautiful in its result, but can also have a special meaning, to be a kind of magical magnet for money.  To make it, you need to stock up on trifles (you can have either one or different advantages), and, of course, make a tree.  How can it be?  This can be an ordinary snag from the forest (it can be processed with a cloth or paper), to which branches-wires will be attached.  Here they hang coins, previously drilled in the center.  The tree can be weaved from beads, more precisely, the base can be woven with beads, to make small twigs.  That's just a little coins can be hung on them, because they simply can not hold.  Or you can go the simple way, decorating an ordinary flowerpot hanging on coins or wires. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money tree from coins" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/344393.jpg?1393504051425" width="300"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Statuette </h2><p>  What else can be crafts from coins?  You can make an interesting figurine - money waterfall.  To do this, you will need a beautiful cup, an old fork, a saucer and coins.  And, of course, superglue.  First, you need to bend the fork so that it can hold the cup on itself, and at the same time lay well and stuck to the saucer.  The foundation is ready.  Now everything needs to be decorated with coins.  It is necessary to glue the product from the bottom up, first decorating the saucer as if sprinkled with trifle, then, rising up on the fork, glue the coins and a little stuff in the cup.  That's all, the moneyfall is ready! </p><h2></h2><h2>  Casket </h2><p>  We go further: what other handicrafts from cheap coins exist?  Why not make a box of old stuff?  To do this, you can glue with coins an old wooden product, but it will be too simple.  And you can make a box full of cents, sticking them to one another.  You need to start with the legs, then make the bottom, laying coins on one another as the scales are located on the fish, then erect the walls again (you can just create turrets, only in this case the box will shine through).  To make the lid, you still need a wooden base - the top of the old box, which is simply glued with coins. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="penny coin crafts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/344384.jpg?1393504075448" width="458"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Suspension </h2><p>  Crafts from coins can be very simple.  Why not make a simple pendant.  An item from an old coin will look especially beautiful.  To do this, you just need to drill a hole in the money of the required diameter and thread a chain or thread into it.  And to make the decoration look more beautiful, you can attach a coin to the base with a thin wire.  So the penny will not spin and will always lie beautifully on the neck. </p>
