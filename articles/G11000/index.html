Of course, the smartphone can no longer be called some kind of advanced device, but in fact it still represents a very, very good option.  Oddly enough, but many ignored this device and did not have time to figure out what are the advantages of the "Sony Xperia M2 Aqua" and what technical characteristics it has. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  In appearance, the smartphone has a rather familiar design, similar to smartphones released in 2014 - a standard rectangular shape with rounded corners, not too sloping ends, the presence of a completely straight back surface, and the use of Omni Balance's proprietary design concept. </p><p>  In the original version of the M2 there is a glass back side, while the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua is equipped with a back cover made of special matte plastic.  How optimal this option is will be decided by users, since plastic seems more attractive to some, while others prefer glass.  If we talk about practicality, then the plastic that uses the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua is much more durable and reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Color </h2><p>  The device is offered in three main colors - brown, white and black.  If you choose among these devices, then many experts immediately say that you need to clearly give your preference to non-black models, because fingerprints often remain on their surface, and in principle the gadget has an extremely simple look. </p><h2>  Convenience </h2>

    <p>  Due to the use of porous plastic having a rough surface, as well as the uneven edges and somewhat pointed corners, the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua perfectly lies in the hand and does not even think to slip out during operation.  From this point of view, this device looks much better than the Z3 Compact or M2, since in these models there is a rather slippery case and the smartphone cannot be held securely in your hand.  Among other things, do not forget that too smooth edges do not allow it to be conveniently lifted from horizontal even surfaces. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of this smartphone are standard, but many people say that the weight of the plastic gadget is quite large.  The front side is protected by specialized glass, while the manufacturers did not provide any clarifying information about this material.  The only thing worth noting is that while the experts tested the technical specifications at Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, no chips or scratches were noticed.  Similarly, no damage was noted on the back cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing </h2>

    <p>  The signature insert of this design is the use of plastic translucent ends on the sides.  Due to this, such a smartphone has an attractive appearance and is somewhat different from other devices similar to it in technical and external characteristics. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the build quality of this gadget, since during operation it does not emit any extraneous sounds, and the back does not bend down to the battery. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  In Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, technical characteristics are also distinguished by another important feature - the use of specialized protection against moisture and dust.  Thus, the device is characterized by extremely high protection of contacts from excessive dust accumulation, and according to the developers, this device can function normally under water at a depth of more than a meter.  If, for example, plugs are completely absent in the Z3 model, then reviews of Sony Xperia M2 Aqua indicate that these plugs are not just there, they really hold moisture well enough. </p><p>  Of course, dust in principle is not a threat to modern gadgets, but the protection of such a device from moisture, of course, is its key advantage.  Especially such protection becomes enjoyable when you consider the cost of Sony Xperia M2 Aqua.  Svyaznoy, for example, offers to pay 12,500 rubles for this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Given the protection, you should not pay special attention to too broad a framework, since this can be called a certain retribution for the fact that the device remains operational regardless of the weather.  About Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, reviews say that the device does not stop working even if you accidentally drop it in the mud. </p><h2>  Control Panel </h2>

    <p>  In the upper part of the front panel there is a camera, sensors, as well as an indicator of missed events.  It is worth noting that the speaker is not so loud, but at the same time provides a very good sound quality.  Since increased dust protection is used here, the design does not allow to produce the most clear and clear sound, but still its quality remains at a fairly high level.  Also on the top of the device is a headphone jack, which, like other elements, was originally hidden behind a plastic plug.  If necessary, here you can connect accessories for Sony Xperia M2 Aqua. </p><p>  Under the screen is a microphone.  It is worth noting that, in principle, you will be heard normally, but often about the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, customer reviews say that on the other side of the tube the voice is a little dull.  The speakerphone is located at the bottom and is protected by a metal mesh. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the fact that on the right are slots for a memory card and a SIM card standard microSIM, which is quite convenient.  Nearby there is a round power button, which is characterized by extremely hard and tight pressing, as well as a thin key designed to adjust the volume in the phone. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen size in this device is 4.8 inches, but the physical size according to technical parameters is 60x107.  For Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, the instruction says that there is a specialized anti-reflective coating on the screen that allows you to use the device in any conditions, but according to customer reviews it can be said that this coating is far from as effective as it might seem at first glance .  There is also an <span>oleophobic coating,</span> which is not made in the best way, but it still allows you to simply erase the fingerprints, and also provides a smooth movement of the fingers. </p><p>  In Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, the characteristics show that the screen resolution is 540x960 pixels, while the aspect ratio is 16:10.  In the process of conducting specialized tests, it was determined that at any value, the image still remains too bright, and the gamma also showed itself not in the best way, which, for example, gives too much brightness to pictures in dark scenes, making the overall look blurry or flat.  A serious excess of blue was also noted, and this was especially true if the device was operating at a low brightness. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua phone is distinguished by a fairly simple matrix, which makes the image cover with purple or yellow at a certain angle.  Also, the device is far from showing its best in the sun, and even with a slight tilt of the screen, it is almost impossible to distinguish a picture. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  Sony Xperia M2 Aqua (whose photo you can see above) uses a non-removable lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 2400 mAh.  According to the manufacturer, in standby mode, this device can function for 641 hours, talk time - 11 hours, and in the process of constant music playback - 37 hours.  If you constantly watch the video, then the device will last no more than 8 hours. </p><h2>  How to practice? </h2><p>  During the tests, it was determined that, in principle, this information is true, and indeed the gadget‚Äôs operating time is standard for a modern Android smartphone of this class, that is, it works for about 10 hours if you use it in a relatively active mode with a connection to the internet.  If you want to play, then you should expect about two and a half hours if you want to play at full brightness and sound volume with output to the speaker. </p><p>  Specialists often pay special attention to the fact that the company saved a little on the supplied network adapter, as a result of which it will be necessary to keep it connected to the mains for three hours to properly charge the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  As usual, this smartphone uses two modules simultaneously.  The rear camera has 8 MP and is equipped with an auto focus function, while the front device is unlikely to please anyone with quality, since it has only 0.3 MP. </p><p>  Even the main camera module can be called relatively weak, but in fact the team involved in the development of appropriate software was able to squeeze the most out of the technologies used here.  Of course, the detail here is far from the most optimal, but noise reduction works more than well.  You can take fairly bright pictures at night, which will not have all kinds of ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù, and the <span>white balance</span> is also well maintained <span>.</span>  Thus, the camera is quite versatile and suitable for different occasions, but you should not expect any incredible results. </p><p>  There is no point in discussing the front camera, since we still managed to get to know what the 0.3 MP camera is about 10 years ago.  Perhaps some, having seen this quality now, will think that their phone is frozen and begin to figure out how to restart the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua. </p>
