Acid Battery Recovery</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Acid batteries are characterized by an increased resistance parameter.  The design of the device is quite different.  The capacity of the acid battery is always indicated in the instructions.  Modifications on 2 and 4 conclusions are presented on the market.  Their self-discharge rate may vary. </p><p>  The electrolyte in devices is most often used by the KS series.  The output voltage, as a rule, does not exceed 10 V. In order to understand this issue in more detail, it is necessary to consider the device of an acid battery. </p><h2>  Battery device </h2><p>  A standard medium capacity battery consists of a unit, a sealed enclosure, plates, electrolyte, and terminals.  Covers in devices are made with output contacts.  The plates on the models are fixed on racks.  Some modifications are made with valves.  If we consider batteries with high capacity, then they have a separator.  The specified element is installed with a jumper.  As a rule, negative outputs are connected directly to platinum.  The battery pack itself is rubber treated. </p>
