    <p>  Turkey is one of the most popular holiday destinations for Russian travelers.  Original culture, reasonable prices, the sea, clean beaches and delicious food are the guarantee that the tourist route ‚ÄúRussia-Turkey‚Äù will always be relevant, and the flow of people wishing to visit this country will never run dry.  But, unfortunately, inexpensive trips in this direction are often available only to residents of St. Petersburg and Moscow.  In other cities, ticket prices are many times more expensive.  In order to fly on <span>holiday to Turkey,</span> until recently it was necessary either to fly to Moscow first, or buy a ticket at an exorbitant price.  Now this is much easier.  Many travel agencies offer to start a trip to this wonderful country from their hometown, without any extra transfers and overpayments.  Pleasant innovations also affected Novgorodians.  Now organizing holiday flights from Nizhny Novgorod to Turkey has become easy and simple. </p><h2>  Sunny Turkey: direct flight from Nizhny Novgorod </h2><p>  Holidays in the Mediterranean resorts have always been especially loved by the inhabitants of Nizhny Novgorod.  But travelers faced some difficulties: they had to lose either money, or time, or both.  In 2014, this problem was solved.  Some travel agencies (the Eurotour company, in particular) began to offer their customers direct flights for holidays from Nizhny Novgorod to Turkey.  Travel companies are doing everything to ensure that the vacation was unforgettable, and nothing overshadowed it.  A ticket can be freely purchased just a couple of days before departure.  Those who wish to make a holiday flight from Nizhny Novgorod to Turkey may have a question about which airlines carry passengers.  The flight is made by Transaero, Orenburg Airlines, Tatarstan, Ural Airlines, and Nord Wind airliners.  These reliable companies will ensure a comfortable and safe journey.  You can choose any length of stay in Turkey, from two to fourteen nights.  If you plan to stay in the country for more than fourteen nights, then a direct flight will be calculated individually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey from Nizhny Novgorod" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/465669.jpg" width="585"></div>
