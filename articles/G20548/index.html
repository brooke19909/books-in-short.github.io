  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The simplest schemes for baubles oblique weaving</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How often have you heard about baubles?  Do you know what it is and what it is for?  Let's talk about it.  A bauble (or, in other words, fenya) is a handmade bracelet.  It is made from various decorative elements - leather, thread and beads.  Most often, this jewelry is part of a hippie outfit.  Surely, you have heard of such a subculture. </p><p>  In ancient times, among the <span>Indian tribes,</span> baubles were a symbol of friendliness, a good attitude to man.  Those people who exchanged this colorful little thing among themselves, from the moment of exchange were considered <span>soul</span> mates <span>,</span> brothers and sisters.  This rite is also characteristic of the aforementioned hippies: representatives of this social direction adopted the custom from free and proud Indians. </p><p>  Baubles are made with your own hands;  they invest love and respect, turning a small ornament into an important symbol of human relations.  Often they are made targeted, especially for some person, in order to express their location with this gift.  According to old customs, if you have been given a bauble, it must be worn until it breaks itself.  Having received such a simple, but significant man-made product as a gift, a person becomes elected and must respect the person who gave it with the same respect and fraternal warmth. </p><p>  Baubles can be made in various ways.  Here, for example, are the patterns of baubles oblique weaving. </p><p>  In order for the product to turn out to be colorful, vibrant, and surely liked by whoever later becomes its owner, it is necessary to choose colors that are saturated and combined with each other.  We will need two red, two white and two black threads (the length of each one hundred centimeters). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First you need to tie all the threads with a knot and braid them in a tight pigtail.  Fasten the finished end to the table.  Then you need to tie the first knot with a red (leftmost) thread around the second red thread.  Repeat this step one more time.  On each thread it is necessary to tie two knots.  And so do with all the threads (tie them all in turn with a red thread so that it becomes the far right).  And so weave each thread in turn.  Schemes of baubles with <span>oblique weaving are</span> not complicated, but you will have to try to get a bauble with even rows of knots and look beautiful.  Finishing weaving is necessary with a pigtail about five centimeters long, on the tip of which you need to tie a beautiful and neat little knot. </p><p>  We told you about one of the schemes, but there are a huge number of them.  There is also a very complex drawing, which you will have to work hard to amaze your friend or girlfriend with your needlework.  We will briefly tell you what other patterns of baubles oblique weaving exist.  You can make the same pattern that we brought to your attention, but not from threads, but from satin ribbons or a mouline thread.  It will turn out a very beautiful product.  And if you add beads, then the bauble will look especially elegant and festive.  Bracelets can consist of either three or more colors.  Here, the author can use the symbolic meanings of various colors to express his attitude to the one to whom the bauble is intended.  The most common meanings: green - the color of youth, life;  red - love, passion;  white - purity and tenderness.  Schemes of baubles with oblique weaving can be easily found on the Internet or in special magazines.  Go ahead, you will succeed. </p><p>  For beginner needlewomen, we can give a little information about what the main nodes of the baubles exist.  There are only two of them, but they can be performed in the usual position or in <span>mirror image.</span>  To begin with, we explain that one of the two threads is one of the workers - the one with which we knit the knots, and the axial one, which we tie with the main thread.  At the beginning of weaving a new row of knots, the threads will change their meaning.  The first kind of knot is a looped one.  In it, from left to right, two nodules must be braided around the second thread.  As a result, the threads will change places.  The knot should become the color of the thread.  The left loop knot is done the same way, but back to the above pattern (in mirror image).  The next node is the right turn.  Everything is simple here.  We make one loop, as in the right, and the second, as in the left loop knots.  Accordingly, the left turn is the same, only first to the left side, then to the right. </p><p>  And the last thing you need to know is how to tie baubles.  After the bauble is ready, try it on the hand of the future happy owner, and, if it comes up, boldly tie a knot and cut the ends. </p><p>  Weave and wear baubles, and let the connection with your friends be tightly connected by a beautiful and interesting home-made bracelet. </p>
