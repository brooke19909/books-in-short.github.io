The reason for the increased demand is the compact size and ease of installation.  Given that a large amount of equipment needs to be placed in the kitchen, the search for a place becomes an urgent problem.  And then, models that can be built into furniture come to the rescue.  As part of this article, <span>microwave ovens from the</span> Korean manufacturer will be considered, having optimal sizes and characteristics according to users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="built-in samsung microwaves" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1790666.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <h2>  Built-in <span>microwave ovens</span> - what is it? </h2><p>  Microwave oven models differ in design type.  For sale are freestanding and built-in.  The latter do not have the usual legs and sides.  They face the front panel significantly protrude beyond the line of the body.  This form is needed in order to harmoniously fit the device into the closet of the kitchen set and hide the joints. </p><p>  Samsung built-in microwave ovens do not differ in equipment from stand-alone models.  With the help of such an appliance it is possible not only to defrost and heat food, but also to fry (grill option), bake (convection mode).  There are also such devices called solos.  That is, only microwave use is available to the user.  Read more about them below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of Embedded Microwaves </h2><p>  Samsung's built-in microwave ovens can be divided into three groups.  The difference between the two is functionality. </p><ul><li>  The cheapest models, they are also the simplest, have a minimum set of options.  They are called solo.  Such devices are used only for heating dishes, making hot sandwiches and defrosting processed foods, meat, minced meat and other products.  You should not expect high performance from such an option.  Most often, these models are used in offices and in families where there are schoolchildren.  The process of warming up a dish is started with a single button.  The time spent is minimal.  The security level is high. </li><li>  The second group includes built-in microwave ovens with grill.  Their cost is slightly more expensive from the above option.  This is explained by the presence of an additional function.  Such devices are capable of working in two modes: microwave and grill.  The heating element is located both in the upper part of the chamber and on the back wall.  There are models in which the design of the heater is movable.  Recently, the company often uses a quartz tube grill.  Its characteristics are much higher than normal.  The advantages include efficiency, power, uniform heating, radiation of soft heat, which does not overdry the products. </li><li>  And the last group combines devices equipped with convection mode.  This option simulates the operation of the oven.  The cost of them is the highest. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung built-in microwave" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1790667.jpg" width="333"></div></li></ul><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Samsung's built-in microwave ovens vary in chamber volume and external dimensions.  Their main advantage is that there is no need to take up space on the work surface.  For this, special kitchen cabinets with empty space inside, without a door and a back wall are used.  The absence of the latter is explained simply - providing ventilation.  Compact models can be placed in a single column.  Most often, it combines an oven, a washing machine and other equipment.  To height is also an individual approach.  Standard is considered at the chest level of a person with average height.  Judging by the reviews, then this arrangement is as convenient as possible.  However, families with children have different standards.  In order for a small owner to be able to use the device independently, it is better to install it lower, for example, at a level with a work surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="built-in microwave black samsung" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1790668.jpg" width="581"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Selection of dimensions </h2><p>  In their reviews, buyers often raise the question of the optimal dimensions of the device.  Samsung built-in microwave ovens are available in a wide range, so there should be no problem choosing the right sizes.  What should I look for when choosing?  If the device is built into a cabinet with other equipment, then its width is a determining factor.  This indicator for all devices should be the same.  But the depth is not important.  Typically, the column is formed by the largest device, for example, a washing machine or dishwasher, freezer. </p><p>  The assortment range includes models with the following dimensions: </p><ul><li>  width - from 40 to 60 cm; </li><li>  depth - from 30 to 50 cm; </li><li>  height - from 30 to 45 cm. </li></ul><h2>  Camera: coverage requirement and volume selection </h2><p>  The modern Samsung built-in microwave is manufactured in accordance with European standards.  The manufacturer meets the requirements for all criteria.  The main attention of the buyer is drawn to the coating of the inner chamber.  According to reviews, the highest quality is bioceramic.  It has properties such as resistance to temperature extremes and mechanical stress.  All owners of such devices claim that the camera is easy to clean, the surface is not scratched and has a long service life. </p><p>  Coated and resistant enamel devices are on sale.  This option is used in inexpensive microwave ovens.  In the reviews, the owners say that although the camera is easy to clean, it‚Äôs very likely that the top layer will be damaged.  Also, over time, the paint may swell or peel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are models in which the camera is made of stainless steel.  As you know, this material is resistant to temperature changes, has a long service life, but it will be difficult to care for such a surface.  Drops of grease and other dirt are washed off with difficulty, and if you overdo it, it is easy to leave scratches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated microwaves samsung reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1790669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  Modern microwave ovens are designed in such a way that control is carried out by means of touch or mechanical buttons.  It happens that the manufacturer uses leverage in low-cost models such as solo.  According to this criterion, the entire product range can be divided into three groups. </p><p>  The first includes devices with a touch control panel.  It is a plate with a flat surface and designations.  It is convenient to use, there will also be no difficulties in cleaning, since there are no protruding elements or gaps in which fat can clog.  However, the owners noticed a drawback.  A power surge can cause a malfunction in the electronics, which is likely to lead to serious malfunctions.  It is also important to pay attention to the fact that repairs will be expensive if such an embedded Samsung microwave oven breaks down.  The instruction manual for the device will help you quickly understand the symbols on the touch panel. </p><p>  An equally popular option is a button control panel.  It is convenient to use.  Owners claim that the interface is intuitive.  But there are also weaknesses.  It is difficult to wash the panel.  Many people use improvised devices for this, which help to penetrate into the cracks near the buttons. </p><p>  And the simplest control is mechanical.  There are only two levers on the panel.  This method is used for microwave ovens. </p><h2>  Samsung FW77SSTR </h2><p>  The built-in Samsung FW77SSTR microwave oven is on average sold for 15,000 rubles.  The height of the device is slightly more than 30 cm, the depth is 35 cm. The body does not exceed 48.9 cm in width. The weight is small - only 12 kg.  The volume of the camera is 20 liters.  Coating - bioceramics.  Type of control - electronic.  Way of work - microwave.  The maximum microwave power is 850 watts.  The user has six levels.  It can be used for defrosting, cooking simple dishes, warming up.  Type of door - hinged.  Its opening is carried out by pressing the button located on the bottom of the control panel.  On the front side, the case is decorated in silver tones. </p><p>  Users note a low price, the presence of a child lock, camera backlight.  Particular attention in the reviews is given to the bioceramic coating.  But the owners attributed the lack of a grill to the disadvantages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="built-in microwaves with grill" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1790670.jpg" width="600"></div>
