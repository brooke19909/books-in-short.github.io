    <p>  The Republic of Crimea is a component of the <span>Crimean Federal District.</span>  It would not be entirely correct to say that Crimea, as part of Russia, began to exist in the spring of 2014, it would be more correct to say - continued.  March 16, 2014, a nationwide referendum was held on the peninsula.  The main one was the discussion of the status of the peninsula - the question of whether to remain in Crimea as part of Ukraine or become part of Russia.  The overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of the peninsula, through free will, wished to live and work as part of Russia. </p><p>  The document on the accession of the Crimean peninsula to the territory of the Russian Federation was signed on March 18, 2014.  A few days later (March 21, 2014), a federal constitutional law was signed.  The result of his action was the entry of Crimea already legally into the Russian Federation.  The Republic of Crimea and the city of federal significance Sevastopol - the new subjects of the federation - began to exist as part of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As soon as this happened, the numismatic market reacted with the appearance of various souvenir sets containing coins dedicated to the Crimea and reflecting ongoing events that were of great historical significance. </p><h2>  New Numismatics </h2>

    <p>  The initiative to mint commemorative coins on the accession of the Crimean peninsula to the Russian Federation came from Valentina Matvienko.  As early as April 2014, the Central Bank announced its intention to mint new commemorative steel coins with brass coating.  Crimea and Sevastopol became the main characters on the banknotes, which were already issued on October 9, 2014 and were dedicated to this historic event - the reunification of Crimea and Russia. </p><p>  For the manufacture of a set of coins, yellow metal was used, which is not precious.  The size of the coins (two of them: one is dedicated to the Crimea, the other to Sevastopol) is 2.2 centimeters in diameter.  The face value of both one and the second coin is 10 rubles.  Crimea and Sevastopol will be presented in the form of images of local attractions.  The Central Bank announced that both coins will be minted in a circulation of 10 million pieces each.  They will be put into circulation in full during 2015. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Front side of regalia </h2><p>  The Bank of Russia and 2014 are minted in the upper and lower parts of the coins, respectively.  Both one and the second coin (Crimea and Sevastopol) on the left and right side are decorated with laurel and oak branches.  In the center is the face value, which is indicated by the inscription "10 rubles" (the word is located under the number).  In the sign “0” of the face value, a protective element is placed, which is the inscription “10” and “rub”.  It can be seen regardless of the angle at which the image on the coin is viewed.  In addition to everything described above, below contains information about which mint was engaged in minting money. </p><h2>  Crimean regalia </h2>

    <p>  The famous Sevastopol monument “Flooded Ships” (not far from Primorsky Boulevard) is minted on the back of the commemorative coin against the background of the outlines of the Crimean Peninsula.  A small asterisk indicates the location of Sevastopol itself.  The inscriptions “Russian Federation” and “03/18/2014” are in the same place as the Crimean coin.  The difference is only in the lower part: instead of "Republic of Crimea" it says "Sevastopol". </p><p>  The obverse of both coins is identical. </p><p>  According to historians and numismatists, coins issued to commemorate the reunification of Crimea with Russia are almost the most beautiful of the existing ones. </p><h2>  Other commemorative coins of Crimea </h2><p>  A historical incident, but the fact remains - March 17, on the day when the Crimea decided to secede from Ukraine as a result of the referendum - the republic was actually an independent state for one day.  However, this fact has not been forgotten.  Evidence of this is the Moscow exhibition of numismatists "COIN-2014", which offers for sale a set of coins of the Republic of Crimea, dated March 17, 2014.  The set includes coins of different denominations.  Kopeks have a value of 10 and 50 kopecks, ruble coins are minted in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 rubles.  There is also a <span>coin of 10 rubles.</span>  Crimea on all copies of the kit is represented by the inscription "Republic of Crimea" and the griffin.  This bird is the <span>emblem of the Crimea.</span>  The inscription is minted in the languages ​​of Russians, Ukrainians and Tatars.  In addition, the date of March 17, 2014 is engraved on the obverse. </p><p>  On the reverse of all the coins are their denomination and objects of historical heritage that the indigenous inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula have been proud of since ancient times: the Genoese fortress located in Sudak, the fountain in Bakhchisarai, the Crimean deer and Crimean pine, dolphin and the ancient Swallow's Nest castle located in Yalta.  The whole set is offered to customers in souvenir packaging.  As an accompaniment - a fact sheet in English and Russian, which contains a brief information about all objects engraved on coins. </p><p>  According to numismatists, these coins are unlikely to ever become a real monetary means of circulation.  The place of this kit is at exhibitions, auctions and in private collections of scientists and amateurs. </p><p>  "Art-Grani" - a workshop of art weapons from Zlatoust of the Chelyabinsk region - also made its own souvenir product.  They became a commemorative coin.  Crimea (contours of the peninsula) is depicted on the reverse.  Although it would be more accurate to say that the image of a globe with intersecting meridians and parallels is plotted on the reverse side.  Against their background, the outlines of the Crimean peninsula with plotted points of 28 settlements are visible.  According to all the canons and rules of coinage, on the obverse there is a bas-relief of Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p>
