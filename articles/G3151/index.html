    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are beds, upholstered furniture, garden chairs and tables, a mirror, lamps and a telephone.  Some have a balcony.  The number of apartments is 50. The maximum studio area is 35 m¬≤.  In reviews of <span>the Adora Garden 3 * hotel</span> (Side), Russians indicate that the complex consists of three buildings.  The main building is inhabited by Europeans and residents of Turkey.  Its number of storeys is 3. Two additional buildings serve our compatriots.  Their category is Annex. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel owns a coastal recreation area.  Colorful umbrellas, comfortable folding sun loungers are placed on it, soft mattresses are laid out.  All inventory for vacationers is provided free of charge.  Its rent is included in the price of the permit.  Dry towels are also available by the sea.  A deposit is used as a security deposit. </p><p>  The beach is sandy, so it is great for children's entertainment.  Entrance to the water is even.  Depth increases gradually.  Waves are rare.  At the height of summer, the weather is clear and calm.  Only in the morning there is a rare ripple.  From mid-October, the sea begins to show its character.  High ridges rise, which crash with a crash on land. </p><h2>  Pool <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adora Garden hotel reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2111020.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The hotel area, judging by the reviews of the Adora Garden Hotel, is compact, but there was a place for a pool on it.  Its bowl has a rectangular shape.  Marked tracks for swimming.  Around are loungers and tables.  A little further away you can see the playground.  On the opposite side is a children's aquazone.  It is separated from the main stationary partition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some rooms have direct pool views.  This point must be taken into account when choosing apartments at the Adora Garden 3 * hotel in Side (Turkey).  They can be very noisy, and at night the backlight interferes with sleep.  Typically, such suites are chosen by families traveling with school-age children.  Sitting on the balcony, it is convenient to watch the child frolic in the water. </p><h2>  A restaurant </h2><p>  The price of the tour includes breakfast.  Tables for morning meals are served in the dining room and on the street.  They serve eggs, cereals, sandwiches, cheese, dairy products, vegetables and fruits.  Pour hot tea and brew coffee.  Starting from lunch, an √† la carte service starts at the establishment.  The waiters help to choose the dishes traditional for the region, prepared by local chefs. </p><p>  The bar, which is located on the way to the beach, mix cocktails.  The alcohol list has a wide selection of drinks.  In the evenings, the Adora Garden Hotel reviews include music.  Lanterns in the garden are lit.  Once a week, theme nights and shows are held.  Artists and singers, acrobats and gymnasts perform on an impromptu stage.  The spectacle is colorful and memorable! </p><h2>  Service <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adora Garden 3 hotel in Side Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2111021.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The list of hotel services: </p><ul><li>  Internet connection </li><li>  elevator; </li><li>  central air conditioning system; </li><li>  shared kitchen; </li><li>  sun terrace; </li><li>  restaurant service; </li><li>  reception by doctors of the medical center; </li><li>  playground; </li><li>  pools; </li><li>  housekeeping; </li><li>  change of towels and bed linen. </li></ul><p>  Wi-Fi in the lobby is free.  Access is available at an additional cost.  Since the hotel is aimed at budget travelers, vacationers have at their disposal a minimal set of free options. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel reviews adora garden" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2111017.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The position of the hotel in the general list of hotel complexes in the Side region directly depends on customer ratings.  At the moment, according to an authoritative international resource, the average Adora Garden score is 7.4 out of 10. An alternative resource gave the institution 3.5 out of 5 points. </p><p>  The following categories are used as the main parameters that make up the hotel rating: </p><ul><li>  level of service; </li><li>  nutrition; </li><li>  quality of rooms; </li><li>  infrastructure; </li><li>  general impression; </li><li>  location. </li></ul><p>  On the pages of the site of the tour operator, the Adora Garden Hotel was given only 2 points.  For a mid-range hotel, this is a normal estimate. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adora garden 3 side reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2111026.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The Russians liked the beach of the Adora Garden 3 * hotel in Side (Turkey).  It is wide and moderately long.  Technicians clean sand and coastal waters daily.  There is no rubbish near the bars.  The guests liked the apartments.  Travelers praised the cuisine and service in the restaurant. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of the hotel is the lack of Russian-speaking staff.  I had to communicate with gestures.  Visitors did not like the proposed entertainment program.  Some were bored.  It was difficult for small children to get to the beach. </p><p>  It was hot and stuffy at lunchtime in the restaurant and on the terrace.  At dinners, the hotel administration was clearly saving.  We were treated to liquid soups.  Some dishes have been salted.  But for dinner, cooks prepared decent dishes.  Served meat, vegetables, sweets. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The procedure for settlement in a residential building is different from the process that is announced by the administration.  When arriving late in Turkey, travelers, according to reviews of Adora Garden 3 * (Side), do not even offer sandwiches.  There was no mineral water in the refrigerator.  Sometimes in high season the hotel is full.  There are no available rooms.  Then, single clients who have paid for separate rooms are offered to move into family apartments. </p><p>  This means that management confirms the reservation without having rooms to accommodate visitors.  Some had to spend their whole vacation in one suite with strangers.  No one compensated the difference in the cost of the tour. </p><p>  A free shuttle bus runs from the hotel.  He carries vacationers to the beach.  There are several morning routes.  To have time to get back to dinner, you need to walk on foot under the scorching sun.  There are no return flights.  They are appointed only in the evening. </p><p>  The bathroom sometimes lacks hygiene products and cosmetics.  Hotel staff explain this with the difficult economic situation in the country and the cheapness of trips. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  You never need to agree to a number whose category does not correspond to the type declared in the tour.  You should stand your ground.  Employees of the accommodation service take advantage of the late arrival of Russians and violate their rights.  Help from a tour operator is not worth the wait.  If a conflict occurs, experienced vacationers are advised to contact the administrator. </p>
