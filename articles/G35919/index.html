Auschwitz History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Auschwitz prisoners were released four months before the end of World War II.  By that time there were few of them.  Almost one and a half million people died in the <span>death camp</span> , most of them Jews.  For several years, the investigation continued, which led to terrible discoveries: people not only died in the gas chambers, but also became victims of Dr. Mengele, who used them as experimental rabbits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002854.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  Auschwitz: the story of one city </h2><p>  A small Polish town in which more than a million innocent people were destroyed, is called Auschwitz all over the world.  We call it Auschwitz.  A concentration camp, experiments on <span>women and children,</span> gas chambers, torture, executions - all these words have been associated with the name of the city for more than 70 years. </p><p>  The <span>German phrase</span> Ich lebe in Auschwitz - ‚ÄúI live in Auschwitz‚Äù - will sound rather strange in Russian.  Is it possible to live in Auschwitz?  They learned about the experiments on women in the concentration camp after the end of the war.  Over the years, new facts have been discovered.  One is worse than the other.  The truth about the camp called <span>Auschwitz (Auschwitz)</span> shocked the whole world.  Research today is ongoing.  Many books have been written and many films made on this subject.  Auschwitz entered our symbol of painful, difficult death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where did the massacres of children take place and terrible experiments on women were carried out?  In <span>the Auschwitz concentration camp.</span>  Which city of millions of inhabitants on earth is associated with the phrase "factory of death"?  Auschwitz. </p><p>  Experiments on people were carried out in a camp, located near the city, in which 40 thousand people live today.  This is a calm village with a good climate.  Auschwitz was first mentioned in historical documents in the twelfth century.  In the 13th century, there were already so many Germans here that their language began to prevail over Polish.  In the XVII century, the city was captured by the Swedes.  In 1918, he again became Polish.  After 20 years, a camp was organized here, on the territory of which crimes took place, similar to which humanity did not yet know. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002853.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  Gas chamber or experiment </h2><p>  In the early forties, the answer to the question of where the Auschwitz concentration camp was located was known only to those who were doomed to death.  Unless, of course, not take into account the SS.  Some prisoners, fortunately, survived.  Later they talked about what happened in the walls of the Auschwitz concentration camp.  The experiments on women and children conducted by a man whose name terrified prisoners are a terrible truth that not everyone is ready to listen to. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The gas chamber is a terrible invention of the Nazis.  But there are worse things.  Kristina Zhivulskaya is one of the few who managed to get out of Auschwitz alive.  In her book of memoirs, she mentions a case: a prisoner sentenced to death by Dr. Mengel does not go, but runs into a gas chamber.  Because death from poisonous gas is not so terrible as the torment from the experiments of the same Mengele. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002856.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  The creators of the "death factory" </h2><p>  So what is Auschwitz?  This is a camp that was originally intended for political prisoners.  The author of the idea is Erich Bach-Zalewski.  This man had the rank of SS gruppenfuhrer, during the Second World War he led the punitive operations.  Dozens of <span>Belarusian partisans</span> were sentenced to death with his light hand <span>.</span>  He took an active part in the suppression of the uprising that took place in Warsaw in 1944. </p><p>  Assistants of the SS gruppenfuhrer found a suitable place in a small Polish town.  There were already military barracks, in addition, the railway connection was well established.  In 1940, a man named <span>Rudolf Hess</span> arrived here <span>.</span>  He will be hung by the gas chambers by decision of a Polish court.  But this will happen two years after the end of the war.  And then, in 1940, Hess liked these places.  He enthusiastically embarked on a new business. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002870.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  Concentration camp dwellers </h2><p>  This camp did not immediately become a "death factory."  At first, they sent here mainly to Polish prisoners.  Only a year after the organization of the camp did the tradition to display a serial number on the prisoner's hand.  More and more Jews were brought in every month.  By the end of Auschwitz, they accounted for 90% of the total number of prisoners.  The number of SS men here also grew steadily.  In total, the concentration camp took about six thousand overseers, punitive and other "specialists".  Many of them were put on trial.  Some disappeared without a trace, including Joseph Mengele, whose experiments terrified prisoners for several years. </p><p>  The exact number of victims of Auschwitz will not be given here.  We will only say that more than two hundred children died in the camp.  Most of them were sent to gas chambers.  Some fell into the hand of Joseph Mengele.  But this man was not the only one who conducted experiments on people.  Another so-called doctor is Karl Klauberg. </p><p>  Beginning in 1943, a huge number of prisoners entered the camp.  Most should have been destroyed.  But the organizers of the concentration camp were practical people, and therefore decided to take advantage of the situation and use a certain part of the prisoners as material for research. </p><h2>  Karl Kauberg </h2><p>  This man led the experiments conducted on women.  His victims were mostly Jewish and gypsy.  The experiments included removal of organs, testing of new drugs, radiation.  What kind of man is Karl Kauberg?  Who is he?  What family did he grow up in, how was his life?  And most importantly, where did cruelty come from within it that went beyond human understanding? </p><p>  By the start of the war, Karl Kauberg was already 41 years old.  In the twenties, he served as chief physician in a clinic at the University of Koenigsberg.  Kaulberg was not a hereditary physician.  He was born into a family of artisans.  Why I decided to connect life with medicine is unknown.  But there is evidence according to which, in the First World War, he served as an infantryman.  Then he graduated from the University of Hamburg.  Apparently, medicine fascinated him so much that he refused a military career.  But Kaulberg was not interested in medicine, but in research.  In the early forties, he began searching for the most practical way to sterilize women who were not of the Aryan race.  For the experiments was transferred to Auschwitz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002885.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  Kaulberg's experiments </h2><p>  The experiments consisted in the introduction of a special solution into the uterus, which led to serious violations.  After the experiment, the reproductive organs were removed and sent to Berlin for further research.  There is no data on exactly how many women became victims of this "scientist".  After the war he was captured, but soon, only seven years later, oddly enough, was released according to the prisoner of war agreement.  Returning to Germany, Kaulberg did not suffer from remorse.  On the contrary, he was proud of his "achievements in science."  As a result, complaints began to come from people affected by Nazism.  He was arrested again in 1955.  In prison, he spent even less time this time.  Two years after the arrest, he died. </p><h2>  Joseph Mengele </h2><p>  The prisoners nicknamed this man the "angel of death."  Josef Mengele personally met trains with new prisoners and made a selection.  Some went to the gas chambers.  Others are at work.  He used the third in his experiments.  One of the prisoners of Auschwitz described this man as follows: "A tall, <span>slender man</span> with a good appearance, looks like a movie actor."  He never raised his voice, spoke politely - and this terrified the prisoners in particular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002895.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  From the biography of the angel of death </h2><p>  Josef Mengele was the son of a German entrepreneur.  After graduating from high school, he studied medicine and anthropology.  In the early thirties, he joined the Nazi organization, but soon, due to health reasons, left it.  In 1932, Mengele joined the SS.  During the war he served in the medical forces and even received the Iron Cross for courage, but was wounded and declared unfit for service.  Mengele spent several months in the hospital.  After recovery, he was sent to Auschwitz, where he launched his scientific activities. </p><h2>  Selection </h2><p>  The selection of victims for experiments was Mengele's favorite pastime.  The doctor needed only one glance at the prisoner in order to determine the state of his health.  He sent most of the prisoners to gas chambers.  And only a few captives managed to delay death.  It was hard for someone in whom Mengele saw "experimental rabbits." </p><p>  Most likely, this person suffered from an extreme form of mental disorder.  He even enjoyed the thought that he had a huge number of human lives in his hands.  That is why every time he was next to the train arrived.  Even when this was not required of him.  His criminal actions were guided not only by a desire for scientific research, but also a thirst for control.  Just one of his words was enough to send tens or hundreds of people into gas chambers.  Those that went to laboratories became material for experiments.  But what was the purpose of these experiments? </p><p>  Invincible faith in Aryan utopia, obvious mental deviations - these are the components of Joseph Mengele's personality.  All his experiments were aimed at creating a new tool that could stop the reproduction of representatives of objectionable peoples.  Mengele not only equated himself with God, he placed himself above him. </p><h2>  The experiences of Joseph Mengele </h2><p>  The angel of death anatomized infants, castrated boys and men.  He performed operations without anesthesia.  The experiments on women consisted of high voltage electric shocks.  He conducted these experiments in order to test endurance.  Once Mengele sterilized several Polish nuns by means of x-ray radiation.  But the main passion of the ‚Äúdoctor of death‚Äù was experiments on twins and people with physical defects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2002882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2002882.jpg?1540671359"></div><h2>  To each his own </h2><p>  At the gates of Auschwitz it was written: Arbeit macht frei, which means "labor liberates."  The words Jedem das Seine were also present.  Translated into Russian - "To each his own."  At the gates of Auschwitz, at the entrance to the camp, in which more than a million people found their death, a saying of ancient Greek sages appeared.  The principle of justice was used by the SS men as the motto of the most cruel idea in the history of mankind. </p>
