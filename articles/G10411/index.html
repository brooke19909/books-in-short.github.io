  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forensic Psychiatry</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Forensic psychiatry is an applied branch of general psychiatry.  Science (in the general psychiatric meaning) studies the laws of development, occurrence and the likely outcome of a particular group of diseases (pathologies).  These pathologies are accompanied by disturbances in the psyche.  The purpose of the study is to provide patients with appropriate care. </p><p>  Forensic psychiatry is engaged in the study of mental disorders in relation to the tasks to be solved in the course of the administration of justice in civil and criminal cases.  Based on the conclusions made by the relevant experts in this industry, the court makes procedural decisions.  In this case, the conclusions of forensic psychiatrists are subject to assessment in conjunction with other evidence.  The adoption of procedural decisions is carried out in the framework of civil or criminal proceedings.  All of the above facts defines this branch of medicine as ‚Äúforensic psychiatry‚Äù. </p><p>  <span>The criminal</span> justice process as part of a <span>preliminary investigation.</span>  In this regard, forensic psychiatric conclusions are applied both by the court and by the person conducting the inquiry (prosecutor or investigator). </p><p>  <span>The subject of the study</span> includes, in addition to accepted general descriptions (for example, diagnosis), additional information.  In particular, forensic psychiatry is not complete without forensic psychiatric assessment.  In other words, when examining the accused, the specialist concludes that the patient has had a chronic mental illness for several years.  In general practice, a diagnosis is sufficient to make a decision on providing care to a patient.  Forensic science and psychiatry, in particular, require the use of additional rather specific criteria.  So, a specialist who assesses the mental state of the accused must answer the question of whether he (the accused) at the time of the commission of the act incriminated to him, could recognize the <span>social danger</span> and the actual nature of his action (inaction) or direct it.  This formulation allows you to determine the severity (depth) of the defeat of the accused with a mental illness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Forensic psychiatry also evaluates other features of mental disorders.  For example, the use of coercive measures is only advisable if the accused is in danger due to his illness.  When the <span>mental state</span> changes, the use of medical coercive measures is suspended even if the disease has not been completely eliminated and the accused remains mentally unhealthy. </p><p>  Forensic psychiatrist performs activities that have several directions, relatively independent.  Moreover, each direction has its own tasks and methods for solving them.  In addition, specific legal forms are used that limit the activities of the above specialist. </p><p>  Forensic psychiatric examination is considered the main activity of a specialist who studies the mental state of the accused in a criminal or civil offense.  She is appointed by the body or person leading the proceedings.  At the same time, tasks are formulated that represent certain questions to a specialist expert.  The research prescribing bodies collect and provide materials to specialists, select specialists (institution or individuals), and evaluate the conclusions based on the results of the studies.  If there is <span>agreement</span> with the conclusions of the <span>experts, the conclusions</span> are applied when making decisions on the processes. </p><p>  It should be noted that specialists conducting the above studies are not vested with authority.  In this regard, statements such as ‚Äúexperts, recognizing the accused as insane, sent him to compulsory treatment, relieving him of responsibility‚Äù are incorrect.  Such decisions are made only by the court. </p>
