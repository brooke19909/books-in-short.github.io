Divorce or not?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is very difficult to choose a good bank in Russia for deposits and other transactions.  The Central Bank revokes licenses from many organizations, branch offices are closed, and new ones are hardly opened.  And all this only complicates the choice.  Nevertheless, now we have to find out about the "Rocketbank" reviews.  Is it a divorce or a real bank that does not face any closure?  It‚Äôs worth understanding this.  Indeed, this organization every day declares itself louder. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank reviews divorce" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079652.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  So, it‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that our current company is a completely new word in development.  The thing is that Rocketbank is an Internet bank that is becoming popular on the net and among the population.  There are no analogues in Russia yet.  This means that such an approach is nothing but novelty.  And it does not inspire confidence in everyone. </p><p>  What do the <span>Rocketbank reviews</span> say <span>?</span>  Is it a divorce or a real bank that really works?  Understand right away - since we are dealing with a new word in organizations, you will not find any offices or branches of Rocketbank in your city.  It turns out that the organization exists only "in words".  Should I trust her?  And anyway, how to contact her?  How to become a contributor?  Indeed, in order to open, say, a deposit, it is necessary not only to come to a working branch of the bank, but also to bring certain documents with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Working method </h2><p>  Immediately refuse to get acquainted with our today's organization is not worth it.  Even if it‚Äôs very scary to be cheated.  The thing is that at ‚ÄúRocketbank‚Äù the personal account plays the role of a kind of branch.  What are you talking about? </p><p>  Our bank is an Internet site that carries out banking activities.  So assure his customers.  In order to become a contributor, it is enough to go through a small registration process, as well as gain access to your account.  Rocketbank has a personal account there.  With it, you can use any services of the organization.  And their list is easy and simple to read on the website in a special section.  So, ‚ÄúRocketbank‚Äù still receives positive reviews.  But are they true?  In real life, it‚Äôs risky to trust Internet resources that are not on the world map at all.  No branches, offices or divisions.  A dubious reputation, isn't it?  There is every reason to believe that the Rocketbank is receiving not so good reviews.  Is it a scam or not?  The question can be answered only after a thorough study of the bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079650.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Map </h2><p>  In order to somehow inspire confidence, Rocketbank came up with an interesting system of work.  In addition to the online account, you get a special plastic card.  And she will help you make deals in the organization.  It is unlikely that scammers will make cards for everyone, send them out, serve them, so that they can "tear off money" and hide from view. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Plus, Rocketbank in Russia is a new word in lending.  Many users on the network urge you to try contacting the company.  It is not necessary to contribute.  Just check the health of the system.  Making a plastic card is free of charge.  And it is carried out immediately after the registration of a new user.  Rocketbank receives real reviews of a diverse nature.  In some they urge organizations to believe, in others they warn.  What else good can be said about the innovation?  And is it worth it? </p><h2>  Cooperation </h2><p>  In truth, yes.  After all, the organization, as management assures, is not just a "mushroom after the rain."  And you can and even need to trust her.  ‚ÄúRocketbank‚Äù receives real reviews of people of various nature mainly after the audience is informed about the cooperation of this dubious company with well-known banks in Russia.  For example, the most common option is to merge with Otkritie Bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank negative reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079651.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, words are confirmed by actions.  The documents do not mention any merger, but the Rocketbank administration says that they created and issued a new type of Otkritie-Rocket cards.  With it, you can manage funds in two organizations at once.  A tempting and interesting offer.  Only it does not inspire confidence in many.  And "Rocketbank" real reviews of investors begins to earn not quite good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Is it worth believing the organization‚Äôs dubious collaboration with other banks?  This is everyone‚Äôs business.  Someone trusts such statements, someone does not.  But one thing can be said - the bank does have a Discovery-Rocket card.  And you can make it with the help of the well-known personal account on the official website.  The question is different - does it work?  Is its use dangerous for Otkritie Bank?  After all, no organization will begin to produce a joint plastic card.  Not entirely honest and reliable.  Yes, and customers can easily lose. </p><h2>  The story of the "Discovery" </h2><p>  "Rocketbank" begins to earn negative reviews from potential customers after they try to learn more about cooperation with popular banks in Russia.  And far from the site administration.  To understand whether it is really possible to trust the news on the official page of "Rocketbank", it is enough to visit the "Discovery" branch.  And already directly there to learn about cooperation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank negative reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079649.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In many regions, the results are shocking - managers and cashiers have no idea what they are talking about.  So, it should be assumed that Rocketbank is a divorce.  Reviews of customers who have used his services for some time often have a negative connotation.  Especially after contacting the Bank "Discovery".  As already mentioned, it is unlikely that someone will confirm the cooperation. </p><p>  But if you managed to get to the administration or management of a bank branch, then the results of the interrogations are again shocking.  It is possible that the head will confirm the words that ‚ÄúRocketbank‚Äù is their peculiar branch, which was opened for the convenience of customer service.  And then what to believe?  Managers and cashiers who may not be up to date with everything that is happening, or management talking about some incredible innovations? </p><h2>  After binding </h2><p>  Trust your intuition.  She will surely prompt the correct answer.  As practice shows, ‚ÄúRocketbank‚Äù receives negative reviews in most cases because customers simply do not trust cooperation and a joint card called ‚ÄúOtkritie-Rocket‚Äù.  And those who have already taken advantage of it have regretted. </p><p>  As soon as the new joint card is in your hands, you will have to bind it to deposits in Otkritie Bank.  And only after that it will be possible to work with it: withdraw funds, replenish accounts and so on.  The whole process takes place in your account on the Rocketbank website.  Tied?  Wonderful.  And now - the most interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank positive reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079648.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Check card balance.  For example, funds remaining in your account or deposit.  About Rocketbank, real reviews of people say that the money from Otkritie Bank simply evaporates, disappears somewhere.  And to calculate where exactly is impossible.  To do this, you will have to go to the Rocketbank branch.  And where to go if it is a clean Internet resource?  The Bank "Discovery" will not give any information.  If you make a request for details, it will be shown that you allegedly withdrew funds from the account yourself and took them.  And that means, at a minimum, the Otkritie-Rocket joint card is nothing but a real scam and deceit.  A very tricky move by scammers.  But is all this the work of Rocketbank?  Or were they just framed? </p><h2>  Work with card </h2><p>  As practice shows, it is really possible to work on the Rocketbank website.  And make full use of your personal account as well.  In addition, replenishing the balance of a plastic card (registered) is also possible.  No cheating, nothing suspicious.  And so many people believe that Otkritie Bank simply substitutes its competitor with a joint card. </p><p>  But take your time.  Try to pay with a Rocket card in a store.  Happened?  Unlikely.  Is it possible to withdraw funds from it?  After all, there are no bank ATMs in Russian cities.  It turns out that you can only use the Internet to spend the available funds?  Because of this incident, not the best ones get Rocketbank reviews.  Is it a divorce?  Or just an innovation that was not well thought out? </p><p>  In truth, if there is no way to pay on a bank card in a store, then it‚Äôs likely that we are fraudsters.  No matter how sad it may sound, but most investors really think so.  What is the point of issuing a card if it can hardly be used in any way?  Moreover, replenishment of funds can take place only with the help of virtual payments.  Very doubtful, is it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank real depositor reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079647.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Loss of funds </h2><p>  Indeed it is.  Rocketbank reviews are also negative by consumers who risked and replenished the balance of the card of the same name using an electronic wallet.  What is the result? </p><p>  Such depositors were deceived.  Funds were debited to the card, but they can‚Äôt be used in any way.  And the money from the balance of the electronic wallet also disappeared.  People were simply deceived, robbed.  Good fraudulent move.  But to prove it is difficult.  After all, "Rocketbank" does not exist in principle.  More precisely, as already mentioned, there is not a single one of its real branches in Russia.  And no one knows where to file complaints.  Any attempts to contact the site administration fail. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  By the way, not very radiant receives "Rocketbank" reviews.  This is a divorce, as many website visitors claim, who have not even tried to join the system.  Just look in the "Contacts" section.  And everything will become clear. </p><p>  The problem is that you will not see the actual or legal address of the organization in this section.  Phone number - purchased.  It has a format of 8 800. And any fraudster can get this number.  There are no specific data for communication with the organization. </p><p>  Among other things, there is only a dubious email, where you can contact with your questions.  Plus community on social networks.  There is no trust in such associations.  So, there are no guarantees of communication with the company management. </p><h2>  Reputation </h2><p>  Of course, the level of trust in Rocketbank is very low.  And his reputation among users is not the best.  All this, despite numerous positive reviews of the company.  Where, then, does the service so gaining momentum come from? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rocketbank real people reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1079646.jpg"></div>

    <p>  She, as it‚Äôs not hard to guess, is simply bought.  That is, someone is paid only for attracting new potential investors.  Pay good reviews, advertising and so on.  This is a very common technique that has long been known to everyone.  Do not trust even the many good words addressed to "Rocketbank", which are confirmed by screenshots.  They are easy to fake. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, today we found out what the "Rocketbank" reviews are.  Divorce is pure water.  That‚Äôs exactly what you think.  But everyone solves this issue for himself.  Practice has already shown that this organization is doubtful.  And she does not provide any guarantees.  So, you do not need to contact her. </p><p>  Carefully choose a bank for deposits.  And avoid internet offers.  There are many scammers on the World Wide Web.  Be careful.  It is better to find a well-known bank, a branch of which is located in your city.  In this case, the probability of fraud is reduced to zero. </p>
