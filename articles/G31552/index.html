In addition, the first Galaxy Tab, code-named P5100, entered the market with a clearly unattractive price.  This, of course, scared away many buyers, including even ardent fans of the brand. </p><p>  But in the case of the Samsung Galaxy GT-P5110, the situation has changed dramatically.  The gadget received not only an attractive set of chipsets, but also an adequate price for itself.  Despite the venerable age for such a technique (2012), the device is still relevant and can be found on sale.  But first things first. </p><p>  We present to your attention a review of the tablet GT-P5110 from Samsung.  Consider the remarkable characteristics of the gadget, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as reviews of the owners.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the GT-P5110 tablet can be called standard for its form factor: 257 x 175 x 9.7 mm and weighs 588 grams.  The ergonomics of the gadget are also at an average level.  It is convenient both to hold in hands and to work with it on a table or knees.  Ergonomic users leave mostly neutral reviews. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Unlike the previous generation models, the back of the GT-P5110 Galaxy Tab is not made from smooth material, but from rough.  The gadget is pleasant to the touch and does not strive to slip out of hands.  Judging by user reviews, there are no problems with one-handed grip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cactusdesigners.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung gt p5110" class="if uuid-3127363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127363.jpg"></div><p>  The housing is resistant to minor scratches and slight dirt.  So, with a rather careful attitude to the tablet GT-P5110, the cover can not be taken.  Modification in gray design (there is still the old and black) looks very impressive.  The range is so well selected that the model looks not just gray, but metal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Black frames around the perimeter of the device harmoniously merge into the design, even despite the decent sizes by today's standards.  In its place is the dynamics.  They are located on the sides and just above the central part of the gadget.  Judging by user reviews, the speakers do not overlap their hands in either vertical or horizontal orientation. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  At the top of the Samsung GT-P5110 are a standard 3.5 mm mini-jack for headphones, a SIM card slot and a slot for micro-SD-drive.  The latter supports flash drives up to 32 GB.  The bottom end is reserved for a universal connector: power / charge / sync with a PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stellatech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gt p5110 galaxy" class="if uuid-3127362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127362.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the GT-P5110 can act not only as a web tool for surfing, but also a phone.  Working in tandem with a headset allows you to easily communicate both via video messengers and the usual method of calling subscribers through a regular contact book. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  For a screen diagonal of 10 inches, a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels is enough.  Judging by the reviews, pixelation can not be traced even with careful consideration.  The screen format involves viewing content in a 720p scan, which is more than enough in most cases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet gt p5110" class="if uuid-3127364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127364.jpg"></div><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbuilt on PLS TFT technology.  Yes, this is not branded AMOLED or even IPS, but the output image is decent.  The same can be said about viewing angles.  The only thing users complain about in their reviews is the glossy surface of the display. </p><p>  To work with the GT-P5110 on a nice sunny day will not work.  The screen fades and acts more like a mirror.  In such cases, the maximum level of brightness helps, but it is best to just find a place in the shadow.  The contrast margin is at a decent level, so you can experiment with the screen settings almost any way.  Auto-adjustment of brightness works as it should and there are no complaints about it. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Responsible for the performance is the TI OMAP 4430 proprietary chipset set based on the Cortex A9, which is paired with the PowerVR SGX 540 graphics accelerator. But two cores and 1 GB of RAM are too few for today's needs.  The Antutu test is attached (photo below). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theregister.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy gt p5110" class="if uuid-3127365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127365.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the tablet copes with ordinary tasks with dignity.  Judging by user reviews, there are no slowdowns and lags when working with the browser and viewing video content (720p). </p><p>  Problems begin during the launch of gaming applications.  Serious and modern programs slow down, freeze and do not want to work.  Of course, simple games in the format of "three in a row" or "turrets" go without problems, but shooters, races and other demanding software refuses to work. </p><p>  When choosing game applications in the same Google Play, you should focus on the year of release.  If this is older than 2014, then there should not be any special problems.  In other cases, you have to reset the graphic settings to the minimum value, if the program starts at all. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Marketers of the company immediately warned potential buyers that the gadget is positioned as a multimedia rather than a photo tool.  Therefore, you can‚Äôt count on high-quality images.  Yes, and the quality of the matrices of both cameras does not have this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sammobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy tab gt p5110" class="if uuid-3127366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127366.jpg"></div><p>  A 3MP rear peephole can take a picture of the text, which can then be parsed, but provided that it has a font of at least 12 pins.  The front camera, except for communicating on video messengers, is not suitable.  Faces, though obtained with noticeable pixelation, but judging by the reviews, many users have enough of this. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The tablet received a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 7000 mAh.  The chipset set cannot be called exacting in any way, but the voracious Android platform still leaves no chance for long battery life. </p><p>  If you load the tablet to the full (Wi-Fi, video and maximum screen brightness), then the battery will be discharged in six hours.  In a more gentle mode, the battery lasts for 8-9 hours.  If you use the gadget as a book and music player, then you can extend the working time for a day or more. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, users are generally satisfied with the autonomy of the tablet.  Not every modern smartphone can boast such a long work.  So users have no serious claims to autonomy. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, the device deserves the right to be purchased.  Here we have a high-quality assembled and convenient tablet with a large screen.  The model is perfect for surfing, watching videos, talking on video messengers and reading books.  Modern gaming applications, the gadget, alas, will not pull.  And the price does not contribute to this in any way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tecnologia.facilisimo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet galaxy tab gt p5110" class="if uuid-3127367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3127367.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that, in addition to communicating via video messengers, the tablet can act as a regular phone.  Such an opportunity will come in handy if the Internet is unavailable for some reason, but you need to make a call. </p><p>  There are no questions to the software either.  The company never included any advertising elements or other ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù in the firmware, which we see on gadgets from China.  The company launcher behaves appropriately and does not lag. </p><p>  Most of the users, judging by the reviews, are happy with the purchase of this model and recommend it to the rest, those who need an intelligent multimedia gadget. </p>
