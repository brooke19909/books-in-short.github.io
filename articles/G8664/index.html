Political subjects are people who are actively involved in political life.  Its driving force is the interests of people, groups, <span>social communities</span> and so on.  A person participating in such relationships can act in different qualities, therefore, a classification of subjects is required. </p><p>  <strong>Classification</strong> </p><p>  Political entities are quantitatively subdivided into single (citizens, <span>stateless persons,</span> foreigners) and groups (elites, estates, ethnic groups, fractions, and others). </p><p>  On a legal basis, political subjects are divided into physical (citizens) and legal <span>(socio-political organizations).</span> </p><p>  In areas of politics - on subjects of foreign (state, peoples, interstate associations) and domestic (citizens, parties) politics. </p><p>  According to the primary or secondary participation of actors in politics, they are divided into two groups.  The first includes citizens, nations, classes, political elites and other social groups.  The second includes states, interstate <span>associations, socio-political</span> movements and organizations. </p><p>  The policy object is understood as a person, legal entities, social groups that are under the influence of the subject.  Thus, the subjects and objects of politics are inextricably linked.  Political relations arise between them.  They can be vertical and horizontal.  The former involve domination and submission, while the latter manifest themselves in the form of coordination and coordination of actions, cooperation of subjects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Which policy actors exist?</strong> </p><ul><li>  Small groups, that is, few in composition of the community of people who are in direct personal communication, are united by common interests and one activity.  They are divided into formal and informal.  The first include family, student group, school class, brigade, parliamentary faction, etc.  The second includes friendly companies, circles, sects. </li><li>  Political organizations, that is, movements, parties, unions, associations, clubs, societies and others.  As subjects of politics, they are divided into formal and informal.  The former are parties, unions and societies, the latter are popular fronts, political movements, and <span>civil initiatives.</span> </li><li>  <span>Public organizations,</span> that is, organizations whose program documents do not contain political goals. </li><li>  The elite, that is, the "top" of society.  The political elite is made up of officials of government bodies (executive, representative, military, law enforcement and information institutions).  The part of the elite that directly administers the state is called the ruling. </li><li>  Socio-political classes.  Depending on the class to which the individual belongs, the size of his income, the nature of work and his lifestyle depend.  The class that is in power is dominant.  He acts on the rest of the classes through laws, economics, the media, and other leverage. </li><li>  Nations and ethnic groups.  There are 3 forms of community of people: tribal (primitive system), nationality (era of slavery) and nation (capitalism).  These historical communities are also called ethnic groups.  A nation determines whether an individual belongs to any ethnic community.  Relations between nations and ethnic groups in one state are political in nature, as they are connected with the institution of power. </li><li>  Confessional groups.  By confessionalism is meant a way of thinking, acting, which corresponds to the requirements and dogmas of a particular religion.  As subjects of politics, they exert a great influence on it. </li></ul>
