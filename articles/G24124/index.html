The mountains here are riddled with millennia ago, and scientists are trying to find out all their secrets. </p><h2>  Where is the Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex located? </h2><p>  The natural miracle, which got its name from a nearby village, is located on the Ai River (Chelyabinsk Region), which is 30 kilometers from the city of Satka, the administrative center of the Satka region.  Its bend forms a picturesque meadow surrounded by dense forests and the Tuy-Tyube mountain range. </p>

    <p>  Many centuries ago there was a plain on this place with calcareous rocks of soils.  Layer after layer of water eroded the ground, exposing the cliff.  In impregnable rock, over time, a whole system of branched labyrinths formed.  It is no coincidence that in the underground grottoes there was the only settlement of ancient people on the territory of our country, and during the Christianization the Old Believers were hiding from persecution.  Now there are working archaeologists, as well as fishermen and hunters. </p><h2>  An ancient underground city that has no analogues in Russia </h2><p>  In 1995, Chelyabinsk scientists found on the coastal line the world's largest local underground complex, which was later declared by the authorities as a historical and cultural monument.  The ancient city, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã425 square meters, is a unique territory, and many researchers compare its discovery with the excavations of Troy, which was considered a fiction of the great Homer.  Archaeologists jokingly call the Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex, consisting of 43 grottoes, an apartment building of the Paleolithic era and claim that the labyrinths are still suitable for life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sikiyaz Tamak cave complex photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1937443.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 14 rooms, archaeologists discovered traces of seven historical periods - the main stages in the development of human civilization.  It is curious that animals lived here in all the climatic zones of the mountainous region of Russia, and their bones speak about this fact.  In addition, the researchers collected huge material that reveals the life of the inhabitants of the dungeon: tools, weapons, jewelry, the remains of ceramic vessels, wood, silver and gold. </p><h2>  Underground labyrinths </h2><p>  The discoverers of the Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex gave names to the underground halls, in which it is always sunny in the afternoon.  So, the Grotto "Dance", investigated first, got its name due to its absolutely flat surface. </p><p>  And the Sysoevskaya cave is recognized as the longest, which is not so easy to get into, because it has a very narrow hole, and those who are afraid of enclosed space will not be able to overcome the test.  The 60-meter labyrinth with branched passages is loved by fans to tickle their nerves. </p><h2>  The karst miracle, where scientists are still working </h2><p>  The discovered ancient sanctuary with the skulls of <span>cave bears,</span> where the inhabitants of the underground kingdom worshiped their gods, proved the fact that in the grottoes people not only lived, but also performed various rites and even buried their relatives.  It is known that in the Ai River valley for many centuries there was a cult of worship of a predator.  The grotto under the name "Bear" was walled up by scientists so that lovers of illegal excavations could not get there, and only those who discovered it knew the road to the tunnel hidden in the heart of the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Scientists work all year round in the karst miracle, which has no analogues in Russia, and the number of finds is only growing. </p><h2>  Wonderful vacation spot </h2><p>  Every year, the Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex is becoming increasingly popular.  Tourists come here for the night, admiring the wonderful views of nature and discovering something new in the underground labyrinths. </p><p>  Visitors to the miraculous masterpiece celebrate the delightful views of the beautiful resting place on the Ay River, the glades along which stretch for almost two kilometers.  A fascinating tourist route will introduce not only the unique beauty of nature, but also with the history and ancient legends of the region. </p><p>  A wonderful corner where you want to return is considered a symbol of the Southern Urals, and the Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex is its main attraction.  Even two days is not enough to inspect the mountain range and all the grottoes, pick up berries, catch fish and swim in the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sikiyaz Tamak cave complex" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1937439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As tourists admit, this is a very attractive place, giving positive emotions.  True, it will be difficult for physically unprepared vacationers to climb to a height of 75 meters along rather steep slopes.  You can still visit the village of the same name, which was abandoned, but with the development of tourism flourished and grew.  Many visitors bought the houses, and now they live here in the summer and rent rooms to tourists. </p><h2>  Sikiyaz-Tamak cave complex: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the natural site by car from two settlements: go to the labyrinths from the village of Mezhevoy and walk along the forest road for about two kilometers, in addition, from the village of Lakly it is not difficult to get to the local attraction on a good primer.  However, those who choose the second option will have to cross the Ai River or cross the boat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sikiyaz Tamak cave complex how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1937440.jpg" width="600"></div>
