    <h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  As you know, for a vacation hotel for a traveler becomes a kind of second home.  And, of course, each of us wants to live in a comfortable room where there is everything necessary, have a beautiful view from the window, count on excellent service and varied quality food.  Invaluable help in choosing a hotel, according to many tourists, is provided by studying the reviews of those who already had a chance to visit a particular place.  After all, former guests had the opportunity to learn about the pros and cons of a particular hotel, and they are ready to share this information with those who are just planning their vacation.  We are proposing today to find out together the opinion of our compatriots who have recently visited the Konstantinos The Great Beach Hotel in Cyprus.  Just note that, judging by the comments of travelers, the Constantinos The Great 5-star hotel received a well-deserved.  So, most tourists were very pleased with the location and level of service in this hotel.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="constantinos the great beach hotel 5 protaras" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  In general, travelers were satisfied with the location of the hotel.  So, according to them, the hotel is located in a place with well-developed infrastructure.  Near it there are restaurants, bars, cafes, shops, playgrounds, travel agencies, car rental agencies, etc. There is also a promenade along which tourists enjoy walking, admiring the coast and looking at other Protaras hotels.  A big plus of the hotel is the fact of being close to the sea. </p><p>  As for the own territory of Constantinos The Great Beach Hotel 5 * (Cyprus), then it is not very big.  However, there is never a feeling of crowding and there is enough space for everyone. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots did not complain about the conditions of accommodation in this hotel.  Judging by their reviews, the rooms here are quite spacious, with fresh repairs and beautiful views, especially if you are booking apartments with sea views.  As for furniture, it is not new.  However, everything is of high quality and in good condition.  The same goes for technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel constantinos great beach hotel 5 protaras cyprus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  The reviews of Constantinos The Great Beach Hotel 5 * (Protaras) left by travelers indicate the fact that newly arrived guests who arrived early in the morning are most likely to check in immediately after breakfast.  This is an undoubted advantage, since vacationers tired of the road do not have to wait for the estimated time until two in the afternoon.  However, judging by the comments of tourists, there was a fly in the ointment.  So, a number of our compatriots note that their arrival at the hotel was at the height of the holiday season - upon arrival they were told that there was no apartment of the category they booked in the hotel.  Therefore, for 2-3 days they were forced to live in a nearby hotel of the same chain.  However, its level is much lower.  So, officially it has four stars, but, according to many vacationers, at best it ‚Äúpulls‚Äù three.  As compensation, the hotel management offered guests meals on the "ol inclusive" system and free use of the safe and the Internet. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, it is supposed to release the occupied room before noon.  Also, if you wish, you can extend your stay at the hotel if your flight is in the evening.  This service is provided for an additional fee, in addition, it is advisable to notify the administration in advance of its need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of the hotel constantinos the great beach hotel 5 protaras" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239251.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  To the level of service at Constantinos The Great Beach Hotel 5 * (Protaras) no complaints from our compatriots were noted.  On the contrary, according to tourists, the staff here does an excellent job.  In addition, all hotel staff are always friendly, hospitable and happy to help in resolving any issue.  In addition, many workers have a good command of the Russian language, which is why our compatriots do not have any communication difficulties here. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking accommodation in the hotel in question, you can choose the option of catering that suits you.  Judging by the reviews, many tourists prefer the "half board" option.  After all, according to them, they want to be able to eat outside the hotel at least once a day to try the famous Cretan cuisine in different restaurants.  I must say that most travelers consider this option the most optimal.  After all, even despite the fact that the food at the hotel is organized at a very decent level, for example, some guests lacked fish dishes.  Otherwise, there were no complaints about the menu on the part of vacationers.  So, they note that for lunch and dinner there was always a choice of at least three to four meat dishes, a lot of salads, snacks, side dishes, sweets, vegetables and fruits.  Our compatriots also found breakfast very diverse. </p><p>  Vacationers also notice that there is a snack bar on the beach.  In it you can not only order alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, but also have a snack during the day with french fries, pizza, a sandwich and other fast food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel constantinos the great 5 stars" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Constantinos Great Beach Hotel 5 * hotel (Protaras, Cyprus) offers its guests all the conditions for a magnificent beach holiday.  So, first of all, it is worth noting that you can walk to the sea from the hotel in just a couple of minutes.  In this case, on the way you will have to cross only the pedestrian promenade.  The hotel has its own fairly large beach, equipped with a bar and enough comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas to protect from the sun.  Many tourists, especially those having a rest with young children, also note a very comfortable, gentle and safe entry into the water on the hotel's beach.  According to them, in many neighboring hotels the situation is not so good.  Judging by the reviews of travelers, the sea itself in Protaras is very clean and calm most of the time.  Swimming here, they said, is a pleasure. </p>
