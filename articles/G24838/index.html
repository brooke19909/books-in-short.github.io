The meager choice in the souvenir shop is the reason for writing a negative opinion about this institution. </p><p>  However, most who have been here before come back here again.  There are many reasons for this.  As noted by many guests, the <span>Nika Island Resort service offers an upscale service.</span>  Ubiquitous Wi-Fi, complete solitude and abstracting from society, the possibility of a good rest with a lot of entertainment - this is what makes the spa guests come back here again.  In general, if you managed to get a last-minute ticket to the Maldives, opt for the hotel in question.  According to many tourists, you will not regret it.  The administration and all hotel staff take care of the comfortable stay of each guest. </p><p>  And finally, I would like to talk about the weather in the Maldives (for months) in order to know when it is better to plan a trip. </p><h2>  When is it better to go on vacation to the Maldives? </h2><p>  In order to answer this question, it is worthwhile to carefully study the weather in the Maldives for months.  In the period from December to April, the largest number of tourists is here, since the water temperature in this period ranges from 28-30 degrees.  But from May to November it is cooler - 26-27 degrees.  This season has a low season.  However, the Maldives accept tourists all year round.  There are no dates for the beginning and end of the beach season.  Blue waters and white sands await tourists at any time convenient for them. </p>
