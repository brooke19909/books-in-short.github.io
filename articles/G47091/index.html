It’s easy to guess - just look at the map.  The forty-third degree of northern latitude and the seaside location determine that the summer months spent in this city will give you a wonderful bronze tan and an excellent beach holiday.  The tourist infrastructure <span>in the Primorsky Territory</span> is well developed.  The shores of the Amur and Ussuri bays are covered by a network of elite and modest <span>resorts, resort</span> hotels, boarding houses, and recreation centers.  And very close to vacationers are waiting for the entertainment of the big city - museums, cinema and concert halls, stadiums, exhibitions.  What are the most popular beaches of Vladivostok?  Where can I go swimming?  These questions are by no means idle.  Because the big city will inevitably worsen the environmental background.  In this article we will consider the best places to stay in this area of ​​the Primorsky Territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladivostok beaches" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1017000.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The specifics of the beaches of Vladivostok </h2><p>  City authorities take care of the leisure of citizens and visiting tourists.  The coastline of Vladivostok is so long that no budget is enough for arranging all the beaches.  Therefore, a wise decision was made to encourage entrepreneurs to take coastal patronage.  They are obliged to ensure the safety of vacationers (lifeguards, first-aid posts, warning boards), to develop infrastructure (locker rooms, parking lots, entertainment) and to monitor cleanliness (public toilets, bins and garbage collection, cleaning the territory).  In exchange for services, entrepreneurs are allowed to “milk” those who come to the beach.  This means that the rental of sun loungers, umbrellas and other ammunition, the use of the toilet and parking is for money.  But admission to the best beaches of Vladivostok remains free.  To lure tourists on their coast, entrepreneurs embark on all sorts of tricks.  Someone sets up comfortable tents for sunbathing, someone focuses on entertainment on the water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does Rospotrebnadzor advise </h2><p>  This government agency is very strict and uncompromising.  He constantly monitors the beaches, takes water samples to detect all kinds of harmful chemical impurities and pathogenic bacteria.  Rospotrebnadzor rejected many places of recreation within the city limits.  This is Cape Kungasny, Tikhaya Bay, the area of ​​Morgorodok station.  There is a discharge of sewage into the sea.  It is also not recommended to take a dip in Fedorov’s bay and in the Zmeinki area, as there are parking lots.  And which beaches of Vladivostok are recognized by Rospotrebnadzor as clean and suitable for swimming?  There are only seven of them.  These are just three <span>beaches in the</span> bay of Lazurnaya, which is popularly called Shamora.  They relate to Primorsktourist CJSC and LOTS LLC.  The third coast is called Voyage Plus.  In the bay "Three Little Pigs" the beach at LLC Rus-2 is approved for swimming.  At the station "Sanatorium" a safe rest awaits you in the Park of Culture.  Lazo and the Riviera Lagoon.  And the whole Glass Bay (official name Ketovaya) is recognized as clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladivostok beaches where you can swim" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1017002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rating compiled by reviews of residents of Vladivostok </h2><p>  Who better than local citizens can suggest an acceptable coast for recreation?  RIA PrimaMedia decided to create a rating of “The best beaches of Vladivostok” and for this purpose it surveyed about two thousand residents of the city.  Almost forty percent of the respondents indicated that the best place of rest is Shamora Bay (Lazurnaya).  It is located in the city and even, one might say, in the center - on the Muravyov-Amursky peninsula, on its eastern shore.  Consequently, it is washed by Chamor by the waters of the Ussuri Bay.  A third of the respondents considered swimming in the city center risky, and advised them to go to the beaches located on the islands.  These small land areas are a natural extension of Cape Muravyov-Amursky.  In terms of beach holidays, the leading islands are Russky, Popova, Peschaniy.  The latter is located quite far from Vladivostok in the Amur Bay.  Also, the favorite places of summer rest for the townspeople are the Sanatornaya station, Pokrovsky park and Sportivnaya harbor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Vladivostok photo" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1017004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best beaches of Vladivostok according to nonresident tourists </h2><p>  Usually this category of vacationers sunbathes and bathes near the housing.  And if tourists do not choose the private sector, but boarding houses or motels, then the coastal zone of these institutions is quite suitable for them.  As a rule, these are suburban beaches of Vladivostok.  The photo of these places demonstrates that a delicate balance has been reached here between the wild and wonderful nature of the Primorsky Territory and developed infrastructure.  There are especially many recreation centers in the Amursky Bay, since it is smaller and warms up faster, and therefore can take the first beach people at the end of May.  The most popular and affordable in terms of price are the boarding houses “Energetik”, “Mostovik”, “White Swan”, “Mama Sakha”, “American-2”, “Cape Krutoy”.  These recreation centers offer not only comfortable housing, but also food - sometimes even according to the all-inclusive system so beloved by Russian tourists.  But Sidimi and Andreevka have recently been considered dirty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Vladivostok" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26186/815465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Glass Bay and others </h2><p>  Recently, new equipped vacation spots have appeared on the embankments of Vladivostok.  Therefore, if you want to swim and sunbathe, it is not necessary to go out of town.  Glass Bay in the <span>Ussuri Bay</span> is invariably popular with both residents and guests of Vladivostok.  What is its uniqueness?  The pebbles of this beach are colorful, the pebbles are very beautiful.  Despite the easy accessibility (after all, the bay is located in the city center, on Shield Street), the beach is very clean.  Excellent places for swimming are the "Seagull", "Mayak", Sedanka, Tokarevsky and Kungasny capes, Sports harbor, the station "Sanatorium", Sadgorod, Fedorov bays, Tikhaya and Ermine.  But the leader, according to tourists and citizens, is Chamora (Azure). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sandy beaches of Vladivostok" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1017007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sandy beaches of Vladivostok </h2><p>  What to do to those vacationers who do not like pebbles?  In Vladivostok and immediately beyond the city limits there are many coasts strewn with sand.  We will only list such beaches of Vladivostok.  Firstly, this is the “Seagull”.  The sand "At Lyokha" is pleased with the sand and developed infrastructure.  On Russky Island, which is connected to the city center by a bridge, there are also many convenient coasts.  In Ulysses Bay, the beach is sandy, but the bottom in the sea is rocky.  The same picture is observed in the Hassan region.  As for the suburban beaches, there are especially many sandy coasts on the islets that stretch in a chain from the Russian.  Some of them, such as Ricorda, are uninhabited.  In the village of Wrangel (200 km from Vladivostok) there is a clean beach.  And, recall, Chamora has a sand cover and a convenient entry into the water. </p>
