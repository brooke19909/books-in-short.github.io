At the same time, there are so many coastal cities and towns that you can come here on vacation every summer and discover something new.  For example, the new resort Orka Sunlife Resort &amp; Spa 5 * (Turkey) is built right on the side of the mountain, so it offers beautiful views of the bay of the Mediterranean Sea.  We will talk about it in more detail in this article, and also consider the reviews of former guests. </p><h2>  More about where this complex is located </h2><p>  Located in southwestern Turkey, Fethiye resort is considered one of the most unusual holiday destinations in the country.  And all thanks to its picturesque natural landscapes - low mountains stretch along the coast, which are almost completely covered with trees.  Only a few independent travelers came here a few years ago, since there were no large complexes here.  But now the resort is developing rapidly, so on its territory not only first-class large hotels are built, but all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable stay has been created.  At the same time, the Fethiye authorities managed to keep the nature of this land intact. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.563928" data-lng="29.133556999999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/1/4/5/3145.png"></div><p>  It is worthwhile to clarify that Orka Sunlife Resort &amp; Spa is located almost 7 km from the central part of Fethiye.  It would be more correct to say that the hotel is located in the village of Oludeniz, which is considered a national park in Turkey.  Its center is 700 meters from the complex, so the noise from the roads and infrastructure does not reach the hotel.  The main <span>attraction of Fethiye, the</span> Lycian Trail, is approximately 500 meters away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps the most significant drawback, according to tourists, is the remoteness of the hotel from the beach.  Since it is located on a mountainside, the distance to the sea is more than 2.5 km.  To reach the coast on foot, you need to spend a lot of time, so the hotel has prepared a special free bus for tourists. </p><p>  The nearest airport accepting flights from Russia is located near the city of Dalaman.  It is almost 60 km from Oludeniz, so it can take about 1-2 hours to get to the hotel. </p><h2>  Important hotel information </h2><p>  The newly built complex Orka Sunlife Resort &amp; Spa 5 * with great difficulty can be called a place for a budget holiday.  But the hotel is perfect for families with children, as well as those tourists who like a relaxing holiday.  It was built in 2013, so the number of rooms and public buildings have not yet become outdated.  As mentioned above, the complex is located on the side of a mountain and occupies a rather large area of ‚Äã‚Äã15,000 square meters.  m. It has built the main hotel building, which houses the administration, as well as 4 four-story residential buildings.  It should be noted that they are not all equipped with elevators.  Three-storey villas for respectable accommodation have also been built on site.  The buildings are decorated in a modern Mediterranean style.  The total number of rooms in the hotel is 195. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orkasunlifehotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the balcony" class="if uuid-2462473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2462473.jpg"></div><p>  Before buying a ticket to the complex, tourists should familiarize themselves with the rules of accommodation.  They do not differ much from the requirements of other similar Turkish hotels.  For example, you cannot come here with pets, but check-in with small children, on the contrary, is only welcome.  For the convenience of tourists from Russia, who are very numerous here, the hotel has Russian-speaking staff who will always help with solving pressing issues and problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Orka Sunlife Resort &amp; Spa: room description </h2><p>  This resort complex offers several categories of rooms at once, so that each guest can choose suitable apartments based on their own budget and request.
