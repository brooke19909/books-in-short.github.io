Leonov's quantum engine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The topic of space exploration in our time is no longer as popular as in the days of the USSR.  This is influenced by a huge number of factors, but the main one can be called the lack of evolution in the technical segment.  However, Russian scientist Vladimir Semenovich Leonov is working on a quantum engine. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  I would like to start with the history of a great man - Vladimir Semenovich Leonov, but, unfortunately, there is not so much information about him.  We can definitely say that this outstanding personality is a theoretical physicist and directly an experimenter.  Leonov also became a laureate <span>of the Russian Government Prize</span> in the nomination of technology and science.  It occupies a place in the first hundred leaders of industry and science of the Commonwealth.  He was recognized as the director of the year in the CIS in 2007.  He is the chief designer, as well as the head of ZAO NPO Kvanton.  Leonov is the author of the scientific discoveries of the quanton (quantum of space-time).  It was Leonov who created the theory of Superunification.  This theory was recognized as the theory of the century, and its direction was a new breath in the energy sector (both terrestrial and cosmic). </p>

    <p>  Also in 2007, Leonov built his own laboratory, which was named ‚ÄúLeonov's Laboratory‚Äù.  After, after a short time, he began to experiment with gravity, the essence of which was to control.  More precisely, he worked on the creation of such an engine that would create traction without freeing the reactive mass.  As a result, the scientist partially achieved this, now his creations are called ‚ÄúLeonov‚Äôs quantum engine‚Äù, many argue that this is the engine of the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So literally in a few words you can talk about this person.  As you can see, Leonov‚Äôs personality is not public and is known only in small circles, but his discoveries received great publicity.  It is precisely on them that I want to dwell in more detail. </p><h2>  Superfusion Theory </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to begin with what served as the prerequisite for the creation of the Leonov engine.  And this is directly the theory, which was called Superunions.  It is called so because it is designed to combine the four interactions.  But at the moment, science recognizes the existence of only three, the fourth element is missing - gravitational force.  The theory itself originated from <span>string theory</span> and supersymmetry by Albert Einstein.  In order not to go into details on this topic, it is worth saying only that it is the theory of Superunification that can bring such a science as energy to an absolutely new level. </p>

    <p>  And yet it consists in the fact that it assumes the ubiquitous presence of various elements, which, unfortunately, current science does not take into account at all.  However, these elements were amenable to publicity, and not by anyone, but by the very creator of the Periodic Table of Elements - Mendeleev.  Even more, the original view of the table included two null elements.  But alas, after it was processed and removed the "unnecessary" particles.  An element called Newtony is important for the theory of Superunification, it was an element of ether.  Mendeleev himself pinned great hopes on Newton, and he named him in honor of the great physicist Newton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Talking about the achievements of the scientist, they primarily mention his greatest aggregate, called Leonov's quantum engine. <strong> </strong>  When creating, its author just turned to such an element as Newtony.  However, Leonov himself did not call him that, he called him a canton, saying that only by interacting with this element would it be possible to create a power plant of a completely new generation. </p>

    <p>  Based on this, it is safe to say that the theory of Superunification has a right to exist, which many scientists are trying to refute.  However, Leonov found the courage to return to the past and recall the forgotten element, and not just remember, but use it as a starting point in his research. </p><p>  Further in the article, we will discuss directly the engine itself. </p><h2>  About the invention of Leonov </h2><p>  First of all, speaking of an aggregate called a quantum engine, <strong> </strong>  it is worth forgetting about such a phenomenon as a photon engine.  This is said by the author himself, since the second engine <strong> </strong>  has a completely different circuit and is not similar to quantum.  Now, for clarity, it is worth highlighting their main differences.  The bottom line is that the photon engine <strong> </strong>  It works due to the annihilation of antimatter and matter, that is, it creates reactive thrust, which pushes the object.  The quantum engine works in a completely different way.  For movement, it uses the energy of <span>gravitational waves</span> and the elasticity of space itself.  Scientists immediately rejected this option, calling it work by pseudoscience, and now they are only trying to modernize what has long been created and has simply exhausted its potential.  And this, roughly speaking, does not need to be proved, it is only necessary to take the characteristics of the first full-fledged Werner von Braun and modern rocket.  The fact is that a modern rocket engine <strong> </strong>  only twice the performance of the first.  It follows from this that the absolute limit has been reached, and further work in this direction will either be unsuccessful or simply meaningless. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For example, rocket engine <strong> </strong>  very dangerous, and the electric motor is not able to show great traction, that is, it is unsuitable for launching rockets into space.  And if you look at Leonov‚Äôs engine, it seems incredibly promising.  You can‚Äôt even imagine what changes will follow if it is successfully implemented.  It is clear that technology and, in particular, technology are fundamentally transformed.  In order to at least a little understand its potential, it is enough to say that theoretically with it you can reach the moon in four hours, and to Mars - in just two days. </p><h2>  Experiments with the engine </h2><p>  In the century of Leonov Vladimir Semenovich there was an incredible number of experiments and various experiments.  However, when asked about this, he immediately begins to talk about the most outstanding that happened in 2009.  The experimenter himself claims that then he was able to create a quantum <span>gravitational engine,</span> which gave acceleration to the object, without using reactive force in this matter.  This became a reference point, since from that time Leonov was able to vertically raise the object along the guide rails, without using the wheel drive.  This phenomenon, according to the creator himself, confirms the theory mentioned above. </p>

    <p>  After the overwhelming success, the hour of calm came, and five years later, only in 2014, bench tests were conducted where the engine of the future was presented <strong>.</strong>  He demonstrated incredible results: despite the fact that his weight was fifty-four kilograms, the thrust impulse reached unimaginable seven hundred kilogram-forces, while the acceleration was 10 joules.  It is also interesting that the engine itself requires only electricity and can work without a body.  Also, based on this experience, it was found that the cost of electricity is only one kilowatt.  These characteristics are stunning, because the most advanced rocket engine, <strong> </strong>  which exists now, generates only one tenth of a kilogram-force, wasting the same one kilowatt of electricity. </p><p>  Now it remains only to imagine what will happen if a quantum engine is created.  Then the payload of the rocket will reach ninety percent.  And this despite the fact that now it is only a meager five percent. </p><h2>  Skepticism of scientists </h2><p>  Despite the experiments, most scientists in this area are skeptical of Leonov‚Äôs engine, saying that his creation will not work in a vacuum. </p><p>  Vladimir Semyonovich himself answers the same, speaking out against the RAS and the commission on the fight against pseudoscience, in particular.  In 2012, he said that her activities could be called simply criminal, and the conversation that his project was hopeless was misinformation.  Leonov also has an opinion that the commission is a foreign special project that is designed to curb the technical progress of his country. </p>

    <p>  It is also impossible not to notice that developments in this direction are being carried out not only in Russia, but also abroad, in particular, in the west.  However, US quantum rocket engines, <strong> </strong>  Russia and China are doing differently, more precisely, their schemes are simply different, because no one wants to reveal their secrets.  But the success of our colleagues abroad is insignificant, in contrast to the domestic breakthrough. </p><p>  One cannot but note Leonov‚Äôs peppy enthusiasm and his patriotism, he simply does not look at the statements of the RAS and is confident that modernization and economic growth will come in only two to three years.  This, by the way, is comparable with the promises of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. </p><p>  Leonov also criticizes the discovery of the Higgs Boson.  Back in 2012, he opposed this idea, saying that the problem was solved back in 1996, when a zero element was discovered in the periodic table - the same quanton. </p><h2>  Advantages of the quantum engine </h2><p>  Above in the text, the many advantages of a quantum engine compared to a jet or photon one were listed.  But still it‚Äôs worth collecting everything in one place and combining everything into a list for convenience.  So, the Leonov engine has the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Ninety tons of payload.  In other words, nine hundred percent, while jet engines <strong> </strong>  reach only five percent. </li><li>  Maximum speed.  A rocket with this engine is capable of speeds of one thousand kilometers per second, while a taxiway develops eighteen kilometers per second. </li><li>  Ability to move with acceleration.  The device has a long traction impulse. </li><li>  The flight to the moon with this engine will last only three and a half hours, while to Mars - only two days. </li><li>  Universality.  Leonov‚Äôs engine can be used not only in the space industry, it will cope well in conditions such as underwater, in the air and on the ground. </li><li>  This engine will be able to increase the maximum flight altitude of the aircraft, so they can reach the mark of one hundred kilometers. </li><li>  Low fuel consumption.  The engine needs very little energy, due to the fact that the devices will fly by inertia. </li><li>  The aircraft will be able to fly the whole year without additional refueling. </li><li>  If a quantum engine is installed on the machine, and, in turn, it is fueled with cold fusion fuel, the car will be able to drive ten million kilometers without stopping at gas stations. </li><li>  This engine is powered by electric energy. </li></ol><p>  Of course, this is an incomplete list of the positive qualities of the engine, because all this exists only in theory.  And only after implementation it will become one hundred percent clear what he is capable of. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  It is now worth mentioning where, nevertheless, this engine can be applied.  Of course, the main medium for him is space.  It will be created for this, but there are still other areas of application.  In addition to rockets, it will be possible to equip cars, sea transport, railway, aircraft and underwater vehicles with a quantum engine.  It also fits perfectly for the power supply of ordinary residential premises.  It is also suitable for sintering building materials with electric current. </p>

    <p>  Thus, this discovery will provide for huge segments, which will facilitate and improve the lives of millions of people several times. </p><h2>  Energy sources </h2><p>  Of course, we must not forget how to energize the quantum engine, because no matter how ideal it is, it needs raw materials to work.  And this source must be incredibly powerful.  A cold <span>fusion</span> reactor <span>,</span> which in turn works on nickel, is excellent for providing. </p><p>  This reactor is much better than the existing ones, because only one kilogram of nickel in the cold fusion mode can release as much energy as one million kilograms of gasoline. </p><h2>  Comparative characteristics </h2><p>  All of the above, of course, conveys all the technical aspects and advantages of the engine, but, as they say, everything is known in comparison.  What will happen if we draw parallels between modern rocket engines and the quantum engine of Vladimir Semenovich Leonov? </p><p>  So, modern space engines <strong> </strong>  one kilowatt of power can achieve a thrust equal to one newton, which is equivalent to one tenth of a kilogram-force.  The quantum engine surpasses the rocket engine several times.  For the same one kilowatt of thrust, he has five thousand Newtons, which is equivalent to five hundred kilogram-force.  As you can see, Leonov‚Äôs development is able to significantly increase efficiency, which, in turn, will give humanity a new technological era. </p>
