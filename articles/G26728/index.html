Many couples only have to dream about a separate housing, but own housing is a realizable dream!  How to buy an apartment if there is no money?  It is this problem that we will solve in this article. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage for obtaining an apartment </h2><p>  You need to dream about the apartment correctly, namely to paint your dream for goals and objectives.  And so you need to answer the following questions. </p><ul><li>  Will you buy an apartment for cash or take it on credit?  If for cash, then make a list of people with whom you borrow at interest or without interest, and for how long.  If you take a loan, then register the banks (name, contact details and mortgage rate with a term). </li><li>  In which area do you want to buy a home?  How many rooms will be in the apartment?  What area do you want? </li><li>  How much money do you need for housing in the desired area?  For example, you want to buy a 1-room apartment, so in a specific area you‚Äôll call all the ads to clarify the pricing policy. </li><li>  How can I get extra income?  How long does it take to get the required amount? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy an apartment if there is no money" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/330113.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ul><p>  This stage lasts until the young family gets a mortgage or buys an apartment.  Therefore, it may take several years or several months.  But you need to constantly be in the know!  That is, banks have different stocks where families with an income of 15-20,000 rubles per month without guarantors can go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Or there will be housing where the owners urgently move to live abroad and sell a luxury apartment with furniture for a penny.  But in order to "catch luck by the tail", you need to constantly ring all the banks, people you know, and through private announcements. </p><h2>  How to buy an apartment if there is no money for a mortgage? </h2><p>  Many banks do not miss young families because of their low solvency.  For example, Sberbank has strict requirements for a mortgage loan: for a family of 3 people, income must be at least 45 thousand rubles, two guarantors with no less income and no loans and a bunch of reference documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy an apartment without money" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/330112.jpg" width="316"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In this case, how to buy an apartment without money?  Look for banks where the campaign for new buildings takes place (rates are higher for resales and requirements are tougher), when a family with a monthly income of 20 thousand rubles can get a mortgage for 15 years with a 12% interest rate without guarantors with a minimum package of documents (personal income tax certificate for half a year, copies of passport, work book and diploma of education).  This is due to the fact that during the period of the action, banks do not take into account family expenses, but look only at profitability. </p><h2>  We take a mortgage, where can I get money for a contribution? </h2><p>  Mortgages - this is the main way how to buy an apartment if there is no money.  A down payment requires a minimum of 10% of the cost of housing.  Currently, there are companies that are building new buildings from 950,000 rubles.  Then for the down payment it is enough to collect 95 thousand rubles. </p><p>  This amount can be collected in cash on your own.  For example, maternity and maternity leave benefits may amount to a down payment.  If the family is expecting a second child, then it can receive maternity capital, due to which you can reduce the mortgage rate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buy 1 bedroom apartment" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/330110.jpg" width="434"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Once you have decided on the bank, hand over the documents and wait for the management decision.  After obtaining a loan for several months (3-6), gradually collect the documents for obtaining an apartment in the property, which you will be advised by various experts from the developer and the bank. </p><p>  Therefore, in order for your dream to come true, you need to draw up an action plan, weighing each decision, and go to the intended goal, not minimizing, finding new opportunities!  Only in this case the question: ‚ÄúHow to buy an apartment, if there is no money, in just a couple of years?‚Äù  - Does not baffle you. </p>
