On the other hand, they manifest themselves as smart, smart, cunning and active organisms.  That is why you can even learn from some species.  Like it or not, the animal world is very interesting and unpredictable.  It is obvious that we humans want to learn as much as possible about such unusual representatives of the wild.  And, fortunately, each person has the opportunity to see some beautiful mammals by visiting, for example, the Feldman Zoo in Kharkov.  It will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Feldman's free zoo </h2><p>  Under the wonderful city of Kharkov (not far from Alekseyevka) there is an equally stunning zoo that will become a godsend for young children and their parents.  It is a great place to relax with family and friends.  And although the unique park was formed relatively recently and has the status of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, it housed the most striking representatives of the wild.  Feldman Zoo has existed for only two years, but managed to conquer thousands of hearts, as it contains the cutest, most beautiful and charming animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fieldman Zoo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/460921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park Features </h2><p>  The wonderful place is open for visiting from 10.00 to 19.00.  The uniqueness of the park lies in the fact that the entrance is absolutely free, which is very attractive for different categories of the population.  But the park still has its own rules, one of which is a ban on travel on bicycles, cars and other vehicles.  Not surprisingly, the desire to look at exotic animals arises most often at the weekend.  Therefore, if possible, it is best to visit the zoo on a weekday.  Then the tourist will be able to enjoy the company of animals and take a walk in a relaxed atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the feldman's zoo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/461143.jpg" width="600"></div>

We offer several options.  The first is to use taxi services, as a result, a two-way trip (that is, there and back) will require 60 UAH.  The second option is to get on your own by bicycle.  It will take a little longer, but the trip will be richer and more interesting.  Of course, there is another way - to walk, but few decide to walk 2 km long. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the park it is forbidden to smoke, conduct photo shoots and call in on various types of transport.  Near the institution is equipped with a guarded spacious parking lot. </p><h2>  Cozy town </h2>

Despite this, it is beautifully decorated.  In general, this is a real paradise for children.  Small ponds, interesting sites, fabulous statues and much more delight the children.  And, of course, the inhabitants themselves are truly beautiful.  The zoo management takes good care of them, so the animals feel at home.

    <p>  Children and their parents will definitely like the stone park where the bear is located, and around it - mushrooms with snails.  In addition to places for recreation, on the territory there are also washbasins, comfortable gazebos, attractions for little mischief-makers, table football, trampolines and slides.  Kids can also find cartoon characters, an authentic llama, a rock garden, a Russian stove and much more.  Naturally, every child will want to visit such a place, and when his desire is fulfilled, impressions will last for a whole month in advance.  In this case, the parents have an obvious question: "How to get to the Feldman Zoo?" </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fieldman zoo how to get there" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/460351.jpg" width="564"></div>

The most interesting thing is that this is completely free transport, which the founders of the park provide to their guests.  Those who are satisfied with this method of transportation need to look for route No. 1656 (AS Forest Park - Feldman Ecopark). </p><p>  If a tourist decided to get to his destination by bicycle, he should follow this route: Alekseevka - Lesopark - soldier's grave - Pyatikhatki - golf club - Belgorod highway - Feldman's zoo.  How to get to your destination by car?  We will tell further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fieldman zoo how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/460923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists who decide to drive their own car should use the following route.  The course must be kept on the Alekseevsky market.  Roughly we go along the district towards Saltovka.  The driver must pass the Belgorod highway and after exactly 300 meters turn left.  After 200 m you can see the former pioneer camp. </p><p>  On average, a tourist will need 40 minutes to get to the park.  If the driver has a navigator, then the task will be simplified several times, only it is worth knowing that the zoo is located on the site of the former Solnechnaya Polyana camp.  Therefore, there is no need to get lost if the system indicates the route exactly to the former children's entertainment institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/460352.jpg" width="600"></div>
