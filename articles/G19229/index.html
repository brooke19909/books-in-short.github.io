This is the second city after New York State.  The village is located at the source <span>of the Niagara River,</span> on the east coast of Lake Erie, not far from the world-famous Niagara Falls. </p><p>  The city of Buffalo (New York) is really small, with only 258 thousand citizens living here, with more than 1.2 million people in the county. </p><h2>  Geographical and climatic features </h2><p>  Great impact on the climate of the city have the Great Lakes.  In winter, it is moderately cold and snowy.  But winters are characterized by a frequent change of weather with periodic rains and thaws.  The temperature varies greatly: from -4 ¬∞ C to -25 ¬∞ C.  Around the middle of November, snow cover is established, fogs often occur.  Peak snowfall falls in December.  It is not very hot in summer: the average temperature in July is +22 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night city" class="if uuid-2553687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2553687.jpg"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is small, about 136 square meters.  km., water resources account for 23%.  However, since ancient times the city was called a lake, because it is due to the lake that most winter precipitation falls here, and they happen just next to the pond.  As soon as the air is saturated with moisture and the pond is covered with ice, immediately the snowfall stops in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Economic situation </h2><p>  Since 2009, Buffalo, New York has experienced a difficult economic environment.  The unemployment rate does not fall below 10%.  More than 25% of the total population of the city is below the poverty line. </p><p>  The average per capita income is 20 thousand US dollars per month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall in winter" class="if uuid-2553682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2553682.jpg"></div><h2>  National and age composition </h2><p>  Mostly white people live in the city, approximately 82%.  African Americans represent 13% of the population, with Hispanics (3.3%), Asians (about 1.32%), and Indians (0.6%). </p><p>  On average, the population of the agglomeration and the city itself is represented by citizens aged about 38 years.  This is not to say that all residents of the state and city graduated from school, of which there are only 83%.  There are even fewer people who have received a bachelor's degree: about 23%. </p><p>  Buffalo (New York) is conditionally divided into several areas.  Mostly African Americans live in the eastern part, Spaniards and Puerto Ricans in the west, although Italians used to live here.  Now the Italians have moved to the north of the city.  Jews live mainly in the western part.  These are mainly migrants from Germany, Poland and Slovakia.  The Jewish community in the city is very small, with no more than 26 thousand people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of the region </h2><div class="photo" data-original="globetrottergirls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buffalo is a beautiful land" class="if uuid-2553671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2553671.jpg"></div><p>  Naturally, the main attraction of Buffalo (New York) is Niagara Falls.  It is located 25 kilometers from downtown, in the town of Niagara Falls.  Around the waterfall there are many viewing platforms from which you can watch how tons of water rumble down. </p><p>  A little-known fact: a waterfall consists of two small waterfalls, but it‚Äôs quite difficult to understand both when observing from observation platforms and from ships on which tourists ride.  There is a very widespread belief that the most beautiful view opens from the Canadian side.  In any case, Niagara Falls is a unique phenomenon that can be viewed day and night, especially since the lights are turned on here in the dark. </p><h2>  Interesting places of the city </h2><p>  From Buffalo in New York, the distance to Moscow is 7,534 kilometers.  It is clear that the easiest way to overcome it is by plane.  However, even by air it will take quite a lot of time: about 9 hours with an average aircraft speed of 850 kilometers per hour.  The distance from New York to the city is 470 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sevenlayercharlotte.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the plane to the city" class="if uuid-2553677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2553677.jpg"></div><p>  The cheapest flights to Buffalo (New York) from Moscow are offered by Lufthansa.  The average cost per person is 23-35 thousand rubles in both directions. </p><p>  In any case, the city has something to see.  First of all, this is the city hall on Main Street.  Not far away is the Naval Museum, where you can view decommissioned warships and aircraft. </p><p>  In the northern part of the city there is an interesting place - Delaware Park.  This is a whole complex, consisting of several small parks, in it there are places significant for the whole state and the city itself.  First of all, it is the best art museum called Albright-Knox Art Gallery.  In the southwestern part of the park there is a cemetery, which is even listed in the register of historical places of the country.  The cemetery has many historical mausoleums and tombstones. </p><p>  Buffalo (New York) is a city of light and a city of good neighbors.  This is the region where the first hydroelectric power station based on Niagara Falls gave a huge amount of electric energy to the city, it was even shared with other regions.  Buffalo is also called the city of trees.  Indeed, it is here that a huge number of green spaces, which is rare enough for US cities.  There are about twenty parks in the city. </p>
