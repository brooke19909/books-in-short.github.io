In fact, these hostels to this day carry out training activities in different countries.  Unfortunately, in Russia such institutions ceased to exist.  But in the distant past and in our country it was considered the highest honor to receive such an education.  In the article you can get acquainted with the history of the creation of the first female educational institution in Russia.  And also find out what life prospects opened up for his graduates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="institutes of noble maidens" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445569.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Foreign hostels </h2><p>  The institutes of noble maidens are in fact schools for women of a private nature.  In these institutions, training is primarily aimed at improving social and cultural activities.  As the name implies, this institution has no significant differences with a regular school.  And its main goal is the completion of education.  The training program in boarding houses of this type is predominantly of 2 types: reinforced and one-year.  The most famous country with a number of private educational institutions for women in its history is undoubtedly Switzerland.  The Princess of Wales was educated here.  She graduated from the AlpinVidemanette Institute.  Unfortunately, it is closed today.  The MonFertile school was also very popular - the Duchess of Cornwall studied there for some time.  Well, of course, one can not help but say about the VillaMontChoisi boarding house.  Thanks to this institution, Switzerland gained great fame. However, in the late 90s, this Institute was closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Foundation of the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445573.jpg" width="550"></div>

But everything changed when the first institute of noble maidens was organized.  The history of its creation originates in the distant 1764.  This event happened thanks to the project of the President of the Academy of Arts Ivan Betskov.  Later he became the trustee of this institution.  In addition, after the opening of the guesthouse, a decree "On the education of girls of noble origin at the Sunday Monastery" was adopted.  This school was located in St. Petersburg.  This order, together with the Charter of the institution, was sent out throughout the Russian Empire.  In principle, it can be said that education in the Boarding House did not differ much from what exists today in <span>modern schools.</span>  Damsels of noble blood were taken there at the age of 6.  The term of study was 12 years and was divided into 4 time periods.  Almost 200 pupils could receive knowledge at the Institute at the same time.  At the end of their education, the 6 most outstanding students received a special badge of honor - a monogram made of gold and engraved with the empress's initials.  The foundation of the <span>Smolny Institute for</span> Noble Maidens made it possible to receive general education and to study the secrets of economics for girls of other classes (with the exception of serfs). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Institute of Noble Maidens Moscow" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445570.jpg" width="490"></div>

Thanks to this, the students had great chances in the future to serve at court.  The preparatory plan was drawn up with the participation of the trustee of the institution and included the study of such subjects as arithmetic, foreign languages, geography, literature, history and the Law of God.  In addition, girls were taught the basics of drawing, needlework and home economics.  Not ignored the development of musical abilities.  So that students could fully obtain the knowledge, skills and abilities that they need, the staff of the institution included 29 teachers. </p><h2>  Articles of Association </h2><p>  <span>The institutes of noble maidens</span> were especially strict in their upbringing.  All the girls followed a strict daily routine.  To meet with the native pupils could only on weekends and holidays.  Moreover, their communication took place only in the presence of the boss.  Students could say goodbye to the boarding school only when they reached the age of 18.  And even the family‚Äôs demand could not influence this decision.  At the end of their studies, many of the pupils remained within the walls of the Institute and worked as class ladies.  Those girls who were educated in the philistine department of the institution had great chances to become governesses in the future.  Initially, the school of noble maidens was located in the monastery.  But subsequently a special building was erected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Institute of Noble Maidens history" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445571.jpg" width="545"></div>

    <h2>  Ongoing reforms </h2><p>  After the death of the Empress, the wife of Paul I began to manage women's educational institutions. She led them for 32 years and managed to change a lot over this period.  In particular, the training period was reduced to 9 years.  Only 3 age groups remained, and they, in turn, were subdivided into excellent pupils, ‚Äúpretty women‚Äù and lagging behind.  The duration of each lesson began to be 2 hours.  The culmination of the academic half-year was the intermediate exams, the end of the year was marked by final examinations.  The changes also affected the age limits for admission to the Institute.  So, girls of noble origin began to be taken to a boarding school from 8-9 years old, and bourgeois women only from 11-12.  And this was due to the fact that their training period was limited to 6 years.  The orientation of teaching has also changed.  If during the reign of Catherine the girls were taught maid of honor, then under Maria Fedorovna they were more likely prepared for the ‚Äúposition‚Äù of wives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Institute of Noble Maidens" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445572.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  New guesthouse </h2><p>  In 1802, at the initiative of the mother of Alexander I, an additional Institute for Noble Maidens was opened.  Moscow became his home.  The difference of this institution was that mainly noble women from <span>low-income families were</span> accepted for training <span>.</span>  But over time, a petty bourgeois branch was also created on its base for other classes.  The curriculum of this institution did not differ much from the curriculum of previous institutions.  The Law of God, foreign languages, history and geography were also taught here.  Physics was additionally introduced.  They did not forget about creative development.  However, the daily routine was much stricter.  Pupils of the institution rose at 6 in the morning and studied until 8 in the evening with short breaks.  The Moscow Institute of Noble Maidens was named after Catherine.  The building in which it was located originally belonged to Count Saltykov.  However, in 1777 his property was seized, and the Invalid House was opened on its territory.  When it was decided to create a school, the architect Domenico Gilardi rebuilt this building. </p>
