In order to better understand the spiritual meaning of such a representation, one should take a closer look at the historical traditions characteristic of Russian Orthodoxy. </p><h2>  From Russian history </h2><p>  The monasteries of the Russian Orthodox Church were most often located at some distance from large cities.  So that excessive worldly vanity does not distract their inhabitants from what they decided to devote the rest of their days.  But to maintain business and economic ties with the outside world, some monasteries left their representations or courtyards in the cities.  Often, the land belonging to the monasteries and the property located on it belonged to the courtyards.  Compounds usually included everything that was not directly involved in the performance of church service.  Economic activity was carried out on the courtyards, numerous pilgrims stopping to bow to Christian shrines.  But the Compound of the <span>Athos Monastery</span> in Moscow is in the spiritual sense something much more than just an addition to the holy monastery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Athos in Moscow" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/450606.jpg" width="397"></div>

In sacred history, it is known as the earthly inheritance of the Virgin.  Mount Athos is located on the peninsula of the same name in the province of Macedonia, in northeastern Greece.  For many centuries, monasteries existed on the peninsula and monks lived.  The close spiritual connection of the Holy Mount Athos and Russian Orthodoxy can be traced for a whole millennium, since the baptism of Russia.  Among other things, this is expressed in the fact that Orthodox pilgrims have sought to visit this sacred place for centuries.  They walked along a certain route, stopping along the route on specially designated courtyards.  That was the historical tradition.  In a certain sense, Mount Athos in Moscow is one of such symbolic places where pilgrims stop on their way to the holy land.  Of course, its meaning and significance is much deeper than a simple temporary refuge for wanderers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Compound of the Athos monastery in Moscow" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/450608.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  In Moscow </h2><p>  Despite the deep spiritual connection between Russian Orthodoxy and the Holy Mount Athos, official representations of the clergy in large cities and both capitals of Russia began to open only in the second half of the nineteenth century.  The Athos Compound in Moscow was established in September 1979 with private donations.  A representative office was located in a small noble estate on Bolshaya Polyanka.  One of the most significant and authoritative figures in the history of spiritual representation was the abbot of the Athos Metochion in Moscow, Rev. Aristoclius. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ministry of the elder Aristocles left a significant mark in Russian spiritual life.  It was through him that for many years communication was made with the Panteleimon Monastery on Mount Athos.  He collected donations to support Russian Orthodox monasteries in Greek Macedonia and sent new novices there who chose for themselves the difficult mission of Divine service.  At the initiative of the holy elder, a periodical publication, ‚ÄúUseful Interlocutor,‚Äù was published at the Athos Compound in Moscow.  This spiritual and religious magazine was respected throughout Russia.  In addition, the elder Aristoclius had the gift of a spiritual healer and received those in need of his help, who came to him from all over Russia.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, two three-story buildings were built on the territory of the courtyard, which housed charitable institutions, a house church and a library of spiritual literature.  But the mission of the Athos Compound in Moscow was interrupted by revolutionary events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rector of Mount Athos in Moscow" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/450605.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  After the revolution </h2><p>  In 1918, the Athos Compound in Moscow virtually ceased to exist.  There was nothing unique in his fate, many other Orthodox churches and monasteries suffered the same fate.  Both in Moscow and throughout Russia.  This expressed the godless policy of the Bolsheviks who came to power.  For several decades, they methodically destroyed the foundations of Russian Orthodoxy, as well as other religious faiths.  The buildings located on the territory of the courtyard were given over to housing, and the abbot Hieromonk Makariy was repressed in January 1919. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Athos in Moscow site" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/450607.jpg" width="454"></div>

    <h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The state‚Äôs policy towards the Orthodox Church fundamentally changed only at the end of the twentieth century.  During this period, many temples were revived that were in desolation and were used for purposes far from their destination.  In 1992, the Athos Compound in Moscow resumed its activities.  His address has changed; it is currently located within the walls of the ancient Temple of Nikita Martyr on Shvivaya Gorka beyond Yauza.  This is one of the oldest churches in Moscow; during its existence, it has undergone renovations and rebuildings.  But the date marked on the foundation stone at its foundation, 1595, evokes a feeling of respect.  The mailing address of the temple is Russia, Moscow 109240, Goncharnaya street, 6. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Athos in Moscow address" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/450609.jpg" width="498"></div>
