    <p>  Such unique natural objects as mountains are all the more attractive.  The subject of this article is Olkhovaya Mountain.  About her, her particular attractiveness for tourists will be discussed in the publication. </p><h2>  Meet Olkhovaya Mountain, Primorsky Territory </h2><p>  Located 270 kilometers from Vladivostok, this mountain is the only one in the region, at the top of which a mountain lake spreads on a plateau, a small but surprisingly picturesque one.  Olkhovaya Mountain, or, as it is also called, Chinese, is located in the Partizan region of Primorye, its height reaches 1669 m. A rather convenient climb makes the mountain very attractive for visiting.  A climbing route has been developed.  This is the Alekseevsky ridge, which is a lateral spur of the Partizansky ridge, which also serves as the watershed of the Partizanskaya and Kievka rivers. </p><p>  The top of the Alder Mountain is a rocky platform from which on a cloudless day an amazing view of the neighboring heights opens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  These are the Cloud Mountains, rising 1854 meters, Snezhnaya - 1682 meters high, Sister (1671 meters), Lysaya (1560 meters), Chernaya (1379 meters), Makarova (1366 meters) and others.  As a sign of people staying on the top of the mountain, a trigonometric point and a memorial cross were erected. </p><h2>  Mountain lakes </h2><p>  At an altitude of 1600 meters on a mountain plateau is a small lake - a shallow body of water framed by honeysuckle shrubs.  It feeds on precipitation.  Therefore, in dry years, the water level drops markedly.  Old-timers claim that sometimes in the most severe droughts the lake dries up, but this happens extremely rarely.  In the middle of summer, the water warms up well, and you can swim in the lake.  Transparent crystal water, clean mountain air attract travelers. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the plateau is quite extensive, which allows you to comfortably settle on the shore, pitch tents, spend time enjoying the primeval peace, and completely forget about the bustle of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Water inhabitants </h2><p>  There is no fish in the pond, but here you can see newts - a relict species of the <span>tailed amphibians of the</span> family of real salamanders.  Fond of a pond from ancient times, these animals arranged their life in it, adapting to the features of the pond.  Another similar natural body of water is located a little higher, but it is so small that it dries up almost every year, although the newts have inhabited it too. </p><p>  But not only the unique reservoirs are famous for Olkhovaya Mountain.  The reviews of travelers who have visited these places emphasize a relatively convenient way to the top and the opportunity to get acquainted with rare representatives of flora and fauna.  Few places on the planet like places with relict vegetation and rare animals. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Olkhovaya Mountain (Primorsky Territory) is forested, which makes the laid routes picturesque and vibrant.  Here you will find thickets of lemongrass - an amazing tree creeper with clusters of purple berries. </p>

    <p>  Every person has ever heard of the magical properties of this plant: lemongrass infusions, which have a general stimulating effect, can increase performance several times, and essential oils from it are extremely popular in cosmetology.  Eleutherococcus, a thorny shrub from the Aralian family, which has no less valuable medicinal qualities, grows near the Olkhova Mountain.  Decoration of the mountain forests of Primorye is another representative of the endangered fauna - rhododendron.  This is an ornamental shrub from <span>the heather family.</span>  Spring flowering of rhododendrons is an amazing sight, which you can see on the way to the top of Mount Olkhova.  In addition, the forest is rich in cedar pine, larch, <span>Manchu nut,</span> aralia, wild rose and <span>wild grapes.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  No less extensive is the group of rare herbaceous plants found in these places.  In numerous glades among the thickets of incense and sediment ripen lingonberries, blueberries and honeysuckle.  On the slopes you can see the edelweiss - the legendary flower with soft purple inflorescences.  And in the forest, a meeting is possible with one of the rare plants, the venus slipper, - a herbaceous perennial and an ancient terrestrial orchid. </p><h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  The fauna in the forests of the Primorsky Territory is also diverse.  So, on the way to the top, with any luck, you can see a golden eagle soaring in the sky - a representative of an endangered species of eagles, listed in the Red Book of Russia. </p>
