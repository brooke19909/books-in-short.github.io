  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Rome: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the oldest cities in the world, where all roads lead, has not changed much for thousands of years.  Charming Rome, famous for its rich history, allows everyone to experience its unique flavor.  This is not the first time that tourists visiting the Italian capital have rediscovered it. </p><p>  The eternal city, connecting the various time layers, is most often associated with the Colosseum, which has become a symbol of the greatness of a powerful empire, and St. Peter's Basilica - the largest building of the Vatican.  However, the Latin motherland hides many unknown architectural monuments, the existence of which most tourists do not even suspect. </p><h2>  Fountain of books </h2><p>  Speaking about such sights of Rome, it is impossible not to mention the small fountain, which became the decoration of the walls of the city archive.  Fontana dei Libri, which appeared in 1927, is a very picturesque architectural structure.  It is made in the form of a niche decorated with a stone head of a deer, and on the sides are four granite books, in two of which bookmarks are made.  <span>The unusual fountain is</span> so beautiful that it asks for a photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rerumromanarum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain of books in Rome" class="if uuid-2277048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277048.jpg"></div><p>  Rome (Italy), whose attractions reflect its history, boasts an original masterpiece located on Via degli Staderari.  The author of the work knew the past of the city very well, and therefore each of his work carried a hidden meaning.  Previously, the street was called "Universitetskaya", because it was an educational institution Universit√† della Sapienza.  Keeping this in mind, the architect came up with the idea to decorate the fountain with gigantic book folios.  And the <span>head of a deer</span> is a symbol of the area in which an amazing ensemble is built.  Five brilliant pearls crown the composition - a tribute to the time when <span>the Medici dynasty, which</span> patronized art, ruled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unique basilica </h2><p>  If the main <span>attractions of Rome</span> do not need to be introduced, then the church of Santo Stefano Rotondo is still in the shade.  The basilica dedicated to St. Stephen, who was martyred, has an unusual shape.  The round structure is one of the most bizarre in the city: the building on the Celius Hill is made in the form of a rotunda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="scoprendoroma.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica dedicated to St. Stephen" class="if uuid-2277001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277001.jpg"></div><p>  San Stefano Rotondo, which appeared on the site of the ancient market, was restored several times.  The church, built in the V century, is recognized as the oldest Christian monument in Italy, which surprises not only with its architectural merits, but also with its gloomy interior decoration.  Colored murals, more reminiscent of popular prints, depict the terrible and brutal killings of the righteous.  And such a catalog of torture confuses modern people who find themselves in the most curious place of a major tourist center.  And he terrified our descendants. </p><h2>  Protestant cemetery </h2><p>  The nook is included in the UNESCO list of cultural objects that are in danger.  Cimitero Acattolico is an unknown sight in Rome for most travelers.  The non-Catholic cemetery is a real oasis of calm, located in the heart of the noisy area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTestaccio (Testaccio), near the mountain of the same name.  Those who have visited the Protestant necropolis note that it is gradually declining.  Suffering from frequent flooding, "the holiest place in the city," as the ingenious O. Wilde called it, does not receive money from the budget.  Ancient stone statues, fences and paths are destroyed literally before our eyes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="viaggiverdeacido.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Protestant cemetery of Rome" class="if uuid-2277005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277005.jpg"></div><p>  A non-religious cemetery covered with greenery, where about four thousand people rest, should be of interest to our tourists, because the last symbolic poet V. Ivanov and artist K. Bryullov found their last refuge.  So-called national zones were formed on its territory, and in one of them are the graves of Russians who emigrated to Italy. </p><h2>  Picturesque rose garden </h2><p>  The most romantic place of the Eternal City must be sought on the hill of Aventino.  The rose garden, founded in 1931, was destroyed during World War II, after which it had to be reconstructed.  The most beautiful landmark of Rome (Italy) is divided into two parts: the upper one is open from April to June, and the lower one is open from the end of May.  In Roseto Comunale with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 thousand square meters you can see roses collected from around the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.giornalemetropolitano.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque Roman Rose Garden" class="if uuid-2277011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277011.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient times, colorful festivities dedicated to the goddess Flora were held at this place, and now tourists can enjoy a delightful sight during the period of the maximum flowering of the Queen of Flowers, blooming every year.  Guests will be surprised by plants that exude an unpleasant odor and change their color.  According to park workers, there are roses of all colors except blue, because it is impossible to breed such a variety. </p><h2>  A corner created for enjoyment </h2><p>  The picturesque parks of the Italian capital, which have become interesting sights of Rome (some of them are described in the article), reveal the special charm of the Mediterranean nature.  The wonderful gardens of Villa Aurelia, hidden on the Yanikul hill, immerse you in an atmosphere of happiness and peace.  From the highest point of the city, breathtaking views are opened up that deserve attention. </p><p>  Gardens at Villa Aurelia was once owned by the American Academy and was only recently opened to visitors.  It is worth remembering that excursions in the park with hedges, fancy fountains and arbors created for privacy are carried out only by appointment. </p><h2>  Monument to the reign of Mussolini </h2><p>  The treasury of monuments of world architecture stores unique attractions.  Rome is a city that perfectly remembers its past and does not destroy objects that appeared during the reign of the Italian dictator Mussolini. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the reign of Mussolini" class="if uuid-2277017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277017.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of a corner that was not included in any guidebook was timed to coincide with the holding of the world fair, scheduled for 1942, which did not take place.  However, there remained the EUR quarter (Esposizione Universale di Roma), erected in the southwest, and one of the symbols of the fascist era in the country was the marble palace of Italian civilization, which amazes with its size.  It is called the ‚ÄúColosseo Quadrato‚Äù because it closely resembles a grandiose antique amphitheater. </p><h2>  Cestius pyramid </h2><p>  If someone thinks that you can visit the mysterious pyramids only in Egypt, then he is mistaken.  Oddly enough, the funeral burial erected before our era is located in the very heart of Rome.  Photos of the sights must be taken by tourists, delighted with the unusual structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="assassinscreed.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cestius Pyramid in Rome" class="if uuid-2277020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277020.jpg"></div><p>  The Cestius pyramid, which appeared after the Roman soldiers celebrated their victory in Africa, rises more than 30 meters.  The only one in the city, it is well preserved, and on its walls you can see inscriptions carved in stone, reminiscent of the construction and excavations of an archaeological site covered with marble blocks.  Inside the mausoleum, located near the non-Catholic cemetery, is the tomb of Gaius Cestius - a politician and a tribune of plebs. </p><h2>  Sundial of Augustus </h2><p>  Few people know that among the hundreds of thousands of interesting sights of the city of Rome, the largest sundials of antiquity are hiding.  Emperor Augustus ordered their construction on the Field of Mars, where giant slabs were installed, on which numbers and letters, zodiac signs and calendar days were embossed.  A huge obelisk (gnomon) was erected from granite imported from Egypt, which allows to determine the height of the star.  The shadow cast by ancient astronomical instruments showed time on the dial of a sundial.  It is curious that on the emperor‚Äôs birthday, September 23, the falling shadow overshadowed the monument decorated with a stone wall - the altar of Peace, erected in honor of the ruler. </p><p>  The size of the oldest sundial is amazing: the diameter of the dial was 160 meters and the height of the obelisk was 30 meters.  The world-famous unique mechanism brought its amazing accuracy.  Unfortunately, after severe flooding, it ceased to function, and the gnomon collapsed.  In the 70s of the last century, in the cellars located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Field of Mars, at a depth of eight meters, pieces of flooring were discovered that made up the Horologium Augusti dial. </p><p>  Only at the beginning of the XVI century the obelisk was restored again, and now it is located in Piazza Montecitorio, Rome.  Sights (photos and descriptions are presented in the article) are of genuine interest to tourists who want to learn more about the history of the country's cultural center. </p><h2>  The oldest storm drain </h2><p>  Another ancient monument is the great city.  Cloaca Maxima and now serves as a storm drain, being in excellent condition.  A canal 800 meters long was dug by Etruscan masters around the 7th century BC.  The oldest building in the world was built during the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Prisca - the king of Ancient Rome, who paid great attention to urban infrastructure.  Big Cloak was originally open, but then it was covered with wood flooring, and later a stone arch appeared. </p><p>  Located beneath the Palatinsky and Ponte Rotto bridges, it has become part of a huge sewer network that has expanded with the expansion of Rome. </p><h2>  Sightseeing: Eternal City Metro </h2><p>  If travelers are tired of wandering around the bustling capital of Italy, they can go down underground to quickly reach remote areas.  The subway project appeared in 1959, but the work was completed after almost 20 years.  Rome is literally crammed with antiquities, and it‚Äôs rather difficult to carry out any work, because experts have come across archaeological sites that need to be studied.  That is why the construction took so long. </p><p>  The first thing that guests see is ordinary residents of the capital, without familiarity with whom the impressions of the open-air museum will be incomplete.  In the subway, which has become the youngest in Europe, there are no usual ticket offices, and all tickets are purchased in vending machines.  The popular and convenient form of municipal transport is not as branched as the metro in Barcelona or London, and its layout is logical and very simple.  Therefore, Russian tourists quickly understand on the spot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro Rome - the most convenient form of transport" class="if uuid-2277032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2277032.jpg"></div><p>  Listing all the noteworthy attractions is not an easy task.  It is worthwhile to think in advance of the route of the future trip to the Eternal City, so that the trip will have the most pleasant memories.  The number of monuments is so great that it is impossible to get to know everyone, and admiring tourists come here again to confess their love to Rome. </p>
