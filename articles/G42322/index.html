    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  A lot of vivid impressions will give you the resort complex Aquamare Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 4 *.  Reviews of tourists demonstrate the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  convenient location (it is quite far from the noisy city, and all the necessary infrastructure is within walking distance); </li><li>  tasty and varied food (everything is made from natural local products); </li><li>  spectacular modern architecture of the main building; </li><li>  new gym equipment in the gym; </li><li>  happy with the presence of a tea set in the room; </li><li>  You don‚Äôt have to wait for the check-out time for registration and check-in if the hotel is not completely filled (additional payments are also not required); </li><li>  some employees speak Russian; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel is located near the airport, the transfer will take you no more than a quarter of an hour (which is very important after a tiring flight); </li><li>  a lot of greenery and manicured lawns in the territory (everything is kept in perfect cleanliness and order); </li><li>  good soundproofing in the rooms; </li><li>  the cleaning is very high quality (this can be judged by the almost perfect condition of the carpet in the rooms); </li><li>  there are Russian channels; </li><li>  at the pool bar every evening you can listen to live music (given the moderate volume, it absolutely does not interfere with those who like to go to bed early); </li><li>  the hotel has a fairly fresh repair; </li><li>  upon arrival, guests receive a gift in the form of a bottle of wine, as well as a minibar filled with drinks; </li><li>  the rooms have large comfortable beds; </li><li>  the waiters in restaurants are friendly, nimble and know their job well; </li><li>  if all the rooms in the hotel are occupied and you are not able to use the early check-in option, then, while waiting for registration, the staff will conduct a familiarization tour of the territory for you; </li><li>  beach towels can be changed several times a day, without leaving a deposit and without showing any coupons; </li><li>  good children's pool with slides; </li><li>  there is a choice between the All Inclusive system and half board. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no ideal hotels, and therefore you should be prepared for the negative moments that you may encounter at Aquamare Beach Hotel &amp; Spa.  Paphos is visited by many tourists, and based on their reviews we can talk about the following: </p><ul><li>  in the hotel all drinks are paid (even for drinking water you need to pay extra); </li><li>  rocky entrance to the sea (legs can be injured on sharp blocks); </li><li>  there is practically no animation in the hotel, and therefore it is not suitable for lovers of noisy and active recreation; </li><li>  in stores in the territory, prices are several times higher than in neighboring retail outlets; </li><li>  construction is underway nearby, which creates a lot of noise and spoils the view from the window; </li><li>  Wireless Internet only works at the reception desk; </li><li>  chefs put too much pepper and spices in the food (even in the dietary dishes that are usually given to children); </li><li>  despite the fact that breakfast is set at 7:00 a.m., staff completes serving and opens a restaurant no earlier than 7:30 a.m. </li><li>  the hotel is located near the Paphos airport, and therefore planes often fly over it, creating a lot of noise; </li><li>  an adapter for sockets needs to be taken with you (for many tourists it becomes an unpleasant surprise that the device cannot be requested at the reception). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Greek hotels immerse travelers in an atmosphere of serenity and relaxation.  The coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in turn, gives beautiful nature and warm water.  If we talk about this particular institution, then it is for those who love a quiet and leisurely pastime.  This is a great option for a family or romantic getaway.  Despite the numerous shortcomings in the organization of work, they cannot cover all the inherent advantages of this institution. </p><p>  Perhaps the only thing that can seriously disappoint travelers is a rocky beach.
