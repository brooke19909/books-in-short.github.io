Samples</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All the boys love to play with military equipment.  Different tanks, <span>planes, helicopters,</span> boats are included in the required set of toys.  Nowadays, children are accustomed to receiving purchased cars as a gift, with which the child will play a little, and then throw them under the sofa or in the box with toys, and forget about it for a long time.  Parents are very disappointed, because the toy is expensive, and the baby‚Äôs interest in the new product disappears very quickly. </p><p>  Yes, and this is normal, the baby is developing, he wants all the time something new.  And that‚Äôs good, actually.  For parents, there is a way out: you need to make military equipment with your own hands from improvised materials. </p><h2>  The value of crafts </h2><p>  Creative development is of great importance for the development of children.  In the Netherlands, the manufacture of handicrafts from waste material is so developed that there are a number of stores where you can buy the necessary waste material: bottle caps, old buttons, foam pieces, foam tape, etc. </p>

    <p>  In fact, such work develops thinking, imagination.  The child in the course acquires knowledge about the qualities and properties of various materials.  And the completed model of <span>military equipment with his own hands</span> will be more appreciated by the kid, since he invested a bit of soul and a lot of work in its manufacture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important point is the joint activity of an adult and a child.  Parents of the current generation are very busy at work, pay little time to their children, but the joint manufacture of military equipment with their own hands from improvised materials will unite the family at one table.  General activity always brings together.  Consider several options for crafts. </p><h2>  Foam rubber tank </h2><p>  The simplest version of the crafts, which children can do on their own, for example, in kindergarten or elementary school, as gifts to dads for the holiday of May 9 or February 23.  <span>Crafts on the theme of "Military</span> equipment" as a gift will do just fine. </p>

    <p>  For work, you will need two household sponges, cocktail tubes, scissors, PVA glue, color cardboard.  We leave the lower sponge in its original form and put it with a grater down.  If desired, you can round off the edges of the tank hull with scissors. </p><p>  Gently remove the grater from the second sponge and cut out 6 identical circles from it, sticking them to the ends of the lower sponge, 3 on each side.  All that remains is to cut out the stars from the cardboard and insert the tubes.  Instead of a cube on a tank‚Äôs cannon, a flame can be cut from a red or orange sponge.  To do this, you need to sharpen the edges.  It‚Äôs very simple to make a model of military equipment with your own hands - a tank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the glue catches, the toy turns out to be quite strong, so that you can play with it perfectly, even in water.  Children will be interested to see how the sponge is filled with water and the tank will drown. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  Consider how to make military equipment with your own hands from improvised materials: a green plastic bottle, thick cardboard, colored paper.  You will also need a knife, scissors, PVA glue, a pencil, a black felt-tip pen to work. </p>

    <p>  In order to make an airplane, you need to cut two identical holes for the wings of the airplane in the middle of the bottle.  Then work continues with paper.  On thick cardboard, you need to draw a wing, portholes, tail, screw, stars.  You can use self-adhesive for small parts. </p><p>  Then begins the assembly of military equipment with their own hands.  Crafts will be beautiful if you choose the following colors: khaki, dark green, light green, sand.  First, large parts are attached: a wing is inserted, the tail of the aircraft is assembled and glued.  Then, unscrewing the bottle cap, a screw is inserted, cut to the diameter of the neck. </p><p>  The last stage of work will be small details: portholes, stars.  Sometimes frightening shark teeth are painted on military aircraft.  You can offer your child such an idea.  He will like it.  The toy turns out to be strong, it can even be thrown into the air, landing on water. </p><h2>  Wooden plane </h2><p>  To do this, you need to take a few ice cream sticks and a wooden clothespin, PVA glue, if desired, the model can be painted in the colors of military equipment.  With a do-it-yourselfer, a preschooler will make such a plane out of improvised materials. </p><p>  Two sticks are glued to the clothespin in parallel, like the wings of a corncob.  For the tail you need two thinner sticks.  Two small rounded pieces of wood are cut out, and possibly cut, from one, which are glued to the edge of the clothespin.  For a short shank, you need to cut the edge out of the second stick.  It is glued to the end. </p>

    <p>  You can paint such a plane in different colors.  Such a toy is suitable for younger students, it is easy to hide it in a backpack and get it at breaks for games.  If you wish, you can stick the wheels with an old broken machine. </p><h2>  Quilling tank </h2><p>  The most complex <span>example of do-it-yourself military equipment</span> from improvised materials is a caterpillar tank.  There are many details that are made by twisting quilling tapes.  After making a series of wheels, they are glued together and glued with a strip.  The result was a tank caterpillar.  After completing a similar second part, the platform is glued in the form of a square onto which the tower is made separately from a thicker strip of paper. </p>
