The 100 rubles issued by her decree were large.  Their value was significant for the treasury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nkj.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money from the time of Catherine 2" class="if uuid-2696692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696692.jpg"></div><p>  Over the course of history, banknotes decreased in size.  However, there was a decrease in their value.  With the reform in 1961, the weight of the rubles that were in circulation since 1947 changed.  The cost of paper money in 1961 was thus significantly reduced, while prices in the country skyrocketed. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Soviet paper signs began to be produced only in 1920, immediately after the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks.  The first banknotes differed in an extraordinary appearance - their separate area was empty, there was no image on it.  Since several republics became part of the newly made state, this was taken into account by the authorities.  For each region, signatures on banknotes were made in the corresponding local languages.  Three-ruble banknotes contained images of reading peasants, while five-ruble banknotes depicted tractors that drove right over the horizon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekaterinburg.doski.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banknotes of the USSR" class="if uuid-2697106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2697106.jpg"></div><p>  After a decade, the Bolsheviks decided to change the appearance of banknotes.  By 1938, all the money produced in the country contained Red Army men, pilots, and miners.  On dozens in paper form a portrait of Lenin was traditionally depicted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A complex innovation occurred in 1947, its implementation was fraught with many difficulties.  At that time, a huge number of Soviet people suffered - they lost their savings, which quickly and uncontrollably lost their weight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="25 rubles 1961" class="if uuid-2696680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696680.jpg"></div><p>  New banknotes of that period again contained portraits of Lenin, some depicted the Kremlin.  By the mid-1950s, innovations were still ongoing.  The design was changing: some of the strips were removed from the decoration of banknotes.  And, of course, the most significant of the innovations of that time was the reform in 1961. </p><h2>  Monetary Reform of 1961 </h2><p>  This year, a decree was issued in the USSR, according to which a new type of banknote was issued for all denominations of banknotes.  At the moment, banknotes published in those years are stored in many houses.  They became a real monument to the financial stability of those times.  They are kept in memory of the times when many people were happy and calm for their future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse side 25 rubles" class="if uuid-2696681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696681.jpg"></div><p>  Many hope that the value of <span>Soviet money</span> (1961 paper notes) will increase.  Saving them at home, they expect that later they will be able to sell for a lot of money.  Most owners are interested in how much paper money in 1961 costs if they are kept intact and almost new.  However, the design of notes of that era did not change for many decades.  Looking ahead, it should be said that the value of paper <span>money of the USSR in</span> 1961 will not be too high in the near future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  1961 banknote names </h2><p>  The statesmen instantly dubbed the new names only the money circulating in circulation.  Banknotes in 1 and 5 rubles.  called "state treasury bills."  Their larger comrades received the name "tickets of the State.  Bank of the USSR. "  This is the historical name of such banknotes since 1947. </p><div class="photo" data-original="subscribe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 rubles 1961" class="if uuid-2696684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696684.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the people gave their names to money, who instantly compared them with previous, already obsolete samples.  "Stalin's footcloths" called volumetric bills of previous years.  With the innovation of 1961, newly made securities were dubbed ‚ÄúKhrushchev's candy wrappers‚Äù.  Indeed, they were quite motley, which was very unusual for the Soviet population of that era. </p><h2>  Name Traditions </h2><p>  The custom to come up with comic names for all notes flourished among the Russian population throughout the history of the issue of money.  Initially, coins were nicknamed, but the same fate befell the securities that replaced them.  At the same time, the names that modern people are used to hearing come to us from history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3monety.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 rubles 1961" class="if uuid-2696687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696687.jpg"></div><p>  For example, ‚Äúten‚Äù is the name of the new banknotes of 1961. They were also ‚Äúchervonets‚Äù, as they once called the gold rubles of the tsarist era, which were red, or ‚Äúworms‚Äù among the people.  Ordinary people sometimes called her "red." </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Appearance of freshly baked banknotes was colored, bright, varied.  Images for valuable "candy wrappers" were created by artists Pomansky, Dubasov, Lukyanov.  1 ruble denominated in a brownish tint.  and 100 rubles.  3 rubles were painted greenish.  and <span>50 rubles.</span>  A bluish tint was typical for 5 rubles.  10 rubles became red.  The violet shade was at 25 rubles. </p><p>  The 1961 USSR paper money depicted the Moscow Kremlin with its towers and temples.  On the "tens" flaunted a portrait of Lenin.  The banknote of 25 rubles, decorated with purple, stood out for its beauty.  Its registration is still recognized as highly protected; counterfeiting of such a security is extremely difficult. </p><h2>  How much are 1961 bills </h2><p>  The real value of each bill is determined, taking into account many features: the presence of seals, watermarks, stamps.  Ultraviolet marks also have a strong influence on the final price.  They were placed on banknotes with a face value of 10 rubles, 25 rubles, 50 rubles, 100 rubles.  Without the presence of ultraviolet marks, paper money (10 rubles) was issued in 1961, their value was several times higher.  UV markings were both purple and yellow.  Depending on the characteristics of the ultraviolet glow, 1961 paper money valued at 25 rubles is also evaluated differently. </p><h2>  Differences of notes </h2><p>  All banknotes, even issued at approximately the same time, will differ from each other.  Among each series, there is defective money with a different coating on different types of paper.  All this certainly affects the final cost of notes.  Sometimes a coin or a banknote of a smaller denomination will at times exceed the value of the seemingly less common denomination.  To detect clear differences in banknotes, take into account: </p><ul><li>  A kind of paper.  The first type is not glossy, its hue is light.  The second type is distinguished by the whiteness of the shade, it is covered with gloss, but only on one side.  This type was the most common at all times.  However, samples of the first type are considered more valuable, their final price is much higher. </li><li>  Series number.  The most expensive are banknotes with the beginning of the series with the letter I. </li><li>  The condition of the banknotes.  Given the quality, the presence of a variety of defects, scuffs, they estimate the final cost of paper money in 1961.  It is clear that banknotes that are not damaged by time are most valued. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.nkj.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="100 rubles 1961" class="if uuid-2696697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2696697.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine the value of 1961 banknotes </h2><p>  For their own calculation of the real value, banknotes use specially created tables, forums for the sale of numismatics.  Taking into account only the state of the banknotes, 100 Soviet rubles of that era will be valued at about five hundred modern rubles.  For one ruble of ideal condition they give about forty rubles, while in decrepit equivalent the same papers will cost about 3 rubles. </p><p>  To improve the condition of banknotes, the science of bonistics was created.  Using it, you can improve the material condition of any banknote, as well as study the historical moments of various countries and eras.  It must be remembered that the value of paper money in 1961 will always depend heavily on their safety.  And though those days are not so long ago, yet these bills cause considerable interest among people who are fond of numismatics. </p><h2>  What to consider when evaluating </h2><p>  Many families keep this money at home, which is now of some value.  At the same time, it must be remembered that the value of paper money in 1961 will vary depending on the date of issue, paper, its prints and stamps.  The most expensive will be notes without UV light.  They are recognized among professionals as rare.  Therefore, the owners of just such banknotes are lucky, they can be stored until a subsequent increase in their value. </p><p>  When evaluating, it must be remembered that dates not always written on a paper sign are real.  For example, banknotes issued only yesterday may contain dates of ten years ago.  This will mean that the appearance and design of the bill was developed on the specified date.  However, the bill itself is new, therefore, its value will be low. </p>
