They include salt.  This product is associated not only with our nutrition, but also with life as a whole.  Our article describes various types of salt.  In addition, you can find out its positive and negative qualities, as well as the daily rate of its use. </p><h2>  What is salt?  General information on the substance </h2><p>  Salt is <span>a complex substance</span> that, in an aqueous solution, decomposes into metal cations and anions of acid residues.  It is considered a natural preservative, a source of essential minerals and an indispensable spice in the kitchen.  In ancient Rome, salt was paid a salary and used it to create charms.  This substance was used as a medicine for some diseases. </p><p>  The greatest amount of salt is in sea water.  It can also be found in halite mineral.  It is extracted from sedimentary rocks.  Such salt is no less in demand than classical. </p><p>  In the food industry, salt is a food product that is ground sodium chloride crystals used in cooking.  It dissolves in water, but does not change its color.  There are different types of food salt.  All of them differ in taste, but nevertheless contain sodium chloride in their composition. </p><p>  Each of us knows the expression that salt is a white poison.  However, it is believed that without it, life on Earth would not have arisen.  Not everyone knows that salt is contained in the blood. </p><p>  In the chemical industry, sodium chloride (table salt) is used to create chlorine and soda.  It is also often used in cosmetology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Positive qualities of salt </h2><p>  Different types of salt have both positive and negative properties.  This substance contains in its composition a mass of trace elements.  Salt has a positive effect on the digestive system and improves vitality.  A small amount of salt in the diet reduces the number of asthma attacks.  This substance contains selenium in its composition - this is a useful substance that is an antioxidant.  It positively affects the cells and protects them from destruction. </p><p>  All types of salt contribute to the removal of harmful and dangerous substances from the body.  This compound perfectly helps with poisoning, since it blocks the process of absorption of the intestinal mucosa of toxic components.  Salt also delays their entry into the bloodstream.  Such an additive helps the body in the fight against radiation and other hazardous radiation.  She perfectly kills microbes. <br>  Many types of salt are used in cosmetology.  It is added to creams and scrubs.  Thanks to this component, the pores open and the dead cells are exfoliated.  The salt procedure can be done both at home and in the cosmetologist‚Äôs office. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of salt" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485048.jpg" width="600"></div>  All types of table salt were used during World War II.  Then, in a solution with its addition, a napkin was abundantly wetted and applied to the wounded soldier for several days.  Thanks to this, the damaged area became clean and had a healthy pink color.  It is known that saline can also be used in the treatment of tumors.

Absolutely all types of salt are no exception.  At a medical symposium in 1979, scientists said that table salt, which we consume daily, is a poisonous substance.  In their opinion, it suppresses our health. </p><p>  It is important to know the norm.  An excess of sodium in the body leads to a delay in excess fluid.  As a result - bags under the eyes, swelling of the face and legs.  Regular consumption of excessively salty foods leads to obesity and high blood pressure.  In this regard, a person quickly gets tired and feels headaches.  Excess saline leads to the formation of stones in the urinary tract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of food salt" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485050.jpg" width="600"></div>  All the harmful qualities of salt are to blame for the people themselves.  Attempts to make it whiter and better ended in the fact that today the product contains a huge amount of <span>sodium chloride.</span>  Surprisingly, natural sea salt, evaporated in the sun, in its composition resembles inorganic compounds of the blood.  The daily rate of salt should not exceed 15 grams.  It is important to consider its content in finished products.

    <h2>  The main types of salt </h2><p>  There are three types of salt: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  stone; </li><li>  boiling out; </li><li>  sea. </li></ul><p>  They are the most basic.  All three varieties differ in the method of extraction and purification. </p><p>  <span>Rock salt</span> has a gray color and large size.  It is crushed halite.  Surprisingly, it is the only edible mineral in the world.  The substance was formed several million years ago on the territory of the ancient seas.  They extract this type of salt in mines and caves.  Then it is cleaned.  Unfortunately, table salt contains a large amount of insoluble substances.  Over time, they accumulate in the body. </p><p>  <span>Evaporated salt</span> is characterized by a snow-white color and small size.  For its extraction, a mine with a salt reservoir is filled with water.  After that, the so-called brine rises up, which is evaporated and purified under the influence of high temperatures.  For example, Extra salt is a product that is 99% sodium chloride.  She is considered the most beautiful, snow-white and shallow.  It does not include solid impurities, but, unfortunately, there are no useful trace elements such as iodine, magnesium and bromine.  Chemical substances are often added to the Extra salt, which protect it from the absorption of liquids.  Because of this, the product is poorly soluble in blood and accumulates in the body. </p><p>  It is no secret that sea salt is extracted from the seas, lakes and evaporated under the influence of the sun and wind.  Unlike other types, it can be fine, medium and large grinding.  Sea salt contains in its composition the most important trace elements for the body.  It is she who is considered a truly natural and useful component.  The composition of sea salt includes iodine, magnesium, bromine, iron, zinc and silicon.  It is she who is recommended by nutritionists to those people who monitor their health and weight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="three kinds of salt" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485051.jpg" width="600"></div>  Recently, sea salt with unusual components has been in great demand.  Among them is a product with kelp.  Dried algae is added to this salt.  It includes organic iodine compounds.  This component is stored in the product throughout the entire shelf life, as well as during the preparation of not only cold, but also hot dishes.  As additional additives in sea salt with kelp add spices, herbs and even bread.  Surprisingly, it was from the last component that our ancestors prepared black salt.  It was lit in the church and used as medicine or as a talisman.

    <h2>  Interesting facts about salt </h2><p>  On the shelves of stores there are different types of salt.  For each of us, this is a spice that we consume daily.  However, many interesting facts are associated with this product, which not everyone knows about. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the name of many dishes is associated with salt.  Many years ago, the salad was a mixture of salted vegetables.  Thanks to this, its name appeared, which is known to us today. </p><p>  It is with salt that the name of salami sausage is also associated.  It is made from salted ham.  Marinade is also associated with our everyday product. </p><p>  Scientists believe that the daily rate of salt may vary.  They recommend first of all to pay attention to the time of year and the lifestyle of a person.  In the summer, people sweat and lose a large amount of fluid, which is why experts allow you to use up to 20 grams of salt during this period.  Athletes can adhere to this norm at any time of the year. </p><p>  Another interesting fact is related to cooking.  Surprisingly, coffee lovers can safely add a pinch of spice to the drink.  Thanks to this, it will have a more intense aroma.  Good housewives know that salt will help beat egg white to steady peaks.  Do not do without it in the preparation of yeast dough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of salt" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485055.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Salt in the human body </h2><p>  The types of salts in the body and their properties remain a mystery to many.  It is they who participate in <span>mineral metabolism,</span> which is characterized by the intake of mineral components into the body.  Salt enters our body along with food and water.  Then it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the cells of the whole body.  The most vital types include salt: </p><ul><li>  sodium; </li><li>  magnesium </li><li>  potassium; </li><li>  calcium. </li></ul><p>  The salts that are contained in our body perform a wide variety of functions.  They participate in the formation of enzymes, ensure proper blood coagulation and normalize the alkaline balance in it.  Salts also play an important role in regulating fluid. </p><h2>  Salt in water </h2><p>  The types of salts in water play an important role.  It is from them that the stiffness of each fluid, important for life, depends.  Soft and hard water is characterized by a combination of chemical and physical properties, as well as the amount of <span>alkaline earth metal</span> salts dissolved in it <span>,</span> namely calcium and magnesium. </p><p>  Fresh water is considered to contain no more than 0.1% salts.  This is the lowest rate.  Sea water is considered the most saline.  The percentage of the substance in it ranges up to 35%.  Brackish water differs in the amount of salt, which is more than in fresh, but less than in sea.  There is also such a liquid in which this substance is absent.  Water that does not contain salt and other components is called distilled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mineral salts species" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485088.jpg" width="240"></div>

    <h2>  Aromatic salts </h2><p>  An important role in our lives is played by mineral salts.  The species that exist today can surprise everyone.  Despite the fact that they are all quite similar in taste, experienced chefs not only distinguish between them, but also give preference to the most exotic species. </p><p>  One of the most popular is considered to be Himalayan.  She has a pink color.  Its deposits were formed about 250 million years ago.  A unique color was formed due to the interaction of salt and magma.  This spice is pure and natural.  Due to its dense consistency, it is often used in construction. <br>  Another popular aromatic salt is Svan.  It was formed due to the combination of spices and spices familiar to us.  You can either cook it yourself or purchase a finished product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="different types of salt" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485094.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Black hawaiian salt </h2><p>  Black Hawaiian salt is considered one of the most exotic and expensive.  It refers to marine species and is produced only on the Hawaiian island of Molokai.  It includes activated carbon, turmeric and taro.  Salt has a solid structure, a mild flavor with a nutty touch and an unforgettable aroma.  Usually it is used at the end of cooking, and they also decorate the finished dish with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of salts in the body" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1485096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Korean fried bamboo salt </h2><p>  We used to use table salt in the form of small crystals of white color.  However, every year there are more and more exotic species that strike with their taste and color.  Korean fried bamboo salt is a traditional spice in Southeast Asia.  The method of its preparation was invented by monks more than 1000 years ago.  The collected salt is dried in the sun and then placed in a bamboo stalk.  It is covered with yellow clay and fried at the stake.  Due to this, all harmful components are removed from the salt. </p><h2>  Persian blue salt </h2><p>  Persian blue salt is considered the rarest.  It has a pleasant blue color, which arose due to the high content of minerals.  It is extremely useful and in demand. <br>  Persian blue salt is used in the preparation of the most refined and expensive dishes.  Experienced chefs claim that her taste is revealed in stages. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Salt is a spice that almost every one of us consumes daily.  It can affect the body both positively and negatively.  Many types of salt are significantly different from the product that we add to food.  They differ not only in color, but also in taste.  Exotic types of salt are most in demand among cooks. </p><p>  Unfortunately, with the regular use of excessively salty foods, the general condition of the body can be disturbed.  That is why it is important to know its daily rate, which you familiarized with in our article. </p>
