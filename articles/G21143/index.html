But we forget that we can have a good rest in our country, without leaving its borders.  Of course, some time ago it was foolish to even compare the quality of tourist services, the service of Russian resorts on the sea with fashionable foreign resorts.  But after the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the situation has changed radically.  Sochi has become a center of resort life in the country, annually collecting hundreds of thousands of tourists not only from Russia, but also from other countries.  The city was literally rebuilt: many new luxury hotels and apartments appeared.  The infrastructure has also undergone significant changes: new entertainments, amusement parks, green squares were awarded the highest marks by vacationers.  And of course, there are all the necessary conditions for a beach holiday. </p>
