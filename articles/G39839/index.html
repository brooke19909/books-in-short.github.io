    <h2>  Choose the time of year for vacation </h2><p>  The season here begins in the second half of May.  However, at this time the sea is still cold.  Of course, each has its own priorities, especially since the rest in Zatoka can be very different.  Reviews say that if you are looking for a budget option, then choose May or September.  But in this case, you will either have to come to terms with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãswimming in the cold sea, or with the risks of falling into the rainy season.  And what is the best time for a comfortable stay?  This is the period from the second half of July until the end of August.  At this time, the water temperature reaches its maximum mark; it is very comfortable to swim in the sea even for young children.  However, if the wind changes, the water temperature may drop sharply and remain so for several days. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who can‚Äôt tolerate the summer heat, the August vacation in Zatoka will be optimal.  Reviews suggest that if you are traveling with young children, then choose this time.  Daytime air temperature is not too high, evenings are very warm and perfect for walking, and the temperature of the sea water reaches a maximum.  If the child is prone to colds, then this is the most favorable season for restoring health. </p>

    <p>  It is the embodiment of a fairy tale that tourists seem to be the recreation center ‚ÄúCardinal‚Äù, Zatoka.  Reviews emphasize that this is not just a hotel, but a luxurious entertainment complex with a swimming pool in the middle, which is located on the Black Sea.  However, even more admiration is the local dining room.  Here for only $ 7 you can have a lovely three-person lunch or five-person dinner.  How do you like this prospect?  However, there are no set meals.  You can choose from several options for salads, side dishes and a huge number of meat and fish dishes.  The main beach is just a few minutes away.  However, it is noisy and crowded here, and therefore experienced tourists are advised to go a little further.  At the end of Zatoka there are no tourists at all, and the sea here is clear. </p><h2>  Base "Solar" </h2><p>  And we continue to choose the best option for you.  If you scroll through an album of photographs, then certainly your attention will be attracted by the recreation center ‚ÄúSolnechnaya‚Äù (Zatoka).  Reviews about her are very contrasting, so we will analyze them.  But first, provide a general description.  Base "Solnechnaya" is a modern, elite hotel complex.  It is located in the central part of the resort village, between the sea and the estuary.  The appearance of the hotel is very respectable.  The semicircular structure with panoramic blue windows compares favorably with many neighboring hotels. </p>

    <p>  The property has its own beach, which serves a local bar.  The water park will appeal to adults and children.  There are three pools and, accordingly, the same number of recreation areas.  Especially popular among visitors is the largest pool.  It includes a hydromassage area, geysers and waterfalls.  There are safer areas for teens and the smallest.  In addition, there is a bath complex with a sauna.  Accommodation of tourists takes place in two residential buildings.  The suites are designed for one, two, three or four tourists.  Each one has a balcony or terrace.  The pirate-style restaurant is very noteworthy.  Here you will be offered dishes of Russian and Georgian, Ukrainian and Moldavian cuisine. </p><p>  What do tourists say?  Surprisingly, most of them are not at all enthusiastic about their vacation.  The hotel is really luxurious and quite expensive.  However, based on the reviews, one gets the impression that his leadership is not at all interested in developing his business.  Many are outraged that the rooms are dirty, towels and bedding are rarely changed.  In general, the organization is clearly not enough.  Although, it is quite possible that the management will take into account the reviews and correct these shortcomings.  The prices here are decent - 700 hryvnias (1769 rubles) per day per person. </p><h2>  Base "Smile" </h2><p>  This is the smallest, but at the same time very beautiful and cozy health resort.  It is located in the Liman Bay of the resort of Zatoka, right on the Black Sea.  A beautiful, three-story building invites guests and offers spacious rooms.  Each of them is equipped with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãair conditioning and a fridge, a TV and a bathroom.  All rooms have a private entrance.  On the territory there is a playground and gazebos. </p>
