Beginning needlewomen often prefer to use polymer clay as the material, because it does not require the presence or long development of any special skills.  Nevertheless, it is imperative to familiarize yourself with the basics of the correct technique and the sequence of actions. </p><h2>  Description of material used </h2><p>  This substance was artificially developed by Fifi Rebinder from Germany.  She is considered the first woman who was able to come up with what to mold from polymer clay.  The substance had a special herbal aroma and contained the so-called plasticizers.  Thanks to these elements, clay gained the property of plasticity.  At the same time, Fifi found out that when baking, the plasticizers are absorbed and harden, which means that after this procedure they can maintain a single solid form. </p><p>  Two types of polymer clay can be distinguished - thermoplastic and self-hardening.  The first of them requires special heat treatment.  The advantage of thermoplastics is high precision, which allows you to create parts and elements of any size from it.  Self-hardening clay dries out on its own in the sun within 24 hours, but in the process the product dries out, which causes not only a decrease in size, but also the appearance of certain irregularities, which should then be manually corrected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What can be molded from polymer clay" class="if uuid-3135242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3135242.jpg"></div><h2>  What can be made of clay </h2><p>  In reality, there are no special restrictions besides your own imagination.  To the question of what to mold from polymer clay, almost any answer can be given.  Many people prefer to make handmade dolls, exquisite figurines and various jewelry.  Certain types of thermoplastics can look like cloth, metal, wood or stone.  Of course, for starters, it is best to resort to the use of the most simple techniques and techniques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also a positive feature of plastic is the absence of any toxic elements in it, which makes it completely safe for children.  The source of inspiration can be a variety of prints, which provide step-by-step instructions for sculpting certain figures.  A number of polymer clay properties make it possible to create the most realistic elements, including heads, arms and legs for dolls. </p><h2>  Core toolkit </h2><p>  The creative process begins by choosing the right supplies.  You can buy clay with tools in any needlework store.  Among all manufacturers, Decoclay and Fimo are especially distinguished.  Also, Russian options like the Sonnet, the Pro, and the Flower proved to be pretty good. </p><p>  Regardless of what is molded from polymer clay, the master will need to purchase a number of tools, which includes the following: </p><ul><li>  rolling pin for rolling; </li><li>  extruder </li><li>  Toothpicks </li><li>  stationery or ordinary sharp knives; </li><li>  PVA glue for connecting several elements; </li><li>  special cutters called cutters; </li><li>  suede fabric that adds shine to the finished figure; </li><li>  emery paper to eliminate roughness and surface roughness; </li><li>  a plastic or glass work surface of sufficient size. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventure-in-a-box.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to mold from polymer clay for beginners" class="if uuid-3135243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3135243.jpg"></div><h2>  Applied modeling techniques </h2><p>  The combination of the options below is allowed.  Moreover, these techniques can be considered the most popular and popular today in solving the problem of what to mold from polymer clay for beginners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Smooth transition.  This technique mixes two different colors to give the desired effect. </li><li>  Sape, cane and millefiori.  The common name for these techniques is sausage.  To perform, you need to connect several layers of clay at once, and then roll them into a kind of roll. </li><li>  Mokume Ghana.  Several layers of material of various color shades are layered on top of each other. </li><li>  Watercolor technique.

A fairly difficult option, requiring good modeling skills.  Mostly not recommended for beginners. </li><li>  Mika Shift.  Technique involves creating the effect of three-dimensional immersion. </li></ol><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  The main actions in the order of their sequence can be voiced as follows: bonding parts, baking the product and varnishing it.  Each of the processes has its own characteristics to obtain high quality output.  For example, some details should be glued after baking.  In this case, you first need to fully determine what to mold from polymer clay and what elements should be used.  Glue should not be applied in strips, because visible smudges may remain.  Spot application is best used. </p><p>  The polymer clay manufacturer indicates on the packaging the temperature regime and the time to be followed during the baking process.  If the instructions are not followed, a color change of the product or insufficient degree of solidification of the material is possible.  A complete look is given to the figure by applying varnish, which, as a rule, clay manufacturers also apply in a needlework kit.  The final process is carried out with a brush or toothpick.  Varnishing is carried out in several layers, with each subsequent being applied only after the previous one has completely dried. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to mold a polymer clay figurine" class="if uuid-3135247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3135247.jpg"></div><h2>  Sculpting animals </h2><p>  Toys are one of the most common polymer clay craft options.

If the part of the head has a thickness of less than 3 cm, then it can be created without any frame.  Many beginners ask how to mold a face from polymer clay.  It is worth noting that each master can apply his own individual technique, but the process is in any case quite complicated. </p><p>  You can start from the forehead, which is done by rolling and flattening the sausage.  This results in a rectangular shape with recesses for the superciliary arches.  The nose is created from a droplet flattened in the form of a cone.  Two flat curved elements are fashioned for the cheeks.  Lips are made from short triangles with one thick edge, and the chin is made from a cone or a flattened short triangle.  The ears are a pair of droplets recessed at one of the edges.  For eyelids, you can make a pair of flat rugby swords.  Last but not least are the eyes.  They are created from a pair of balls of white clay that has been burned. </p><h2>  Connecting face details </h2><p>  When creating figures, many beginners are looking for an answer to how to mold a doll's face from polymer clay.  A shape for the head is preliminarily created, and foil is used as a skeleton, crumpled and flattened on one side.  After the application of 6 mm plastic.  Future facial features are outlined in thin lines with a needle, toothpick or knitting needle.  Thus, places under the eyes, mouth and nose are drawn, and nasolabial folds are created if necessary. </p><p>  Prepared face elements are laid out on a clay head in accordance with the marks.  Large parts are cut or overlapped.  The needle serves to smooth out the joints formed in the process.  All elements are subject to adjustment in the process, due to which it is possible to achieve optimal combinations of shapes and sizes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to mold a polymer clay face" class="if uuid-3135250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3135250.jpg"></div><h2>  Development of a work plan </h2><p>  Before you mold a polymer clay figurine, you need to get a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits appearance.  This is especially true when sculpting several different or identical dolls at once.  Without a clear plan, most likely, unpleasant moments will appear like any violation of proportions both within the framework of the elements of one figure and between several separate products. </p><p>  In addition, you should be preoccupied with thinking over reliable frames that fasten all parts together.  Large figures with a height of 25 cm or more usually have a brass or copper rod.  Smaller options (no more than 3 cm) can do without any frame at all.  Further, the proportions and dimensions of the figure as a whole and its individual parts are calculated. </p><h2>  How to mold a polymer clay doll </h2><p>  After the manufacture of the frame from any rod or steel wire, the volume is increased.  This is done using ordinary foil.  Without a well-built frame, it will not be possible to make a worthy product.  All dents, bumps and bumps should be smoothed out.  Thus, it will then turn out to apply clay evenly enough.  If the proportions and dimensions of the frame coincide with the outline sketches, then this stage is considered to be completed. </p><p>  In terms of how to mold a doll made of polymer clay, it is usually indicated that, first of all, the process begins with covering the visible parts of the body with the material, and only then it is worth proceeding to the head and face.  Distribute the available plastic in advance.  For example, you should first sculpt and set aside the doll's head, however, it is best to create hair and makeup on the finished attached element. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dearlittledolliesltd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to mold a polymer clay doll" class="if uuid-3135254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3135254.jpg"></div><h2>  Mumps </h2><p>  The choice of suitable colors for the product remains at the discretion of the needlewoman.  Preparatory procedures include creating a large ball for the torso, four small balls for the hooves, a thin tube for the tail and a middle ball for the heel.  You will also need to make eyes and ears.  They can also be made from four small balls of clay.  For the eyes, the use of small beads is allowed. </p><p>  It remains only to understand how to mold a pig from polymer clay, and combine all of the above elements.  A large ball for the body rolls into an oval, which tapers to one side, where the neck and head will be located.  Clay hooves are flattened into tablets.
