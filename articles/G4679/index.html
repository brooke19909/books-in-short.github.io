    <p>  Clothing is made separately, but for <span>interior dolls it is</span> usually made non-removable.  It can be sewn directly to the base or even glued.  The most important and responsible thing is to make the body itself.  It is made both in separate parts, and for example, it is made by the head with the body, limbs with the body. </p><p>  When stuffing parts with synthetic winterizer, it should be borne in mind that the density of the head should be greater than the legs.  If the limbs are too tight to fill, they will practically not bend, because of which it will not work to plant a doll.  When the neck is slightly full, the head may fall.  This should also be taken into account.  If something doesn‚Äôt work right the first time, don‚Äôt be upset.  All comes with experience. </p><p>  It is worth noting a slight nuance about the seams.  Some sew them until the details are cut out of the flap, and then they grasp the scissors and bypass the contour almost close to the seam.  You can do it in the traditional way.  On complex curved contours, incisions are made so that the fabric does not tighten after twisting and stuffing the element on the front side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is difficult to twist long and narrow parts of the legs and arms, and this is a characteristic feature of popular interior dolls.  It is worth using a pencil or a wand, while making allowances for seams to a minimum. </p><p>  Now you know how to make a doll out of fabric: first you make the head, then the rest of the body, and last, do the outfit.  This is the most interesting, fascinating creative stage, but you need to go through the rest. </p><h2>  How to sew a doll with your own hands: a master class on making a head </h2><p>  Puppets most often begin to sew with this element.  The head is made of fabric or from a cut off part from <span>kapron tights.</span>  In the first case, two parts are sewn together on the wrong side.  Through the hole left, the product is inverted, filled with padding polyester.  In the second embodiment, cotton is immediately stuffed into a nylon "bag".  By tightening the fabric with threads in certain places, you can form a face relief.  If you want naturalness and volume, you can even use the bottom of a plastic bottle as the basis.  It will be enough to add cotton wool for the roundness of the cheeks and chin. </p><p>  If you decide to make your head out of calico or other natural fabric, but you haven‚Äôt found a suitable shade, take the white material and create the desired shade yourself by coloring with natural pigments of tea or coffee.  Coffee gives a darker color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a doll with your own hands at home" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/679801.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The technology of dyeing consists in the fact that a white cloth is dipped in a hot solution (infusion) of a natural ingredient, held in it until it cools.  It is pulled out, hung out or laid out on a flat surface, so that it does not turn out to be stains, until it dries out incompletely, ironed.  After these procedures, you will get the desired shade, which, thanks to the last operation, will not be smeared. </p><p>  It is better to dye the fabric with large rags in the pan for uniform color, but first you should try to do this on a small piece.  Tea should always be filtered, otherwise the tea leaves will stain.  In the infusion, you can not only hold it, but also boil for about 0.5 minutes. </p><p>  Facial features are usually painted with paints.  Acrylic will do.  So that the pigment does not fall into the fabric, it is worth priming the right places with PVA glue.  The second way is to embroider the eyes, lips, and shape the nose from the fabric by stuffing.  You can stick purchased plastic eyes.  This option is usually used if the doll is made in the form of a character in the animal world (cat, hare). </p><p>  The hair is made of thread floss, yarn for knitting or other available material.  If you have an old wig from an unnecessary children's toy, you can try it on.  Usually, the hair is first collected in a hairstyle, and then gently attached to the head. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a doll do it yourself master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/679808.jpg" width="467"></div>
