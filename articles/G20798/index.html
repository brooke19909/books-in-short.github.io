The syllable ‚Äúba‚Äù means ‚Äúcotton fabric‚Äù, and ‚Äútik‚Äù means ‚Äúdrop‚Äù, ‚Äúdot‚Äù.  Batik for beginners in the general sense of the word is a manual painting of matter.  This type of fabric painting is a special technology for processing, dyeing and decorating material of a suitable structure.  On each of the islands of Indonesia and India, people have for centuries used this method of processing fabrics with natural dyes.  The most popular and the development of methods for creating batik received on about.  Java.

    <p>  Handmade fabric was used as a base for painting.  Her preparation was given special attention.  The fabric was soaked, boiled, bleached.  Masters in various ways achieved its homogeneity and the desired density.  The painting of one cut could take several days.  Its main stages were: waxing, staining, drying.  Such actions were repeated many times until a multicolor pattern was obtained.  In some cases, the tissue treatment consisted of 5-10 cycles.  The recipe for making natural paints is still carefully guarded.  The clothes determined the family ties of a person, his affiliation with the caste and social status.  The subjects of the painting were different: from the most complicated ornaments to abstract drawings.  Often they conveyed religious and genre motifs.  Despite the wide distribution of this art in Indonesia, in Europe and America it appeared only at the beginning of the twentieth century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basics of mural technology </h2><p>  Batik for beginners is based on the application of the contours of simple patterns to the fabric.  At the same time, those places that should not be painted are pre-coated with wax or a special rubber compound.  After immersing the treated fabric in a container with a coloring composition, its residues are carefully removed.  To achieve a layered pattern, the procedure is repeated several times.  Before starting work, any fabric must be washed thoroughly. </p><h2>  The cool way to create batik </h2>

For beginners, we can recommend the so-called ‚Äúcold‚Äù method.  It is based on the application of the contours of a special composition based on rubber glue.  Cold batik is used for dyeing silk, although some other fabrics can also be processed.

    <p>  The basis of this method is "reservation", which means applying a certain composition to the fabric in order to highlight and maintain a variety of shades of background and pattern.  Cold batik for beginners was invented much later than ‚Äúhot‚Äù.  This method of processing tissue became possible with the development of chemistry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reserving compounds for cold batik </h2><p>  The best reserve composition is considered the contour means "Gutta", which is produced by the company "Kroil".

There are color and colorless compositions.  A less environmentally friendly and convenient <span>mixture of rubber</span> glue, waxes and gasoline.  For 500 g of homemade reserve, you will need 50 g of glue, 430 g of gasoline, 20 g of <span>beeswax</span> or 220 g of glue, 230 g of gasoline, 50 g of paraffin.  Such a reserve should be applied with special tools.  Most often, a glass tube with a reservoir is used for this. </p>

As a rule, it is called "hot batik".  The reserve substance in this case is used only hot.  Thanks to the application of molten wax, the ratio of unpainted and stained fragments creates unique painting patterns.  The uniqueness of such a batik lies in the fact that even when you try to accurately repeat any ornament on the screen, it is impossible to obtain identical copies.  Wax is applied using a special tool, which in Indonesia is called ‚Äúchanting‚Äù.  Moreover, its shape may be different, and the principle of action always remains the same.  Places covered with wax do not absorb paint and limit its spread throughout the fabric.  This method is used, as a rule, for coloring matter made of cotton.

It is applied to the fabric along the drawn contours of the pattern.  After the composition has cooled, the material is stained and the wax residues are cleaned off.  When creating complex multi-layer patterns, you will need to repeatedly apply the reserve and color the material in the desired shades.  After obtaining the final result, the remnants of the wax mass are removed by several times ironing the fabric through wrapping paper. </p><h2>  The development and diversity of modern batik </h2>

At the same time, batik lessons for beginners include not only the traditional Indonesian methods of applying wax and paints to cotton, but also ‚Äútourniquet‚Äù, ‚Äúnodular‚Äù, blue-white Chinese color of silk, multi-color Japanese painting on silk.  There is another type of tissue processing, which is often called "batik for beginners."  This is the so-called "free painting".  Despite the various methods of execution, 3 different techniques are referred to it.  It includes watercolor, screen and graphic painting.  Such a mixture of methods of working with fabrics was due to the Dutch, who brought to Europe both the <span>production method</span> and the word ‚Äúbatik‚Äù itself.  Any technology can be chosen for beginners, and with the accumulation of experience with fabric and paints it will expand due to other methods of dyeing.

    <h2>  Working conditions when creating batik </h2><p>  Even with the best fabrics, special colors and reserves, it is impossible to obtain beautiful and durable products without proper work organization.  The room for creating batik must be bright, ventilated, dry and heated.  For work, you will need a convenient table and a large hoop or stretcher, in which the fabric will be fixed.  Matter should be well stretched, as sagging can disrupt the outline of the pattern.  As a rule, a wet cloth is pulled on a stretcher, and after drying it is well straightened.  For painting, you must have a set of tubes (for cold batik), special tubes with a reserve, brushes, patterns, forms for paints, a container for dyeing fabric.  For "hot" processing of the material you will need a special tool "chanting".  As chemicals that give tissues special effects, you may need alcohol, salt, and urea. </p>
