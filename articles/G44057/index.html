It is located just between the equally famous Antalya and Alanya.  Despite the fact that the town itself is quite small, beach hotels extend from it on both sides along the coast.  In addition, the resort area includes a number of nearby villages.  This region of the country was strongly influenced by Mediterranean cuisine.  Local restaurants serve very unusual fish dishes. </p><p>  The town lives off beach tourism.  A large number of ancient ruins attracts tourists.  Since the city was once founded by the Greeks, to this day in the district are many ancient buildings. </p><p>  Side district stretches along the coast for twenty kilometers.  A large number of historical attractions are concentrated on its territory.  Therefore, rest in the local area is chosen by those who strive not only to swim in the sea and bask in the sun, but also to see something new and interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side temple hotel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2126163.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Turkish resorts are famous for their extensive sandy beaches.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãold Side, there are two main sections of the coast - western and eastern.  The beaches seem to be, and are close by, but are very different from each other.  The western beach is safer.  Sunset at sea is smaller.  It is for this reason that it is more popular.  Here families with children prefer to relax.  Almost the entire coast is divided into separate parts between bars and restaurants.  But there are also public areas.  Outsiders are not allowed on the beaches of expensive hotels.  By the way, the local coast is marked with the Blue Flag, which indicates its cleanliness and ecology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  During the high season, the western beach is completely filled with vacationers.  It is always incredibly noisy and fun here.  There are a lot of recreational activities on the coast.  Here you can try your hand at sailing, parasailing, diving or fishing.  Along the coast grow orange and coniferous groves. </p><p>  Side diving is very popular on the coast.  The most interesting place is considered to be a French ship that sank during the Second World War.  You can also see under the remains of a military American aircraft near Manavgat. </p><p>  Of course, the underwater world of the Turkish coast is not as beautiful as in the Red Sea.  But still there are interesting places.  Near Side there are reefs, where they bring those who want to dive and enjoy the bright fish.  In the east of the historical center there is a professional diving club, which has excellent instructors.  Here you can take a training course and organize an interesting dive for experienced divers.  Prices in Turkey for such services are on average almost the same at all resorts.  The cost of the training course is from 8 to 16 thousand rubles, and one dive will cost from 2 to 4 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple side hotel 3 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2126169.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are a lot of hotels in Side, but guest houses or apartments are a rarity.  Almost all complexes are located near the sea and operate on an all-inclusive basis.  Prices in Turkey for accommodation are very different and largely depend on the level of the hotel and its infrastructure.  So, for example, the price range in Side per day in a double room is from 4.5 to 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews about Temple Side Hotel 3 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, let's turn to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Opinion about this institution in different vacationers is fundamentally different.  And the whole hotel is quite good as a budget vacation spot.  In fairness, it is worth noting that it is located in a very convenient place, since there are shops, bars and cafes nearby, and the distance to the coast is only two hundred meters.  As such, there is no territory in the hotel.  Therefore, children have nowhere to walk, most of the time they sit in the reception area, where the Internet catches. </p><p>  The hotel is modest enough, not a lot of apartments.  However, when booking rooms, you should know one caveat.  The fact is that not all hotel apartments have windows.  In half of the standards, entrance doors act as windows.  Not everyone likes the lack of sunlight.  If you open the door, you can be clearly seen from the street.  The rest of the rooms are good enough for relaxation, because they have everything you need.  Family apartments are more spacious.  Room cleaning is quite high quality and is carried out regularly, with the replacement of linen and towels there are no problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple side hotel 3 service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2126166.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the hotel is consistent with its price category.  Double room with all-inclusive meals for six nights costs from 45 thousand.  rubles.  Of course, this institution cannot be called fashionable, but it is worth remembering that there are only three stars on the sign.  As in any hotel, there are advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The all-inclusive hotel concept includes three meals a day and afternoon tea, as well as some drinks.  The dining room serves buffet meals.  Most tourists believe that the food is good enough, tasty and satisfying.  True, only chicken meat is present from meat.  Fish is also often served.  On the tables there are always a lot of vegetables and salads from them.  Of the fruits, apples, watermelons and melons are usually offered.  According to vacationers, the food, although a little monotonous, is simply impossible to remain hungry.  What the hotel lacks is traditional Turkish sweets.  Breakfast does not serve desserts at all.  And at lunch and dinner, the palatability of the proposed sweet dishes is not very good.  The rest of the food is quite high quality and good. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel makes a rather favorable impression.  Tourists are especially pleased with the Temple Side Hotel 3 * service.  Pleasant and smiling staff is one of the main advantages of the complex.  All tourists note the excellent location of the hotel.  Since the hotel is located in the center of Side, next to it there are all the most necessary facilities.  In addition, the ancient ruins of the ancient city are a ten-minute walk away. </p><p>  To the coast also go about ten minutes.  However, next to the hotel there is a city beach where you need to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas.  But it is very small and not very convenient.  The complex has its own spacious beach, located a kilometer from the hotel.  A bus runs on it four times a day.  But walking to it will take about thirty minutes.  The beach is very beautiful, but it has a sharp sunset in the sea.  Literally in a couple of steps it becomes deep enough, so you need to swim here carefully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple side hotel 3 beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2126175.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has its own small pool.  In the evenings, recreational activities are held that end closer to midnight.  Once a week, a Turkish night holiday is arranged for guests.  The hotel staff practically does not speak Russian, since the institution was originally focused on German tourists.  But at the reception there is always an administrator who speaks excellent Russian, so there is no language barrier. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, according to vacationers, the hotel is quite suitable for those tourists who do not want to overpay extra money for additional amenities.  Therefore, the hotel can be recommended as a budget institution with normal service and pleasant staff. </p>
