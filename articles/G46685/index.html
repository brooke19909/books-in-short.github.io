If you find yourself in such a situation, then a solution has long been found!  Like Hostel in Moscow is an organization that provides comfortable rooms for 300 rubles per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelbook.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Like hostel" class="if uuid-3154384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40722/3154384.jpg"></div><h2>  About company </h2><p>  The first Like Hostel was opened back in 2013 in Izhevsk.  The founder of the company is the world famous businessman and coach, Ayaz Shabutdinov.  Surprisingly, the first hostel did not even have beds!  By the evening, after making an advance payment to the guests, the sleeping places were collected. </p><p>  At the moment, Like is one of the fastest growing and most successful companies.  Like Hostel in Moscow is a collection of luxury apartments that you will not find in many hotels where the cost of rooms is many times higher. </p><p>  According to company statistics, more than 9 thousand people book rooms monthly;  more than 3 hundred visitors spend the night daily;  and only 2 percent refrain from reviews due to employment or dissatisfaction with the service.  The remaining 98 leave only kind words to the company's employees. </p><h2>  To whom?  To whom?  Not just one! </h2><p>  One of the most chic places for travelers is the hotel in Moscow City.  Like Hostel in Moscow is able to satisfy the needs of not only avid travelers and students, but also open doors for couples with children.  Separate rooms, special conditions, as well as maximum isolation - this is what you need if you need to spend the night with a small child in her arms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The room can be chosen depending on whether you are traveling alone or prefer to spend time in companies.  "Like" is ready to provide rooms from economy to VIP-class for both companion guys and those who need to relax alone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels.otpusk-info.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel like Moscow city" class="if uuid-3150080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/129058/3150080.jpg"></div><h2>  About service and services </h2><p>  The employees of Like Hostel in Moscow are proud that this hotel is considered one of the best in Russia and the CIS countries.  Cozy beds made up with fresh linen are prepared for each visitor.  In addition, everyone can use the kitchen, laundry and, of course, the bathroom.  Cleanliness is one of the main principles that is steadily observed in every Like! Hostel </p><p>  Please note that the hotel is non-smoking, all places are offered for guests who do not have a bad habit.  Everyone is offered free internet, a parking space, free tea or coffee. </p><p>  If you need to have a bite to eat or enjoy a full meal, then a restaurant with a shared kitchen and a snack bar offers its services.  Laundry, ironing facilities, safes, a photocopier and printer, as well as other minor services are provided to each guest.  You can get access to the Internet through laptops and computers, which are provided for free use to each guest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vashotel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like hostel Moscow address" class="if uuid-3150083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/129058/3150083.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and Attractions </h2><p>  One of the main "Like Hostels" in Moscow City is located in Presnensky District, 26 Konyushkovskaya Street. The hallmark of this district is the presence of a business center where the most successful entrepreneurs gather. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that the mini-hotel is equidistant from all airports: to Vnukovo - 25 kilometers, to Sheremetyevo - 25.3 kilometers, to Bykovo - 33.3 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like hostel best" class="if uuid-3150090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/129058/3150090.jpg"></div><p>  Like Hostel in Moscow is close to the most amazing sights.  For example, at 400 meters there is a Humpback Bridge;  and going a little further, guests can enjoy the wonders of the Moscow planetarium.  After 40 meters, the doors of the Moscow Zoo open for the most curious, and after another 30, the Presnya Memorial Museum.  Arbat and Patriarch's Ponds are one kilometer from the hostel, while Triumfalnaya and Pushkinskaya Squares are 1.6 and 1.8 kilometers away, respectively. </p><p>  Here lovers will find a place to work, and lovers to relax and visit the brightest Moscow streets.  So, Moscow City (a business center) is located only 2.8 kilometers from Like Hostel;  Gorky Park is located after 3.7 kilometers;  and VDNH begins almost 9 kilometers later - the distance is no longer close. </p><p>  So, if you decide to enjoy the beauties of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, work hard or stop for one night, look for ‚ÄúLike Hostel‚Äù in Moscow at the address: 3rd Tverskaya-Yamskaya, 12. This institution will save not only a significant amount of money, but also give an unforgettable feeling of comfort, coziness and care to everyone! </p>
