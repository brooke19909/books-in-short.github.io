    <h2>  International Stratigraphic Scale </h2><p>  The appearance of this system is an important discovery in the history of mankind.  It represents the basis of stratigraphy.  Ways to obtain information about the <span>geological history of the</span> development of the earth's crust were discovered using a planetary scale.  MSS is a significant element that can solve many geological problems.  Without this system, it would be impossible to create many world maps and descriptions of separate large sections, for example, tectonic, geological, paleogeographic, paleoclimatic, paleolandscape, and many others. </p><h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  The concept of "general stratigraphic scale" is most often found in Russian sources.  Its meaning is understood as the universal nature of the system and the global scope of its application.  The stratigraphic scale is a special sequence of taxonomic units.  This system can be considered as a standard of the absolute <span>geological period</span> during which the sedimentary shell of the Earth was formed.  It reflects the perfect complete cross section of the earth's stratosphere without various overlaps and gaps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stratigraphic geochronological scale" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461211.jpg" width="522"></div>

It is also used to determine the relationship of any stratosphere intervals.  In this case, their single or multiple return is established.  All of the above elements make the international stratigraphic scale the basis for compiling a chronology of events.  This measurement structure is the basis for restoring the geological history of the planet. </p><h2>  Standards </h2><p>  The totality of elements that includes the stratigraphic scale is a geological language of a global scale.  Its spelling complies with interstate agreement standards.  Professional language is one of the many features of the system.  The International Geological Congress is involved in setting these standards.  Also in this process is the union of geosciences.  For a long time, <span>these structures</span> organize special representative meetings, during which regular changes are made to the secondary school.  At the last meeting of the International Geological Congress, it was called the geological time scale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international stratigraphic scale" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461212.jpg" width="394"></div>

These units have only a temporary meaning, that is, chronostratigraphic.  For this reason, they are not used for the direct separation and relationship of sections.  The units, which includes the stratigraphic scale, in fact, represent only some time periods.  They, in turn, are represented in the rocks.  By the appearance of a section of a section of a certain sign, their boundaries are fixed.  This is best done under appropriate conditions.  The attribute should be isochronous, preferably from a chemical or physical nature. </p><h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  Currently, there is a version of the international stratigraphic scale, which is mainly based on regional units.  In particular, in the Western European system.  It has its own historical and geological character.  A stratigraphic scale with tiers shows the natural stages of development of certain areas of the Earth's surface, as well as the biota that inhabited it.  However, the obvious cannot be denied - the historical-geological principle really works successfully.  However, its use is effective exclusively in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãany one region or sedimentary basin.  The use of this paragraph in the development of the international stratigraphic scale is not possible.  This is due to the fact that the stages of development of different sites are often not similar in the length of time periods.  However, they are synchronized in a certain way due to the influence of global factors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="geochronological and stratigraphic scales" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461213.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Main trend </h2><p>  Entering the linear <span>scale of geological time</span> in years is carried out through a combination of many elements.  It is necessary to use all factors and dated events of global and regional scales.  Other stratigraphic elements are also needed. </p><h2>  Barriers to completing ISS </h2><p>  The Interdepartmental Strategic Committee of Russia harshly criticized the latest development of the system.  The fact is that the domestic organization decided to follow geological traditions in the future.  The Russian Committee refuses to use the international strategic scale in the form in which it is functioning now.  This is due to the features of its intervals, terminology and nomenclature.  From a practical point of view, all these elements contradict those contained in the general stratigraphic scale of Russia.  In addition, they have insufficient argumentation.  The official subjective reason that prevents the completion of the international stratigraphic scale is the beliefs of many domestic geologists.  They believe that the ISS should maximally reflect the geological history of the development of the planet.  This belief is recorded in the relevant code of the Russian Federation.  Thus, the stratigraphic scale of Russia is a separate system today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stratigraphic scale with tiers" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461214.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Additional information about secondary school </h2><p>  The International Strategic Directory reflects the totality of data relating to the main aspects of the system: principles, definitions, concepts, categories, which includes a stratigraphic scale, procedures and so on.  This system consists mainly of standard units, which are dated in years.  Their breakdown is based on the study of the schematic layout of rocks.  The system combines two different types of scales: chronostratigraphic and chronometric.  The first is currently perceived as a structure for measuring the schematic arrangement of rocks with standard sections that are selected in the stratotypes of the boundaries.  The second type is based on units of duration.  For example, in years, while the standard is second. </p><h2>  The main tasks of the system </h2><p>  The first goal pursued by the stratigraphic scale is to identify local temporal relationships.  Of great importance for the geology of all areas is the setting of the relative age of the layers.  These aspects are independent of any patterns of chronostratigraphic units of a global nature.  Secondly, the development of a standard scale is necessary.  It is needed to establish a complete systematic ordering of certain chronostratigraphic elements.  They have their own names and are used on a regional and global scale.  It is assumed that this hierarchy will become the basis of the standard.  It should determine the age of the layers of rocks, and also allow to correlate them with the history of the planet.  The ideal option is considered in which the standard scale will fill the entire sequence without any overlaps and omissions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stratigraphic scale of Russia" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461215.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Chronostratigraphic classification </h2><p>  This system is an organization of breeds in units.  It is based on criteria such as age and formation time.  The main goal of the system is to organize the rocks that form the earth's crust into certain units.  They, in turn, have their own names that correspond to intervals of the geological period.  These elements are the basis of the temporal relationship and the system of recording geological events of history. </p><h2>  Subdivision </h2><p>  This element is a collection of all rock layers that are combined together on a specific basis.  In particular, the process of their formation during the period of one interval is important.  The division includes exclusively breeds that were formed in a certain period of the history of the planet.  These elements are limited to isochronous surfaces.  Their <span>relative size</span> and ranks are set by the length of the time period that they reflect.  To compile a chronostratigraphic hierarchy, the thickness of deposits that are part of the units is not needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="general stratigraphic scale of Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461216.jpg" width="467"></div>
