Such programs, utilities and applications in an enormous assortment are located on the same Google Play - some record sound from other applications, some record incoming calls, while others work like a voice recorder, recording everything and everything. </p>

    <p>  Let's try to understand the whole variety of such applications, highlighting the most functional and most importantly - free - utilities that allow you to record conversations of calls and do not require any Root rights and other troubles. </p><h2>  Record Mic and Call </h2><p>  This utility can <span>record sounds</span> in several formats: WAV, 3GP, MP4 and AMR.  The program works with both incoming calls and other sounds from third-party applications.  However, you should immediately clarify that the program for recording calls only works with a microphone, so for exotic models without it, this option will not work. </p>

    <p>  The functionality provides for saving the recorded file under the name of the contact, which is very convenient.  Another useful feature of the utility is the automatic deletion of files every other day, week or month, which is also very useful in a framework limited by the medium.  It is possible to limit call recording by file capacity or conversation duration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Built-in functionality allows you to easily send a recording via e-mail or Skype, as well as put the whole process on a ‚Äúschedule‚Äù, which is very rare for similar programs. </p><p>  The application (Record Mic and Call recording) is distributed free of charge, therefore it is replete with intrusive advertising, which was mentioned more than once in user reviews as a clear minus.  Disabling the Internet helps to cope with this problem, after which the advertisement disappears immediately until the next inclusion. </p><h2>  RecForge Lite </h2><p>  Another noteworthy program that will easily record calls to Android.  The utility is characterized by advanced and very useful functionality, although it works with only three formats: WAV, MP3 and OGG.  In their reviews, many users note as an obvious plus of the software - the ability to convert different formats directly in the application.  The owners also note the excellent quality of the audio recording. </p>

    <p>  Almost all programs of such a plan record sound in high bitrate, if possible, based on the technical characteristics of the phone, but RecForge manages to add some additional effect that contributes to a better sound quality, which is good news. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Program features </h2><p>  Phone calls are recorded at frequencies of 8, 11, 22, 44 and 48 KHz, both in mono and stereo mode.  It has a convenient explorer that allows you to work with folders and files (move, delete, rename).  Some users in their reviews complain that call recording does not happen automatically, but this is more than compensated for by the presence of all kinds of widgets that similar products lack. </p><h2>  Easy Voice Recorder Pro </h2><p>  The utility is quite easy to learn, and the intuitive functionality will not become an obstacle in the recording.  Just select the desired mode and the program will automatically adjust to your current needs. </p>

    <p>  Call recording on Android takes place in high quality thanks to support for the WAV and AAC formats, and to save space on the drive, you can enable the 3GP format, which is also very convenient for everyone who watches every byte on the phone. </p><h2>  Utility Features </h2><p>  One of the distinguishing features of the utility is the service for <span>converting voice</span> to text, but with some caveats: you need an activated account in Quicktate, and only two languages ‚Äã‚Äãare supported - English and Spanish.  As an option, look for decryptors of the Russian language on amateur resources, since there are plenty of them. </p><p>  There is a function to stop playback if other applications try to play the file you need.  In general, the utility copes with its primary task, and user reviews about its work deserve attention.  If you don‚Äôt need dozens of extra functions, but you need a good tool to record calls, then Easy Voice Recorder Pro is a great option. </p><h2>  InCall Recorder </h2><p>  The first three respondents undoubtedly have extensive and useful functionality, in contrast to the modest InKel Recorder.  Yes, this program can only be recorded in MP3 and there are no schedules, timers or any widgets.  But they are essentially not needed, all the user needs is just to click on the button right in the call window, and the program will immediately begin recording calls. </p>

    <p>  The utility eliminates unnecessary transitions between windows to configure recording or create additional automatic profiles - just click on the button and use.  Another important point that many users note as a plus in their reviews is the ease of development.  When you turn it on for the first time, the program will tell you about the main points (in Russian), which is enough to get started. </p><p>  In addition, the utility is equipped with an equalizer, which, incidentally, is convenient and as simple as the rest of the modest functionality.  The built-in online assistant allows you to share the recording via email or Dropbox service. </p><h2>  Smart voice recorder </h2><p>  This utility is not much different from previous participants in the review, but it has one very interesting feature - it is a ‚Äúsilence pass‚Äù.  It is extremely rare to meet this feature in free software, and even then with a trial period of use. </p>

    <p>  The main feature of ‚Äúsilence skipping‚Äù is the cutting out of quiet moments, that is, you can think for a long time in a conversation without fear of the size of the recording file, since all silence will be automatically excluded.  Separately, it is worth noting that the threshold of "silence" can be set manually, which is extremely useful if you are, for example, at a train station or in another public place.  Judging by the reviews, the utility is in enviable demand among journalists and students. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  After a ‚Äúfield‚Äù test of an impressive number of applications of such a plan, we can conclude that there is simply no critical difference between them, and this also applies to paid software, including.  Therefore, the average user does not need to spend money on expensive programs.  Among the free variety you can find quite adequate, multifunctional and, most importantly, high-quality utilities for recording conversations. </p><p>  One of the most versatile options is InCall Recorder.  The program is easy to learn, and all you need to start recording is a single click.  A remarkable and useful instruction right before starting work will explain all the main points that you may need in the process. </p><p>  If you need a variety of features, such as scheduled recording, then Record Mic and Call is perfect for this.  Fans of high-quality sound and especially picky music lovers will surely make friends with the RecForge utility, which literally turns cacophony into a normal stream and pleases with a high bitrate. </p><p>  One of the easiest and most eye-catching applications is Easy Voice Recorder.  The utility perfectly copes with its main purpose and has an excellent voice recorder on board, which squeezes all the juices out of your microphone, but produces enviable sound results.  Those who like to record boring lectures can recommend Smart Voice Recorder.  The program filters out silence, leaving only the voice you need. </p>
