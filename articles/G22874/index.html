    <h2>  Some details </h2><p>  One-, two-, and three-room apartments are designed here, in which finishing is not provided, as well as parking lots located under the buildings and ground parking garages.  Transport accessibility of LCD "River Park" is not bad, since the complex is located not only in the city, but also quite close to the center.  Near Andropov Avenue, exit on the Nagatinsky bridge, to the metro on foot for about fifteen minutes.  Nearby is the South River Station.  Full urban infrastructure of the River Park quarter is provided.  After all, this provides for a project for the reconstruction of this industrial zone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Nagatinsky Zaton, several hotels and business centers will be built near the Kolomenskaya metro station.  LCD "River Park" will have its own comprehensive school, kindergartens and a clinic.  On one side, a section of the <span>residential complex</span> borders the embankment of the Moscow River, hence the name.  The River Park quarter is located in the middle of nature conservation complexes - the Sadovniki and <span>Nagatinsky floodplain</span> parks <span>.</span>  Very close is the museum-reserve, beloved by all Muscovites - Kolomenskoye.  The purely geographical location of River Park is very advantageous.  It has everything - a river, forest parks and proximity to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metropolis.  There is a lot of water from the east and north, the territory is surrounded by it.  Almost River Park is a peninsula. </p><p>  Nearby, a five-minute walk, there is a well-kept museum reserve, with an abundance of greenery, temples, historical monuments and wildlife.  The total area on which the River Park residential complex is under construction is almost thirty hectares, but the buildings will occupy only thirty percent of this area, the rest is naturally cultivated nature: with a promenade, boulevards, parks, squares, sports facilities, playgrounds and other well-maintained public areas. </p>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  In the style of post-constructivism designed LCD "River <span>Park".</span>  <span>Moscow</span> in recent years has become rich in modern new buildings, many of which are unique.  Here the comfort of future residents is thought out to the smallest detail.  The buildings will be built quarterly, forming cozy enclosed courtyards.  And this isolated space is highly demanded today by residents of megacities, because people tired of vanity want a comfortable social environment, that is, to know their neighbors in person and by name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is exactly what is planned in the River Park LCD.  Here, the courtyard culture that dominated in Moscow fifty to sixty years ago may well be revived.  And if you add to this wonderful unhurried walks along the promenade near the big water, where the space is perfectly provided and the borders are pushed aside, there are the advantages of buying a home in the River Park residential complex.  Reviews say that there are a lot of people who want to settle here. </p><p>  In total there are 22 buildings in the <span>residential complex</span> , with nine to nineteen floors, in which approximately six thousand people will live.  The developer of LCD Park River is Rechnikov Invest.  The project is being implemented by the development company AEON Corporation together with Ferro-Stroy.  Sberbank acted as the financial partner, and Ostozhenka Bank acted as the general designer. </p>

    <h2>  Project </h2><p>  Designers made sure that a comfortable and convenient stay in this residential complex was daily and every minute.  There are no standard solutions, the entire project is copyrighted, and every square meter of the territory is thoroughly thought out.  All the wishes of future residents are provided.  Beautiful playgrounds will be created here, as well as zones for adults and elderly people who wish to engage in physical education. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The equipment is supplied by the world leader in this area - a company from Denmark - Kompan.  Even plants in these territories will delight the eye from the earliest spring until the very late fall: first bird cherry and apple trees, then flowers on the flower beds.  In autumn, you can admire the lights of rowan berries, in winter - forever green needles.  There will be no dull plains here - designers will even change the landscape with loose hills.  For relaxation, designed wooden ergonomic benches. </p><p>  All small forms located on the territory will be with decorative lighting, and the general lighting in the courtyards and on the streets will not interfere with the sweet sleep of the residents in their apartments.  Kids here will not get lost even on bicycles: they have developed special safe routes that are looped back.  Playgrounds for each age will have their own.  Parkour and specific simulators for sports will be created for teenagers. </p><h2>  Children and adults </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in the construction of the complex the author's design of the River Park residential complex is used.  It is difficult to completely describe it.  After all, it can turn out to be too long, since there are so many interesting solutions.  We will talk about some of them in the article below.  For example, about school.  She will have a glass facade, so the children will not move away from the social environment of the entire city block.  They will be at school, but at least a little at home. </p><p>  There are special safe routes to the school.  For small schoolchildren, developing zones will be arranged right in the open.  A kindergarten will have its own pool.  The project focuses on children's health.  For walks around the school and kindergarten there are vast territories, and the kids will engage in classrooms that are spacious and bright.  Even the lockers here will be special - with ventilation, so that the child‚Äôs clothes dry out after a walk. </p>

    <h2>  Competition </h2><p>  The competition for the development of an <span>architectural concept has</span> been declared international.  The finals were architectural bureaus from Italy, China and Russia.  For a long time, the jury selected from the most beautiful projects the most thoughtful and successful.  Russian architects won.  The basis of the project is the unity of solution, the harmony of all elements: from bicycle and pedestrian paths to moorings, a lighthouse and the general landscape.  Paving, gazebos, every small form - everything is tied into a single complex, providing comfort for the eyes and convenience for everyday stay. </p><p>  The promenade is functionally zoned - with walking areas and venues for various events.  All along its length restaurants and cafes will work.  The embankment is surrounded by groves of birches and elms, a large apple orchard and another floating garden - on a ship.  In winter, an ice rink and a Christmas tree will be equipped on the main square of the complex. </p><h2>  Residential and non-residential </h2><p>  Nineteen non-residential premises are currently on sale, which are located on the first floors of three buildings of the first phase of commissioning of RC River Park.  Prices per square meter start at 159 thousand rubles.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese premises is from 45.30 square meters to 88.73.  A total of 1,400 square meters of purely commercial space is sold in the first stage, and up to six thousand in the entire project.  Residential premises - 2300 apartments in seven houses of the first stage.  All buildings are nineteen floors with apartments ranging from thirty to one hundred and nine square meters, from one to four rooms. </p><p>  The first three three-section buildings (Nos. 8, 9, 10) offer 648 apartments, of which 216 are one-room, 324 are two-room and 108 are three-room.  The main feature of these apartments is an improved layout.  The buildings of the first stage are made of precast concrete, but the first floors are monolithic completely, so the most spacious and comfortable layouts are provided.  They do not have extra partitions and corridors with which panel housing construction is so different.  The ceilings are also much higher here: three and a half meters in the eighth and ninth buildings and four meters in the tenth. </p><p>  Therefore, the size of windows in non-residential premises is one and a half times greater than in apartments.  But all the premises of the tenth building, which overlook the embankment, are with panoramic glazing.  On the first floors are offices with separate entrances, common areas and control rooms.  The elevators in each section are silent - freight for a thousand kilograms and passenger - for four hundred.  One-room apartments, offered today in LCD "River Park", from six and a half to ten and a half million rubles, two-room - from eight to sixteen million, three-room - up to twenty-four.  Nevertheless, there are very few free apartments left. </p>

    <h2>  Parking </h2><p>  The land parking of the residential complex is combined from two materials - fiber cement panels on the lower part of the main building and on the front facades of buildings and metal pipes painted in white.  Two surface parking areas are already located in the complex.  They are perceived very harmoniously in the general building system, despite the fact that this is just a garage complex.  Most likely, this effect is achieved due to the fact that the facades of buildings are also lined with fiber cement panels. </p><p>  Entrances and exits to garages are carried out by means of separate gates with automatic barriers and only through a special internal passage between the parking enclosures.  Access to this protected area, including the entrance and exit of vehicle owners, is controlled by a management system.  The upper floors of the parking lot (from the second to the sixth) can be accessed by elevators, which are located at the ends of the buildings, or through the stairwell.  The total area is 15 051 square meters, 521 places for cars.  Parking lots are located a hundred meters from the first line of residential buildings. </p><h2>  Features and Features </h2><p>  Only the first part of this residential complex will consist of three phases of three or four buildings in each of them.  A total of one hundred sixty eight residential square meters.  About four thousand people will live in four and a half thousand apartments.  These are panel houses (series "Europe") on nineteen floors.  These apartments will have internal walls and even decoration from the builder.  Three buildings - from the eighth to the tenth - are located with the letter "P", thus forming a pretty courtyard, where everything is thought out to the smallest detail in favor of the convenience of residents.  However, many buyers have a question: why are prefabricated houses here, if the project should have a monolith? </p><p>  Perhaps this was done in order to collect the first (and more "light") money for the construction of next and more expensive buildings.  Typical houses are always cheaper than monolithic, and much more.  And to build them is not an example faster.  And this plan was a success.  To date, there are not even two dozen free apartments in the first stage - everyone has been sold out.  And the developer considers the money and thinks how best to distribute it for the construction of more expensive and complex buildings.  In the second stage there are also three identical houses, but already monolithic-prefabricated structures and aerated concrete blocks.  There are eighteen floors in buildings and two turrets - fifteen- and twelve-story.  Here the parking lots will be underground. </p><p>  Interestingly, the parking roof protrudes from the ground by about four meters.  Therefore, the patio will be raised, fenced.  Neither cars nor strangers will be able to access this place.  Here, the entrance to the entrances is carried out only from the outside of the buildings, and the courtyard can be accessed through the second floors of residential buildings of the second stage of LCD Park River.  Their deadline is 2017.  There are no interior walls and finishes, and the windows are 210 centimeters high, very large.  In any case, much more than in the panel houses of the first stage.  The third phase will be ready in 2018. </p>

    <h2>  Second and third stages </h2><p>  In the second phase of construction, monolithic houses of eighteen, fifteen, twelve and nine floors.  In apartments, the ceiling height is three meters, in the entrance groups - almost six.  At the same time as the second stage, kindergarten is completed (individual project).  The decoration of all common areas in the buildings of the second stage is design.  Concierge is available.  The facade is ventilated, sound insulation and increased insulation.  Ceramic and <span>fiber cement boards</span> for facade decoration are imported, of the highest quality. </p><p>  And in the first stage, and in all the rest - there are places for air conditioners.  The third stage is also monolithic houses of fifteen, twelve and nine floors.  This is the first line from the river with the best views of the embankment.  Simultaneously with the third stage, a school will be commissioned, completed according to the author's project.  The one and a half kilometer embankment for the delivery of the third stage will be completely landscaped - with piers for boats and boats, a boat station, boathouses and the like.  Moreover, a sailing school for children is also being built here.  In total, twenty-two high-rise buildings will be erected in the complex. </p><p>  This is a very large-scale project, which is entirely provided by its own infrastructure.  The district of the capital is highly developed.  The only drawback is poor ecology.  One and a half kilometers from this area, treatment facilities are located.  From there, with a fair wind, an unpleasant odor is carried throughout the district.  In addition, the land where construction takes place requires mandatory renovation.  Not all buyers are sure that the developer will solve these problems.  However, apartments are being sold out incredibly fast. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  First about the good.  Soon, until 2020, a new metro station will open here - Klenovy Boulevard.  It is very close to the LCD River Park.  The Nagatinsky Zaton district is pleasant by the presence of a large number of green areas.  It is not transitory, because there will always be a quiet and peaceful place to stay.  Own quay alone is worth a lot.  And what magnificent views from the windows to the parks and ponds!  The developer is very reliable. </p><p>  It is definitely checked and will not fail.  The infrastructure here is excellent.  If something is not enough in the residential complex itself, around it - Moscow - the district is almost central, which has everything, as in Greece.  The clinic in the LCD own, there are several shopping centers, a school, a kindergarten.  What else is needed?  Now about the negative.  Its smaller, of course.  About the environment has already been said.  The metro is far away.  Water is close - it's nice and beautiful, but the foundations would not have leaked.  The people will soon be much more here, because next to the residential complex is planned the construction of Moscow Disneyland.  The biggest drawback is traffic jams, but it can be said about absolutely any area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow with confidence. </p><p>  The housing here is beautifully made, the surroundings are picturesque, for every taste, but alas!  - far from every wallet.  And the most interesting: Nagatinsky Zaton, a peninsula located in the southern district of Moscow, is the most densely populated in this metropolis.  Here, on the peninsula, many people live - one million and eight hundred thousand more.  If you add the population of Novosibirsk and Barnaul (cities not small in territory), you get about the same.  But only the territory of Nagatinsky Zaton is much smaller. </p>
