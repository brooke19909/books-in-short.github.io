    <h2>  How to choose the right crochet hook </h2><p>  For beginners, it is important to immediately learn the basic rule: you should select a hook for the thickness of the yarn, and yarn - for the pattern of the selected pattern.  It happens the other way around: the fashionista liked the yarn, and she wanted to knit a unique thing under it.  In this embodiment, the hook is bought under the thickness of the thread, and then the circuit is already selected.  Crocheting for beginners sweaters with a complex pattern can be an impossible task and discourage the desire to continue needlework.  You should always practice with simple patterns, gradually mastering new, more complex patterns.  This is the only way to achieve true mastery. </p>

Quite often, the yarn label indicates which hook number it is intended for.  Otherwise, you must independently determine the size.  It is important that the thickness of the head of the knitting tool be equal to the double thickness of the folded yarn.  For knitting some products, this rule does not apply, then the thickness of the hook and yarn can be the same.  In the process of knitting, using several types of tools will help to better understand the details.

    <p>  The quality and uniqueness of work depends little on the color of the yarn.  It is important to choose the right thread texture.  For knitting wear items it is better to use natural yarn, it is somewhat more expensive, but if you create a masterpiece, then it should correspond to its status in all respects.  Synthetic thread is most often used for knitting toys, decor elements.  Specialized stores can offer a choice of yarn of all possible colors and any quality. </p><h2>  Specific words and their meaning </h2><p>  Parsing textual descriptions of the work, one can come across incomprehensible words for the novice craftswoman: ‚Äúair loop‚Äù, ‚Äúrapport‚Äù, ‚Äúuneven columns‚Äù, ‚Äúchain‚Äù, ‚Äúarch‚Äù.  Of course, one cannot do without the initial theory, but it should be studied in tandem with practice.  All these tricky, at first glance, words are easier to remember, practicing their execution: knitting "pigtails", "arches", "chains". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to learn crochet for beginners in a short time and without special difficulties, sweaters should not be taken as a practical example.  It is easier to train on a single piece of canvas that does not have a special purpose, which can then be dissolved or stored as a sample.  It is not scary to try knitting arches, air loops or a simple pattern to understand what rapport is.  Even if it takes more than one week to learn, knitting a cloth will give an invaluable experience. </p><h2>  Text job description </h2>

If you build up some experience, over time, one pattern scheme will be enough for needlewomen, but a text designation is never superfluous.  In addition, it reflects all the main numbers: the number of loops in the figure, rows in the rapport, the junction of the individual elements.  With such an allowance, there is no need to re-count the loops once again.

    <p>  Focusing on the diagram and text description, it is easier to learn <span>crochet.</span>  <span>A jacket for a girl,</span> which can be chosen as the first independent product, will be a good start to the practical implementation of the theory studied.  When everything is at hand: two job descriptions, a tool, yarn and a model for which the product is knitted, work is faster.  Over time, you can begin to create clothes for yourself. </p><h2>  <span>How to read</span> the drawing scheme <span>correctly</span> </h2><p>  In the process of studying and practical development of the knitting technique, it is important for a novice master to remember and consolidate all the information received on patterns and methods of work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork crochet sweaters" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/373445.jpg?1397473481316" width="418"></div>  Prior to introducing the concept of "rapport" into the description of schemes, a drawing could consist of several sheets in which each element of the pattern was drawn with all the details and with the real number of rows.  This made it difficult to crochet for beginners sweaters - the most popular element of clothing.  The description was too long, and the master could get confused in the ranks.  Now it‚Äôs enough to be able to read the rapport pattern and repeat it as many times as necessary.

    <p>  The scheme is read from bottom to top and from left to right, if only the front (even) rows are indicated.  With a more detailed drawing, when a description of the back rows is required, they are read from right to left.  If the scheme requires special reading, additionally the arrows indicate the direction of knitting.  This may seem complicated only for beginners.  After accumulating some experience, the process of studying the circuit will cease to cause difficulties. </p><h2>  A small example to reinforce the theory </h2><p>  One of the patterns that is often knitted in various products - the ‚Äúshell‚Äù - is used to create delicate sweaters, shawls, individual details of clothing, as well as an original decoration.  It is not difficult to master, it can be used in different alternations with other patterns on the canvas: in horizontal, vertical or staggered order.  ‚ÄúShell‚Äù can also be used as a canvas for various things, especially it is ideally suited for crocheting sweaters with a yoke.  By application, this is a universal pattern. </p><p>  To knit the ‚Äúshell‚Äù, you need to dial the desired number of lifting loops for the product that will be created.  Additionally, we collect several loops for the chain.  We calculate how many ‚Äúshells‚Äù will be on our canvas, and with the loop chosen according to the calculations, we begin to execute five crochets at once.  The number of crochets depends on the preferences of the needlewoman: if she likes voluminous patterns, she will take more crochets.  The number of columns should be odd if there is no desire to shift the pattern to the side, or even if the ‚Äúshell‚Äù must be staggered.  After knitting the columns, you need to skip a few more loops of the base of the chain, and then in the selected loop knit the same number of columns with crochets.  This will be the ‚Äúshell‚Äù pattern.  Having mastered it, you can take up <span>crocheting sweaters with patterns.</span> <strong></strong></p><h2>  Knitting workshops </h2>

Nowadays, you can learn everything from quality manuals and video programs.  Only this is a bit wrong.  To become a true master, it will still be more correct to work out with a professional.  Learning from someone is always more convenient and faster.  In addition, the training master will transfer to the students his own achievements, which cannot be found in the manuals, will clearly show knitting techniques, as they say, on the fingers.

    <p>  And if you already have some initial experience in mastering the knitting technique, it is enough to visit narrowly targeted master classes, such as, for example, crocheting sweatshirts.  If you want to learn how to knit more serious things, you can agree with the teacher about a private lesson. </p><h2>  Both fashionable and beautiful </h2><p>  Crocheted products are unique and inimitable, even if the basics of ancient drawings were used to create them <strong>,</strong> because each needlewoman will definitely bring something special to the existing schemes: she uses other connections of the main elements, replaces some nodes with others or something else.  To meet two absolutely identical things is almost impossible.  Crocheting for beginners sweaters according to a well-learned pattern can be repeated with another yarn with a different shade as a fixing practice.  Firstly, the scheme will be studied in detail, and the creation of the second and subsequent models of time will require much less.  Secondly, repetition is the mother of learning, which means that having done one operation several times, it will be much easier to remember.  Thirdly, creating the next product, the master will definitely want to bring something of his own to the drawing - this can turn out to be a unique thing in all respects. </p>
