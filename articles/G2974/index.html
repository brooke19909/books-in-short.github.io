Its luxury is striking to this day.  The Palace in Versailles is an architectural monument located in the suburbs of Paris.  He gained fame thanks to his fountains, gardens, unique interiors, as well as size, because the complex is considered the largest in Europe. </p><h2>  Castle history </h2><p>  The Royal Palace at Versailles is located just twenty kilometers from Paris.  His story began after Louis XIV visited the castle of his Minister of Finance.  The building struck the monarch with grandeur and scale.  In beauty, it significantly exceeded the royal residences of the Tuileries and the Louvre.  The Sun King painfully took this fact, and therefore decided to build a palace that would become a symbol of his absolute power.  Monarch chose the city of Versailles not by chance.  Shortly before this, France was shocked by the Fronde, so it would be imprudent to continue living in the capital. </p><h2>  Residence construction </h2><p>  The construction of the palace in Versailles was begun in 1661.  Over 30,000 people took part in the work.  To this end, the king banned any private construction in Paris and the surrounding area.  In peacetime, even sailors and soldiers were sent to work.  Despite the austerity, a lot of money was spent on the construction of the palace, although building materials were purchased at the lowest prices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viatorcom.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace in Versailles" class="if uuid-2548033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548033.jpg"></div><p>  The royal family moved into the palace at Versailles in 1682, but work on this did not stop.  The complex was constantly being completed due to the extension of new buildings.  Work was carried out until the French Revolution of 1789.  The palace was created in the Baroque style.  Its first architect was Louis Levo, who was later replaced by Jules Arduin-Mansart.  The layout of the palace and park in Versailles was carried out simultaneously.  The design of the parks was entrusted to Andre Lenotra.  But the interior decoration of the building was led by the painter Lebrun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction was very complicated.  Initially, it was necessary to drain the swampy lands, filling them with soil, sand and stones.  After the soil was carefully leveled, forming terraces.  On the site of the former village, it was necessary to build a city where the courtiers, guards and servants could live. </p><h2>  Territory formation </h2><p>  In parallel with the construction of the palace in Versailles, work was carried out on the arrangement of the adjacent territory.  Since Louis was called the ‚Äúsun king,‚Äù Lenotre decided to plan the park‚Äôs alleys in such a way that they resembled the rays of the sun diverging from the center.  Initially, it was necessary to dig channels and build a water supply system, which was supposed to supply water to fountains and waterfalls.  The work was not easy, since it was planned to build more than 50 ponds and fountains.  In the course of the work, it became clear that the aqueduct, built originally, will not cope with the task.  As a result, after numerous attempts, a hydraulic system was built into which water flowed from the Seine. </p><h2>  The fate of the palace </h2><p>  Louis XIV did not have time to complete his project.  After his death, Louis XV and the entire court settled for a while in Paris.  But seven years later, the king returned to Versailles, and later ordered to continue construction work. </p><p>  Significant changes were made to the layout of the palace at Versailles, as the monarch decided to demolish the Ambassadors' Stairs, which led to the Great Royal Chambers.  Louis XV made such changes consciously to build chambers for daughters.  In addition, he completed all work on the opera hall.  At the suggestion of his favorite, the famous Madame Pompadour, the Trianon Palace was built in Versailles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The interiors of the palace" class="if uuid-2548039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548039.jpg"></div><p>  In the last years of his life, the king began to reconstruct the facade of the palace.  According to one version, work was to be carried out by the courtyard, and according to another, the external facade was subject to restoration.  The project was so large that it was completed only in the last century. </p><p>  According to historians, the palace was the place where the kings and their entire court relaxed in style and scope, here they weaved intrigues, created conspiracies.  Such traditions were begun by Louis XIV, and later they were continued by his descendants.  The greatest scope reached under Marie Antoinette, who was very fond of entertainment, intrigue and mystery. </p><h2>  Palace of versailles </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe palace without parkland is 67 thousand square meters.  The main palace in Versailles is the main building in which several generations of rulers lived.  Officially, the castle could be accessed through the front door, which was decorated with a cast-iron grille with a royal royal coat of arms.  In front of the main building, two pools, faced with granite, were created. </p><p>  A royal chapel was erected on the right side.  Its upper tier was intended for the monarch and his family, and the lower - for the courtiers.  In the northern part of the building were the king‚Äôs chambers, and in the southern part there were maids of honor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In total, Versailles has about 700 rooms.  The monarch received foreign ambassadors in the throne room with the beautiful name "Salon of Apollo."  In the evenings, musical performances and theatrical performances were held here. </p><p>  One of the most significant premises of the Grand Palace in Versailles is the Mirror Gallery.  The most important techniques were held in it, for which a silver throne was installed.  Balls and lush holidays were held here.  The courtiers crowded in the gallery in the hope that the monarch would go through it to the chapel and they could submit a petition to him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abc.net.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirror Gallery" class="if uuid-2548029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548029.jpg"></div><p>  The mirror gallery has a special look.  It has 17 arch-shaped window openings.  They all open onto the garden.  And between the windows are mirrors that visually enlarge the room.  In total, the gallery has 357 mirrors.  The hall has a high height (10.5 meters).  Mirrors opposite the windows give the impression that there are openings on both sides.  Until 1689, the room was decorated with silver furniture.  Later it was melted into coins. </p><h2>  Greater Trianon </h2><p>  The castle was built in a classic style and decorated with pink marble.  The monarchs used the building for a variety of purposes: to relax while hunting or meeting with favorites. </p><h2>  Lesser Trianon </h2><p>  The palace was erected on the initiative of the Marquise de Pompadour, however, she died before the end of work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="primewomen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lesser Trianon" class="if uuid-2548045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548045.jpg"></div><p>  The building is designed in the style of transition from Rococo to classicism.  After the construction was completed, the king's favorite, <span>Countess Dubarry</span> , lived here <span>.</span>  After the accession to the throne of Louis XVII, the palace was transferred to Marie Antoinette.  She was resting in its walls, even the king could not bother her here.  Subsequently, the queen built a small village near the palace with a mill and houses in accordance with her ideas about the life of peasants. </p><h2>  Parks and gardens </h2><p>  Not only the interiors of the palace in Versailles are impressive, but also its gardens.  The latter consist of a large number of terraces.  In total, the park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 100 hectares.  An interesting fact is that all of it is completely flat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park territory" class="if uuid-2548037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548037.jpg"></div><p>  It is simply impossible to find uneven terrain on its territory.  Here are Small and Big Trianon, Belvedere, Theater of the Empress, Temple of Love, grotto, French pavilion, viewing platforms, sculptures, alleys, canals, systems of fountains and reservoirs.  The gardens of Versailles are sometimes even called little Venice. </p><h2>  Difficult times </h2><p>  The Versailles Palace was the seat of the monarchs for about a hundred years.  But after the French Revolution of 1789, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVII were arrested and executed in Paris.  After these events, the palace lost its political and administrative significance.  He was plundered, and many masterpieces of art were lost without a trace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldwanderings.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace ensemble" class="if uuid-2548043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548043.jpg"></div><p>  After Bonaparte came to power, Versailles was taken under protection, work began on its restoration.  But the plans were not destined to be realized, since the empire collapsed.  Versailles only benefited from this.  The Bourbons returned to power again, who began to actively rebuild the complex, and subsequently made it a museum.  After the defeat of France in the war with Prussia, the German Empire was proclaimed in the Mirror Gallery.  After a while, a peace treaty was signed between the two countries.  And after the end of World War I, the French began to rebuild the castle.  Over time, many of his values ‚Äã‚Äãwere returned. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The palace was built at a fast pace, but at the same time incredibly large-scale work was carried out.  The hasty construction and lack of funds led to the fact that many fireplaces in the building simply did not function, although they were built with the aim of heating the premises.  In addition, gaps were visible in the doors and windows of the palace, which caused the wind to walk through the halls.  The building was very cold for all its splendor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="primewomen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greater Trianon" class="if uuid-2548047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2548047.jpg"></div><p>  Yet Versailles impresses with its scale.  It is difficult to imagine that once on the site of a stunningly beautiful complex there were marshy swamps.  In the shortest possible time, a palace and park ensemble appeared in their place, which became world famous. </p><p>  The Palace in Versailles is the place that every tourist should see.  The impressive complex leaves a lasting impression.  Its walls have witnessed many palace intrigues and secrets.  Currently, the palace is open to the public and is a museum. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  A visit to the palace in Versailles is an obligatory part of the program of any tourist.  The palace and park ensemble is certainly impressive, although many believe that it can not be compared with Peterhof.  And yet such a large-scale structure is worth a look.  According to tourists, the complex should be inspected in the warm season, when the park gains all its splendor.  In winter and early spring, damp or cold weather does not allow to appreciate all its beauty.  At such a time, there are no queues at Versailles at all, but you won‚Äôt get any pleasure from visiting it; moreover, fountains do not work at this time. </p><p>  The ideal time to visit is May, summer and September.  Tourists recommend choosing sunny but not hot weather for the excursion.  In high season, there are large lines near the palace, so it is better to go after lunch.  In addition, you can purchase a ticket on the museum‚Äôs website indicating the time of entry.  This will allow you not to stand in line.  Fountains do not work all days, their schedule is on the site.  The palace and park complex is a unique sight, so it is certainly worth a visit. </p>
