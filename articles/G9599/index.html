    <p>  Traditionally, as it is now universally accepted among developers, the first floors of buildings, especially in the most large-scale residential complexes, are reserved for non-residential premises and objects of social infrastructure.  Almost seven thousand square meters are allocated for their placement. </p><p>  Owners of their own vehicles cannot but rejoice, and there are more and more of them every year.  For their needs, more precisely, for the parking of their cars, specially allocated places are located located near residential buildings.  As the Svetlaya Dolina residential complex (Kazan) moves in, the developer provides for the construction of multi-level multi-functional freestanding parking complexes. </p><p>  As for the appearance of the complex, here the developer tried to translate the requirements of modernity into the external beauty of the project.  These are French balconies, panoramic windows, elegant fences. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: external and internal </h2><p>  LCD "Svetlaya Dolina" (Kazan), reviews of which already allow us to talk about the high quality of the building, offers apartments that are primarily suitable for families with children.  The developer has foreseen in the project the construction of three kindergartens in the complex.  This is in addition to <span>entertainment shopping centers, the</span> first of which was opened five years ago, offering goods at competitive wholesale prices. </p><p>  In walking distance there are four comprehensive schools, a large number of kindergartens, kindergartens and adult clinics.  Not to mention what is planned in the complex itself. </p><p>  The yard area is being improved, children's playgrounds and sports grounds have been built.  There is an opportunity for recreation not only for children, but also for adults, as walkways are provided in the courtyards. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  LCD "Bright Valley" (Kazan) reviews of residents has the most diverse.  Whenever a new apartment building is commissioned, there are both positive and negative opinions of apartment buyers.  So in the case of the specified residential complex. </p><p>  Many already settled apartment owners are satisfied with the location of the complex in the zone of favorable environmental conditions, silence.  New children's playgrounds and arrangement of the yard territory are delighted.  Many leave positive reviews due to the fact that they like the apartments themselves, their layout and quality of decoration.  Most residents of the complex are satisfied with the presence of developed infrastructure: grocery stores, kindergartens, beauty salons. </p><p>  Of the negative reviews, we should single out those that relate to any minor interruptions in the operation of utility networks, for example, interruptions in power supply.  Some residents, on the contrary, are dissatisfied with the quality of decoration of apartments, uncomfortable balconies. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2>
