It was much cheaper and more practical than a sword, the manufacture of which took a huge amount of scarce iron, and in terms of combat effectiveness was not inferior to it in anything.  An ideal example of such weapons is the Viking axes, which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Where did the <span>battle axes</span> come from <span>?</span> </h2>

Ancient axes were very distantly similar to their modern "descendants": forget about pieces of sharpened flint screwed with ropes to the pole!  Where more often they looked like drilled cobblestones, mounted on a stick.  In other words, initially the axes were not chopping, but crushing weapons.

    <p>  And it is justified.  Imagine a relatively thin, chipped flint plate: what will happen to it if the owner hits a shield, tree or stone?  That's right, it will be possible to say goodbye to weapons, since this mineral is very brittle.  And this is at the height of the battle!  So a stone, planted on a solid pole - a much more reliable weapon.  And the ax in its modern form could only appear after humanity has mastered the basics of metalworking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic information </h2><p>  Contrary to popular belief, Viking axes, even the most menacing in appearance, have never been heavy.  Maximum - 600 grams, not more.  In addition, the shaft was never bound by iron!  First, metal used to be extremely expensive.  Secondly, this made the ax heavier, and massive weapons in a long battle could lead to the death of the owner. </p>

Like, all "self-respecting" Viking leaders used swords.  This is from the category of Hollywood Vikings myths.  The ax is much more practical, simpler, it is not so unfortunate to lose it in the heat of battle.  A good sword made of "good" iron was so expensive that archaeologists have so far been able to find only a few instances of such weapons.

    <p>  Confirmation of this is the found graves of military leaders and high-ranking "laymen".  They sometimes found whole arsenals, among which there were many axes.  So this weapon is indeed universal, both ordinary soldiers and their commanders used it. </p><h2>  The emergence of two-handed axes </h2><p>  But the legendary Broadax was a favorite ‚Äútoy‚Äù of the northern peoples, it is also a two-handed ax on a long pole (this is the name of the Viking ax, by the way).  In periodicals it is often called the ‚ÄúDanish Ax‚Äù, but this name is not too true, since it does not completely convey the essence of this weapon.  Broadax's "finest hour" came in the 11th century.  Then the people who are armed with them could be met from Karelia to Britain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

For example, ‚Äúfriend of the Shield‚Äù, ‚ÄúBattle Witch‚Äù, ‚ÄúWolf of the Wound‚Äù.  Of course, only the best and highest quality samples were awarded this attitude.

    <h2>  What was the difference between two-handed axes? </h2><p>  Broadax blades looked very large and massive, but the impression is only partly true.  The blade of such axes during manufacturing was significantly thinned to save precious weight.  But the ‚Äúax‚Äù itself could indeed be large: the distance from one tip of the blade to the other often reached 30 cm, and this despite the fact that the ‚Äúworking body‚Äù of the ax in the Vikings almost always had a significant bend.  Such weapons inflicted terrible wounds. </p><p>  The arms for a reliable swing had to be big ... and they really were!  The "average" Broadax, rested by a pole in the ground, reached the standing warrior to the chin, but more often "more epic" samples were also found.  These axes were extremely powerful weapons, but still they had one serious drawback.  Since the shaft had to be held with both hands, the warrior was automatically left without shield defense.  And therefore, the "classic" one-handed Viking axes occupied the last place in the life of the latter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The influence of <span>Viking weapons</span> on the military affairs of the Slavs </h2><p>  Many similar weapons were found during <span>archaeological excavations</span> and on the territory of our country.  Broadaxes are especially numerous, and such finds are most characteristic for the Leningrad region.  Around the XII-XIII century, the situation in those parts became less "tense", and the list of standard weapons is gradually changing.  Viking axes with wide blades are gradually ‚Äútransforming‚Äù into relatively harmless household equipment. </p><p>  By the way, according to historians and archaeologists, it was precisely during the period of the wide spread of Broadaxes in Russia that there was a real ‚Äúboom‚Äù in the development of domestic weapons thought of those years.  The battle axes in Russia, created under the influence of the Varangian, incorporated all the best from European, Asian and Scythian designs.  Why do we pay attention to this?  It's simple: the evolved Russian axes later attracted the descendants of the Normans. </p><h2>  Combined Models </h2><p>  It was Kievan Rus that gave a second life to the combined options, with a spike on the butt.  Such weapons at one time were very quoted by the Scythians.  It is these axes in the 10-11 centuries that the Vikings will ‚Äútake up‚Äù, and from our country these weapons will begin their march through Western Europe.  It should be noted that initially the Vikings used slag with a simple, round or mushroom-shaped section. </p>

This evolution is easy enough to explain: if initially military people put on chain mail and other light armor, then over time the armor became more and more serious.  It was necessary to pierce it, and there appeared klevets and ‚Äúpunches‚Äù with a pronounced faceted section.  The most prominent representative of the Varangian-Russian axes is the hatchet of Andrei Bogolyubsky.  Most likely, he never belonged to the prince himself, but was made just in the historical period we are describing.

    <h2>  The weapon of the "modern Vikings" </h2><p>  Today, by the way, modern replicas of these weapons are being produced.  Where can I buy such an ax?  Kizlyar (‚ÄúViking‚Äù is one of the most popular models) is the new ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù of excellent weapons.  If you belong to enthusiastic reenactors, then you will not find the best choice anywhere else. </p><h2>  Why not a sword? </h2><p>  As we have already noted, the ax is often perceived by the layman as the weapon of a lumberjack and master, but not a warrior.  Theoretically, this assumption has some logical reasons: first, this weapon is much easier to manufacture.  Secondly, even for a more or less tolerable mastery of the sword it took at least ten years, while the ax was with the person in those days, and the improvement of the skills of its use took place, so to speak, ‚Äúwithout interruption from production‚Äù. </p>

Perhaps the only factor in choosing a weapon was its combat practicality.  Many historians believe that the ax was supplanted by the sword due to its heavy weight.  And this is also not entirely true.  Firstly, the weight of the Viking ax was only slightly higher than the mass of the battle sword (or even less - the mass of the ax itself was no more than 600 grams).  Secondly, swinging a sword also required a lot of space.

    <p>  Most likely, in an historical perspective, the ax gave way due to success in metallurgy.  It became more, warriors could be provided with a large number of albeit inferior, but technological and cheap swords, the combat use of which was much simpler and did not require such significant physical data from the "user".  It must be remembered that the fights of that time were by no means an elegant fencing, the matter was decided by two or three strokes, the better prepared man had the advantage, and therefore both the ax and the sword in this regard were weapons of equal value. </p><h2>  Economic value </h2><p>  But we should not forget about another reason for the popularity of axes.  The Viking ax (whose name is Broadax) was also of purely economic importance.  Simply put, it is unlikely to be able to build a fortified camp with the same sword, they will not be able to repair the fighting dragcar, they will not make equipment, and in the end they will not chop wood either.  Considering that for most of his life the Vikings went on hikes and were engaged in completely peaceful affairs at home, the choice of an ax was more than justified because of its high practicality. </p><h2>  <strong>Ax as a weapon of noble warriors</strong> </h2><p>  Judging by the chronicles and finds of archaeologists, this type of weapon was very popular among Scandinavian warriors.  So, the notorious king Olaf the Holy was the owner of a battle ax with the expressive name "Hel".  So, by the way, the ancient Scandinavians called the <span>goddess of death.</span>  Eirik, the son of <span>Harald the Fair-haired,</span> had the respectful nickname "The Blood Ax", which quite transparently hints at his preferences in the field of weapon choice. </p>

Such, in particular, was the famous Mamennian pole ax, on the surface of which amazing and beautiful patterns formed by a hammered silver thread are visible.  Naturally, such a weapon was a status one and emphasized the high position of the owner in society.

    <p>  The burial of Sutton Hoo also testifies to a great reverence for battle axes, as many richly decorated axes were discovered in it.  Judging by the luxury of this burial ground, one of the most prominent military leaders of the Angles or Saxons was probably buried there.  What is characteristic: the deceased himself is buried "in an embrace" with an ax, on which there are practically no jewelry.  This is a purely <span>military weapon,</span> so during his lifetime this man clearly preferred axes. </p><h2>  Sacred meaning </h2><p>  There is another circumstance indicating the reverence with which the northerners treated the axes.  Archaeological and written sources unequivocally testify that the Viking ‚Äúax‚Äù tattoo was extremely common precisely from the 10th to the 15th centuries.  This weapon, one way or another, figured in almost all military patterns with which professional soldiers adorned their bodies. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the Viking Ax amulet was no less common.  Almost every second neck pendant included a miniature poleax figurine.  It was believed that such an ornament bestows the strength, power and mind of a real warrior. </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  If you are a professional reenactor, then the Viking ax (production Kizlyar) can be an ideal choice.  But such a ‚Äútoy‚Äù is not too cheap, and therefore many lovers of medieval weapons may have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking these weapons independently.  How real is it?  Is it possible to make a viking ax with your own hands? </p><p>  Yes, it is quite possible.  The base for an ancient weapon can be an ordinary ax, from which with the help of a grinder everything superfluous is simply cut off.  Then, using all the same angle grinder, the entire surface is carefully polished, on which no burrs and protruding pieces of metal should remain. </p><h2>  Other comments </h2><p>  As you can see, making a Viking ax with your own hands is relatively simple, and it will not require large expenses.  The disadvantage of this method is that the resulting tool will have only a decorative function, since they will not succeed in doing the chores. </p>
