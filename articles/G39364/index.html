    <p>  The church impresses with its original architecture.  Interesting are the frescoes, surprising the richness and vibrancy of colors.  Unfortunately, some of them managed to get into poor condition, but this almost does not affect the overall impression.  It is curious that the religious building has a metal floor, which forced many parishioners to use rugs during the service. </p><p>  Currently, the temple acts as a museum. </p><h2>  Elias Church </h2><p>  What other religious attractions can I see?  Palekh is an urban-type settlement on whose territory the <span>Ilyinsky Church</span> is located <span>.</span>  This building was erected in 1790, it was then that the brick building replaced a wooden temple.  This church is a wonderful example of architecture of the second half of the 17th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, as a result of restoration features, the appearance of the temple was significantly modified.  This also applies to interior decoration, for example, walls previously decorated with paintings were whitened.  Despite this, the church retained the features testifying to its many years of existence, so it is definitely worth admiring it. </p><h2>  House-workshop Dydykina </h2><p>  What other important places to see?  Palekh is a settlement that gave the world not only brilliant artists, but also talented sculptors.  This can be easily verified by visiting the Dydykin House-Workshop, the famous sculptor who was born in this village.  It was this man who developed the project of the St. Petersburg monument to Pushkin on the Moika, and other outstanding achievements are attributed to him. </p>

    <p>  Visitors to the workshop, which has been operating since the end of 1978, will be able to admire the extensive collection of sculptural works by the famous artist, whose works can be found in museums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl.  For example, there is a small copy of the aforementioned monument dedicated to the famous poet. </p><h2>  Golikov House Museum </h2><p>  What other surprises is Palekh able to present to his guests what to see when he is in this village?  The Golikov House-Museum is a place that all lovers of painting should definitely look into.  This man is among the first artists who worked in the genre of varnish miniatures.  He is the founder of the Artel of Ancient Painting, which was opened in 1924. </p>

    <p>  The museum has been hosting visitors since 1961 and is located in the very center of the village.  The exhibits presented in it are pleasing with their diversity.  Much attention is paid to documentary exposition, to subjects related to the personality of the artist himself, to whom the house museum is dedicated. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  Palekh (Ivanovo Oblast) is a settlement on the territory of which there are other interesting museums.  For example, the Korin House Museum, dedicated to an artist belonging to the Palekh dynasty of icon painters, deserves a visit.  It is curious that Korin came to popularity rather thanks to his portraits, rather than the use of Palekh's corporate identity.  The museum glorifying him has been operating since 1974. </p><p>  It is also worth a look at the Zinoviev House Museum, a famous artist who worked in the varnish miniature genre.  The exhibits are associated not only with creativity, but also with the life of a celebrity, so a visit to the museum will provide interesting information about the rural way of life. </p>
