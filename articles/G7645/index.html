In the latter there were about five hundred yards, and a large bazaar was noisy on Mondays.  So the name “Monday”, or in Tajik “Dushanbe”, was assigned to the village.  On the map, the town appeared in 1875.  Then it was a fortress in which about ten thousand people lived.  But there were already artisan blocks, caravanserais, mosques and even madrassas in it. </p><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  Today, the capital of Tajikistan is a large, beautiful, spacious, sunny city, which stands near the majestic mountains of the Hissar Range.  Sights of Dushanbe are concentrated mainly in the center, which is very convenient for tourists.  From the airport through the whole city runs Rudaki Avenue.  It is there that all the sights of Dushanbe are located. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of dushanbe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1335093.jpg" width="600"></div>
