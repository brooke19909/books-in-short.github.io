And sometimes it‚Äôs even hard to understand which photo depicts an expensive VIP-hotel, and which one shows his less ‚Äústar‚Äù brother.  This is not surprising, since it is unlikely that anyone will flaunt rooms with battered furniture or publish pictures of the poorly groomed territory in which this or that hotel is located.  And therefore, in order not to get into trouble, you should not make the final choice on the basis of only advertising brochures and the sugary promises of travel agents.  It‚Äôs better to study more thoroughly all the information about the selected hotel, fortunately, the resources that provide it today are more than enough.  And in order to slightly alleviate the fate of the tourist, who was confused by the abundance of all kinds of, sometimes very contradictory information, we offer a small overview of the hotels of one of the most visited resorts in Turkey - Kemer.  More precisely, its suburb, which is called Goynuk.  This is a relatively young resort village located on the seafront, which is so popular today that enterprising Turks literally within a few years erected many fashionable hotels on its territory, one of which is the Vogue Hotel Avantgarde 5 - we will describe in detail.  So to speak, as an example. </p><p>  So, Goynuk, Turkey, hotels.  Read! </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the resort </h2><p>  Goynuk is located, as mentioned above, next to the popular Turkish resort of Kemer.  To be more precise, only seven kilometers separate them from each other.  The Toros mountains, which cover the village as if in a half-ring, reliably protect its territory from all kinds of winds, and therefore the climate here throughout the year is very, very conducive to relaxing on the seashore.  The mountains themselves are covered with ancient pine forests, while the village is dominated by orange and pomegranate groves.  In the late nineties, the village was divided in two by a highway leading directly to Antalya, which, together with the close proximity of Kemer, contributed to the heyday of the village of Goynuk (Turkey).  The hotels here began to grow one after another, as a result of which, over the course of ten years, the unremarkable area acquired the status of a successful fashionable resort. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ... and about hotels </h2><p>  In the resort of <span>Goynuk (Turkey),</span> hotels were erected on a grand scale, and therefore many of them have a five-star status.  Almost all hotels of this category are located on the first coastline, which is extremely convenient, since vacationers do not need to get to the sea for a long time.  5-10 minutes of leisurely walking - and you are already on the beach.  There are not so many four-star hotels here, and they are all located already on the second line - that is, somewhat removed from the sea.  Nevertheless, 4 * hotels (Goynuk) are also quite in demand, because, by and large, a short walk through the beautiful resort town does not cause any protest.  Especially when you consider that there are a lot of various shops and cafes along the way where you can have a wonderful time - do some shopping or just sit at the table, delighting yourself with a glass of tart wine or a cup of delicious coffee. </p>

    <ul><li>  Queen Elizabeth Elite is a chic five-star hotel, built in 2007.  It has the shape of a ship, frozen in the midst of many pools.  Designed for any type of vacation, the distance to the beach from it is only 50 meters, the cost of a weekly stay for two is forty-seven thousand five hundred rubles. </li><li>  Club Phaselis HV-1.  The hotel was commissioned in 2006, in 2012 a total restoration was carried out.  Built on the seafront, ideal for both active and relaxing family vacations.  The cost of the tour is 78,000 rubles. </li><li>  Majesty Club Kemer Beach.  This hotel, built in 1987, is designed for youth recreation.  The overhaul carried out in 2007 was aimed at creating a real island of pleasures and entertainments for active vacationers and noisy companies in the hotel.  The cost of the tour is 56,200 rubles. </li><li>  <span>Club Boran Mare</span> Beach 5. Opened in 1994, renovated in 2009.  The club hotel, surrounded by greenery, is designed for those who prefer silence and solitude.  A seven-day vacation here will cost 60,000 rubles. </li><li>  Le Chateau De Prestige.  This is not even a hotel, but rather an old castle.  Medieval architecture, spacious rooms, huge terraces with access to the sea - all this is at the service of those who value comfort and coziness more than anything else.  Opened in 2007, the cost of the tour is 55,000 rubles. </li><li>  Queens Park Goynuk.  Another five-star hotel, of which there are so many in the Goynuk resort (photos of some of them, by the way, are presented in the article).  Opened in 1994, renovated in 2011. It is located on the seashore, designed for all types of recreation - here both youth companies and sedate married couples feel equally good.  The cost of living is 57,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Of course, these are far from all the hotels that the Goynuk resort has.  Map hotels clearly indicates that there are many more.  However, all of them, even if briefly, as we have said, to describe in one review is really impossible.  Especially since we have the ‚Äúprotagonist‚Äù next door - the Vogue Hotels Avantgarde hotel.  We turn to a more detailed description of it. </p><h2>  Turkey.  Vogue Hotels Avantgarde - 5 star hotel </h2><p>  Built in 2009, the hotel impresses with its scale, sophisticated design and truly fantastic architecture.  Vogue Hotels Avantgarde occupies a vast territory - one hundred thirty five thousand square meters.  Landscapes of stunning beauty, splashing literally at the threshold of the waves of the gentle sea, mountain air filled with the scent of pines and cleanliness, increased comfort of the apartments - all this is the key to an excellent quality vacation. </p><p>  Vogue Hotel Avantgarde, the photo of which is presented below, is a very peculiar hotel of some kind.  On its territory there is the main - Main Building - a four-story building and many villas (more specifically, there are 45 of them) offering apartments of various categories, which makes it possible for guests with different levels of income to relax.  Moreover, all buildings are located in a park area, surrounded by exotic trees and flower beds with fragrant flowers.  So, if you wish, you can relax not only on the beach or by the pool, but simply on the grass, in the shade of an orange or <span>pomegranate tree.</span> </p><p>  Vogue Hotels Avantgarde 5 has an extremely developed infrastructure.  In fact, this is not even a hotel, but a mini-city, with its shops, restaurants, bars and other facilities designed to make the rest comfortable.  However, first you still need to dwell on the apartments. </p>

    <p>  Vogue Hotels Avantgarde offers a huge variety of both paid and free services.  You can list them indefinitely, so we will limit ourselves to one remark: there is everything in order to satisfy every guest‚Äôs desire at any second.  Starting from breakfast in the room and ending with lighting of tennis courts at night, if someone suddenly decides to run with a racket after sunset. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  It is quite clear that for a hotel as luxurious as Vogue Hotel Avantgarde, the prices are set accordingly.  Seven nights spent in a standard double room (calculated for two people) will cost two thousand seven hundred dollars.  In a junior suite - four thousand four hundred.  In a family suite you can relax for a week for six thousand dollars, in the same deluxe suite for eight and a half.  Living in a villa for the same period will cost ten thousand.  e. Incidentally, provided in the hotel Vogue Hotels Avantgarde 5 and accommodation with pets.  True, for every day a pet stays, they will have to pay sixty euros.  But this is, of course, compared to the main price list, just trifles. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p> If you look at the above numbers, you can understand that for such an amount the hotel is obliged to provide service of only the highest quality.  Which, in principle, corresponds to the actual state of affairs.  Reviews for Vogue Hotels Avantgarde for the most part are actually only enthusiastic and positive.  All vacationers emphasize the excellent decoration, equipment and comfort of the apartment.  Pleases Russian tourists and the fact that there are no difficulties with communication.  And at the reception, and among the staff of the room, and in the restaurant there will always be a Russian-speaking employee.  Many people think that Vogue Hotels Avantgarde is perfect for families with children, as here all the conditions are created for the latter: excellent animation, kids clubs, safe pools with slides, a good menu, a beautiful amusement park and even a mini zoo.  Plus, of course, a safe and gentle entrance to the sea. </p><p>  With regard to nutrition, here, too, you rarely see negative reviews.  On the contrary, many argue that everything is so delicious that it is impossible to resist, so as not to try.  As a result, some take home extra pounds from the rest.  But here it is already necessary to make claims not to the hotel, but to your own appetite. </p><p>  What causes discontent?  Oddly enough, vacationers believe that there is too little space on such a vast territory - villas "eat up" a lot of space.  It is not surprising, yet chic apartments with their own garden require quite large areas.  But this is not so relevant, because you can pull yourself up, save up and become the owner of this garden for at least a week.  And then there will certainly be nothing more to complain about. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Turkey has always enjoyed great love among our compatriots.  Today they have already mastered Goynuk, which is still considered a new-fangled resort.  Why do you say bye?  Because, as you know, nothing stands still, new hotels appear, old ones are already becoming not so interesting.  But when will it be yet.  In the meantime, one thing can be said.  Anyone who prefers to relax in Turkey and can afford to stay in a fashionable five-star hotel should pay attention to Vogue Hotels Avantgarde. </p><p>  After all, it is ideal for both active and business leisure, equally good for honeymooners and couples with young children.
