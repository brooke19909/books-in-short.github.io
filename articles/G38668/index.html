There is a hypothesis that this state existed in the sixth century BC.  e.  At that time it was the land of Urartu, conquered by the Aryans.  After some time, Armenia appeared as a separate independent state.  And then the first national money of this country was made. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The state <span>currency of Armenia</span> appeared at the beginning of the first century BC.  e.  and was called drum.  The drum was equal to 100 lumens (hundredths).  The coins depicted King Tigran the First.  Then the images of his followers were minted.  Coins were made of silver and did not differ in mass from other metal currencies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money of Armenia" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1514987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the reign of the Mamelukes, Armenian money temporarily ceased to exist.  When the country became part of the Russian Empire, rubles were in use.  Again, the money of Armenia was printed only in 1917, after the October Revolution.  A new currency was being made in London.  Then this money was replaced by Soviet rubles. </p><h2>  The revival of the Armenian currency </h2><p>  The Central Bank of Armenia was founded in the ninety-third year.  He returned the national currency, setting the course of the Armenian dram.  At first, money was printed in Germany, and until 1995 banknotes had 8 denominations.  They were all done in a classic style with bright margins and simple prints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Coins were minted from aluminum: 3 types of lumens and 4 denominations of drams.  Despite the fact that their design was quite simple, at present, money made in the period from 1993 to 1998 is acquiring collectible status and is valued higher and higher every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armenian dram course" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1514989.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Currently, coin dramas are not used in everyday life, but are still the official currency.  On the reverse of the coins the denomination is indicated.  The signature "drum" is engraved nearby.  The border pattern is different.  On the obverse is the Armenian coat of arms.  In a circle of coins (except for the face value of ten drams) - the inscription "Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia". </p><h2>  Exchange rates and exchange </h2><p>  In the ninety-third year <strong> </strong>  modern money began to be printed in Armenia.  The ruble exchange rate at that time was 1: 200.  In 2012, the data changed by a ratio of 12.84: 1.  In accordance with the international situation and the situation inside the country, the course of the Armenian drama periodically changes.  At the end of 2016, it is 13.54: 1. </p><p>  Exchange can be made in large hotels, shops, shopping and entertainment centers.  But in the provinces, exchangers are much less common.  There, the currency changes mainly in banks.  Since there are not very many ATMs installed in Armenia, the use of debit and credit cards has not been put into widespread use.  In provincial cities, the population is accustomed to using exclusively cash. </p>
