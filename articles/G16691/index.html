Such a system is installed along with a fire alarm.  Most of them are equipped with devices to improve sound quality and emergency broadcasts.  You can send the necessary notice using any of the internal telephones.  To do this, just dial the special code number.  Sometimes in large enterprises this system is used to search for a specific employee.

    <h2>  Types </h2><p>  There are five types of these systems, and their choice depends on the regulatory framework and, secondly, on the wishes of the customer. </p><ol><li>  Sound alert.  This is a tinted signal, an alarm siren, etc. </li><li>  Light alert.  Flashing signs with the word ‚ÄúExit‚Äù with a drawn pointer appear as light icons. </li><li>  Light alert and voice.  Along with the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù icons, people are alerted through the columns about the necessary actions. </li><li>  Light notification, voice, simple zone notification and zone notification with the possibility of feedback from the dispatcher. </li><li>  Light notification, voice, zone notification with the possibility of feedback from the dispatcher, the implementation of several alerts at the same time, all systems are coordinated from the control post. </li></ol>

    <p>  Today, manufacturers are ready to offer potential buyers loudspeakers of various shapes, sizes and capacities.  All this abundance needs to be sorted out somehow.  The easiest way to divide them into main types: </p><ol><li>  Horn-type loudspeakers.  They are used in open areas and in production.  These loudspeakers are characterized by high <span>sound pressure.</span>  Used only for the transmission of announcements due to the narrow range of reproduced frequencies.  They differ from ordinary loudspeakers in that they have a much smaller angle of emission of sound waves.  Mounted on poles, towers, poles, building facades.  They are used in production shops and other similar sites where the noise level is high. </li><li>  For installation in open areas.  Dust-proof loudspeakers capable of operating in a wide temperature range are used at such sites.  It is these parameters that should be given special attention when choosing this type.  The degree of dust and moisture protection should be equal to IP-34.  Temperature range -25 ¬∞  - + 40 ¬∞ .  Such requirements are maintained by loudspeakers with cases made of heat-resistant plastic or metal.  The mount allows you to change the orientation in one of two planes. </li><li>  Pendant loudspeakers.  This type is widely used in rooms with high ceilings.  Their design allows installation at the required <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verification of warning systems" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22928/540183.jpg" width="400"></div>  height, which ensures uniform sound coverage of the premises of the most complex configuration.  Such devices are used in trading floors with uneven or simply high ceilings.  So that they organically fit into the design of the room, they are installed on the same level with lighting fixtures.  This makes the speakers virtually invisible, but perfectly audible.  They are attached to the elements of metal structures or beams. </li><li>  For installation in the wall.  This type is not as popular as wall-mounted or suspended-ceiling speakers.  This is due to difficulties in installation work.  So, in a brick wall you need to prepare a niche, and not each of them has the necessary thickness so that this niche has sufficient depth.  Installation in drywall is carried out using springs, which are located in a pre-prepared hole. </li><li>  For installation in a false ceiling.  Widely used, suitable for rooms with any configuration.  The main condition is the presence of a false ceiling.  During the design process, particular attention should be paid to the overall dimensions of the speakers and their height, which should not exceed the distance between the main and suspended ceiling.  Such devices are mounted using springs that secure them in the hole prepared in the ceiling. </li><li>  For wall mounting.  Very popular, due to the ease of installation and compatibility with various types of interior.  Mounted with dowels, which are attached to the walls. </li><li>  Special loudspeakers (intrinsically safe, explosion-proof, etc.).  The voice warning system in the mines is equipped with this type.  As well as in industrial premises and in open areas where explosive mixtures can or may form.  This type has the highest security, but its cost is quite high. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warning and evacuation management system" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22928/540188.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Frequency range </h2><p>  The range of reproducible frequencies allows you to divide all the speakers into broadband and narrowband.  The former have good sound quality and rather high cost.  They are used where, in addition to voice messages, it is necessary to broadcast music programs.  These are sports complexes, shopping and entertainment centers, supermarkets.  The voice notification system, as a rule, is composed of devices of the second type.  The main objective of such audio devices is to transmit only voice messages.  These loudspeakers successfully combine sound of average quality and rather low cost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Alert Certification </h2><p>  Both foreign manufacturers and domestic should certify their products of this type without fail for compliance with the fire safety standards of the Russian Federation.  Verification of warning systems includes performance tests in various operating modes, electromagnetic compatibility, mean time between failures, resistance to ignition, etc. It certifies the Central Administration of Central Administration of Central Administrative Offices of the Central Administrative District of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Certification Authority for Security Alarm Equipment of the Russian Federation). </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Sound signals of the warning system in their tonality should differ from sounds of other purposes. </p><p>  The fire warning system must be controlled from a control room (fire station) or other premises that meets fire safety standards and is approved in due order. </p><h2>  How to arrange emergency messages </h2><p>  For broadcasting such messages, it is better to use a pre-prepared recording, since the dispatcher's unstable speech can only increase the panic of people in a critical situation.  In addition, psychologists recommend using a calm female voice, as its spectrum is in good agreement with the frequency range that is important for perception.  The text of the message should sound neutral and suppress panic, contain information about the evacuation routes from the building.  To attract attention, you can send a tone at the beginning and at the end of the message. </p>
