    <h2>  Who is this device for? </h2><p>  Any ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone is a large-scale event in the world of gadgets.  The <span>iPhone 6s</span> was no exception in this regard <span>.</span>  Its price has not changed much against its predecessor.  And the appearance of the device remained almost the same.  But the filling of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone has improved significantly against the background of the parameters of the previous generation.  The rest of this smartphone can boast of rich equipment and is of most interest to the most demanding users.  But at the same time, his cost is corresponding. </p><h2>  Gadget design </h2><p>  The last two generations of ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù and ‚ÄúiPhone 6ES‚Äù are almost identical in terms of design.  They come in a non-separable metal case.  The front panel is protected by impact-resistant glass "ION-X".  Behind it is a 4.7-inch display matrix made using the IPS technology.  The only control button that displays a fingerprint sensor is displayed below.  On the right edge is a SIM card slot and a gadget lock button.  And on its left side there are volume controls and a button for switching to silent mode.  A conversational microphone, lightning ports and a 3.5 mm audio port are displayed on the bottom of the device.  On the back of the smartphone is the main camera (it stands for the back cover) and its dual LED backlight.  There are four color options for the case of this device: silver and gray are complemented by the familiar iPhone 6s Gold and the new pink color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Of course, the Apple A9 processor solution of this gadget cannot boast of impressive technical parameters.  It has only 2 64-bit computing modules, which at maximum load can accelerate to 1.8 GHz.  Against the background of the "Snapdragon 810" with two computing clusters, each of which includes four computing cores, its parameters look really modest.  But, on the other hand, do not forget that this is the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6s.  A distinctive feature of this platform is a high degree of optimization.  If in the case of the Android software, the device often runs a lot of unused software in the background, then CPU resources are used more rationally.  All unnecessary stops immediately.  Therefore, on this gadget without any problems any software will be launched, including the most demanding one.  Moreover, a similar picture will continue for the next two years.  That is, the owners of this smartphone will not have to worry about a lack of performance in the near future.  You can not say about the flagship solutions of the competing platform - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  Here changes occur much more often, and problems with a lack of computing power are felt already a year after the purchase of the flagship solution of any manufacturer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Graphics </h2><p>  As a graphic solution, this smartphone uses the PowerVR GT7600.  This graphics card was jointly developed by Apple and Imagination Technologies.  This is the most productive graphics solution, which in its capabilities leaves far behind its direct competitors - Adreno 430 and Mali-T760MP8.  Moreover, even now, six months after the start of sales, the situation in the segment of mobile graphic accelerators has not changed and ZhT7600 continues to be the sole leader.  As a result, any applications of the iOS platform without any problems for 2 more years will be exactly launched on this generation of iPhone. </p>

    <h2>  Another plus of the gadget: display </h2><p>  Some kind of transcendental resolution like 4K, this device can not boast.  But, on the other hand, what's the point in these 4K?  Even the ‚ÄúHD‚Äù resolution does not allow the ordinary eye to distinguish a single pixel on a 4.7-inch diagonal screen.  And here the diagonal is still the same 4.7 inches, but the resolution is slightly better - 1334x750.  The screen matrix itself is made using the IPS technology, which guarantees excellent color reproduction and brightness.  Also, a combination of 1334x750 resolution and IPS matrix manufacturing technology can significantly improve the gadget's autonomy.  The manufacturer did not forget about <span>protecting the front panel</span> in the iPhone 6s.  A review of the technical specifications of this smartphone model indicates the presence of tempered glass "ION-X".  Also separately noted is the proprietary 3D Touch technology.  Its essence lies in the fact that a smartphone can determine the degree of pressure on the touch screen and, depending on this, execute completely different commands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  By the amount of installed memory, all Apple smartphones lag behind competing platforms.  If today's flagships of Android can boast of having 4 GB of RAM, then here are just 2 GB of RAM in the iPhone 6s.  Reviews highlight the fact that this is quite enough for a comfortable and smooth operation of the device.  The key feature here is software optimization, which allows more rational use of device resources.  There is no separate slot for installing an external drive in this device.  But the capacity of the internal drive can be 16, 64 or 128 GB.  Given the lack of the possibility of increasing the volume, it is better to immediately buy a device with the required amount of internal memory. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  It seems like a modest sensor - 12 megapixels - underlies the main camera of the iPhone 6s.  Comparison with direct competitors, alas, confirms this.  But the optical system of this camera, as well as software filters allow you to get photos that are superior in quality to sensors with a significantly larger number of megapixels.  Also in this device autofocus technology is implemented and there is a double flash.  Video here can be recorded in 2160p format with a refresh rate of 30 frames per second.  The front camera has a 5 megapixel sensor and this allows you to get ‚Äúselfie‚Äù that is faultless in quality.  Well, she also copes with her second task perfectly - by making video calls. </p><h2>  Battery and its features </h2><p>  The modest capacity of the built-in battery at 1715 mAh in the iPhone 6s.  An overview of the parameters of the flagships of Android is another confirmation of this.  But, on the other hand, you need to understand that the iOS system boasts high optimization.  We add to this a very economical processor solution in terms of battery life, a relatively small display resolution and an energy-efficient screen matrix and get 14 hours of continuous operation in the most intensive use mode.  Well, with a decrease in load, you can rightly count on 2-3 days of work.  But something more in this case will be difficult to achieve. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Out of the box, the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6s immediately runs on the latest version of the operating system, iOS 9. It was developed by the manufacturer specifically for the announcement of this gadget.  All the hardware resources of this device are perfectly matched to this software, and as a rule, there are no problems during operation.  This operating system is perfectly compatible with all existing software, these are platforms and, as a result, everything is launched on this device. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Only on the positive side are the owners of the iPhone 6s.  Reviews highlight its improved performance, excellent camera quality, impeccable autonomy.  In general, Apple turned out to be another masterpiece of a mobile gadget that will not leave anyone indifferent.  Separately, it is also worth highlighting the color versions of this phone.  Now iPhone 6s Gold has become familiar, and the pink version has taken its place, which is primarily aimed at a female audience. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget price </h2><p>  The price at the start of sales of the iPhone 6s gadget was definitely sky-high.  The price of the basic version of the smartphone started at $ 1,300.  More advanced modifications, with 64 GB and 128 GB, were estimated at 1,500 and 1,700 dollars, respectively.  But now the price has dropped.  The most modest version of the "apple" smartphone can be purchased for $ 800.  Well, modifications with 64 GB and 128 GB can now be bought for 920 and 1050 dollars.  On the one hand, these prices are really high.  But do not forget that this is Apple (we overpay for the brand!), In addition, there is a really high level of quality. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The iPhone 6s was just perfect and flawless.  The reviews of the satisfied owners of this device confirm this once again.  Apple took the next evolutionary step and released another great smartphone.  This is a great gadget that definitely has no weaknesses and which all other manufacturers are guided by.  Also, a copy of the iPhone 6s based on Android has already appeared on sale.  Her parameters are more modest, she has a number of disadvantages.  From the original device in it there was only a design.  So be careful when buying. </p>
