This is a large-scale <span>residential complex</span> located on the territory of Ramensky.  Its total area is almost 40 thousand square meters.  The official developer is the well-known company "Garant-Stroy" in the city.  By the way, a complex with a similar name ("Borisoglebskoye") is located on the territory of New Moscow, 35 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  About him, we also detailed the material in this article. </p><h2>  Features of the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Layout LCD Borisoglebsky" class="if uuid-2917606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917606.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of the Borisoglebsky residential complex will help buyers figure out exactly which apartments they are ready to provide, whether they meet their needs, and whether it is possible to find the desired quality of construction and finishing works here. </p><p>  The <span>residential complex itself</span> is located on Mira Street in the city of Ramenskoye.  It includes six monolithic-brick buildings, in which the supporting structures are made of a monolithic-reinforced concrete frame, and the internal walls themselves are made of bricks.  It is noteworthy that all buildings of different floors - from 15 to 17. Each of them is made on an individual project, so that the impression of concrete boxes on one person that surround you every time you return home is not created. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this residential complex there is an opportunity to purchase one-, two- or three-room apartments.  In total there are 640 of them. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidential premises varies from forty to one hundred square meters.  Many should be impressed by the height of the ceilings - three meters ten centimeters.  All this creates a feeling of space, free space, even with small areas in general. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of each apartment is its large and spacious kitchen, the loggias are glazed with single double-glazed windows, and double-glazed windows are mounted in the window frames.  It is worth noting that in this residential complex you will not find specific apartments or penthouses.  Premises for rent without decoration, but with already installed front doors.  Outside, the LCD looks very presentable, since the houses are faced with colored bricks. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Borisoglebsky" class="if uuid-2917607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917607.jpg"></div><p>  Young mothers in this place are guaranteed to feel comfortable, as in all the buildings of the residential complex, without exception, security rooms, concierges and prams are provided.  There will be no problems with parking, which is so familiar to everyone who lives in Moscow and the Moscow region.  Here they managed to be solved by building a large and spacious parking. </p><p>  The house has everything you need for a comfortable and safe life: noiseless elevators, ventilation and fire extinguishing systems, modern means of communication.  Moreover, an accessible environment for people with disabilities is equipped here, for disabled people there are ramps.  On the territory of the residential complex, sports and playgrounds are open.  Separate parking lots are provided for guests, while the entire territory of the residential complex is guarded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is necessary to note good transport links.  The whole complex is within walking distance from Chugunov Street, which almost immediately goes into the highway crossing the village of Kratovo.  Literally after a few kilometers, this road merges into one of the main routes in the south-east of the Moscow region - the Yegoryevskoye Highway, so it‚Äôs not difficult to get out of here with a private car, in the future you can go both to the capital itself and to any point in the region. </p><p>  There are options for how to get to the capital and by public transport.  Just a five-minute walk is the Fabrichnaya railway station, through which trains to Moscow follow.  You can get from here to the Kazan station or the metro station Vykhino. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Borisoglebsky in Ramensky" class="if uuid-2917604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917604.jpg"></div><p>  When it comes to why it is worth settling in Ramenskoye, many note the complete absence in the city of harmful industries.  Of course, there is still industry in the city, but mainly light or agricultural enterprises are located here that do no harm to the surrounding atmosphere.  The city itself and the entire surrounding area are considered very clean.  In the immediate vicinity of Ramenskoye there are extensive pine forests with dry soil, around there are many sanatoriums for people with pulmonary diseases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This residential complex is located almost in the center of this small town in the suburbs.  Nearby is Lake Borisoglebskoye, the Saturn football stadium, which once played the team of the major league of the Russian championship, a recreation park, the Trinity Church. </p><p>  Families with children will definitely be cozy and comfortable.  Near the LCD there are ten kindergartens and three secondary schools, a children's clinic, a large number of pharmacies, a maternity hospital, supermarkets and grocery stores within walking distance. </p><h2>  Satisfied tenants </h2><p>  Reviews of the residential complex Borisoglebsky can be found both positive and negative.  Many who come here rely on an environmentally friendly place, but at the same time they are embarrassed by the presence of nearby medical facilities, which you usually do not want to be near.  These are narcological and tuberculosis dispensaries.  Of course, there are a lot of infections, but if you think about it, about the same probability of picking up some dangerous virus remains in public transport.  But at the same time, no one refuses to travel by minibus and subway. </p><p>  Therefore, in reviews of the Borisoglebsky residential complex in Ramenskoye, it is noted that this complex has at least good ecology in comparison with the rest of the Moscow region.  The cost per square meter of housing is estimated quite high, even for such a beautiful house.  Hand on heart, you can recognize that in Ramenskoye you can find apartments much cheaper, but in this case the buildings themselves will be simpler, and you will have to live somewhere on the outskirts, and not in the center near the park.  The average cost per square meter in this LCD is from 80 to 85 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In the reviews of the Borisoglebsky residential complex, everyone notes that there are no complaints about the architecture and concept of the complex.  Beautiful and modern houses look very elegant, calm and pleasant colors (green and blue) do not annoy anyone, many like the original mirror windows. </p><h2>  Bad reviews </h2><p>  Moreover, in the reviews of apartments in the residential complex Borisoglebsky there is enough negative.  Most of the indignation is connected with the eternal problem of Russian developers - houses that were not delivered on time. </p><p>  Moreover, even despite the delay, the quality of work remains unsatisfactory.  For example, almost everyone changes the front doors installed by developers, since they are completely unreliable, unable to protect a person and his property, and can‚Äôt even cope with the cold and smells that come from the landing. </p><p>  Some residents of the Borisoglebsky residential complex near Moscow have serious concerns because of an unreliable foundation.  Of course, everyone understands that the house shrinks in the first few years after the completion of construction work, but in this case it turns out to be too strong.  For example, residents complain that double-glazed windows burst in separate apartments. </p><p>  The low quality of construction work at a fairly high price per square meter is the main complaint expressed by local residents who managed to purchase apartments in this residential complex.  Often you can find reviews in which the new settlers complain about the need to additionally insulate the apartment, since before the winter, large gaps are revealed, because of which the house is constantly cold. </p><h2>  New Moscow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sit-company.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Borisoglebskoe" class="if uuid-2917616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917616.jpg"></div><p>  You should also read reviews of residents of the residential complex Borisoglebskoye, located in the ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew Moscow.  The residential complex is located in the village of Zverevo in the Novofedorovsky settlement.  Officially, it belongs to the Trinity Administrative District.  The land on which the houses are located is only 35 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  So transport accessibility is quite good. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ecological region is 120 ha.  Part of the quarters have already been commissioned, and work remains to be done on the rest.  In total, it is planned to erect 219 three-story houses in the middle of picturesque and green recreation areas. </p><p>  Spacious home parking lots are provided for holders of Borisoglebskoye residential complex and their guests.  It is noteworthy that in the courtyard of each house there are children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  And after the completion of the main works, the central street will be a real boulevard with bike paths, the total length of which is about one and a half kilometers.  Moreover, it will start from the railway station Rassudovo.  So getting to Moscow from here is not difficult. </p><p>  Currently 72 houses have been commissioned in the Borisoglebskoye residential complex in New Moscow.  At the moment, you can purchase one-, two- or three-bedroom apartments at a price of 58 and a half thousand rubles per square meter.  Different layouts are available, also residents can count on metropolitan registration, autonomous heating in each apartment. </p><h2>  Residential block project </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews of LCD Borisoglebskoe" class="if uuid-2917615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917615.jpg"></div><p>  In customer reviews of the Borisoglebskoye residential complex, the developer is often praised for the project he developed with the arrangement of adjacent territories, which really means comfortable housing that you want to return to. </p><p>  The creators of the project always emphasize separately that this residential complex is not just a cluster of houses, but buildings located in accordance with the general ideology.  It, in turn, is aimed at providing high-quality and comfortable living conditions, which is why playgrounds are being created in large numbers here, and places for sports are being arranged. </p><p>  Such a zealous approach to planning and developing the project allowed us to create a unique place for living, in which everyone feels calm and comfortable. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis ecological region in the Borisoglebskoye residential complex is a combination of various building configuration options.  Thanks to this calculation, the complex is visually divided into quarters, the originally constructed houses are complemented by green boulevards and spacious pedestrian alleys.  All this allows us to provide comfort and coziness, which is so lacking for residents of megacities. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sit-company.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Borisoglebskoye in New Moscow" class="if uuid-2917617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917617.jpg"></div><p>  It is important at what level of development is the infrastructure in such a residential complex, especially when it is located at some distance from the city. </p><p>  It is worth noting that now these are only plans.  This is explained simply, while there are few houses built, with the increase in their number new social and cultural objects will appear. </p><p>  According to plans, three kindergartens, a secondary school, a shopping center, a sports and fitness center, an Orthodox church named after Boris and Gleb, and centers for public and business purposes should appear in this place. </p><p>  The general concept of the project provides for the construction of four quarters, each of which will become the owner of a name corresponding to the zoning of the development area.  They will be called Birch, Maple, Rowan and Lilac.  All of them will be united by Oak Alley with the central square, which is planned to become a traditional place for recreation and meetings of local residents. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Borisoglebskoe" class="if uuid-2917614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2917614.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of the Borisoglebskoye residential complex in New Moscow, most of the customers who are considering buying an apartment there note that this housing can become an analogue of a relatively cheap country cottage, since the building density in this place is really low.  It would be wise to settle here, for example, retired parents, and to visit them with the children on weekends. </p><p>  Young couples will be frankly bored, at least until a sufficient number of shops and cafes open within walking distance, and even then the situation is unlikely to change fundamentally. </p><p>  In customer reviews of the Borisoglebskoye residential complex in New Moscow, who already live in this complex, they note that they are generally satisfied with the acquisition.  I like the complex development, which in the future will be accompanied by all necessary infrastructure, mortgages on favorable terms, interest-free installments. </p><p>  An absolute plus is the ability to monitor the progress of work on the Internet, where the developer constantly reports on what they have managed to do.  This is always noted in reviews of the residential complex Borisoglebsky.  You can find out about house 162 from these reports that work on installing a roof, waterproofing and insulation has been completed there. </p><h2>  Why is it not worth going here? </h2><p>  This opinion about this residential complex can also be found.  There are enough dissatisfied customers who are by no means advised to purchase housing here. </p><p>  In the reviews of potential buyers about the Borisoglebskoye residential complex, the main complaints so far are related to the organization of the surrounding infrastructure.  Relatively nearby there are several villages - Aprelevka, Selyatino, Kievskaya, in which there are cafes and shops, but in the complex itself and at the nearby railway station, they simply are not. </p><p>  At the same time, many reviews of the Borisoglebskoye residential complex in New Moscow are associated with complaints about the low pace of construction and the quality of work performed.  Some frankly argue that the developer is very poor, does not stand up to any deadlines, and the quality of the apartments leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  After the official commissioning of the house, monstrous imperfections are revealed.  For example, in the walls made of drywall, there are no holes left, and they try to transfer apartments to equity holders without an installed gas boiler, that is, it simply does not seem possible to start heating the room and using hot water. </p><p>  In some reviews of residents about the residential complex Borisoglebskoye, doubts are expressed in general that there are at least some positive aspects in this complex.  Delays in the construction and commissioning of houses are simply amazing, as a rule, this happens later, at least for one year.  In this case, the developer refers to the lack of a sufficient number of workers.  Therefore, until they finish doing everything necessary at one facility, it will not be possible to send construction crews to another. </p><p>  In addition, in this area there are actually quite serious problems with transport accessibility, especially if you are trying to drive your own car.  In the evenings there are traffic jams in the Rassudovo area, in which you can stand for several hours.  In addition, some speak with doubt about the promised ecology and silence.  In the immediate vicinity of the residential complex is a tank training ground, where exercises and firing are regularly held.  As a result, the entire county is shaken by a roar in a radius of approximately 20 kilometers. </p><p>  If you go here by train to Moscow, then there will also be many problems.  In general, transport accessibility is the biggest minus of this residential complex.  By train, you have to go to Moscow for about one hour, and by car you can get into traffic jams for many hours, losing even more time.  Of course, there is a prospect that will significantly improve this situation.  According to the plans of the Moscow government in the coming years, a 15-minute ride by public transport will make it possible to get to the Vnukovskaya metro station.  In this case, working in a metropolis and living in this remote and secluded small LCD will become much easier.  Then we can expect a significant increase in prices. </p>
