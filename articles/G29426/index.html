Attempts to resolve the issue diplomatically failed and led to a conflict.  In 1853, the Russian Empire fought against the Ottoman Empire for supremacy in the Black Sea straits.  <span>The Crimean War of</span> 1853-1856, in short, is a clash of interests of European states in the Middle East and the Balkans.  Leading European states formed an anti-Russian coalition, it included Turkey, the <span>French Empire,</span> Sardinia with Great Britain.  The Crimean War of 1853-1856 covered significant territories, stretched for many kilometers.  Active hostilities were conducted in several directions at once.  The Russian Empire was forced to fight not only directly in the Crimea, but also in the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Far East.  Significant were the clashes on the seas - Black, White and Baltic. </p><h2>  Reasons for the conflict </h2><p>  The reasons for the Crimean War of 1853-1856, historians determine in different ways.  So, the British scientists consider the unprecedented growth of aggressiveness of Nikolaev Russia to be the main cause of the war, the emperor led to an <span>escalation of the conflict</span> in the Middle East and the Balkans.  Turkish historians determine the main reason for the war is the desire of Russia to establish its dominance over the Black Sea straits, which would make the Black Sea the inland body of the empire.  The dominant causes of the Crimean War of 1853-1856 are highlighted by Russian historiography, which claims that Russia‚Äôs desire to improve its shaky position in the international arena prompted a clash.  According to most historians, a whole complex of cause-and-effect events led to the war, and for each of the participating countries the preconditions for the war were their own.  Therefore, until now, scientists in the current conflict of interest have not come to a unified definition of the causes of the Crimean War of 1853-1856. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Clash of interests </h2><p>  Having examined the causes of the Crimean War of 1853-1856, we move on to the start of hostilities.  The reason for this was the conflict between the Orthodox and Catholics over control of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which was under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire.  Russia's ultimate demand to give her the keys to the temple provoked a protest from the Ottomans, actively supported by France and Great Britain.  Russia, not resigned to the failure of its plans in the Middle East, decided to switch to the Balkans and introduced its units into the Danube principalities. </p><h2>  The course of the Crimean War of 1853-1856 </h2><p>  It would be advisable to divide the conflict into two periods.  The first stage (November 1953 - April 1854) is the Russian-Turkish conflict itself, during which Russia‚Äôs hopes for support from Great Britain and Austria did not materialize.  Two fronts formed - in Transcaucasia and Crimea.  The only significant victory for Russia was the Sinope Sea Battle in November 1853, during which the Turkish Black Sea Fleet was defeated. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="results of the Crimean war of 1853 1856" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1235427.jpg" width="429"></div>

The landing of the Allied forces in the Crimea forced Russian troops to retreat deep into the peninsula.  The only impregnable citadel was Sevastopol.  In the autumn of 1854, the brave defense of Sevastopol began.  The mediocre command of the Russian army rather interfered than helped the defenders of the city.  For 11 months, sailors under the leadership of P. Nakhimov, V. Istomin, V. Kornilov repulsed the enemy‚Äôs attacks.  And only after it became impractical to hold the city, the defenders, leaving, blew up the weapons depots and burned everything that could burn, thereby disrupting the plans of the allied forces to seize the naval base. </p><p>  Russian troops made attempts to divert the attention of the Allies from Sevastopol.  But they all turned out to be unsuccessful.  The clash near Inkerman, the offensive operation in the Yevpatoriya region, the battle on the Black River did not bring glory to the Russian army, but showed its backwardness, outdated weapons and inability to conduct military operations correctly.  All these actions brought closer the defeat of Russia in the war.  But it is worth noting that the allied forces got it.  The forces of England and France by the end of 1855 were exhausted, and there was no sense in the transfer of new forces to the Crimea. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean war of 1853 1856 defense of Sevastopol" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1234037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Caucasian and Balkan fronts </h2><p>  The Crimean War of 1853-1856, which we tried to describe briefly, also covered the Caucasian Front, events on which developed somewhat differently.  The situation there was more favorable for Russia.  Attempts by <span>Turkish troops</span> to invade Transcaucasia were unsuccessful.  But Russian troops were even able to advance deep into the Ottoman Empire and capture the Turkish fortress of Bayazet in 1854 and Kara in 1855. The actions of the allies in the Baltic and White Seas and in the Far East did not have significant strategic success.  And rather exhausted the military forces of both the allies and the Russian Empire.  Therefore, the end of 1855 was marked by the actual cessation of hostilities on all fronts.  The warring parties sat down at the negotiating table to take stock of the Crimean War of 1853-1856. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean war of 1853 1856" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1234038.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Completion and Summary </h2><p>  Negotiations between Russia and the allies in Paris culminated in a peace treaty.  Under pressure from internal problems, the hostile attitude of Prussia, Austria and Sweden, Russia was forced to accept the Allies' demands for the neutralization of the Black Sea.  The ban on justifying naval bases and the navy deprived Russia of all the achievements of previous wars with Turkey.  In addition, Russia pledged not to build fortifications on the √Öland Islands and was forced to give control of the Danube principalities into the hands of the allies.  Bessarabia was transferred to the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  In general, the results of the Crimean War of 1853-1856.  were mixed.  The conflict pushed the European world to the total rearmament of their armies.  And this meant that the production of new weapons is intensifying and the strategy and tactics of warfare are radically changing. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the course of the Crimean War of 1853 1856" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41921/1234039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Ottoman Empire,</span> having spent millions of pounds on the Crimean War, led the country's budget to complete bankruptcy.  Debts to England forced the Turkish Sultan to agree to freedom of religious worship and the equality of all, regardless of nationality.  Great Britain dismissed the Aberdeen cabinet of ministers and formed a new one led by Palmerston, which canceled the sale of officer ranks. </p><p>  The results of the Crimean War of 1853-1856 forced Russia to turn to reform.  Otherwise, it could slide into the abyss of social problems, which, in turn, would lead to a popular rebellion, the result of which no one could undertake to predict.  The experience of the war was used in conducting military reform. </p><p>  The Crimean War (1853-1856), the defense of Sevastopol and other events of this conflict left a significant mark in history, literature and painting.  Writers, poets and artists in their works tried to reflect all the heroism of the soldiers who defended the Sevastopol citadel, and the great significance of the war for the Russian Empire. </p>
