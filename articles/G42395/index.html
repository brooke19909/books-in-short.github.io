  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tasks of ecology and its structure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of <span>ecology, as a science, has</span> entered our life relatively recently.  The relationship of man with the environment has been studied for a long time.  Over time, it was noted that people have a significant impact on the state of nature.  It often has negative consequences.  The tasks of ecology are to identify the factors that arise as a result of such interaction and their impact on the state of the environment. </p><p>  Environmental research has been ongoing since 1900.  This is the science of the interaction of all living organisms with the environment that surrounds them.  It has its own structure, which depends on the object of study. </p><p>  Global ecology is studying the general principles of interaction of living organisms on the planet.  Her research includes <span>global</span> environmental <span>problems</span> and methods for their prevention. </p><p>  Classical ecology explores all the possible connections that are formed between living organisms, the environment in which they live and its features.  This study concerns both the current situation and past periods.  Classical ecology is divided into several areas.  Autecology is studying the ecology of organisms.  Synecology explores the ecology of communities.  Population ecology is the study of populations. </p><p>  The applied side of this science sets the norm for natural resources that can be used without causing great harm to the environment.  The tasks of ecology in this direction are to maintain a viable state of the environment. </p><p>  Social ecology is studying the interaction of society with the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a regional ecology, which explores the relationship of organisms with the environment within a certain territory. </p><p>  This science closely interacts with other sciences.  The subject of <span>ecology is studied</span> in higher educational institutions, as experts in many areas must take into account and work out directions for <span>protecting the environment</span> in the process of their activities. </p><p>  Recently, ecology has received a new round of development.  This science is being comprehensively developed using various methods and means for research.  In this regard, the tasks of ecology have expanded. </p><p>  1. Development of principles of sustainability of systems in biological communities. </p><p>  2. The study of ways to adapt living organisms to the environment. </p><p>  3. Monitoring the number of populations. </p><p>  4. The study of the diversity of organisms living on earth and how to maintain their quantitative composition. </p><p>  5. The study of processes that take place in the environment and the development of methods for their maintenance. </p><p>  6. The study of ecological systems existing on the planet and of the processes that occur in them and are of global importance. </p><p>  7. A warning about the consequences that human activities have on the environment. </p><p>  8. Taking measures to eliminate environmental problems and improve the <span>environment.</span> </p><p>  9. The development of ways to rationally spend natural resources and renew the species diversity of living organisms that exist on the planet. </p><p>  These are the main tasks of ecology. </p><p>  Human activities in recent decades have had a great influence on the state of the environment that surrounds it.  Sometimes this interaction is catastrophic.  The environment in some cases is able to recover on its own.  But sometimes the situation cannot be corrected.  These are global disasters that lead to irreversible consequences. </p><p>  A person must first of all take care of the nature around him.  Environmental tasks require a permanent solution, therefore, the entire <span>world community</span> is involved in environmental problems <span>.</span> </p>
