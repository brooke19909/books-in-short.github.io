The quantity and variety of dishes are sufficient.  There are complaints from tourists about the abundance of fried and deep-fried food.  Such food is heavy enough for the stomach and is of little use. </p><p>  Hotel guests also indicate that it is necessary to book sunbeds on the beach in the front rows in the morning, otherwise you can stay without a place under a canopy.  Almost all guests are satisfied with the work of snack bars.  They note that only sometimes quite large queues are lined up in them. </p>

    <p>  The guests of the complex are very pleased with the presence of a zone for self-preparation of freshly squeezed juices.  There are always a lot of different fruits and modern equipment. </p><p>  The work of animators does not always satisfy the needs of guests.  Tourists often notice that recreational activities are prepared in haste and are not designed for different ages of vacationers. </p>
