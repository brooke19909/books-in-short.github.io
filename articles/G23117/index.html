Holidays in Bulgaria</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bulgaria is attractive for tourists from Belarus for many reasons.  A short flight (about three hours), similar languages, low prices and a high level of service - this is not the whole list.  In this country, high mountains fit into a compact territory, and the warm Black Sea lapses in the east.  And you can go to this sunny land straight from Minsk!  Holidays in Bulgaria are not only about sunbathing and swimming in the summer.  In winter, you will certainly enjoy the well-equipped ski resorts.  In addition to natural attractions, tourists are expected to visit ancient ruins, medieval churches and monasteries, modern water parks.  In this article we will consider particularly attractive tours to Bulgaria, as well as give some recommendations to those who are going to make an independent trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="From Minsk rest in Bulgaria" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/771981.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  When to go on vacation </h2><p>  The country lies in a strip of temperate continental climate.  The beach season in Bulgaria lasts from May to early October.  The most frequent rains in June.  But there is not much rainfall in Bulgaria - only 550 mm per year.  In the second half of summer and autumn, the weather is mostly dry.  A characteristic feature of Bulgaria is that it is cooler here than in countries located at the same geographical latitude.  This means that even small children will not need acclimatization, having arrived from Minsk.  Holidays in Bulgaria will not disappoint a winter tourist.  Rila ski resorts are always covered in snow.  And it‚Äôs nice to ride here also because the southern sun is beaming with might and main.  Day temperature in January is only minus two degrees, although real frosts are not uncommon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Minsk Bulgaria" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/772067.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you purchase a tour package to the <span>resorts of Bulgaria,</span> then it already includes the cost of the trip.  Many firms offer bus crossings.  This is an inexpensive <span>mode of transport,</span> but it is very tiring - the path is not long.  The train "Minsk - Bulgaria" (actually it goes to Varna) is more comfortable.  But in this case, you will have to spend a little less than forty hours on the road.  It is much more convenient to use air service.  Regular flights from Minsk fly mainly to the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia.  But in the summer, numerous charters leave for the resorts.  And not only from Minsk.  You can get to Burgas by flying with Belavia air carrier from Brest and Gomel.  Winter tourists usually get a flight Moscow - Plovdiv.  If you want to turn a long road into an exciting journey, you can fly to Istanbul, and from there take a bus to the resorts of southern Bulgaria.  Or use the Odessa-Varna high-speed catamaran ferry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria from Minsk prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/771998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which resort to choose? </h2><p>  Winter tourists in Bulgaria are waiting for such ski resorts as Chepelare, Pamporovo, Borovets and Bansko.  The level of service, of course, is not the same as in Courchevel or Zermatt, but it does not cause any complaints.  Well-groomed tracks, lifts work.  It is good to come here for beginners in skiing or families with children.  <span>The Black Sea coast of</span> Bulgaria stretches exactly from north to south, from Romania to Turkey.  Conventionally, the zone is divided into two parts at Cape Emine.  In the north (Albena, Balchik, Golden Sands) the temperature of the water and sea is lower by 2 degrees.  And these resorts are more expensive than those located in the southern part (Sunny Beach, Nessebar, Pomorie, Sozopol).  But wherever you come from Minsk, a vacation in Bulgaria will delight you with beautiful sandy beaches.  Often they have the Blue Flag - a sign awarded by the coast for ecology and cleanliness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  An independent traveler should not get hung up on 380 kilometers of beaches.  There are many interesting places in Bulgaria, a visit to which will broaden your horizons and leave the most joyful memories.  Plan excursions depending on the resort that you choose, arriving from Minsk.  Holidays in Bulgaria in the resort of Golden Sands will be incomplete if you do not see the rock monastery Aladzha.  Be sure to visit the Valley of Roses and take home perfumes based on oil from this flower or a jar of jam.  Sightseeing cities are the ancient Plovdiv, Burgas, Melnik, Varna and Nessebar.  It is also recommended to visit the <span>Rila Monastery,</span> which is 120 kilometers from Sofia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Bulgaria from Minsk" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/772025.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <h2>  Tours to Bulgaria from Minsk </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt like to book hotels and dry your head with the question ‚Äúhow to get to the resort, where to stay and what to eat‚Äù, buy a ticket.  Tour operators will choose a place of rest to your liking.  After all, in Bulgaria there are resorts specializing in youth, family and even children's vacations.  In terms of catering, you can order both half board and the All Inclusive package.

You can also plan the duration of your vacation in the package ‚ÄúBulgaria from Minsk‚Äù.  Prices for trips to this country are pleasing for their availability.  For a week of staying alone, for example, in Golden Sands (with flight and half board) you need to pay 13,653,200 rubles.  And in Albena, a seven-day vacation with All Inclusive will cost 8 million 566 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria children's vacation from Minsk" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/772033.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bulgaria: children's holidays </h2><p>  From Minsk you or from any other city, the question of where to put the child on summer vacation will still be relevant for you.  Well, consider <span>this offer.</span>  <span>Belarusian tour operators</span> have long sent children groups to Bulgarian resorts.  The children are always accompanied by certified teachers from Minsk.  And on the spot, Bulgarian rescuers on the beach, the protection of the camps, are also responsible for their safety.  Children live either in villas, cottages, or in buildings.  Outside adults are not allowed into the camp.  Mistral-2 in the resort of St. Vlas and Festa in Kranevo specialize in the healing of children.  And the Macon Residence 3 * camp near Sunny Beach offers an excellent program with active sports. </p>
