    <p>  Mineral salts are simply an indispensable element for the life and health of every person.  These substances are found in the usual form of simple compounds in nature.  Some of them - complex salts - have a complex structure and are widely used in industry.  Simple compounds are constituent components of all organs and tissues of a <span>living organism</span> and occupy five percent of the total body weight.  The following are most important for humans: potassium, sodium, calcium, sulfur, phosphorus, magnesium, <span>iron, chlorine,</span> manganese, cobalt, iodine and fluorine.  They are excreted along with other products, so a person needs to constantly take care of the proper level of salts in the body.  Usually, with proper and rational nutrition, the question of lack of salts does not arise - the natural products that we consume in sufficient quantities contain the necessary nutrients for the body. </p><p>  If a person eats monotonously, then mineral salts from a certain product will not satisfy all the variety that is needed.  As a result, the mechanism of salt absorption and excretion is disrupted, which will lead to disease.  For example, if young children do not have enough calcium, then they are at risk of rickets, and in adults, teeth may break down, hair may fall out, bones become brittle.  A lack of iron will affect the composition of the blood and provoke the so-called anemia (iron deficiency anemia). </p><p>  The natural properties of salts of calcium, magnesium and sodium contribute to the coordinated work of the digestive organs, due to which the person normalizes metabolism, accelerates metabolism, energy metabolism.  The individual's need for calcium is quite significant - about one gram is required per day to fully participate in all processes.  You can replenish calcium salts through products such as cottage cheese, cheese, milk, kefir, egg yolk, spinach, salad, cauliflower.  From this set, calcium from dairy products is easiest to digest, so you should not neglect them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Phosphorus is indispensable for normalizing the functioning of the nervous system.  Its salts are contained in the liver, eggs, brains, rye bread, <span>oatmeal,</span> cheeses.  For a day you need to give the body two and a half grams of phosphorus.  Given that it is best released from products of plant origin, then this element must be obtained from there. </p><p>  Ordinary salt is also priceless for the body.  A person needs about fifteen grams a day - to use it with food, but take into account the fact that this element is also in some products.  If a person eats animal products, then you can salt them just a little bit, because salt is contained in the food consumed.  However, many people like to over-season dishes to improve their taste, which leads to an excess of it in the body.  This can provoke certain disorders, because salt retains water, which means that there may be swelling, complications on the kidneys, liver, heart.  The pressure rises, the nervous system works worse. </p><p>  For its miraculous properties, mineral salts have earned well-deserved recognition in cosmetology.  During skin rejuvenation procedures, face masks, and <span>pore cleansing,</span> salts are used very widely.  They smooth wrinkles, iron enriches the skin with oxygen, potassium creates optimal <span>osmotic pressure</span> between skin cells, retains moisture, copper is a kind of antiseptic - it prevents the growth of bacteria, manganese at the cellular level is involved in respiration, energy exchange, microcirculation of substances. </p><p>  Mineral salts are sold in pharmacies, you can take baths with them, make <span>baths for hands</span> and feet, face masks, wash hair, strengthen nails. </p>
