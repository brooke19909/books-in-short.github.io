    <p>  One type of <span>weapon of mass destruction</span> is a chemical weapon.  The principle of its action is the toxic poisoning of the environment and people.  It can be in the form of missiles, air bombs, mines or other means of use.  Their composition includes a <span>poisonous substance.</span>  <span>The international community</span> has made several attempts to ban the use of this type of weapon.  However, its production does not stop. </p><p>  Chemical weapons are divided into several types.  Depending on the type of poisonous substance and its effect on the human body, the following types are also distinguished: </p><p>  1. The substance may cause effects on the <span>central nervous system</span> .  The result is a quick defeat of a large number of personnel.  The fatal outcome when exposed to this type of chemical weapon is very high. </p><p>  2. The next species affects the body through the skin and respiratory system.  This chemical weapon is an aerosol or vapor. </p><p>  3. The fastest is a weapon containing substances that affect the whole body.  They penetrate the blood with oxygen and quickly spread to tissues and organs. </p><p>  4. Substances that affect the lungs and cause a choking effect are part of another type of chemical weapon. </p><p>  5. The latter type is a chemical weapon that contains substances that have a temporary effect on the mental state of a person.  It is not fatal, but can cause passing deafness, blindness, a state of panic and fear, and some other mental disorders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are still substances that cause the effect of irritation.  They have a short-term effect, realized in the form of sneezing or lacrimation.  These substances are adopted by the police in some countries. </p><p>  Types of chemical weapons are distinguished by military purpose: </p><p>  1. A deadly weapon destroys manpower. </p><p>  2. The second type temporarily disables people.  The term depends on the type of damaging substance. </p><p>  Sometimes the use of non-lethal weapons can be fatal.  This occurs in the case of a significant excess of its concentration.  Such cases were recorded during the Vietnam War. </p><p>  Depending on the speed of exposure, chemical weapons are divided into slow-acting and fast-acting.  It also depends on the substance it contains.  The irritating, psychotropic and neuroparalytic components have a quick effect.  Slow and strangulation substances have a slow effect. </p><p>  Also distinguish elements with a long exposure time and short-term.  Unstable substances act within a few minutes, and more persistent ones can cause long-term negative consequences (up to several weeks). </p><p>  Wars in which chemical weapons were used showed their inefficiency.  Despite the deadly harm that some substances may cause, certain conditions are necessary for their use.  For example, the weather. </p><p>  Russia has signed an agreement on the non-use of chemical weapons.  In this regard, a program has been developed to destroy all its species. </p><p>  Chemical weapons protection should be used to reduce the risk of injury. </p><p>  The main role here is played by the timely detection of the problem and the search for methods to resolve it.  As individual means, gas masks and special clothes are used.  But with a massive defeat, it becomes necessary to protect a large number of people.  For this, special rooms are provided, equipped with filters and ventilation, which prevents the spread of toxic substances. </p><p>  The use of chemical weapons must be reduced and completely banned.  It must be fully controlled by international organizations. </p>
