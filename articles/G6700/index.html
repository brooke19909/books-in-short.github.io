The owners of the Tricolor satellite television set-top boxes often have the question of whether it is possible to connect 2 TVs to the Tricolor. </p><h2>  Television Outputs </h2><p>  In itself, such a connection is not complicated, but there are a number of nuances that must be taken into account before you independently engage in such a connection. </p>

    <p>  All television receivers produced until recently were assembled in China, and, as a rule, had high-frequency outputs (antenna), scart, or tulip.  Therefore, it was not difficult to connect the TV to a <span>satellite dish</span> through the receiver‚Äôs low-frequency output, and through its high-frequency output, you can connect the rest of the TVs yourself using an ordinary antenna cable. </p><p>  This is all the more relevant, since in almost every home there is definitely more than one TV today, and from time to time it is necessary to decide whether Tricolor 2 can be connected to 2 TVs yourself. </p><h2>  Cons of connecting via treble or tulip </h2><p>  True, with such a connection there is one minus - it is that you can watch only the same channel on all TVs, and it‚Äôs not very convenient to constantly go from room to room to switch the program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although this problem is eliminated by the acquisition of the so-called extension cord remote.  Its cost is about 1 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Recently, the Tricolor company has been actively working to replace the old receiving equipment with new, more modern.  However, in practice, everything is not so rosy in terms of user benefits. </p><p>  Before that, it was relatively simple to install Tricolor on 2 TVs.  How to connect the wires yourself, you could find out from any textbook or just ask a neighbor. </p><p>  With the advent of the first new 8300 receiver, MPEG4 was added and the number of channels was increased, but at the same time the RF output and the Tulip jack disappeared. </p><p>  Probably the main goal was to reduce the cost of the receiver, but as a result, the ability to connect a second TV via HF was also lost.  As a result, everyone who wants to watch two TVs is forced to pay more.  Perhaps the manufacturer specifically decided to exclude the potential to install Tricolor TV 2 on 2 TVs.  How to connect it all the same to watch different channels? </p><p>  To watch both TVs again, you have to buy an RF modulator, which costs about $ 60.  Or buy a video sender, which sends commands, sound and video signal wirelessly to 20-30 meters.  Its cost is already about $ 100. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <span>How to connect Tricolor TV</span> to 2 TVs </h2><p>  Firstly, relatively recently, the Tricolor TV company launched the release of a new kit, which is designed specifically for connecting two or more televisions to one satellite dish. </p><p>  This kit has several connection options, depending on whether they watch the same channel on several TVs or are supposed to watch different channels.  The second option will require some additional costs. </p><p>  If you need to connect the equipment so that the same channel is broadcast on both TVs, the question of how to connect the Tricolor TV to 2 TVs is solved as follows: you only need to buy a signal splitter and an <span>antenna cable of the</span> required length. </p>

    <p>  A signal divider is only needed if the receiver you are using does not have multiple outputs for connecting TVs.  If there are such outputs, then you can additionally not spend money on its purchase. </p><h2>  Connect two TVs to watch one channel </h2><p>  We connect the first TV to the <span>antenna connector of the</span> receiver, and the second TV - through the ‚Äúscart‚Äù or <span>HDMI-output of the receiver.</span>  The only thing required with such a connection is the presence of the corresponding inputs on the second TV. </p><p>  If you plan to watch on two TVs connected to the same satellite receiver, different channels, then you will need another receiver, plus it also has a client.  The result is a scheme - "Tricolor 2" on 2 TVs.  How to connect, consider in more detail. </p><h2>  Server-client for viewing different channels </h2><p>  In this case, the receiver will be like two tuners with two LNB connections.  It will work as a server, and the second receiver connected to it - the client - will connect to it through a specially created local network. </p><p>  There are different options for such a connection: </p><ul><li>  You can connect receivers using twisted pair. </li><li>  At some additional cost, you can organize a Wi-Fi connection between them, that is, use a router and get a wireless network as a result, specifically for Tricolor 2 on 2 TVs.  How to connect, described in detail in the instructions. </li></ul><p>  As a result, each TV will have its own remote control, and both TVs will be able to show different channels simultaneously. </p>

    <p>  What is worth paying attention to in this situation?  The fact that the price of such a satellite kit will not be low.  Therefore, it is probably worth determining that in this case it will be most cost-effective to buy two independent, conventional sets, or a Tricolor 2 set for 2 TVs.  How to connect it should now be clear. </p><p>  It is still important here that the configuration of the installed kit fits into the budget allocated for solving the task. </p>
