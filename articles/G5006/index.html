    <p>  The hotel complex Lotus Muine Resort SPA 4 * is located 100 meters from the sea shore.  Unfortunately, the hotel‚Äôs own beach is not suitable for swimming, as the bottom has not yet been cleared.  Nevertheless, it is always pleasant to walk along the shore.  In addition, just a few meters away is the beach of the neighboring hotel, where tourists can also sunbathe in the sun, bask in the shade of palm trees and swim.  Naturally, there are all conditions for more active recreation, including boat riding, yachting, water skiing.  By the way, the coast is very popular with fans of surfing, as the waves are high every year. </p><h2>  Entertainment and additional services for tourists </h2><p>  Of course, the territory of the hotel Lotus Mui-Ne Resort SPA 4 * has everything you need for a truly carefree vacation.  In particular, guests are offered laundry, dry cleaning and parking services.  There is also a rental point where you can rent a car, motorcycle or other <span>type of transport.</span>  This service is very popular with guests, as it facilitates movement around the area and makes it possible to make a short trip. </p><p>  Lotus Mui-Ne Resort SPA 4 * also has a modern business center with all necessary equipment, two meeting rooms and a large conference room, which, incidentally, is often used for banquets. </p>

    <p>  In the courtyard there is a large outdoor pool, where it is quite pleasant to spend time.  Around there are a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas, beach towels are provided free of charge.  You should definitely visit the local SPA center, which offers a lot of wellness treatments, including massage and hydromassage.  There is a sauna and a small fitness center.  The hotel has a tour desk to help you organize trips to the most interesting places.  By the way, there are several interesting sights nearby, including the Poshanu Cham tower, which is definitely worth a look. </p><p>  And from time to time on the territory of the hotel arrange exciting performances and show programs. </p><h2>  Hotel complex Lotus Muine Resort SPA: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Of course, travelers are primarily interested in the opinions of tourists who have already managed to use the services of this resort.  It is worth noting that the reviews about the Lotus Muine Resort SPA 4 * hotel are for the most part positive.  Customers first of all note spacious rooms and beautiful territory - it is really pleasant to spend time here.  In addition, the distance from the city center and an excellent soundproofing system create good conditions for a quiet, measured rest. </p><p>  According to the comments of former guests, the employees here are polite and do an excellent job.  The city center can be easily reached by taxi or rented transport, which, you see, is good.  Perhaps the only drawback of the hotel, judging by the reviews of tourists, is the lack of its own beach, but the administration is already working on a solution to this problem.  Many vacationers were satisfied with their stay at the hotel and are planning to return there again in the future. </p>
