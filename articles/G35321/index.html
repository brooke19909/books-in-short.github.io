    <h2>  Work principles </h2><p>  Inna can be called a superstitious person, however, just before starting work, she tries not to take bad thoughts into her head, because for any story you just need to be well prepared.  In order to get a result, actions are needed, not prayers and requests addressed to fate.  A woman tries to put maximum effort when it is most appropriate, that is, thinking through her work.  To do this, she reads a lot, goes in for sports to keep herself in shape, discusses information with professionals, draws facts from news sites and social networks, in the tapes of which you can also find out a lot of interesting things. </p><p>  It is important to get acquainted with all the views in order to understand how the representatives of the people think.  The information environment should be carefully scanned.  The opinions of people are different, and all of them need to be known and try to take into account.  It is also important to understand the motivation of certain actions.  Knowledge is everything.  Especially when you work with such a large stream of thoughts and judgments.  To carry out the program well, you need to plan your speech, and since you don‚Äôt foresee everything, you need to be resourceful and answer suddenly pop-up questions that you did not count on. </p><p>  Most importantly, Inna is always supported by loved ones.  And Karpushina spends all her strength on the most important of life's tasks - to realize her natural data.  Sometimes this requires a lot of dedication, but it is always worth the effort.  The most important thing is to persistently go towards your goal, which is what the TV presenter does. </p>
