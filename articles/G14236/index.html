  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crafts from waste material: ideas, master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Looking through crafts made from junk material available on numerous Internet sites, you understand that handmade craftsmen use absolutely any objects in their work, nothing is left without their attention.  Now the whole world has joined the struggle to preserve the ecology of our planet.  Many industries operate in recyclables.  At home, you can also use many unnecessary things, giving them a second life. </p><h2>  DIY material </h2><p>  For decorating the premises and creating various crafts, used materials are used.  These are old newspapers and used plastic bags, unnecessary CDs and plastic bottles, twigs and saw cuts from the tree, tin cans and packaging cardboard, wine bottle corks and vinyl records.  You can list for a long time, since there are many similar gizmos in the house.  Crafts from waste material perform a useful function: they extend the life of old objects and preserve the natural resources of the Earth. </p><p>  In this article, we will present readers with photographs of various things made from recycled materials.  We will also provide a detailed master class of handicrafts from scrap material with step-by-step instructions for their implementation, tell you what you need to have in addition, describe the sequence of work. </p><h2>  Toilet paper machine </h2><p>  Such work can be done by children of preschool or primary school age.  A racing car consists of a hub and four wheels.  You will need to additionally purchase a dense cardboard.  Four identical circles are cut according to the circle pattern and the contours of the wheels are drawn with gouache.  Disks can be drawn in white, as in a photograph, or you can draw the same as a car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovethispic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from toilet paper bushings" class="if uuid-2311881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311881.jpg"></div><p>  A hole for the driver is cut out on the sleeve.  The cut resembles the letter "H".  The edges are bent in different directions.  Front - the steering wheel is drawn, and the backrest is obtained on the back bend.  Crafts made from waste material for children should be bright.  Therefore, the car is painted in saturated colors.  Additionally draw the number of the racing car, different stripes or arrows.  In order for the wheels to spin, they can be mounted on a metal or plastic rod by breaking through the opposite holes in the hub. </p><h2>  Furniture for dolls </h2><p>  As crafts from waste material for children, furniture can be made of dense corrugated packaging cardboard.  After purchasing items of equipment, large boxes remain.  You can simply throw them away, but not if the handmade craftsman lives in the house.  After all, boxes are an excellent material for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated bed" class="if uuid-2312023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2312023.jpg"></div><p>  You can make a bed, chairs, a sofa, a wardrobe, a table and chairs for dolls from packing cardboard.  To make such a bed, as in the photo above, you need to measure the height of the doll and add a couple of centimeters for the pillow.  The width of the bed can be any.  A rectangle is cut out by the standards, as well as side jumpers in front and behind the bed.  At the head of the sidewall should be higher.  The upper edges of the scissors are rounded.  You can cut a heart or give any other curly shape.  Then the legs of the legs of the bed with notches, into which all the structural parts for fastening are inserted.  Instead of a mattress, a kitchen sponge is often used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rope from plastic bags </h2><p>  If you have gathered a lot of bags made of polyethylene, then you can make crafts out of them.  From the junk material you get a strong jump rope.  Everyone knows that this item for children's games quickly becomes worthless, cracks appear on it and pieces break off over time.  If you make a rope out of packages, it will be very strong and will last a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="package rope" class="if uuid-2311945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311945.jpg"></div><p>  How to do such a craft out of junk material with your own hands?  The photo shows that the rope is made by braiding.  It consists of three strips.  To make it more convenient to weave from packages, you need to tie their ends to some immovable basis, for example, to the table leg.  Packages are cut into thin strips.  You can lengthen them with a hot iron, just be sure to put a cotton cloth so that the polyethylene does not melt. </p><p>  When you have three long strips available, you can start braiding.  Knots are tied at the ends of the rope and an electrical tape is wound, which serves as the handles of our craft from waste material. </p><h2>  Tulips from plastic bottles </h2><p>  To make flowers from empty containers, you will need several half-liter bottles, wire, acrylic paints and brushes (you can use paint in a spray can), foam balls, awl.  We start making crafts from waste material by cutting off the bottom of the bottles at a distance of 10 cm from the bottom edge.  The upper edge is cut in semicircles, imitating the tulip petals.  In the center of the bottom with an awl, a hole is made for the wire, which acts as a stalk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="blogberrygarden.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tulips from plastic bottles" class="if uuid-2312006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2312006.jpg"></div><p>  In order to hold the wire firmly, a foam ball painted in yellow is put on the inside.  The flowers themselves are blown up with spray paint.  You can decorate each petal with a different color from above, using a foam sponge.  The upper part of the wire is wrapped in several turns of adhesive tape so that the flower does not slide down from it.  From green plastic bottles, long leaves of flowers are cut and mounted on a wire. </p><h2>  Decorative wall panel </h2><p>  Original junk crafts can be made from old and no longer needed CDs.  Of these, you can not only make a decorative circle on the wall, but also create a mirror or picture.  On a piece of paper whatman need to draw a large circle, which will serve as a template.  This is necessary so that the discs stick evenly.  Then you need to calculate the distance between the edge of one and the other disk.  Using the ruler, points are placed on all elements.  When gluing discs, they must be placed exactly to this mark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="panel from CDs" class="if uuid-2311976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311976.jpg"></div><p>  You can use thick PVA glue or Crystal clear glue as a bonding material.  You can use a cardboard base. </p><h2>  New Year's crafts from scrap material </h2><p>  Now many people are trying to decorate for the New Year not only the interior decoration of the apartment, but also the front door, adopting the tradition of the peoples of other countries.  If you have a lot of <span>corks from wine</span> bottles, then it‚Äôs interesting to create a decorative wreath for Christmas from them.  Hang it on the front door from the outside.  Corks are perfectly bonded to each other with glue.  It is best to use a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegreenhead.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas wreath of corks" class="if uuid-2311900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311900.jpg"></div><p>  Traffic jams are arranged in a chaotic order in a circle.  Between them are red berries of viburnum made of plastic.  You can decorate the DIY scrap material with your own hands with a sprig of pine, spruce or thuja, as in the photo above.  Small Christmas toys are placed on it. </p><h2>  Marine theme </h2><p>  To make a wall picture of twigs in the shape of a seahorse, you need to prepare a template.  To do this, on the sheet of whatman paper, the contours of this fish are drawn.  Then transfer the drawing to corrugated cardboard, which will serve as the basis for the future craft.  As material for work, branches without bark are useful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="twig seahorse" class="if uuid-2311916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311916.jpg"></div><p>  Stick them to the base parallel to each other.  It is necessary to fill the entire space without gaps.  On the abdomen of a seahorse, sticks should be glued exactly along the edge, and on the back, they should protrude slightly, depicting the pointed edges of the fish fins.  Complement the sea crafts of the seahorse's eyes, made from crumpled algae in a bunch. </p><h2>  Newspaper Box </h2><p>  Do not be surprised, but even from old newspapers or magazines you can make useful crafts.  From the waste material represented by old printing products, you first need to roll up the tubes using a knitting needle or a wooden skewer.  The device is placed on the edge of the newspaper and begin to tightly wind the paper around it.  The edge of the material is smeared with PVA glue and attached to the last turn.  It will take a lot of tubes to create a casket, so that you can prepare for work in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="play.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper box" class="if uuid-2311957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311957.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom of the casket is created by winding the tubes on a stick.  Something similar happens when curling paper strips.  You can use the quilling hook in your work.  If you don‚Äôt have one, then split the edge of the wooden skewer, insert the edge of the newspaper tube into the slot, and wind it in a circle to the desired size. </p><p>  The sides of the casket are made in the same way, only consist of several small circles.  They are glued with the end part to the bottom and attached with the sides.  To better maintain the shape, it is recommended that the parts be additionally fastened with wire or kapron threads. </p><p>  The lid of the box resembles its bottom, only in addition to the top is a handle attached.  This is a small circle of the same tubes.  If you want your box to be bright, newspaper tubes need to be painted with acrylic paints to your liking.  After drying, it is recommended to additionally open the product with a layer of acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Frame for the mirror </h2><p>  From plastic disposable spoons you can make an original frame for a mirror or picture.  To do this, you need to cut a large circle from fiberboard or thick cardboard.  This will be the base on which spoons will be glued in layers.  Only the upper part of the items is used in the work, the handle must be cut to the very bottom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aaishascreativedreams.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spoon mirror frame" class="if uuid-2311875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2311875.jpg"></div><p>  Work begins on the rim from the extreme circle.  You can stick the spoons with the curved side up.  The frame from the forks will also look beautiful.  You can alternate parts from spoons and forks in layers.  When the products are attached in the first circle, the laying out of the second begins.  This is done with an offset to the center. </p><p>  The mirror is drawn around the contour with a pencil before starting work, so that the master could understand his location on the craft.  When all the rows are laid out, a mirror is attached.  A rope is installed on the back side, on which the mirror is hung on the wall. </p><p>  This craft looks very impressive.  You can pick up spoons of different colors and lay them out, alternating colors or arranging in layers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article presents just a few examples of the use of recycled materials, which in the skillful hands of handmade masters turns into beautiful works of art.  Both children and adults can work with it.  Children can present hand-made articles on ecology on a school exhibition.  To do this, you can use twigs, plastic bottles, plastic bags, old newspapers.  Any material that pollutes the planet after use can be reused.  This must be explained to people in order to protect our Earth from pollution.  After all, not only people suffer, but also the rest of the living creatures that live on it. </p>
