    <h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  Since Lenovo IDEAPHONE K900 32GB is one of the most productive solutions, it also has the appropriate equipment.  The boxed version of "K900" includes: </p><ul><li>  The smartphone itself. </li><li>  Battery capacity of 2500 milliamps / hours. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Cord - adapter USB / MicroUSB. </li><li>  Protective film. </li><li>  Case - bumper made of silicone. </li><li>  Manual. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><p>  The only thing missing is an external flash drive.  The problem is that the smartphone itself does not have a slot for installing it.  Therefore, you have to be content with the built-in memory.  In extreme cases, you can install an external flash drive using OTZh-cord (it will also have to be purchased separately).  Another issue that arises is the advisability of using a <span>protective film</span> and a bumper cover.  The front panel of the device is made of protective glass, and the back cover is made of stainless steel.  As in the first case, and in the second it will be difficult to damage the gadget's case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The appearance of the gadget and the convenience of working on it </h2><p>  In appearance, Lenovo K900 32GB BLACK is a "shovel".  The dimensions of the smartphone are really impressive: 157mm by 78mm.  Moreover, its thickness and weight are 6.9 mm and 162 grams, respectively.  It is very difficult to control it with just one hand.  Dimensions still make themselves felt.  The front part, as noted earlier, is made of the 2nd generation Gorilla Eye safety glass.  The back cover is made of stainless steel.  Only narrow strips on top and bottom of plastic.  Above the display is a speaker and a camera for making video calls.  Under the screen are the classic touch buttons: ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  Not quite comfortable are the usual <span>control buttons.</span>  You can turn on the device on one side, and the volume swings are located on the opposite edge.  But the connectors of the wired interfaces are located on the lower edge of the device.  There is also a conversational microphone. </p><h2>  But what about the processor? </h2><p>  The strength of the <span>Lenovo K900</span> 32GB is the central processor.  In this case, we are talking about <span>ATOM Z2580</span> from Intel.  Physically, it has 2 computing cores, but due to the use of HyperTrading proprietary technology, the number of computing threads is doubled.  Another feature of this CPU is its clock frequency is 2 GHz.  Let's put it this way: not every solution today boasts such a characteristic.  But not everything is as perfect as it seems at first glance.  The architecture of the cores of this CPU is ‚Äúx86‚Äù.  But most of the devices running Android are powered by ARM solutions.  If you do not go into details, then we can say that there may be problems with the application software.  But this is only a conditional remark, which in most cases does not manifest itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Graphics subsystem and display </h2><p>  A sufficiently productive graphics adapter is installed in the Lenovo K900 32GB.  In this case, we are talking about the PowerVR SGX544MP2.  This is a productive solution that can easily cope with the task of any difficulty level, for example, the demanding Asphalt 8 toy on this gadget goes without problems.  The ideal complement to this graphics adapter is a 5 ‚Äùand a half-inch display with a resolution of‚Äú HD ‚Äù, that is, its resolution is 1920 by 1080. Another positive point is that the screen is based on an IPS matrix.  This ensures high image quality and viewing angles as close as possible to 180 degrees.  As expected for a device of this class, the display is able to display more than 16 million colors and process up to 5 touches to its surface.  Another indisputable advantage of this model is that the screen is protected by the 2nd generation Gorilla Eye glass. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras and their features </h2><p>  An ambiguous situation with this model is formed around the main camera.  On the one hand, she has everything in order to receive high-quality pictures and videos.  This is a 13 megapixel matrix, and autofocus, and LED backlight.  But if the photos are of acceptable quality, then there are certain problems with the video.  Most likely, they are associated with the lack of an automatic image stabilization system.  This leads to the fact that the frame in the video can be blurry.  There is also a <span>front camera.</span>  Its main task is to make video calls.  She copes with this task without any problems.  Moreover, it is based on a 2 megapixel matrix.  This is quite enough for high-quality images during video calls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  An interesting situation with this model is with the memory subsystem.  If everything is clear and unequivocal with RAM - 2 GB, then with the built-in drive options are possible.  Initially, 16 GB was integrated in this model.  But a little later, a more advanced modification appeared - Lenovo K900 32GB.  A review of its technical characteristics indicates that the difference between them is only in the volume of the flash drive.  Moreover, it is very significant - 2 times.  Accordingly, the cost of the latter is much higher.  Therefore, do not forget to check with the seller the amount of installed memory.  The situation with memory cards is much worse.  There is no slot in this smartphone for their installation.  If for some reason 16 GB or 32 GB of internal memory is not enough for you, then you can increase its size only with the help of the OTZ cable and a regular USB flash drive. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The weak link in this premium smartphone is the battery.  Its capacity is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2500 milliamps / hours and this value is most likely due to the thickness of the case at 6.9 mm.  Chinese engineers had to choose between the thickness of the smartphone and its autonomy.  As a result, the choice was made in favor of the first, and the second parameter faded into the background.  Given the screen diagonal of 5.5 inches and a powerful processor, 2500 milliamps / hours is clearly not enough.  In the best case, one charge is enough for a day of intense load.  If you use the minimum power consumption mode, you can increase this figure to 2 days, which is also not so much.  The only right solution in this situation is to additionally purchase an external MicroUSB battery and with it, significantly increase the degree of autonomy of this device.  Otherwise, he may fail you at the most inopportune moment. </p><h2>  System software </h2><p>  Smartphone Lenovo K900 32GB operates under the control of the most popular operating system at the moment - "Android".  Installed firmware with serial number "4.2".  In fact, this version is a bit outdated.  But, all the same, in the foreseeable future, compatibility problems should not arise.  Given the fact that the smartphone debuted more than a year ago, it is no longer necessary to expect updates.  So you have to be content with what is.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù itself was not installed naked.  ‚ÄúLenovo Laucher‚Äù acts as an add-on, which allows you to optimize the interface of a smart smartphone to the user's needs without any problems. </p>

    <h2>  Application software </h2><p>  Lenovo smartphones always come with a rich set of application software.  "K900" in this regard is no exception.  In addition to the previously mentioned Lenovo Laucher, a standard set of utilities from Google is also installed on this device.  Here is the email client, and the social service "Google +", and "Evernot" for instant messaging.  There are also international social services such as Instagram, Facebook and, of course, Twitter. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  A very extensive set of communications in the Lenovo K900 32GB.  A review of technical specifications indicates the following wired and wireless interfaces: </p><ul><li>  One SIM card, which with the help of built-in transmitters can work in networks of the 2nd and 3rd generation.  In the first case, the information transfer rate will be 560 kb / s, and in the second - 7.2 Mbit / s. </li><li>  "Wai Fai", capable of operating at speeds up to 300 Mbps. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù 2nd generation. </li><li>  Built-in "ZhPS" - the transmitter allows you to easily turn this device into a regular navigator.  So with this smartphone it will be difficult to get lost on the ground. </li><li>  Universal USB 2.0 / MicroUSB performs 2 tasks at once.  One of them is connecting to a PC to exchange information with it.  The second is charging the battery. </li><li>  The last connector is a 3.5 mm jack for connecting an external speaker system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Lenovo K900 32GB turned out to be fairly balanced.  Powerful processor, powerful graphics adapter, impressive screen size with excellent resolution, ample memory.  But still there are negative sides to this gadget.  First of all, a small battery for such a large and productive smartphone.  As previously noted, this problem can be solved.  It is enough only to additionally purchase an external MicroUSB battery.  In the second case, the situation is similar.  An external memory card cannot be inserted into the K900.  No slot needed.  But with the help of ‚ÄúOTZh‚Äù - a cable and an ordinary flash drive, this problem can be solved.  In general, the Lenovo K900 32GB was almost perfect.  The price for it is $ 345, which is not so much for a device of this class. </p>
