    <p>  If you are thinking about whether to buy a PS4, choose a different console, or turn to a PC, then you have to make a serious decision.  The world of games is now incredibly vast, but it has its own specifics, which you will definitely have to consider.  So, it is worth starting with the fact that today computer games are one of the most popular types of entertainment, which is not inferior in any way to literature, cinema, or any other leading ways of relaxation.  Therefore, you should not consider a gamer as a person who has no other interests besides computer games, because this view of the question is incredibly outdated.  Now <span>this is the norm,</span> and those who are not fond of games solely because it is "teenage bullshit" should reconsider their view of things.  There are already a large number of educational and developmental games for children, as well as family projects in which everyone can take part together.  In general, computer games are good, but the question of which platform to play them on remains an open question.  This article will be devoted to whether it is worth buying a PS4? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Confrontation PS and X-Box </h2>

    <p>  If you are considering whether to buy a PS4, then you should take a look at the history of this console.  In fact, today, only two developers, PS and X-Box, are really fighting in the foreground, but the second console appeared much later.  The fact is that the Play Station makes its serial numbers really serial, and not as in the case of the X-Box.  Here, at first, the console came out at number 360, and after it the generation changed to One, that is, ‚Äúone‚Äù.  PS the first and second generation of consoles were already quite a long time ago, the first of them still had cartridges.  But already the second completely switched to laser discs.  Since then, PS has been very popular, and the fourth generation model, the PS4 console, which will be discussed in this article, has been released relatively recently.  However, the X-Box One competes with her, and a personal computer is always looming on the horizon.  And how in this case to make a choice?  And in favor of what - X-Box, PC or PS4?  Should I buy a console at all?  These are the questions you should answer first. </p><h2>  Do I need a console purchase? </h2>

The fact is that this is a rather expensive subject, which is quite limited in function.  That is, if you have a computer that has enough power to run most modern games, then you probably do not need a console.  However, there are some aspects that are definitely worth paying attention to.  Firstly, consoles have long ceased to be exclusively subjects for games - they are becoming increasingly multifunctional, so in this regard the purchase of a PS4 or other version will be justified.  Secondly, it‚Äôs time to get used to the fact that computer games are the most ordinary entertainment, which you can also spend money on if you want to.  So even if there is already a good computer, the console will clearly not be superfluous.  And thirdly, it is, of course, exclusives.  For each of the consoles, developers create games that are suitable only for her.  They are called exclusives.  And for the sake of gaining access to such projects, sometimes it is worth thinking about acquiring a particular set-top box.  Another question: is it worth buying a PS4 now?  After all, a lot of time has passed since the release of the new generation - maybe it's too late? </p><h2>  PS4 purchase </h2>

    <p>  So, you decided to buy a console.  And if you choose PS4, then you may have a very logical question: "Is it worth taking it at the moment?"  The fact is that the new generation console was released more than two years ago - is this really its drawback?  In fact, everything is quite different - in the first year of sales, buying a PS4 looked like a risky event.  After all, the PS3 was a very good prefix, in addition, it had a large supply of games.  At first, the owners of PS4 could try their hand at only a dozen or two projects.  Moreover, it was only the basic version, which had not yet had time to acquire functionality.  Now everything is completely different, and you should not be afraid of buying a new generation console.  She has already established herself in the market, and developers are releasing more and more exclusives for her, as well as developing versions of multiport projects for her.  It is also worth noting that this console has added useful features - you can now use it as an adapter for television, as a game center, and also use other incredible features.  In general, if you still had questions about whether to buy a PS4 at the start, now now, after more than two years, these issues should recede into the background. </p><h2>  PS4 vs PS3 </h2>

    <p>  One of the most pressing questions regarding the purchase of a new generation of console: is it worth buying a PS4, if there is a PS3?  In fact, this question is very complicated, since the developers have already managed to lure users with their complaints about the new features of this console.  However, the PS4 is actually not so beautiful.  On the contrary, there are not quite the most flattering reviews regarding this console, but for the most part they relate to the initial PS4 models.  In general, if you have extra money, then you can switch from the old generation to the new.  But remember: the PS3 is still quite indebted to be quite competitive. </p><h2>  PS4 vs X-Box One </h2>

    <p>  If you are faced with the question of choosing between the two giants of the console world, then here you can hardly give any advice.  The fact is that in this matter absolutely everything tastes decide.  These consoles are essentially similar, but at the same time they have different functions for which they should be taken.  Therefore, it will be much better here if you yourself try both, and then decide what you like best. </p><h2>  PS4 vs PC </h2>

    <p>  One of the most controversial debates is about which is better - a personal computer or a console.  In this case, no matter what ‚Äúlotions‚Äù the PS4 prefix has acquired, the computer‚Äôs functionality will still be higher.  Moreover, almost all games that are not console exclusives are released on the computer, but far from all projects that are available on the PC get to the consoles.  Accordingly, in this confrontation, the choice will definitely fall on a personal computer.  But you can - in addition to it and with sufficient finances - purchase a PS4.  For the sake of advanced features and exclusive games. </p><h2>  Where to buy PS4? </h2><p>  So, if you have already decided that you want the PS4, and nothing will stop you, then you should reasonably approach the choice of the place to purchase the console.  The fact is that there are various options that may suit one person, but will be completely unacceptable to another.  The first question that arises for almost everyone: is it worth buying a PS4 on Ebay, because there is always an offer there, and the consoles are much cheaper there.  But here you will have to take into account the fact that you will have to pay for shipping from the United States, plus guarantees of success are slightly less than in other cases.  Naturally, the likelihood that you will be deceived or that your prefix will be beaten during transportation is extremely small, but it still exists.  In addition, you will not receive any warranty service - unless you go with the console directly to the United States.  You can also purchase PS4 in specialized stores or from an authorized distributor, if available in your city.  It will come out to you a little more expensive, but at the same time you will have a guarantee, and maintenance, and even crack.  But what definitely is not worth doing is to buy the PS4 from your hands or at unofficial points where you may not be given any guarantee at all. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  If you want to become the owner of the PS4, then you better pay a little more, but contact the official representatives or a reliable store.  But before that, you should think about whether you need this purchase?  After all, the console is a rather specific thing, so it makes no sense to spend quite a lot of money on something that you are not particularly going to use.  Well, the last answer to the question of whether to buy a PS4: in 2014, a huge number of exclusives were already released, they won‚Äôt be able to install them on a PC.  Yes, and regular games are often ported to this console, so there should not be a problem with this. </p>
