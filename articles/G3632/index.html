It differs in very mediocre technical characteristics, so it does not reach the title of a full-fledged communicator.  On the other hand, the set of functions provided for the model allows you to position it as something more than a regular mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 310" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/770701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As already noted above, the appearance of the device is made in the same style as the rest of the serial modifications.  The design is dominated by soft and smooth lines.  All faces of the device are beveled, and the corners are rounded.  The model is available in white, bronze and gray metallic colors.  The case is made of glossy plastic, and therefore fingerprints always remain on it.  However, this is far from the only flaw in the appearance of the Nokia Asha 310. Reviews of its owners indicate that minor scuffs, scratches and other damage appear on the case very quickly, no matter how carefully the phone is operated.  As for the build quality, there is nothing to complain about: bumps, backlashes and crevices are absent, and the device itself does not creak even when squeezed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The mobile phone uses a display made by capacitive technology, the diagonal of which is 3 inches.  It should be noted that one of the main drawbacks of the Nokia Asha 310 model is the characteristics of its screen.  The fact is that the resolution is only 240x400 pixels, and the image density is 115 pixels per inch.  In this regard, even with the naked eye, you can notice the graininess of the image displayed on it.  A good margin of brightness is almost the only plus of the display.  Thanks to this indicator, everything here is clearly visible even in bright light.  As for the sensor, it responds very quickly, adequately and accurately to touch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 310 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/770702.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The dimensions of the phone in height, width and thickness are respectively 109.9x54x13 millimeters.  In this case, the device weighs 104 grams.  By modern standards, it can be called a bit thick.  Along with this, as evidenced by the reviews put away by the owners of Nokia Asha 310, in the palm of the hand the model lies very conveniently and can be easily controlled with one hand. </p><h2>  Location of the main elements </h2><p>  Directly below the phone‚Äôs display, the developers installed call accept and reject buttons, as well as a microphone hole.  On the back cover is the camera lens and the main speaker connector.  If you open it, you can see the slot for one of the SIM cards and the battery.  A slot for additional memory and a second SIM card is provided on the left side.  The so-called hot swap function is supported for both slots.  On the right side is the Nokia Asha 310 start and stop button, as well as <span>a volume control.</span>  The output for connecting standard headphones, a headset and a charger can be found on top. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 310 review" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/770703.jpg" width="600"></div>

For this reason, Nokia Asha 310 is equipped with a single-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, 128 MB stationary and 64 megabytes of RAM.  If such a need arises, the user can install an additional drive up to 32 GB in size.  In general, the interface functions well, and most applications start without any delays. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The model is equipped with an ordinary camera with a two megapixel sensor.  In this regard, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the quality of pictures taken with the phone can not be called even average.  When creating photographs indoors, they appear blurry and darkened in some places.  Even worse is the situation in bright <span>daylight.</span>  The videos shot on the Nokia Asha 310 camera are also characterized by similar indicators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 310 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/770704.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A lithium-ion type <span>battery is</span> provided for the phone, with a capacity of 1100 mAh.  Its full charge is enough for the device for 600 hours in standby mode or about 17 hours of constant conversation.  As the practice of using the model shows, under the condition of not the most intensive use, you can keep it without charging for up to four days.  In this indicator, the phone slightly surpasses the analogues operating on the Android system. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Nokia Asha 310 is a fairly simple device that is most suitable for people who plan to use it to only make phone calls.  In order to save money, the Finnish manufacturing company used, to put it mildly, not the best camera and hardware stuffing, therefore, in its main parameters, the model can only compete with inexpensive communicators.  On the other hand, if you look at other representatives of this class, then this phone has decent functionality.  Its main advantages include support for working with two SIM cards, high autonomy, good appearance and excellent ergonomics. </p>
