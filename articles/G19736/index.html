    <p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding the complex was due not only to the possibility of creating the necessary conditions for international sporting events.  The construction was to become a base for physical education and attract tourists.  Also, the areas of the developed complex were intended for training professional athletes and holding cultural events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The multifunctional complex Minsk-Arena began to be built in the spring of 2006 after the signing of the corresponding decree by the President of the Republic of Belarus A. Lukashenko.  About two thousand people worked at the facility daily.  They implemented the project of the famous architect Valery Kutsko, an employee of the workshop of the Belgosproject Institute.  The building was officially opened four years later, on January 30, 2010. On the ice of the complex, as part of its opening, a match was held for all the stars in the Continental Hockey League. </p><p>  Currently, the multifunctional complex Minsk-Arena occupies a leading position, being considered the most capacious venue and the leading hockey arena of the European continent.  The building makes a huge impression thanks to the high-tech architectural solution.  It surpassed the beauty of the external and internal design, as well as the range of services provided, all the sports arenas that were built earlier in the country.  Moreover, the Minsk Arena can rightfully be considered a landmark not only in Belarus, but also in Europe. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the ice structure </h2><p>  The Minsk-Arena complex is unique in its multifunctionality, equipment, equipment and technical complexity.  There are no analogues to it in the Republic of Belarus today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the development of the project, a roof was provided in the building, which was made using French technology.  These works were carried out in Belarus for the first time.  The roof is cable-stayed.  Black cables are pulled around its perimeter.  They are called guys.  They are the main support for the roof.  The roof is made of lightweight material, which, despite this, has the ability to withstand up to one hundred and twenty tons of load.  Almost every square centimeter of the roof has special sensors.  With their help, constant monitoring of cable-stayed tension is carried out.  This information is tracked by both Belarusian and French experts. </p><h2>  Ice Arena </h2><p>  A certain number of stands located in the lower tier of the main structure of the complex have metal steps.  Call them blitters.  By pressing a single button, the stands are able to slide under the concrete steps along with the seats.  The need for this arises when conducting pop and sports shows, as well as concerts.  In the free space, a dance floor is arranged and a collapsible stage is set. </p>
