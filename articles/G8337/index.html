    <h2>  What about the phones? </h2><p>  Cell phones have entered our life extremely tightly and harmoniously; moreover, they have become virtually an integral part of it, therefore, to attract attention to them, companies have to show unthinkable ingenuity.  One of the most successful advertising tricks back in the days of <span>landline phones</span> was the move "the largest phone in the world."  But let's decide on what characteristics we will choose the winner, since everything in this world is relative. </p><h2>  Largest to use </h2><p>  If the main condition is the ability to use a mobile phone in everyday life, then the title "the world's largest phone" gets Huawei Ascend Mate.  Honestly, this is a smartphone that looks more like a tablet.  Its diagonal is 6.1 inches; the phones have no larger screen yet.  However, it is quite convenient to use it, if you neglect the appearance of a person who almost brings a laptop to his ear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the biggest phone in the world" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/319538.jpg" width="410"></div>

He‚Äôs only 10 cm tall and weighs 22 kilos.  And even if the phone does not work without an outlet, all other functions are quite accessible.  Except, of course, vibration, since vibration would compete with the work of <span>a jackhammer.</span> </p><p>  The Vietnamese could have argued with the Chinese, who created the world's largest phone measuring 3.2 by 1.1 m and weighing 300 kg.  But Tang built his device alone, and the Vietnamese as a company, so it can hardly be considered that they broke the Chinese record. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the biggest phones in the world" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/319539.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  The largest from the company </h2><p>  If we evaluate exactly the dimensions of the device and not find fault with the fact that it was made by the manufacturer of mobile phones, we can say that the biggest Samsung phone in the world is Chicago Samsung, which is 4.5 meters long and almost 3.5 wide.  So far, nothing more colossal from the world of mobile phones has been registered with the Guinness book.  Like all previous versions from the category of "biggest phones in the world", this one is also working and equipped with all the options specific to cellular communications.  However, in our opinion, this Samsung monster still loses to the giant of the seventies of the last century, even if it was "old", on the buttons.  Still, to dial the number on that phone, you had to climb with a stepladder, the buttons were the size of a square meter, and the receiver was completely picked up by a crane.  So there‚Äôs something for mobile companies to strive for and whom to give up. </p><p>  And although all these huge phones are, in principle, of little use in everyday life, in addition to the advertising and PR functions conceived by the companies, they also amuse people.  And in general, such mobile phones are not the dumbest way to be noted in the treasured book, and using such a giant is interesting not only for children, but also for adults. </p><p>  . </p>
