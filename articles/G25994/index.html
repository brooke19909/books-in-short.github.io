It is worth saying that phones are not the main product of the company.  In addition to smartphones, the Japanese produce home and professional electronics.  Game consoles that every gamer wants to get are also known. </p><p>  In addition, Sony has two film studios, a record label and a huge archive of films.  It may also provide financial services in some cases.  The company has several large representative offices around the world: in Japan, China, the USA and European countries. </p><h2>  Spread </h2><p>  The corporation began its work back in 1946.  Initially, the company was called Tokyo Telecommunications Industrial Company.  Later, thanks to a combination of letters and analogies, it was decided to reincarnate in Sony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all sony phone models" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565628.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  Back in the early 50s of the last century, the company was engaged in the sale of tape recorders.  Soon released the first radio.  Over time, the company's shares began to be quoted, and it quickly began to gain popularity and momentum.  Following began to improve TVs, VCRs and players. </p><p>  Already in 1994, game consoles became known.  Then the first PlayStation appeared.  A few years later, the company began to produce computers, laptops and players. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Telephone era </h2><p>  In 2001, the world saw the Sony Ericsson phone.  All models, photos of which were saved on the Internet, were incredibly popular.  They began to be produced in batches.  The corporation worked to improve them, and after 10 years got rid of the Ericsson prefix. </p><p>  In 2012, new competitive Sony Xperia phones appeared on the market.  This line has become very popular.  She received several branches.  Some models have become budget, others, on the contrary, the most expensive smartphones on the market. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, in 2001, Sony decided to start producing phones.  She was assisted in this by the Swedish company Ericsson, which received exactly half of the subsidiary Sony Mobile Communications Inc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony phone all models" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565629.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  After the tasks set, the implementation of the plan began.  Both companies wanted to produce phones that feature high-quality digital shooting, as well as a wide selection of multimedia.  Since 2002, all Sony models have received color displays.  In addition, the company seriously thought about switching to GSM, and successful sales only confirmed the correctness of this decision. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First popularity </h2><p>  Despite the difficulties that the brand experienced, the world saw the first ‚Äúswallow‚Äù, which brought success, in 2003.  It was a Sony Ericsson T610 model.  The phone received its popularity due to a number of improvements over which they worked 2 years.  The design turned out to be successful.  Of course, now such a phone would look antediluvian, but then it was a bestseller.  The case had a classic candy bar, there was also a joystick, which later became familiar and convenient.  The dimensions of the device were compact. </p><p>  In addition to the color display, there were many useful features that people only had to get to know.  Among them is the long-loved E-mail client, as well as the then-popular support for infrared and even Bluetooth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony photo phones models" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the end of October, the new P900 model was introduced, which replaced the P800.  This phone was a discovery for the whole world.  He got a touch screen, inside there was already 16 MB of memory.  Its design was very interesting - the gadget had a hinged lid that covered a small part of the screen.  Also included was a stylus for comfortable control.  After there were several modifications of this model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, the P910 was one of the first phones to have the famous QWERTY keyboard, which was located on the hinged lid of the device.  There was also a fairly high-quality display that was larger than the previous ones.  The company has expanded its internal memory. </p><h2>  The heyday of Ericsson </h2><p>  All Sony Ericsson phones were famous for their features.  But the most popular were the Walkman and Cyber-shot series.  A huge number of models came out.  Walkman has become popular for its signature players and unmatched sound.  Cyber-shot had a bias towards a good camera, and now they would have got the proud name of camera phones. </p><p>  The first most popular among them was the K750i, which belonged to the Cyber-shot.  Perhaps this is the most popular phone "Sony Erickson."  All models that came out later did not receive such a huge amount of positive reviews.  This model was first seen in 2005.  After a while, it was recognized as the best product of those years, and a little later, and in general the most successful project in the history of the concern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia phone models" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565623.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the K750i turned out to be very tenacious.  Conservative owners of this phone still can not get enough of its stable operation.  After 11 years, there are still those who use the K750i.  Of course, at the moment, his camera has become much weaker - only 2 megapixels.  There is also little internal memory here - 34 MB.  Not to mention 1 MB of RAM.  Nevertheless, at one time it was a hit that not everyone could boast of. </p><p>  But from the Walkman series, the W800i has become such a phone.  He was immediately considered a clone of the K750i.  Their only difference was in the direction.  Still, each had his own specialization.  There were also slight differences in the case, software, and delivery set.  Otherwise, these are absolutely two identical models of Sony phones.  A photo of them, by the way, only confirms this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Ericsson phone all models" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565630.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other models </h2><p>  In addition to these, other equally popular models came out under the Walkman and Cyber-shot brands.  Among them is the K850i, which received as much as 5 megapixels of the main camera.  A little later, the C905 already came out with 8 megapixels.  There was also an exhibition model Satio, which already had as much as 12 megapixels. </p><p>  In 2007, the company decided to buy a software manufacturer, and since then all models have become more unified inside.  They had approximately the same set of branded applications. </p><h2>  Embryo </h2><p>  Sony‚Äôs phone went through a lot.  All models had a huge number of revised versions.  But fans have always been pleased to see the new series.  So, in 2008, the famous Xperia prefix first appeared.  The first model, which received the short but loud name X1, began to work on the basis of Windows Mobile.  It was on this OS that the company originally released this series.  But next year, all models were relocated to Android. </p><p>  In general, during the period when they first got to know Xperia, three basic models were released.  But among them were those that would surprise even the modern buyer.  For example, the Sony Ericsson X5 Pureness became a limited edition phone that had a transparent display.  It could be found only in exclusive salons at a very high price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Ericsson phone all models photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565625.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Until the end of 2011, a whole series of phones with the Xperia prefix were released.  Among them are such popular models as the gaming Xperia PLAY or the advanced Xperia Neo, and the lesser-known Xperia Mini, Xperia Mini Pro and Xperia Pro. </p><h2>  Disappearance </h2><p>  The end of <span>2011</span> can be officially considered the period when Ericsson ceased to exist.  The Swedish company decided to sell its share of Sony, and she, without thinking twice, agreed to this step.  This event was due to the fact that the phones became less competitive, it was necessary to move on, come up with new models and create a better product.  So there was an updated company Sony Mobile Communications. </p><h2>  Falls and ups </h2><p>  All Sony phone models have come a long way to end up in someone's bag or pocket.  Since 2012, a number of lines from the updated Sony Xperia have been released.  Among them are budget models, and those that could claim huge popularity.  But the most successful and at the same time failed were smartphones from the Z series. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565627.jpg"></div>

    <p>  They first entered the market in 2013.  Gadgets became the first waterproof devices.  The building is monolithic, and docking stations that were previously unknown were also delivered to it.  The first model was the Sony <span>Xperia Z1.</span>  This is the most classic version of the series.  After it came a compact variation of the model, as well as a large device - Compact and Ultra, respectively. </p><p>  Following the Japanese decided to release Z2, Z3 and Z5.  The fourth version was only available in Asia.  As a result, the project started very successfully, but over time was a failure.  The company tried to fix any errors all the time, but at the same time created new problems for users.  As a result, it was again at a loss. </p><h2>  New attempt </h2><p>  In 2016, all Sony models of phones changed the main index to X. The company again decided to try to improve and produce high-quality smartphones.  As a result, three models came out under this name: <span>Sony Xperia XA, Sony Xperia</span> X and Sony Xperia X Performance.  These smartphones really turned out to be very good, but quite expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia X" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1565626.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The company tried not to depart from its style, but still updated the design and made elegant, sophisticated and beautiful models.  In addition, she worked on software and on the technical component.  She listened to customer reviews, moved the soft buttons around the case.  Added the famous fingerprint scanner. </p><p>  In general, carefully, but did the work on the bugs.  Now Sony has nothing to spoil with the further release of models and listen more carefully to customers. </p>
