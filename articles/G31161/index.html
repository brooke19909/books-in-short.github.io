    <h2>  What is located next to the hotel </h2><p>  Sirocco Beach 3 is almost on the sea, and this is one of the decisive points that are taken into account during the trip.  In addition, it is located near the city of Mahdia - about two kilometers to its center.  Closest to the hotel is <span>Monastir Airport.</span>  The distance to it is about fifty kilometers.  And from the airport of the city of Tunisia - as much as two hundred and thirty.  Three hundred meters from the hotel there are Oasis grocery stores with good prices, quality goods and an assortment better than in the market. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We arrive at the hotel - how and when? </h2><p>  The hotel is located quite far from the airport where charter flights arrive.  Therefore, a transfer to Sirocco Beach 3 (Mahdia) takes an hour and a half or two.  And if you are an independent tourist, then most likely you will fly through Monastir.  From there it is easy to get to the hotel by train or bus.  Go to Mahdia and minibuses (piles).  Like all local hotels, this hotel is located on the first line, near the shore.  Therefore, public transport inevitably passes by, and the minibus can stop right near the entrance.  You need to come here exactly when the hotel is open - that is, between May and September (inclusive).  July and August are very hot and good for passive vacationers.  A refreshing breeze blows at sea at this time, and you don‚Äôt want to go anywhere.  But for those who want to explore the surroundings, it is better to choose the beginning and end of the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirocco beach 3 Mahdia" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/588281.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Tunisia, Mahdia </h2><p>  This city is located near the cape, which bears the same name with the continent - Africa.  At one time, he was even the <span>capital of Tunisia.</span>  Those who come here usually know that Mahdia is not a party place.  He is loved by those who value secluded relaxation, huge beaches and the cleanest sea.  These places are good for traveling to the sea with children.  All you need to know before buying a ticket to Sirocco Beach.  The hotel ‚Äú3 stars‚Äù, which it is, of course, cannot provide either an aqua park or a thalassotherapy center.  But if you look, then all these charms can be found in other hotels.  And they are quite accessible not only for their guests.  For example, a beautiful water park operates at the Caribbean World Hotel.  And the best centers of thalassotherapy in Mahdia are open at the Vinci Nur and Golden Tulip hotels.  Near the "Black Gate" of the city on Fridays there is a very colorful market.  Prices there for tourists can be just insane, but they go there just to stare at goods and local customs.  If you are interested in Islamic architecture, go to the local mosques - Bolshaya and Mustafa Khamza are especially good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirocco beach 3 reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/588291.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Eat and drink at the hotel - what is the quality? </h2><p>  As in many Tunisian "treshki", the "all inclusive" system is practiced here.  The cuisine at Sirocco Beach 3 (Mahdia) is excellent.  Breakfast is better than in Turkish hotels of the same category - there are cereals and yoghurts.  As usual in the East, baking is beyond praise!  From the dinner and side dishes there are rice, potatoes, vegetables, baked or grilled.  Lots of salads.  There are meat, poultry and a variety of fish - more than five species.  <span>Buffet,</span> so you impose your own meals.  Fine fruits - especially watermelons, melons and grapes.  For a bite to eat at the bar and pizzeria, guests can enjoy a meal for free.  They allow you to drink alcohol in a restaurant that you bought somewhere in duty-free - and not every hotel will find such an indulgence. </p><p>  If you want to enjoy local seafood, tourists recommend not going to restaurants, where all this at sky-high prices, but to fish shops.  There, in the evenings, the catch of the day is grilled on coals, and the pleasure is completely inexpensive.  But if you have already decided to visit a cafe like Sidi Salem (this is in Medina), then be sure to try couscous with fish.  Here it is prepared just amazingly. </p><h2>  Swim and sunbathe </h2><p>  The beach is next to the hotel.  Sunbeds and umbrellas, according to vacationers, are free, although the opposite is found on tourist sites.  The sea is very clean, the beach itself is large, wide, with white sand.  There are no jellyfish at all, although in the neighboring areas there are quite a lot of them.  A center has been opened where you can engage in various water activities.  On the beach there is a playground where they play volleyball.  Sirocco Beach 3 Hotel (Mahdia) has a large outdoor pool.  It is very spacious, and it‚Äôs nice to relax near it.  A path from it leads directly to the sea.  You can swim here from morning to evening.  <span>Beach towels</span> are available for hire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotel Sirocco beach 3" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/588299.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  How much is the trip? </h2><p>  Many vacationers choose this hotel because they are very happy with the price.  It starts from three to four thousand rubles per room per day.  Although many services are paid.  Using the refrigerator - 25 dinars per week.  The safe in the room is also for a fee - two dinars per day.  The same cost and rental of beach towels.  Otherwise, you need to take your own.  Riding on the beach on a "banana" costs seven dinars, on a parachute - 20. Bottle beer at the hotel - $ 2.5.  Tourists highly recommend buying Tunisian wines and date liquor (the latter costs about eight dollars).  If you want to go to the medieval quarter - Medina - from the Sirocco Beach 3 Mahdia hotel by taxi, then pay no more than two or three dinars.  Entrance to the fortress costs 3 TLD.  You have to buy excursions at the hotel, as there are no street agencies in Mahdia.  A full-day sightseeing tour of the main attractions will cost about forty-five dollars per person.  You can buy olive oil for six dinars per liter.  A diving course will cost three hundred and twenty dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirocco beach hotel 3" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/588695.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Where can I go and go on an excursion? </h2><p>  There are no special attractions within walking distance of the hotel, so if you want to wander around the shops, the market and the cafe, then go to Medina.  Although interesting shopping, as some tourists claim, can be done very close to the hotel - along the promenade there are shops with clothes, a supermarket with good prices.  Merchants near the hotel are quite polite and do not impose anything.  And in the city do not forget to bargain - the more skillfully you do it, the more you are respected.  In Medina, beautiful old buildings - forty-meter gates, the remains of the walls of the Fatimid era, when this city was the capital of Tunisia, the fortress of Bordj al-Kebir, which is located directly on Cape Africa.  Of the excursions, vacationers like a walk on the "pirate ship", which includes lunch and drinks, as well as a trip to Tunisia and Carthage.  True, tourists advise history buffs to go to Carthage on their own, since during the excursions they visit only Antonin's baths.  There are many positive reviews about the ‚Äúblue city‚Äù of Sidi Abu Said, which is known throughout Tunisia.  Sirocco Beach 3 organizes trips there too.  In addition to picturesque streets and ceramics, this city boasts amazingly beautiful viewing platform, which overlooks the entire bay.  Those who come here not for the first time run the risk of going on longer excursions - to the Sahara, Sousse. </p><h2>  Hotel Sirocco Beach 3 Reviews </h2><p>  There are not very many Russians in the hotel, and the main contingent of guests is Europeans and local residents.  The hotel is cozy and compact, there is no crush, no lines.  The hotel is located in the suburbs, and is very good for a relaxing holiday, to spend time with the sea and the sun.  Employees are polite and responsive, everything is done on demand.  You can ride with children - the territory, although small, is quite sufficient for games and walks.  The food is excellent, the service is at a good level.  Comparing with neighboring hotels, vacationers recognize the advantage of Sirocco Beach, and assure that they will come here next year.  This is a very budget option, allowing you not only to sunbathe and swim, but to get in touch with an amazing culture that has absorbed Arab and European elements.  People here live better than in Egypt, and the sea is cleaner than in Turkey.  You can also bring beautiful silk and top-quality olive oil from here. </p>
