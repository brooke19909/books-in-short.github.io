    <p>  The layout of poker is the basis for taking the essence of the game. </p><h2>  What is poker? </h2><p>  Card poker involves participation in the game from two to ten people at the same table, each playing for himself. </p><p>  Known <span>types of poker</span> are Hold'em, Omaha, Stud, Draw Poker and others.  The essence of each game is based on certain rules and strategies. </p><p>  In today's world, there is the opportunity to take part in the game via the Internet or in special cardrooms.  Companies are also gathering at home, for which a special set with chips is purchased. </p><p>  A special place in the rules of the game is occupied by the poker layout.  Combinations of cards deserve separate consideration. </p><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  For playing poker, a deck of 36 cards is used.  This is a well-known pile from six to ace, consisting of four suits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Combination poker layout" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/823211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The game has a rating of combinations.  It depends on the sequence of cards.  Combinations of poker layouts with higher ratings also with the same suit.  The combination of these two factors gives the most powerful royal flush.  Such a layout of poker is the dream of any player, because this is a win-win option.  However, royal flush comes infrequently. </p><p>  In the event that the participants did not get any of these combinations, the win is determined by the weakest combination - the highest card.  The rating of cards is also taken into account when determining the winner among several participants who have the same card combinations on hand. </p><h2>  Top rated card combinations </h2><p>  The chances to win are greater for the participant who has one of the highest card sequences. </p><p>  The layout of poker by seniority is called hand rating.  In order of decreasing significance, it has the following form. </p><ol><li>  The Royal Flush (among the poker fans is called the ‚Äúroyal combination‚Äù) consists of 5 cards of the same suit from ten to ace.  This is a win-win combination of cards. </li><li>  A straight flush (also called a "direct deal") is a combination of 5 cards of the same suit, standing in order. </li><li>  Four of a kind is the next highest poker layout, which consists of four identical cards.  When revealing cards (in the game this action is called a ‚Äúshowdown‚Äù), the height of the rank of the cards is important if it is dropped by several participants. </li><li>  Full house (translated as ‚Äúfull house‚Äù) is also one of the most rated combinations after the previous three.  It consists of 2 peer cards + 3 identical cards of a different rank. </li></ol>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Less rated combinations </h2><p>  According to the established rules, the following poker layouts are considered in descending order.  They are less winning, but even such a poker layout can bring victory. </p><ol><li>  A flash consists of 5 cards of the same suit and does not have any order. </li><li>  A straight is a poker layout in which 5 cards of different suits go in ascending order one after another. </li><li>  Next in descending order of hands comes thrips (set, three cards, three, triple).  This is a coincidence of three identical cards. </li><li>  Next in the ranking are two pairs, each of two identical cards. </li><li>  A pair is a combination of two identical cards. </li><li>  A high card is the lowest winning option that a poker layout can bring.  The rules stipulate that in the absence of any of the above combinations, the winner will be determined by the highest card that came to the player.  Even with the weakest combination of cards, correctly applying the strategy of the game and taking into account the psychology of opponents, a participant can win a round. </li></ol><h2>  Stage One Sit-N-Go Tournament Layout </h2><p>  There is a specific system for holding a Sit-N-Go tournament.  Its layout in poker (example in the photo) at the initial stage occurs according to a certain scheme. </p><ol><li>  Two players at the dealer place blind bets.  The first makes a small bet (small blind), and the second - a large bet (big blind).  After that, the dealer arranges 2 cards face down. </li><li>  The initial layout in poker (photo below) sets the participants to the trend of the game.  Each participant raises, accepts a bet or discards cards. </li><li>  In turn, players take the highest bet or refuse to play in this round. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Second Sit-N-Go Tournament Layout </h2><p>  After the first lap, the time comes when the dealer carries out the second stage of the layout. </p><p>  He deals three cards face up, which each player can use to form the best hand (combination). </p><p>  This layout is called a flop.  Again there is a betting circle, and the dealer opens the fourth card to the players (the turn layout). </p><p>  The last fifth card is opened to players when the river layout.  After it, the last bets are made, the winner of the round is determined. </p><p>  The game continues until the last of the two finalists comes out of it.  The winner takes the win. </p>
