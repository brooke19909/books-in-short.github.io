    <p>  The statement "Activity is the only way to know" refers to such an important problem as the basic need of a person for knowledge.  After all, it is precisely the desire to learn something new that we owe to all that we have today.  What happened on Earth thousands of years ago, long before our era?  Almost nothing.  Neanderthals lived on the planet, and only the desire to survive, provoking the search for something new, made people out of them. </p><p>  Cognition is the way to life.  A person who wants to think, study, work, and most importantly, think, often achieves a lot.  This distinguishes him from ignoramuses, people living with illusions, and simply from biological trash.  In order to achieve a certain goal, to fulfill a plan, you must try, work, work, both on your plan and on yourself.  It is necessary to act, in other words, to progress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Goal setting </h2><p>  The expression ‚ÄúActivity is the only way to knowledge‚Äù, the problem of which is quite wide, makes a person think.  Some people who need nothing from life just chuckle at the statement.  They have completely different values, more precisely, they are often completely absent.  However, this is only for the time being and for the time being.  Urgent need - this is the most effective way to make a person move off the ground.  If he needs to do something, get, get, find out, he will begin to act.  Even the most lethargic, lazy and nothing-like person will begin to attempt to achieve his goal.  This is the meaning of the phrase "Activity is the only way to knowledge." </p><h2>  Live and learn </h2>

    <p>  God alone knows how old this proverb is.  But one thing can be stated with certainty - this is absolutely true.  Sitting in one place, it is simply unrealistic to learn something.  People at all times were trained in the process of vigorous activity.  And, by the way, it was not always correct.  Everyone makes mistakes and learns from them - this is absolutely normal.  If you stop acting, think, synthesize a thought and bring it to life, then a person will instantly begin to degrade.  One day you should not do anything, lie on the couch and watch TV, on Monday you feel like you are stupid, absolutely not ready for productive activity.  Man needs to work.  In order for his activity to have a certain meaning, it is imperative to set goals.  Motivation is a must.  But everyone has her own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Was the playwright right? </h2><p>  Bernard Shaw knew what he was saying.  ‚ÄúActivity is the only way to know‚Äù is definitely a golden quote, which for many can become a motivation, a sense to move on, not give up, achieve your goals.  Learning new things, you will be able to understand many objective laws of the existence of our world.  Indeed, without this it is unrealistic to carry out any practical task.  Anyway, self-development is always good.  A person must become better in order to make and the world a little more perfect. </p>

    <p>  A lot of controversy and controversy provoked and continues to evoke the statement "Activity is the only way to knowledge."  The pros and cons are regularly cited by various modern philosophers and thinkers.  Although this phrase gets much more support.  Quite dubious arguments are opposed: supposedly, in addition to practical activity, you can still see, hear, feel - this is also the path to knowledge.  However, only seeing, hearing and feeling, you can learn something, but not continue your path to improvement.  All information obtained in similar ways should be further used in practice in order to draw certain conclusions, to be sure of what they have seen / heard or to categorically refute, expressing their point of view.  Only by synthesizing all methods of cognition, it will turn out to begin to think competently and versatilely.  And this is very much appreciated in our time. </p>
