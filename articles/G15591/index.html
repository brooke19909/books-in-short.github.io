Literally, we get the "driver of the army." </p><p>  The word "governor" is Slavic, in Latin it corresponds to dux, and in German - Herzog.  In those days, the ancient Slavs had mostly military life, and there was a custom to choose leaders at the tribal veche in case of a military threat.  When it ended, the governor's power ceased. </p>

    <p>  The Russian governors now had power not only military, but also civil and spiritual.  The chiefs of the tribe, the "owners", the so-called "supreme governors" appeared, they also performed the duties of chief judges and high priests.  Over time, among many Slavs, the name "governor" was transformed into the concept of "prince".  In the specific period, each of them had its own army and governor.  This was a man who performed military functions in wartime, and in peace was in charge of various civil affairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When autocracy was established, only Moscow sovereigns appointed regimental governors.  The army was divided into 5 regiments, led by one or more commanders.  The head was considered the head of a large regiment.  The governors were helped by the clerks who performed the census and carried out monetary calculations.  After the outbreak of hostilities, it was necessary to check all the military people on the lists, as well as draw up new ones for the correct payment of a salary.  The rank of military governor was abolished under Peter the Great, only civilians were left. </p><h2>  Concept transformation </h2>

    <p>  In the 16th century, a small reform took place.  Local governors began to be called annual, as they were appointed for a year, subsequently - city.  In the 17th century there was a general introduction of this post.  In the Time of Troubles, there was a need for military power for each city, as well as a connecting governing body for Moscow and the provinces, which would have power over all social classes.  Usually not one governor was sent, but several (second and third governors), clerks and clerk.  The governor had at his disposal most of the branches of local government.  Their duties included the recruitment of troops, the salary of money or bread, the capture of thieves and robbers, runaways.  They had to take measures to protect themselves from fires, epidemics, track forbidden games and circuses, eradicate schism, monitor the clergy and parishioners visiting the church.  The voivode is, among other things, a judge.  He decided civil matters to 100, and subsequently to 500 rubles.  Those of them over whom the governors did not have power were sent to Moscow.  Most often, the <span>death penalty</span> was not part of their authority, but some were granted this right.  Provincial service was very profitable, "self-serving."  This explained its short duration: the service lasted a year, two, sometimes three. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The abolition of the governor </h2><p>  In 1775, the post of governor was abolished.  The voivode offices, which had been with them since the reign of Peter, were closed.  However, in Poland this post existed until the end of the 18th century. </p><h2>  Voivode Mikhail Ivanovich Vorotynsky <strong></strong></h2><p>  Since 1543, Vorotynsky was appointed governor of the city of Belev.  He distinguished himself during the attack of Sahib-Giray, the Crimean Khan.  It happened in 1541.  The battle took place at the Oka border.  All attempts to cross the opposite shore were futile, as it was well guarded by Russian troops.  Sagib Giray nevertheless decided to try to break through with the help of the approaching Turkish artillery.  The Tatars opened cannon fire and began to cross the river, but they were stopped by the Russian regiments, which arrived a little later, and the Crimean khan was forced to stop the offensive.  Sagib-Giray changed the direction of the strike and moved troops to Pronsk.  The assault began on August 3.  The city was subjected to shelling, but managed to defend it.  The next day, the khan moved to the steppe.  He was chased by Mikhail Vorotynsky with his brothers Vladimir and Alexander.  The result of their campaign was 45 captured languages ‚Äã‚Äã- scouts sent to Moscow.  In 1551, Mikhail Ivanovich received the rank of "royal servant", and the next year he would play a huge role in the conquest of the <span>Kazan Khanate.</span>  In May 1566, Ivan the Terrible granted Vorotinsky the rank of boyar. </p><h2>  Pretiƒá </h2><p>  Another well-known Old Russian representative of this post is Voivode Pretiƒá.  He stood at the head of a squad that assisted <span>Princess Olga</span> during the siege of Kiev in 968.  It was Pretich who made peace with the Pecheneg Khan. </p>

    <p>  In conclusion, it is worth summing up all that has been said.  So, the voivode is the chief, ruler of the Slavic peoples.  History has known many wise and selfless representatives of this post.  The very word "governor", whose synonym is "ruler", is associated with something imperious and courageous.  Subsequently, this post was abolished, and today we can talk about this concept only in a historical aspect. </p>
