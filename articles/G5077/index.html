    <p>  Hotel Panorama Village is located in a small but very colorful fishing village called Agia Pelagia.  By the way, it was erected on a hillside, and therefore from almost anywhere there is a breathtaking panorama of the bay and the sea.  Just 18 km away is the lively island capital of Heraklion.  All planes fly here, so the road to the hotel does not take much time: just a few minutes in a comfortable transfer - and you can enjoy the comfort of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is a complex of several three-story buildings.  There is also a fairly spacious area that resembles a beautiful, blooming garden - you can admire the bright colors of nature, relax in the shade of cypress trees, relax and sunbathe on the terraces.  By the way, the hotel was opened in 1984 - it has been hosting tourists from all over the world for decades.  In 2007, a complete reconstruction was carried out here. </p><h2>  Room conditions: photos and additional information </h2>

You can take a shower at any convenient time.  Guests are provided with personal hygiene products, as well as clean towels (they change almost every day) and a hair dryer (not too powerful, but enough for drying).

    <p>  Of course, visitors to the island are primarily interested in beach vacations.  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that this is the 2nd line - you will need to go to the beach for 5-10 minutes.
