    <h2>  What is SNILS and why is it needed </h2><p>  Since the beginning of the 2000s, or rather, since 2002, Russia adopted the system of <span>compulsory pension insurance.</span>  Now every employer is forced to pay special insurance premiums for employees.  They will become in the future the basis of the insurance part of a person‚Äôs pension.  In order for an employee to accumulate an insurance pension, he is required to register with the current system of social insurance.  At this moment, he is assigned a special number - SNILS.  The identifier is assigned once and does not change until the end of life. </p><p>  The document looks like a small light green card made of plastic.  It contains all the necessary information: </p><ul><li>  identifier itself (individual insurance number); </li><li>  surname, name and patronymic of the owner; </li><li>  floor; </li><li>  place and date of birth; </li><li>  information about when a person was registered in the system. </li></ul><p>  Even those who are not officially employed or do not work at all can get such ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  Neither age, nor the fact of employment, nor the presence or absence of citizenship can become an obstacle.  So how to get SNILS in Moscow, Rostov, Perm or other cities? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where and how to get snls" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1877021.jpg" width="500"></div>

With its help, getting benefits, various compensations and social payments is much easier.  Without this document, it is impossible to obtain a birth certificate or draw up maternity capital.  To obtain public services on the Single Portal, you will also need this number.  As you can see, the question of how to get SNILS (in Moscow or other cities) is quite relevant.  Let's get it right. </p><p>  There is nothing complicated in getting a document.  If you are officially employed, you won‚Äôt need to do anything at all.  In this case, registering you with the OPS system is the responsibility of the employer. </p><p>  If you do not have official work, you will have to tackle the issue yourself.  Here, all roads lead to the local branch of the <span>Pension Fund.</span>  There you will be answered all the questions regarding the formation of the pension, the rules for the transfer of contributions will be explained.  The procedure is simple and does not take much time. </p><h2>  We make SNILS in the RF PF </h2><p>  So how to get SNILS?  In Moscow, you are in another locality - it doesn‚Äôt matter.  The procedure is the same everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get snls through public services" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1877022.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To obtain a document you only need a passport.  Sometimes it happens that SNILS needs to be issued urgently, but you do not have a mandatory civil document.  For example, a passport is lost, damaged, handed over for re-registration or is unavailable for other reasons.  In this case, you can replace it with any other document confirming your identity.  These are quite suitable: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  sailor's passport; </li><li>  certificate of release from MLS; </li><li>  military ID; </li><li>  provisional identity card; </li><li>  international passport; </li><li>  other documents. </li></ul><p>  If you decide to issue SNILS for a young child, you will need a birth certificate.  Foreigners and stateless persons will also need a document confirming the legality of their stay in the country. </p><p>  The only document that you will need, in addition to a passport or a document replacing it, is a small questionnaire.  The form will be issued on the spot.  It‚Äôs easy to fill out the form, you need to enter the following data in block letters: </p><ul><li>  name, patronymic, last name; </li><li>  floor; </li><li>  date, month and year of birth; </li><li>  address of your registration and place of residence (if they do not match); </li><li>  passport details; </li><li>  contact telephone number. </li></ul><p>  It is also necessary to indicate the date of filling out the form and put a signature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get snls on public services" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1877023.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  SNILS in MFC </h2><p>  And how else can I get SNILS?  In Moscow and many other cities of Russia, there are special multifunctional centers that are intermediaries in certain issues.  If the MFC is located near your home, which has an agreement on cooperation with the Pension Fund, you can apply for SNILS registration there.  True, only citizens of Russia can take advantage of this advantage.  Foreigners and those who do not have citizenship are not given this opportunity. </p><p>  For registration of SNILS in the MFC it will also be sufficient to fill out a questionnaire and attach an identity document.  The employees of the center will check the information and transfer the papers to the Pension Fund.  After three weeks, the employees of the RF PF will decide on assigning you a retirement insurance number. </p><h2>  How to get an insurance card online </h2><p>  Today, the vast majority of citizens have mastered the computer so much and are used to using the Internet that they often solve many bureaucratic issues without looking up from the monitor.  Online processing of various kinds of documents has long become the norm and is not surprising.  Therefore, many will be interested in the question of how to get SNILS through State services or any other similar service.  You see, this is very convenient: I went to the site, registered, pressed a couple of buttons and the document was already in my pocket. </p><p>  But not so simple.  In such a way, as in State services, it is simply impossible to get SNILS.  On the site gosuslugi.ru you can only download the application form and fill it out at home.  This is due to the fact that information about the personal accounts of insured persons is strictly confidential.  And on the Web, unfortunately, the likelihood of uncontrolled use of personal data of citizens is too high.  Although officials promise that soon the service will be available online. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get lost snls" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1877024.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  What to do in case of loss </h2><p>  Another important question that interests citizens: how to get the lost SNILS and is it worth it to change the document if you have changed any personal data? </p><p>  Everything here is also extremely simple.  In case of <span>loss of a document, you</span> should visit the personnel department or accounting department of your company and write a statement.  Further, everything will happen without your participation.  The employer will independently notify the <span>Pension Fund</span> about the problem <span>,</span> and you will be given a duplicate of SNILS. </p><p>  You can apply to the RF PF yourself.  Just write a statement, and after 30 days, pick up the document. </p><p>  If you have changed any data entered in SNILS, or found an error, you will have to change the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  The procedure is similar to receiving a new document and also takes no more than a month. </p><p>  Please note that in the new document only your personal data will change, but the certificate number will remain unchanged.  Despite the fact that the ILS ceases to exist at the time of the death of the owner, the insurance number from the database is still not deleted.  So the existence of two people with the same numbers is simply excluded. </p><p>  Now you know where and how to get SNILS, and you can easily do it. </p>
