    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  On the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba is such a wonderful city as Eilat.  He is very loved not only by tourists who adore the Red Sea, but also by connoisseurs of culture.  After all, Eilat is a very ancient city that existed as far back as 900 BC.  And this is where the Magic Sunrise Club 4 * is located. </p><p>  This hotel complex was built in 2000.  12 years after the opening of the hotel, a restoration was carried out.  There were no major repairs.  Everything is already quite new and modern.  But they regularly carry out cosmetic repairs. </p><p>  The beach from the hotel can be reached in just 10 minutes.  Although this is not close proximity to the sea, but there are all sorts of interesting sights nearby.  For 3 minutes, for example, you can get to the Eilat Promenade, for 6-7 - to the Dolphin Reef. </p><p>  And another undoubted advantage of this hotel is that to the airport here - just a stone's throw.  Drive 5-7 minutes.  Of course, some consider this a minus - many people have to get used to the noise of taking off and landing planes for some time.  But, however, the apartments here have good sound insulation, because nothing will disturb the guests' relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Magic Sunrise Club 4 * has absolutely everything that is necessary for the comfort of guests, from free high-speed Internet to private parking.  Naturally, there is a 24-hour reception, currency exchange, and a tour desk.  There is also a room where guests can leave their luggage.  Ticket service is also available. </p><p>  The hotel also has such basic services as a laundry with dry cleaning, an office with fax and photocopying services, as well as a good conference room with all the necessary equipment for meetings and other events. </p><p>  But of course that's not all.  On the territory there are several shops, its own church and a beauty salon with a hairdresser. </p><p>  Guests can book a non-smoking room or family apartment, take advantage of the delivery of drinks and food, or, if there is such a specific need, ask for amenities for people with disabilities. </p><p>  By the way, talking about the services, it is impossible not to mention with special attention the staff working here.  The fact is that the hotel staff speaks not only Hebrew, but also English, German, Arabic and Russian.  The latter fact is especially pleasing. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  Magic Sunrise Club 4 * reviews receive mostly positive.  Which is not surprising.  Many guests claim that this is not a hotel, but a real separate resort.  After all, the complex is located on 80 acres of land, with green spaces and dense grass. </p><p>  People who came with children say that upon arrival, each baby is given unusual passports.  There is detailed information on the activities carried out by local circles.  And in each of them, where the child went, a stamp is put in the passport.  All children who collected 10 seals receive gifts. </p><p>  And many guests enthusiastically talk about the local small Luna Park.  Children's railway, an inflatable trampoline, electric cars, carousels - all this can brighten up your leisure time. </p><p>  In general, if we make a general conclusion, we can confidently say: this is a good, but not cheap hotel, aimed at people with children, as well as offering excellent service and amazingly delicious dishes.  Many reviews have confirmed this, but if you want to make sure, then you should go here on vacation. </p>
