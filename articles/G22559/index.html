    <p>  As the processor installed chip Spreadtrum model SC7715.  It should be noted that this is a budget solution.  And if so, obviously you will not have to expect sky-high performance from the device.  But users who are considering a smartphone Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 Neo, reviews of which have probably already read, as an option for purchase, would have guessed this themselves.  The maximum frequency to which the processor can overclock is 1.2 MHz.  In principle, this is a lot, but you will not be full of one chipset, as they say.  The processor has two cores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Graphics Accelerator </h2>

    <p>  Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 Neo G318H, reviews of which highlight both the negative and positive sides of the device, is equipped with a set of all necessary communication standards.  We are talking about Wi-Fi support (works in the b, g, n bands).  There is a Bluetooth module version 4.0.  Navigation in space is carried out due to GPS technology.  The phone works with third-generation networks.  Of course, there is no LTE technology. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2>

    <p>  Fans of ‚Äúselfie‚Äù shots can pass by the model, because the ‚Äúfront‚Äù of the Samsung <span>SM G318H</span> Galaxy Ace 4 Neo, which continues to be discussed among users, is absent.  The main camera is located on the back side, it is supplemented by a flash of LED type.  Nevertheless, its resolution is only 3 megapixels.  It would be naive to expect good shots from such a device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory cards </h2><p>  The user can expand the storage capacity of their data using external microSD standard drives.  Supported memory cards up to 32 gigabytes.  The device does not accept more. </p><h2>  Embedded devices </h2><p>  A speaker, microphone, and sensors are integrated into the design of the device.  The latter are represented mainly by a gyroscope and accelerometer.  The Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 Lite mobile phone is unlikely to surprise anyone with the stereo sound of melodies. </p><h2>  Ports </h2><p>  You can connect a wired stereo headset to the device.  For this, a 3.5 mm standard jack is used.  To recharge the device, as well as to synchronize it with a personal computer, a MicroUSB port is provided. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery capacity of the phone is 1500 mAh.  Not so much.  Most likely, it will be enough only for 6-8 hours of battery life with careful handling. </p><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  The device in the salons of cellular communication arrives in cardboard packaging.  She, so to speak, is disguised as wood.  The dimensions of the package in all three planes are 75 by 135 by 50 millimeters.  At the same time, its mass does not exceed 254 grams.  The sizes are not much different from similar packages, this is a fact.  The standard dimensions for the boxes that sell devices with a screen diagonal of 4 inches. </p><p>  Above you can see the image of the subject of our today's review.  Nearby is an icon that tells us that the device is equipped with the function of working with two SIM cards.  The side lists brief specifications of the smartphone.  They indicate data on the display, its diagonal and matrix manufacturing technology. </p><p>  It is told about which networks are supported, what is the hardware, including the processor, RAM and camera.  Below you can find a text footnote that talks about the method of manufacturing the package.  From there, we can find out not very interesting information that the box consists of recycled paper.  When printing images, special (seemingly environmentally friendly) soy ink was used.  In general, the box will go for recycling after its use.  Everything is very, very boring, information, rather, for those who care about the environment. </p><p>  Immediately, on the side, only a little to the side, you can find a sticker on which the device‚Äôs barcode is applied.  In general, the packaging, of course, has a good style compared to similar items from other manufacturers.  And no matter how boring it is to read all this about environmental protection, we still have to appreciate the fact that the South Korean manufacturer pays attention to this and cares about the environment. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 Neo smartphone comes with the device itself, a network adapter, a cable for synchronization and charging, a brief user guide, and documents for warranty repairs.  In general, the required minimum for each novice (and not only) user.  A wired stereo headset is not included, which may upset some buyers.  By the way, the charger is represented by a network adapter.  A microUSB cable can only be used for charging from a laptop or personal computer. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device is classic.  This is the same rectangular smartphone that has rounded edges.  Classics of the genre, and more.  Well, for the better or for the worse, it is up to the user to understand, since the tastes of each are individual. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The smartphone in all three planes has the following dimensions: height is 121.4, width is 62.9, and thickness is 10.7 millimeters.  At the same time, the mass of the device does not exceed the mark of 123 grams.  On both sides of the device is covered with a special protective film.  In this way, the South Korean manufacturer took care of its customers.  The film ensures the safety of the appearance of the smartphone until it is removed. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  The front part is equipped with a touch screen, the diagonal of which is four inches.  A silver edging is laid around the perimeter.  On top there is an insert made of metal.  She picks up the speaker.  At the same time, this is an additional protection and decoration element.  Below, under the screen, we can find the buttons.  One of them is metal, the other two are sensory. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  There is a connector in which a 3.5 mm standard wired stereo headset is connected.  We won‚Äôt find anything else. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here is the port for connecting the MicroUSB cable.  With its help, the device is synchronized with a personal computer. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  She distinguished by the presence of a lock button and power management.  A little higher than it there is a special recess.  It is needed in order to quickly remove the back cover. </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  On the opposite side is the volume rocker.  Here is the location of the device controls. </p><h2>  Review of smartphone Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 Neo </h2><p>  It's time to take stock.  What can customers who have purchased this device say? </p><p>  In positive qualities, you can record a good build quality, which distinguishes the creations of a South Korean manufacturer.  Good for such a price and design.  It can be said stylish.  Well, and, of course, the function of supporting the work of two SIM cards. </p><p>  An obvious drawback of the device is the low battery capacity.  The device discharges very, very quickly, especially with active use.  Another disadvantage is the lack of a front camera, and we are generally silent about the quality of the main one.  Perhaps these moments can be highlighted in the review of this phone model. </p>
