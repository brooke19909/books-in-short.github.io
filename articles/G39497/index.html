    <p>  The bank is a harsh instance, they won‚Äôt enter your position, they won‚Äôt believe in a gray salary, so you really need to be aware of your capabilities.  When choosing where it is more profitable to take a mortgage, pay attention to the fact that a loan consists of several indicators.  This is the amount of the down payment that you are ready to pay immediately.  Annual <span>interest rate,</span> type of payment: annuity or differentiated, additional contributions.  The latter include different types of insurance.  Some banks require insuring the title of property, life or the real estate itself.  All these indicators in total show the size of your overpayment.  You, in turn, can influence them.  For example, the higher the down payment, the lower the interest rate.  The loan amount depends on the total salary in your family, the number of dependents, a good credit history, and even on the entries in the work book.  Although a <span>mortgage loan to</span> young people can be issued on more favorable terms. </p><p>  <strong>What if...</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage loan to young" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/114831.jpg" width="400"></div>
