    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is characterized by the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  here, unlike most other hotels, cots are paid; </li><li>  breakfasts are very scarce, and the food is the most ordinary; </li><li>  despite the fact that the room has a minibar, it does not even have drinking water; </li><li>  interruptions in the supply of hot water; </li><li>  maids do not react in any way to the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign and burst into the room with cleaning; </li><li>  very few rooms with balconies; </li><li>  dirty carpet. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel "Olympus" is a rather attractive accommodation option in the city of Kazan.  Despite the fact that it is somewhat remote from the central part of the city, there is a fairly good traffic intersection, and therefore it will not be difficult for you to get to any point you need.  In addition, this institution is located near the airport. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel building is designed in a modern architectural style.  The interior is closer to classical conciseness.  This applies to both rooms and other rooms.  The apartments are freshly renovated and new furniture.  The atmosphere of homeliness is created by modern amenities. </p><p>  As for the restaurant, opinions about it are rather mixed.  If you want to try the dish from the menu, you will be pleasantly surprised by the ratio of high quality and reasonable price.  Tatar cuisine deserves special attention.  If we talk about breakfast, then they are a big disappointment.  Not only is the choice of dishes very scarce, but also the amount of food is incredibly small, but because all the guests are simply not enough.  That is why tourists do not recommend paying for breakfast (it is better to go to neighboring cafes or restaurants, where for a little money you can eat tasty and satisfying). </p>
