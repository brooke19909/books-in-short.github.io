    <h2>  Laykina glory </h2><p>  The animal immediately became famous and popular on the whole planet, the fame of Laika could be envied by the most famous artists, jazz musicians, rock and roll stars and athletes, not to mention politicians.  The only circumstance that overshadowed the joy of the next scientific and technological achievement of the space age was the death of the dog.  After a six-month stay in orbit, having made two and a half thousand revolutions around the <span>planet, the satellite</span> burned out in the atmosphere.  What to do, progress entails not only the glory of pioneers, it requires sacrifice. </p><p>  When asked about which breed of dog was put into orbit, no one could give a clear answer.  Laika was a "noblewoman", in other words, a simple mutt.  Why did this happen, it turned out later. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first dog in space" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/320709.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Pre-Flight Events </h2><p>  Studies of the influence of various factors accompanying the presence of living beings in near-Earth outer space have been conducted since 1951.  Desik and Gypsy became pioneers among earthlings, they had to climb to the stratospheric height (100 km) in an inhabited capsule, but their space flight could not be called, although the rocket that lifted them was the same, R-7, to which they sent into space other astronauts.  They did not enter orbit, but it was intended.  But from their suborbital “leap”, Desik and Gypsy returned safely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first dog in space like" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/320711.jpg" width="269"></div></h2><h2>  Belka and Strelka </h2><p>  After a series of such launches, it was the turn of space flights.  The first dog in space, Laika, perished, but the following problem was already being solved by Soviet scientists.  It was necessary to increase the mass of the payload and ensure its return to Earth. </p><p>  Weight doubled, as well as the number of "passengers".  Squirrel and Strelka, so they were called, and they also turned out to be mutts.  Jacqueline Kennedy, receiving from N.S.  Khrushchev’s unusual gift, she didn’t even ask which dog the breed was put into orbit this time.  The puppy's mother was the legendary Strelka, who had been in space, and this fact made the present priceless. </p>

    <h2>  Nigella and Asterisk </h2><p>  Having come close to solving the problem of launching the first astronaut, scientists put his “model” into the descent ship, that is, a mannequin equipped with numerous sensors.  The company "Ivan Ivanovich" (as he was nicknamed in Baikonur) was made up of the four-legged best friend of man.  Less than a month before Gagarin’s flight, this “couple” flew into space and returned safely.  Again, it was not reported what kind of dog was put into orbit, only her nickname, Chernushka, became public.  Soon, to be sure of success, this experiment was repeated.  The asterisk confirmed by means available to her that she was all right. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first dog in space" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/320715.jpg" width="386"></div></h2><h2>  So why are they all mutts? </h2><p>  Now it is the turn of people to storm the cosmos.  And it was time to clarify which breed of dog was put into orbit for the first and subsequent times, and why. </p><p>  The answer was surprisingly simple.  When choosing a “passenger”, space engineers were guided by such qualities as excellent health, stress resistance, quick wits and a good, friendly character.  By the way, pilots were also recruited into the cosmonaut corps for approximately the same basic criteria. </p><p>  There were also age restrictions (up to 6 years).  Weight should not exceed 6 kg.  And the color was preferable to light, it is possible with spots, so that the face of the animal (and even its expression) was clearly visible on the television screen. </p><p>  After a long careful selection and training, the first dog was selected.  Laika visited space, she successfully passed all the tests, showing the best results. </p>
