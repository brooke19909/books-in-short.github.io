    <h2>  Versatility and diversity </h2><p>  Skirts-sun is a special niche among skirts in general.  These are not only models for little girls or schoolgirls.  Sun skirts may be appropriate for different ages and occasions.  The pages of modern glossy magazines show models in skirts-sun and tight-fitting top.  For evening outings it will be profitable and interesting to look at a floor skirt made of satin or chiffon.  Light and <span>short sun skirts are</span> relevant in the warm season and in resorts, and a skirt made of thick fabric to the knee will look beneficial on the office lady.  And, of course, the cut of the sun skirt for wedding dresses with several layers of flying light fabrics has already become classic.  Appearance depends on how to cut and sew a skirt-sun. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also derivative options for <span>cutting a skirt-sun.</span>  The finished product will differ in the number of seams, folds and, accordingly, the amount of material used.  In the same ways, half-sun skirts, double and quarter-skirts are hidden. </p><p>  Each owner of a skirt with open the sun, feels easy, fresh and feminine in it.  And everyone who has ever sewed it himself knows how to cut a sun skirt quickly and easily.  You will need a tape measure or centimeter, scissors (ideally tailor's) and chalk, soap or a pencil for fabric. </p><h2>  Choose fabric for the "sun" </h2><p>  Before you open the skirt for the sun girl, you must select the appropriate fabric.  For the warmer months, lightweight, breathable fabrics will be more appropriate and convenient.  An ideal option would be chiffon, satin, linen, chintz, batiste or jeans.  Cotton fabrics will be pleasant for a day's walk, and in a silk skirt-sun you will be the queen of a summer evening. </p><p>  For winter, warm dense fabrics are traditional, such as wool, velvet, knitwear, boucle, jacquard and tapestry. </p><p>  For costume parties, children's parties or carnivals, you can decorate the sun skirt with flounces, sequins, lace or embroidery.  You can <span>sew a skirt</span> of several layers of chiffon or thick heavy silk.  The main thing - before you open the sun-skirt, to think through the design of the future product in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Nuances when choosing a fabric </h2><p>  A sun skirt has several nuances that you need to know before cutting and stitching a sun skirt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not give preference to plastic fabrics that are easily stretched, even if they are put on the palm of your hand.  The finished product will also quickly lose its shape stretching down.  If you still decide to stay on such a fabric, then a skirt is best done with a lining.  Without a liner, such a skirt will ‚Äústick‚Äù and emphasize flaws. </p><p>  For easily stretching fabrics it is necessary to make an allowance in width of about 5 centimeters. </p><p>  If you decide to stay on a satin fabric of a dark saturated color, you must take into account the change in shade along the entire length of the rolled segment.  This will be most noticeable in the black satin.  When connecting the side seams, the satin will shine differently from different sides.  To avoid this effect, it is recommended to do the pattern not along the lobar, but along the longitudinal direction of the thread.  This tip is relevant only for a skirt-sun and half-sun.  Direct models exclude such an effect.  Our finished product has several nuances that you need to know before cutting and stitching a sun skirt. </p>

    <h2>  Striped "sun" </h2><p>  Do not give preference to fabrics with stripes or in a cage if you are new to sewing.  Only experienced seamstresses and tailors can sew a striped sun skirt so that it would not be embarrassing to put it on light later. </p><p>  On one side of the seam, the pattern will turn out horizontally, and the other vertically.  To fix this, you can flip the seams.  Remove the side, and make the main front and rear.  You can also cut the fabric not from the corner, but in the shared direction.  Then it will be appropriate to make the seams in front and behind.  The stripes will converge, visually forming a pattern with an angle of 90 degrees. </p><p>  If you want to sew a sun-skirt from checkered fabric, be prepared for the fact that much more material will be needed to combine the pattern.  The additional expense will be easy to calculate, knowing the height of the pattern repeat.  The larger the cell or its pattern, the greater the expense.  Add the height of the cell to each side of the pattern.  Before you open a skirt-sun for a girl, try to attach square or striped patterns to each other.  Estimate how to connect them most advantageously. </p><h2>  Necessary calculations </h2><p>  Correctly cut the skirt-sun will help correctly taken measurements.  If you do not have a centimeter, you can take measurements with the help of threads.  Do not use hard roulette.  Measurements will not be accurate and the product will be damaged. </p><p>  First you need to determine two sizes.  This is the size of the hip circumference of the one for whom the skirt will be sewn, and the length of the product.  After taking the measurements, record the hip circumference as Oh <sub>b</sub> <sub> </sub>  and length as D <sub>Yu</sub> .  For example,  <sub></sub> = 90 cm, and  <sub></sub> = 95. After that, you need to determine the radius of the waist circumference R1.  We calculate it by the formula: </p><ul><li>  (0 <sub>b</sub> + 5) / 2n, where n is a constant equal to 3.14 </li></ul><p>  Waist radius for example = (90 + 5) /6.24=15.22 cm </p><p>  After we determine the radius of the lower part R2 of the skirt according to the formula: </p><ul><li>  R1 + D <sub>and</sub> </li></ul><p>  Hem radius for example = 15.22 + 95 = 110.22 cm </p><p>  You can use paper to create a pattern, but experienced seamstresses can do without it.  If this is one of your first creations or you are not confident in your abilities, make a pattern on paper, cut out all the details, sew together and try on.  Instead of paper, you can use oilcloth. </p>

    <h2>  Getting to the pattern </h2><p>  So how to cut a sun skirt: </p><ul><li>  Fold the material in half and begin to draw radii on it.  Folding the fabric in half, mark a point on the fold line in the middle of the length.  From it we draw a radius of a waist.  To draw a radius, measure line segments of length R1 from the starting point and put points on their end.  Then just connect them together.  The resulting semicircle will be the radius R1. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Similarly, draw the radius of the bottom of R2.  Check the accuracy of the measurements by measuring the distance from the first radius to the second.  It should be equal to the intended length of your skirt.  Above the upper radius, leave a seam allowance of 0.5-1 cm, and under the lower radius 0.5 cm. The smaller the allowance from the bottom, the more accurate and effective the hem will be. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  For a more even distribution of waves (fold), change the radius of the waist, bringing its center closer to the starting point by 1.5-2 cm (you can skip this step).  You can cut your pattern. </li><li>  After you open the sun-skirt, you need to transfer the patterns to the fabric.  If there is no large table, you can sit right on the floor.  It is important that when you transfer the pattern to the fabric, it was motionless. </li><li>  If you want your future skirt to have only one seam, fold the fabric for cutting two more times.  You will get four layers, which later you will connect with one seam.  The only drawback of such a product is the high consumption of fabric. </li><li>  For a more even distribution of waves (fold), change the radius of the waist, bringing its center closer to the starting point by 1.5-2 cm (you can skip this step). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Half skirt </h2><p>  The process of how to cut a sun skirt and a half sun differs in the number of patterns and the <span>consumption of fabric.</span>  For a half-sun skirt, more parts are needed, respectively, the number of seams will be more. </p><p>  The algorithm of actions is exactly the same, with the exception of the first paragraph.  The fabric is not folded in half, but cut in one piece. </p><p>  To save material, some novice seamstresses make a small but annoying mistake.  Two patterns must be placed on the fabric so that the left and right seams of both are located on the longitudinal and lobular sections, respectively.  If you arrange the patterns in such a way that the left seam of one will be with a longitudinal section, and the other with a longitudinal section, then in the future this will badly affect the product.  Such joints will look sloppy, seams will be noticeable, bumps will appear. </p><h2>  How to cut a skirt-sun on an elastic band </h2><p>  The top of the skirts and the sun and the sun can be varied.  Someone uses a stitched belt, someone not.  You can tie a beautiful ribbon or belt over it.  Gum is inserted into the lung tissue.  A skirt with a belt on an elastic band will favorably emphasize the figure of its owner. </p><p>  The belt on an elastic band is cut entirely, preferably the direction along a <span>shared thread.</span>  Elastic band can be inserted not on the entire length of the skirt, but in several places.  In such a skirt it will be comfortable to sit for a long time.  Such styles are relevant for obese women. </p><p>  Make a pattern of the future belt.  Determine the width according to the chosen style, it can be different.  Remember to leave allowances around the edges. </p><p>  After processing the edges of the skirt, it is necessary to fasten the belt on it.  Pin it on the skirt so that the front side of the belt is 1 centimeter below the top edge of the skirt.  Sew in a way convenient for you. </p><p>  There is nothing simpler than cutting out <span>a sun skirt with an elastic band.</span>  It will look stylish and relevant, but it will take a little time, effort and money. </p>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  What is the best way to sew a sun skirt with an elastic band: </p><ul><li>  If you want a very fluffy skirt with a lot of folds at the waist, draw a larger radius when patterning.  Be sure to align all folds before flashing.  For dense and heavy fabrics, wide folds look more advantageous. </li><li>  Before sewing natural fabrics, in order to avoid deformation of the product, it is recommended to wash and iron. </li><li>  Choose the right patterns on the fabric that will not enlarge the figure.  A skirt-sun on an elastic band visually gives volume to the hips. </li><li>  If the bottom of the skirt turns out to be uneven, ask someone to help you.  Put on a skirt and start turning slowly in it in a circle, the second person can hold any flat part and draw a new edge on the product, with chalk, for example. </li></ul><p>  Today we have examined in detail how to properly open a skirt-sun and avoid common mistakes.  Good luck  Sew with pleasure! </p>
