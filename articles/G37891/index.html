For example, such as Kabardinka.  When, in 1836, the Russian government built a military fort here to pacify the local population during the war in the North Caucasus, no one even knew that this village would have such a prosperous future.  And all because of the unique microclimate, which contributes to a healthy and beach holiday.  The fort was named after the Kabardian regiment, which was stationed here.  Today <span>it is an</span> urban-type <span>village</span> in which there is a developed resort infrastructure. </p><p>  Where to stay in Kabardinka?  The offer of housing is simply huge.  Firstly, sanatoriums.  They can not only relax on the Black Sea, but also improve their health.  Indeed, near the Kabardinka the healing water sources Belotsvetnaya and Gelendzhik were discovered, and Taman mud is used for balneological treatment.  There are luxury hotels in the resort, for example, "Nadezhda Morskoy Rai SPA".  And of course, as in the Russian south without the good old private sector.  The middle ground between an expensive hotel and a cheap shed or a room with the owners is a guest house.  We will talk about one such thing in our article.  It is called the Achilles Palace (Kabardinka). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Achilles Palace Kabardinka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156714.jpg"></div>

To get to Kabardinka from the air harbor, you need to take buses No. 5 or 6 to the Rynok stop.  Between Gelendzhik and the village is only 13 kilometers.  Regular buses go to Kabardinka from the city.  If you get to the "south" by rail, then the station closest to the resort is in Novorossiysk.  In this case, you need to get to the bus station by trolley.  The distance between Novorossiysk and Kabardinka is about 25 kilometers.  They are overcome by a regular bus in forty minutes.  How to find the Achilles Palace Guest House in Kabardinka?  You should move along the large street of the World (one of the main transport arteries of the village), then turn onto Apricot.  On it you need to find the cafe "Byzantium".  The next turn after it is called Kabardinsky Lane.  The third number in this quiet street is the Achilles Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest house achilles palace kabardinka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156719.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The territory of the guest house </h2><p>  A small private hotel is a four-story mansion.  It is relatively new (was built in 2013).  At the entrance there is free parking for guests of the Achilles Palace (Kabardinka).  Security of residents is provided by a round-the-clock video surveillance system.  The territory of the guest house itself is small under urban conditions.  Between the gate and the porch there is a small space where tables are installed, so that residents have a place to smoke.  There are several flower beds and a barbecue.  The steps lead up to the beautiful lobby, where there is a reception and a seating area with a TV, a white leather sofa and a wrought-iron table.  There is also a shared kitchen on the ground floor.  The space between the back wall of the house and the fence of the neighboring plot is somewhat wider.  There is a heated swimming pool and a sun terrace with sun loungers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay in Kabardinka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156717.jpg"></div>

Most hotel rooms are standard with a balcony.  They are designed for two, three or four people.  There are also economy rooms without a balcony.  In the improved <span>rooms, the bedroom is</span> more spacious.  It goes on both sides of the building and, accordingly, has two balconies.  The best room at Achilles Palace is a two-room suite.  In addition to the bedroom, it also has a living room.  In this last room there is a folding sofa.  Therefore, the suite can serve as housing for both a couple and a family of four.  But whatever the category of the rooms, they all have their own bathrooms with shower.  And all rooms for guests are equipped with new comfortable furniture, air conditioning, which cools the room well, and a flat-screen TV.  They clean the rooms every day, and linen is changed every five days.  In the reviews, guests report that on each floor there is an iron and ironing board. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest House Achilles Palace Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156721.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Unlike a hotel where only a faceless night's accommodation is available to tourists, the Achilles Palace Guest House (Kabardinka) provides guests with a shared kitchen.  It is equipped with the necessary set of dishes and utensils.  In the spacious room, which is both a kitchen and a dining room, there are several refrigerators and lockers so that guests can store food there.  Vacationers in their reviews assure that you do not need to stand in line for a free burner or pan.  The kitchen has two gas stoves with ovens, and also a microwave.  Those who do not want to spend time on vacation cooking and washing dishes can eat in one of the cafes, the nearest of which, Byzantium, is only 70 meters from the guest house.  For those who like to cook, let us know that next to the mini-hotel there are several grocery stores, including those working around the clock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Achilles palace kabardinka reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156715.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, pool </h2><p>  From "Achilles Palace" (Kabardinka) to the promenade, walk about ten minutes in unhurried steps.  The guest house is located close to such attractions of the resort as the ‚ÄúInverted Building‚Äù in the Old Park.  All <span>beaches in</span> Kabardinka are free.  They are composed of small pebbles and well-equipped, with many water activities.  However, vacationers say that in high season on the central beach of the resort is too crowded.  As an alternative to too cold or stormy sea, you can consider the pool, which is located in the guest house.  Its dimensions are not very impressive - 3 by 11 meters.  But it is always at a comfortable temperature, since it is heated.  Water in it passes a modern purification system.  The fence around the pool is pasted with murals that create the illusion of relaxation on a tropical island.  Nearby there are several sun loungers. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  "Achilles Palace" (Kabardinka) in the reviews is characterized as a great place to relax.  A shuttle service from the airport or train station is available for a fee.  There is free parking under video surveillance.  Barbecue areas with barbecue facilities are available in the courtyard.  Tourists in reviews are pleased to note that fast and free Wi-Fi is available throughout the guest house.  An iron is available on the floor, and a washing machine is available for a fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Kabardinka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2156722.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Weather in Kabardinka </h2><p>  As for the prices of rooms in the guest house, they are very dependent on the season.  When do you need to go to Kabardinka?  The peak of the season is traditionally July and August.  Prices then double.  But due to the fact that the resort is located in a wide valley at the foot of the Markotkh Range and under the protection of the mountains, it has a unique climate.  The weather in Kabardinka is mostly clear, sunny and calm.  And therefore, the beach season here lasts longer than in other places of the Krasnodar Territory - from April to November.  A guest house "Achilles Palace" takes vacationers year-round. </p>
