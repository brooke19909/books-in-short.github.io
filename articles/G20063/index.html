Direct flight Perm-Simferopol</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Little has changed in the life of Permians, who annually go on vacation to the Crimea.  A direct train with Perm-Simferopol service makes life easier for residents of the entire Urals who make transplants to Perm and then travel in comfort.  However, there are alternative travel options. </p><h2>  Why exactly Simferopol? </h2><p>  Simferopol is a city located on the territory of Crimea and has a rich past.  According to historians, the predecessor of the settlement was Naples-Scythian, which was erected in the III century BC and destroyed about 600 years later.  His remains can still be found while walking along the left bank of Salgir. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is here that you can ride along the world's longest trolleybus line, which connects Simferopol, Alushta and Yalta.  The Perm-Simferopol train is one of the few that is passed by the Ukrainian security forces during a difficult period for Russia and Ukraine.  Rail and road transport, according to residents of the Crimea, is now one of the safest ways to get to the peninsula. </p><h2>  Is it far to Simferopol? </h2><p>  There is one thing that interests everyone who plans a trip along the Perm-Simferopol route - distance.  It may vary and depend on how the traveler will get to the Crimea.  If you are going to go there by car, the distance will be 2834 kilometers, taking into account the fact that you will go along the necessary routes.  The straight line distance is much smaller and amounts to 2095 kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If we are talking about traveling by train, then the figures are somewhat different, since the train must pass through the territory of not only Russia, but also Ukraine.  The distance in this case is 2856 kilometers, taking into account arrival to the territory of a neighboring state.  The distance between Perm and Simferopol airports is 2078 kilometers. </p><h2>  We are going by train </h2><p>  A convenient way to get to the Crimea is the Perm-Simferopol train, which was previously seasonal, and has recently been included in the general schedule on an ongoing basis.  Earlier, a fast train operated between the two cities; in the schedule for 2015, it was transferred to the passenger rank, as a result of which the transit time increased. </p>

    <p>  The composition leaves from Perm on even days, it will be so until September 8, 2015, in the future the schedule will change for the winter.  The total travel time from Perm to Simferopol is almost 50 hours, previously it was 47.5 hours. The passengers are offered all the amenities, a restaurant car is on the train, and the most modern trains are used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of tickets depends on what type of travel document will be purchased.  The most expensive seats will be in a comfort car; a seat in a reserved seat will be cheaper.  The exact cost must be clarified in the Russian Railways information bureau, since it can vary in accordance with the coefficient and time of the year. </p><h2>  Flying faster </h2><p>  If the train is not suitable for you, there is another tool that allows you to travel on the route "Perm-Simferopol" - an airplane.  There are direct flights between the two cities, the flight duration is about three and a half hours, Boeing and Airbus liners of various airlines run on the route. </p>

    <p>  The cost of a plane ticket can also vary, it must be specified in the airline, which serves a particular flight.  The average price of a one-way ticket ranges from 4 to 6 thousand rubles, but if you purchase a round-trip travel document - the cost can be from 10 to 13 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If there are no direct tickets for the Perm-Simferopol flight, you can get to your destination with a transfer via Moscow.  The duration of the flight in this case will increase significantly (from 7 to 10 hours), as well as the cost of the travel document.  Ticket prices can be checked with airline representatives. </p><h2>  Or is it still by car? </h2><p>  Fans of travel can go to the Crimea by car.  Perm-Simferopol - the route is quite long, and it can take several days to overcome it.  You will have to drive through Izhevsk, Samara, Saratov, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, as well as the Krasnodar region, although the quality of roads in some regions leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  The most exciting part of the journey awaits motorists in Kerch, where they will have to cross the strait by ferry.  Since there is still no bridge between the Krasnodar Region and the Crimea, it is at the design stage, all Russians who want to get to the peninsula and use a car to do this have to wait in line.  Sometimes the wait stretches for several hours. </p><h2>  Other ways </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is no direct bus service along the Perm-Simferopol route, so they will not be able to use it.  Many travelers leaving Perm travel to Krasnodar, and then cross the Kerch Strait by ferry, board the train and travel to the final destination of their trip - Simferopol.  However, this option is not entirely convenient, since it will require an additional waste of time, money and effort, so it is best to use direct communication. </p>

    <p>  You can also enter Crimea through the territory of Ukraine, however, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation does not recommend entering the territory of a neighboring country in connection with the hostilities taking place before further notice.  It is planned to build an automobile and railway bridge across the Kerch Strait, but they will appear no earlier than 2016. </p><p>  As of August 2015, Russians who plan to visit Crimea do not need a passport or visa - entry into the peninsula is carried out according to the standard principle of entry into any region of the country.  When visiting the Crimea, the Government of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation recommends that you exercise complete caution and security measures, do not come into contact with suspicious persons, and also in the event of any emergency, immediately contact local law enforcement agencies. </p>
