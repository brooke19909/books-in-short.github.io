In particular, service packages designed for smartphones include mobile Internet for working with mail and social networks, SMS packages and minutes for calls. </p><p>  The Russian operator MTS is no exception.  The company created several tariffs for both smartphones and tablets of its subscribers.  That they include, we will tell in this article. </p><h2>  Smart packages from MTS - the smartphone will be pleased! </h2><p>  The company introduced a whole tariff system that will satisfy the user with a mobile phone called Smart.  This service includes four additional packages that differ in terms of cost and volume of data provided.  We are talking about Smart Mini, Smart, Smart + and Smart Top. </p>

    <p>  The subscriber is given the right to choose whether to receive less for the corresponding amount or to pay more in exchange for additional opportunities.  The difference between the packages is the amount of megabytes of Internet connection (in MTS, a smartphone is considered a device with which the user will probably ‚Äúsurf‚Äù on sites, read news and have fun with various media content), SMS messages, the amount of free minutes within the network, and, of course, package region.  For example, a tariff at which a subscriber is given the opportunity to talk with users of another part of Russia will cost more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to more clearly understand which of the MTS smartphone tariffs is better for you, we will provide basic information for each of them. </p><h2>  Smart mini </h2><p>  So, let's start with the simplest and most affordable - the Mini package.  It is intended for users with minimal queries and those who would like to spend as little as possible on communication.  <span>The subscription fee that</span> is charged to the user is only 200 rubles.  For this money, a person receives 500 megabytes of Internet, an unlimited number of conversations with MTS subscribers from the same region, 50 SMS and 1000 minutes for calls to operator numbers from another region. </p><p>  Moreover, in order to call the numbers of other operators, you must pay 1.5 rubles for each minute of conversation.  As reported on the official website of the company, the tariff "MTS Smartphone Mini" (or, as it is officially called, Smart Mini), you must purchase a starter pack worth 220 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Smart </h2><p>  The next in the tariff ladder is the Smart data packet.  This is a more expensive tariff, which will cost 450 rubles for each month of use.  True, the capabilities of the subscriber will be an order of magnitude greater.  So, for use <span>on the MTS network, Internet</span> for a smartphone on this plan is provided in the amount of 3 GB of data.  This, as we see, is already 6 times higher than the norm stipulated by the previous tariff. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the subscriber is provided with unlimited conversations with numbers belonging to MTS, as well as another 500 minutes, which can be used to make calls to phone numbers of other operators.  For text communication, the operator provides 500 SMS, which the subscriber can send to any number for free. </p><p>  The cost of the tariff plan is equal to the monthly payment - 450 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Smart + </h2><p>  The next tariff, which is of interest to us as part of the study of the MTS Smartphone package, is Smart Plus.  It costs even more - 900 rubles a month.  For this amount, the client receives as much as 5 GB of mobile Internet data and unlimited calls to any numbers on the MTS network.  In addition, the subscriber is provided with 1100 minutes of calls to any numbers throughout the country, as well as 1100 SMS messages. </p><p>  The cost of the services that will be provided after spending the allocated packages depends on whether the subscriber will activate the Additional Internet and Additional SMS services.  If this is not the case, then the Internet is provided free of charge, but with a speed limit.  While SMS over the norm will cost 50 cents / piece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smart top </h2>

    <p>  Finally, the most expensive and at the same time the tariff with the most extensive features is Smart Top.  Its cost reaches 1,500 rubles per month, and for this money the user receives 10 gigabytes of Internet throughout Russia and unlimited calls on the MTS network.  At the same time, instead of 1100 on ‚ÄúSmart Plus‚Äù, the user of ‚ÄúTop‚Äù receives 2,000 minutes for calls to phones of foreign operators, as well as 2,000 SMS messages throughout the country.  If a person spends the marked limit, then calls to MTS numbers will be allocated to him free of charge, while for connecting with foreign operators you will need to pay 3 rubles for each minute of conversation. </p><h2>  Other rates </h2><p>  It is possible to use other tariffs for smartphones designed for MTS subscribers.  These are the plans of "Second" and "Super MTS".  The first means the absence of a monthly fee every month, but provides for the removal of 5 kopecks for every second of conversation on phones located within the Moscow region.  To talk with a person from another region, you need to pay at a rate of 5 rubles per minute, if we are talking about MTS numbers, and 14 rubles / minute for calls to phones of other operators. </p><p>  The Super MTS tariff provides for the absence of a monthly fee, but you need to pay one and a half rubles for communication with MTS subscribers (starting from the 21st minute of conversation per day of use), 5 rubles for calls to numbers of other operators. </p><p>  Thus, most likely, if you have a need to use the Internet, Smart tariffs will be more beneficial for you. </p><h2>  Phones from MTS </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the fact that the company provides mobile services, the operator also has its own line of smartphones.  Their range is presented in a special online store on the official website.  All MTS smartphones, their prices and reviews for each can be found there.  On this resource it is also offered to order a smartphone for yourself. </p><p>  You ask, what is the feature of devices that are sold under the brand of a mobile operator?  According to a model that has long been practiced around the world, these devices are locked for a single operator.  This means that purchased smartphones marked "MTS" will only work with the SIM card of this operator. </p><h2>  What is the benefit? </h2><p>  The question is, why buy a phone (MTS smartphone) if it cannot be used with other networks?  This is a pretty significant limitation for the user, which can not be bypassed?  What happens if a client wants to switch to another operator? </p><p>  The benefit that MTS smartphones promise (prices, reviews we will describe below) is the low cost of the devices.  It, in turn, is explained by the fact that the mobile operator underestimates the price, based on further cash receipts from the subscriber.  Indeed, you must admit that a person will continue to use a smartphone, paying for mobile services to the operator.  Therefore, MTS may sell such devices cheaper. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  If you are thinking of buying a smartphone in MTS, you should read the reviews about it first of all.  For example, take one of the most popular (and available) - the Smart Start model.  It costs only 2,990 rubles, while, as noted by customer reviews, the device fully justifies its price.  Characteristics indicate that this is a budget touch-sensitive phone, which can be used both as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù and as a gadget for listening to music, talking on Skype, reading books or <span>surfing the Internet.</span> </p><p>  Another example: in the event that you need not a budget device, but a solid smartphone capable of more, you can choose the 968 model. This MTS smartphone (reviews confirm) looks much more solid, but costs 6500 rubles.  At the same time, it is equipped with a processor with a capacity of 1 GHz, a 5 megapixel camera, 512 megabytes of RAM and various features like a GPS module and a memory card slot.  For that kind of money, again, according to the recommendations of the customers, there is no better device. </p><p>  The company also sells other MTS smartphones.  Prices, reviews and specifications are what you need to pay attention to first.  You can also choose the device based on its external design and other preferences. </p>

    <h2>  Features of branded devices </h2><p>  In general, when buying such a smartphone, you should remember about its main feature - it is rather a simple budget phone for the MTS SIM card than a serious device for everyday work.  At their core, these phones are cheap Chinese Android devices.  Therefore, it makes no sense to compare them with smartphones from Samsung, Apple or even Lenovo.  Just considering the prices that are installed on MTS smartphones, the reviews are positive.  However, do not forget that they are suitable primarily for elementary tasks (indicated above).  Alas, it will not work to play them or take colorful pictures. </p><p>  In general, as the assortment on the MTS website shows, these people buy phones and there is a demand for them.  And again, the devices are connected to the tariff plans of the operator, which will be a clear plus for those who are used to MTS. </p>
