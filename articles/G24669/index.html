In addition to a large number of big tops in the middle of the century, and more specifically in 1853, the first stationary circus building was erected in Moscow.  It was located on Petrovka and was wooden.  The next similar building was erected on Vozdvizhenka in 1868. </p><h2>  First stone </h2><p>  The oldest and first stationary in the capital is the Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard.  The history of its creation is as follows.  The hereditary circus artist, born in Italy, Albert Salamansky (1839-1913), who became a successful entrepreneur, opened circuses in Berlin and Riga, in Dubulti (part of Jurmala) and Odessa.  And in the mid-autumn of 1880, the Muscovites opened their hospitable gates to the current Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/793982.jpg" width="600"></div>  Architect August Weber built a specialized building.  The opening was magnificent, all the circus stars of that time were performing: Mrs. Truzzi rode on a bareback horse, gymnast Henrietta walked along the wire, there were gymnasts brothers Pascals.  Most of the program was given to equestrian numbers.

    <h2>  Creator and master </h2><p>  Salamansky himself performed with 14 trained horses.  In the second part, a ballet about a winter evening was shown, in which in the circus arena skated and rolled down the ice slides on a sled.  As the director and owner of the circus, Salamansky tried to attract ordinary people into it, although the main audience was the Moscow merchants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/793983.jpg" width="600"></div>  Through the efforts of the director, the circus showed daily performances for children with a specialized program.  The circus quickly became very popular in Moscow.  However, the Salamanca establishment existed in the conditions of fierce competition.  Directly next to him, in the building of the current cinema "Mir", was also located the enviable circus of the Nikitin brothers.  The future old-new (so-called Muscovites) Nikulin circus won the fight for the audience.

Before the revolution, these were the Durov brothers, the Bim-Bom clown duet.  In general, the circus paid a lot of attention to clowns, because, as the founder stated, the circus is not a circus if people don‚Äôt laugh at it.  His arena remembers dozens of talented clowns - Kozlov, Grandmother, Vysokinsky.  For many seasons Tanti and Veldman, Alperov and Bernardo, Krasutsky and Kristov performed here.  Of course, only specialists know them.  But many people remember <span>Soviet clowns</span> , especially the older generation. </p><h2>  The blacksmiths of world-wide circus glory </h2><p>  The current Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard, while not yet such, was famous for the performances of such masters as D. Alperov, B. Vyatkin, L. Kukso, A.E.  Latyshev (Anton and Antoshka).  And who does not know such world-famous clowns as Oleg Popov, Pencil, Yuri Nikulin and Mikhail Shuydin, or Leonid Yengibarov, or the great <span>Yuri Kuklachev,</span> who spoke with him in tandem <span>?</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/793984.jpg" width="600"></div>  These are circus legends.  For many years Alexander Borisovich Boucher, Honored Artist of the RSFSR, served here as the leading performance, or as head master.  The directors who contributed to the glory of the circus were Mark Mestechkin and Arnold Grigorievich Arnold for many years.  But a whole era in the history of this circus is associated with the life and work of Yuri Vladimirovich Nikulin, who received the highest insignia for his activity under the Soviet regime.  This and many others explain his name, which arose in the name - Nikulin Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard.

Nikulin adored the arena since childhood, as the words from his song about the old circus from childhood dreams say, which became fate and love for life.  Dreaming of an acting career, he entered the clownery school at the circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard in 1945.  From that moment on, his life was inextricably linked with this institution.  For two and a half years he worked with the very famous clown Pencil, whose popularity is immortalized in Soviet cartoons.  Yuri Nikulin assisted him along with Mikhail Shuidin, with whom he later formed the famous duet, which lasted for many years - from 1950 to 1981.  Reprise, sketches and pantomimes of the duo were included in the gold fund of the domestic circus.  Yuri Nikulin stopped performing when he was 60 years old. </p><h2>  Popular favorite </h2><p>  The popularity of this artist is over the top.  Yu.V.  Nikulin was known and loved by all the inhabitants of the Soviet Union.  A recognizable and unique actor, behind whom there were many brilliant movie roles, an ingenious narrator and presenter of the popular TV show "The White Parrot", since 1981 he has been the main director, and since 1982 the art director and director of his own circus.  Under his leadership, new, world-famous productions were released, the best artists in this genre were invited with unusual, unprecedented attractions.  The Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard becomes a domestic legend. </p><h2>  New circus building </h2><p>  Young graduates of the school at the circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard honed their skills here.  Yuri Vladimirovich‚Äôs great success as a director should be considered obtaining <span>permission to build a</span> new building.  It was built instead of a dilapidated, centenary, in the arena of which on the 13th of August-the month of 85 of the last century, the last performance was given.  And 09/29/1989, the program "Hello, Old Circus!"  a new unique building was opened that meets all modern parameters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard reviews" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/794130.jpg" width="600"></div>  In 1996, on the day of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the great maestro, the institution to which he gave his love and his life received his name and began to be called the Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard.  A photo of the modern building of this institution, beloved by many generations of Muscovites, is attached.

The purpose of trips of many Russians to Moscow is connected with the desire to visit this legendary place.  For many years, the Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard has received the most enthusiastic reviews.  People go to performances, knowing in advance what a high class the expected sight will be.  And still the circus surprises and delights them beyond measure.  The circus troupe is highly professional, led by the son of Yuri Vladimirovich - Maxim Nikulin, who grew up in this amazing atmosphere.  His father and mother until their death were inextricably linked with this circus.  Even my grandfather wrote scripts and reprise for the performance of artists at the arena of this particular circus.

Maybe that‚Äôs why the Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard is so popular right now.  His poster is often updated.  In itself, it is unusually colorful, and it contains certain information.  In addition to rearing horses (a traditional symbol), the date of foundation - 1880 is indicated in her hat and there is a portrait of the genius Yuri Nikulin in the clown's make-up recognizable by all.  The 134th season opened with a performance called The Royal Circus.  The amazing performance is fully consistent with the name - a truly royal sight, staged by eminent and titled authors - O. Druzhinin and G. Eradze.  One of the authors of the script is M.Yu.  Nikulin.  The performance has already been awarded the highest prizes.
