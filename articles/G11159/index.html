There is no escape from this - everyone wants to add comfort, convenience to their life.  One of the devices designed to do this is a multicooker.  She frees up a host of time for the hostess, allowing her to do other things while preparing food.  The problem is that this is an electric device with a heating element in its circuit, which means that utility bills should grow logically when using it.  In today's article, we will consider how much electricity a multicooker consumes, and whether to purchase a similar household appliance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tristarproductsinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much electric cooker consumes electricity per hour" class="if uuid-3062733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3062733.jpg"></div><h2>  The multicooker has too much consumption: myth or reality? </h2><p>  In order to answer this question, it is necessary to refer to the technical data of the household appliance.  Power consumption will depend on the brand and model, however, for example, you can take not the lowest indicator - 1 kW.  After all, it will depend on him how much electricity the multicooker consumes per hour. </p><p>  The average cooking time is 50 minutes.  Then, having made simple calculations, you can understand that the device should consume about 830 watts per cook, but we should not forget that it periodically turns off during operation, which means that you can safely divide the resulting figure into 2. Total, for one multicooker preparation consumes 415 watts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pressurecookerportal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern crock-pots" class="if uuid-3062750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3062750.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the total <span>electricity costs</span> per month </h2><p>  It makes sense to calculate this indicator.  After all, the only way to understand whether it makes sense to cook with this household appliance.  Calculating how much electricity a multicooker consumes per month is quite simple.  Based on the fact that it is necessary to cook food 2 times a day, and in the month of 31, we get: 415 √ó 2 √ó 31 = 25730 W = 25.8 kW.  With an average cost of 3 rubles / kW, you will have to pay 77.4 rubles. </p><p>  Having calculated how much electricity the multicooker consumes, it is safe to say that there is no talk of any sky-high amounts.  In addition, if not a gas, but an electric hob is installed in the home, then using such a device will be much more profitable. </p><p>  The following video will tell about the pros and cons of such devices. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="uw-HaQfgEJ4" data-url="https://youtu.be/uw-HaQfgEJ4" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/0/2/3/14023.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the difference between pressure cookers and multicookers </h2><p>  In principle, one does not interfere with the other.  A slow cooker may also have a pressure cooker function.  But the differences between them are significant.  The main thing is the cooking time.  In a pressure cooker, it is significantly reduced due to the fact that the whole process is carried out under pressure.  That is why it is forbidden to open its lid during cooking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.toluna.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker how to choose a good slow cooker" class="if uuid-3062740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3062740.jpg"></div><p>  Pressure cookers used to be quite common.  The lids on them were bolted to the pan or clung to the edges, and the seal was made using the central screw.  On top was a valve through which excess steam was vented.  However, it often failed, clogged, as a result of which such pans exploded.  Despite the fact that modern electric pressure cookers are devoid of such a flaw, many housewives still treat them with caution. </p><h2>  How to choose a good slow cooker </h2><p>  A crock-pot is such a device that will always be in sight, which means that when choosing it is worth paying attention to its design.  It should fit into the interior of the kitchen.  But this is not the point.  Its main task is to be convenient and practical, which means that the device must possess all the qualities necessary for the hostess.  That is why, when a desire arises to purchase such household appliances, you should not immediately run to the store.  In our age of the Internet, it is better to search for a suitable model through a home computer.  Only in this way does it become possible to understand which functions are really necessary and which can be dispensed with. </p><p>  Recently, devices equipped with the ‚Äúrice cooker‚Äù function have begun to appear.  Do not focus on this.  All this is just a marketing ploy.  Any slow cooker is able to cook rice porridge.  If it is required that it be crumbly, it can always be steamed.  For this, almost all models are equipped with special plastic bowls with holes. </p><p>  When choosing a device, you should pay attention to how much electricity the multicooker consumes.  And it is not a matter of controlling the cost of paying bills.  More powerful models will not hit your pocket much in this regard, but cooking will be much faster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kuchnia.wp.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much electric cooker consumes electricity per month" class="if uuid-3062759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3062759.jpg"></div><p>  After 3-4 suitable models are selected, you can go to the store.  It is necessary to carefully inspect the device for chips, scratches.  The slightest flaw should be the reason for the rejection of the purchase or a significant discount on the goods. </p><p>  Mandatory and checking the performance of the multicooker directly on the spot.  It should be borne in mind that it is imperative to familiarize yourself with the certificate of conformity for the product.  The seller must provide it upon request.  If there is no such paper, it is better to refrain from buying. </p><p>  A warranty card is also very important, which the seller should note, putting down the date of purchase in it.  Otherwise, it will be calculated from the date of manufacture. </p><h2>  Final part </h2><p>  Surely now, having learned how much electricity the pressure cooker actually consumes, many will change their minds and decide on such an acquisition.  And that will be the right step.  After all, such a device really greatly facilitates the cooking process. </p>
