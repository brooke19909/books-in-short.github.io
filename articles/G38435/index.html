In fact, this issue is of interest to many citizens.  Also, the answer may seem useful to organizations and individual entrepreneurs.  After all, if you know about responsibility, everyone will be able to avoid the negative consequences.  This should be remembered.  So what should residents of Russia pay attention to?  Is there any penalty for <span>tax evasion?</span>  And if so, which one?  All this will be described later.  In fact, understanding the question posed is easier than it seems.  Especially in the presence of knowledge of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Is there any liability </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the liability for tax evasion.  Does it exist in Russia?  If so, who exactly will carry it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what will happen if you do not pay taxes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584011.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The answer is not so difficult.  Responsibility for tax evasion in Russia takes place.  But the specific punishment will depend on many factors.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  by type of taxpayer; </li><li>  from the amount of non-payment; </li><li>  from the payment delay period. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, it is not so easy to say exactly what taxpayers are afraid of.  The only thing that Russia is confidently talking about is that tax evasion necessarily entails a number of negative consequences.  Which ones?  They will be described later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Penalties </h2><p>  What will happen if you do not pay taxes?  The first problem that all taxpayers face is fines.  This is a monetary penalty, which increases the tax paid by a certain amount.  Accrued daily.  Accordingly, the longer a citizen or organization does not pay, the more they will eventually have to give to the state. </p><p>  Penalties begin to accrue from the moment of debt formation.  That is, if the tax is not paid before the deadlines, the next day the payment will increase.  This measure applies to all taxpayers.  Therefore, it is recommended not to delay the study payments. </p><h2>  Individuals </h2><p>  There are several types of taxpayers.  For them, various penalties for non-payment of taxes are provided.  What are the scenarios? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liability for tax evasion" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584012.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first large group of taxpayers is <span>individuals.</span>  For them, as a rule, there are income taxes, as well as property, transport and land taxes.  What to expect if you ignore a payment order from a tax? </p><p>  What will happen if you do not pay taxes?  There are several options for punishment.  Which ones?  The RF Tax Code will help.  According to him, one may encounter: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  With penalties.  Citizens who delayed paying taxes will have to pay a penalty when paying.  This measure has already been said.  The amount of additional costs directly depends on how much the calculation was delayed. </li><li>  With a fine in the prescribed amount.  The most common measure of responsibility that is only found in Russia.  The penalty for non-payment of taxes, in accordance with the established rules, is established individually, but with some restrictions.  Citizens pay 100-300 thousand rubles or lose their earnings for 12-24 months.  It all depends on the court decision. </li><li>  With forced labor.  Responsibility for tax evasion in Russia by individuals is expressed (sometimes) in the form of forced labor.  Its maximum duration is no more than a year. </li><li>  With imprisonment.  An extreme measure of responsibility that a taxpayer can only bear.  Imprisonment is proposed for 1 year.  Arrest for 6 months is possible. </li></ol><p>  All of the listed penalties are the responsibility of individuals for non-payment of taxes in accordance with the established legislation.  Similar measures are also provided for the preparation of false documents or for failure to submit a tax return on time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="penalty for tax evasion" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Special sizes for individuals </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what will happen if you do not pay taxes.  Only all of the measures listed cannot be called unique.  The responsibility of <span>individuals is</span> sometimes expressed somewhat differently.  What is it about? </p><p>  On tax evasion in especially large amounts.  Such a crime has more severe penalties for negligent taxpayers.  Which ones? </p><p>  The penalty for tax evasion in such a situation will increase.  Now for the perfect deed will have to give from 200 to 500 thousand.  As an alternative punishment, a payment is made in the form of a citizen's profit for 1.5-3 years.  Forced labor also takes place.  In case of non-payment of taxes in especially large amounts, the court may force up to 36 months of forced labor.  Or imprisonment for a similar period.  But the arrest is no longer taking place. </p><p>  Exactly such measures are provided for individuals, if there was <span>tax evasion.</span>  Article 198 of the Criminal Code indicates such measures.  But there is another interesting nuance in it.  About him a little later.  First you need to figure out what non-payment to legal entities and individual entrepreneurs will result in. </p><h2>  IP and organizations </h2><p>  The difference is not too big in the established punishments.  But for organizations and individual entrepreneurs, as a rule, the consequences of debts to tax authorities are more dangerous than it seems.  During such events, the company may cease operations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax evasion uk rf" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584010.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tax evasion <span>(Criminal Code, Article 199) is</span> punishable by: </p><ol><li>  Fine.  Like individuals, individuals and legal entities.  persons pay from 100 to 300 thousand rubles.  As an alternative amount, you can lose the maximum profit for 2 years. </li><li>  Forced labor.  A distinctive feature is that the right to conduct this or that activity is taken away from the organization.  More precisely, the taboo is imposed on the intruder.  Most often - on the head of the organization.  The maximum sentence is 2 years for work and 3 for work restrictions. </li><li>  Arrest for six months. </li><li>  Imprisonment.  It is usually associated with a restriction in the conduct of a particular activity.  The limits of punishment are exactly the same as with forced labor. </li></ol><p>  Everyone should know what will happen if they do not pay taxes.  In addition to these penalties, organizations face fines.  Therefore, an increase in billing still takes place. </p><h2>  Special cases </h2><p>  But there is another option for the development of events.  What threatens tax evasion?  According to the established rules, if this act is committed by prior conspiracy or in large (especially large) amounts, the punishment is harsher.  It somewhat resembles the responsibility of individuals for a similar act. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax evasion article" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584009.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Accordingly, you may encounter: </p><ol><li>  Cash payments.  Fines are set to half a million.  You can also lose income for 3 years. </li><li>  Forced labor for a maximum of 5 years.  In addition, the head of the organization or entrepreneur may be deprived of the opportunity to conduct this or that activity, as well as occupy specific positions.  A similar measure lasts no more than 3 years. </li><li>  Imprisonment.  Together with him, a taboo is laid on activity.  The duration of sentences is up to 36 months inclusive. </li></ol><p>  It follows that taxpayers face approximately the same consequences.  But with a small caveat.  Which one? </p><h2>  Disclaimer </h2><p>  The fact is that it is far from always necessary to think about what will happen if you do not pay taxes.  In Russia, criminal punishment is sometimes avoided.  This feature applies to all taxpayers. </p><p>  According to the established rules, if an individual entrepreneur, organization, or just a citizen independently closed the debt and paid the full penalty, you can not be afraid of responsibility.  But such a concession applies only to cases when the violation is committed for the first time. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear what threatens tax evasion.  In practice, most often citizens are faced with penalties.  But criminal liability does not occur so often.  In any case, with individuals.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what threatens tax evasion" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1584008.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All citizens need to pay taxes.  In some cases, bailiffs seize property for which they do not pay.  This should be remembered by every taxpayer. </p><p>  In 2017, a new penalty for tax evasion takes effect in Russia.  Citizens who have not paid on time transport, property or land tax will be fined.  The payment amount will be 20% of the tax. </p>
