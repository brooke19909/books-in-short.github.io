    <h2>  Attractive island features </h2><p>  Seychelles, whose attractions surprise even the most sophisticated tourists, have unique beaches, a unique flora and underwater world.  There are no such beauties anywhere else on the planet.  Here you can meet unusual birds and animals. </p><p>  There is practically no agriculture in the republic, but no industry at all.  The local government protects nature, given to him by God, and is very sensitive to this issue.  The Republic of <span>Seychelles</span> prohibits any expansion of the tourism business, nor can new hotels be built here.  All this is done so that the number of tourists does not increase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only in this area there is something that simply fascinates a person - these are magnetizing stones that have lain on the island for many thousands of years.  It seems that here they were left by aliens from outer space.  Since ancient times, stones have been used by white sorcerers.  With their help, they plunged into a trance and predicted the future. </p><p>  Mahe, La Digue and Praslin are the granite central islands of the republic.  All other islands are coral atolls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mahe island" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1251532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The largest island of the Seychelles archipelago </h2><p>  The largest and most visited is the island of Mahe.  In the eyes of tourists, dozens of elite resort hotels, tropical <span>impassable forests,</span> beaches with their pristine charm and historical incredibly interesting sights make this area irresistible.  The island offers its guests an exciting excursion program. </p><p>  <span>The capital of the island</span> is the city of Victoria - this is the largest city of Mahe and the smallest capital of the planet.  Here at every step are the sights: a copy of Big Ben on the main square of Victoria, the Cathedral of the <span>Immaculate Conception,</span> which is the most important religious attraction of Mahe. </p><p>  Mahe Island invites art lovers to visit the Kraft Village area.  This is such a village of artisans, in which the best craftsmen present their products.  Also, travelers should try the Mon Fleury Garden, which has a huge collection of palm trees.  Among them there are very rare species of trees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="republic of seychelles" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1251533.jpg" width="600"></div>

Two centuries ago, only a pirate‚Äôs foot entered this territory.  Over the past two centuries, only four owners have lived in Muayen.  Until 2012, the owner of the island was Brandon Grimshaw, and after his death, the territory became part of the Republic of Seychelles. </p><p>  On the island, Brandon lived with Creole Rene Lafortun, who lived here for about 10 years.  He was encouraged by Grimshaw‚Äôs offer to settle on the island and gladly accepted his offer.  Men actively engaged in the augmentation and protection of fauna and flora.  Each of the men planted 16 thousand trees.  Grimshaw also acquired several giant endangered turtles for Muayen. </p><h2>  Tourist Attractions </h2><p>  Seychelles, the sights of which every inhabitant of the Earth wants to see, have some more interesting places that all tourists visiting the republic should see.  So, one of such places is the gallery of the famous artist Michael Adams.  It is housed in a classic chalet with a small shop and workshop.  Here you can buy your favorite canvas, postcards and copyright calendars. </p><p>  The Royal Spice Garden is another interesting attraction.  It was founded in 1772.  Today, the estate has a small restaurant serving national cuisine, a museum and a souvenir shop.  The museum exposition is dedicated to the life of planters of the XVIII-XIX centuries. </p><p>  In the northern part of the archipelago you can find the one of a kind nature reserve Seychelles Morne.  Tourists walk around the reserve are extremely popular.  <span>Rainforests</span> occupy a significant part of the Seychelles Morne, and during the tour you can admire rare species of trees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="muyain island" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1251530.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What else do you need to see? </h2><p>  Seychelles, whose attractions are inexhaustible, can boast some more of its zest.  For example, on the island of Praslin, Seychelles palm trees called Coco de mer grow.  The fruits of these trees can weigh up to 25 kilograms.  Some trees are thousands of years old. </p><p>  Here, on Praslin, there lives a black parrot ‚Äì vase - a bird symbol of the Seychelles.  Many tourists visit the pirate graves, causing considerable interest. </p>
