Without it, we cannot spend calmly free time, communicate with our friends, seek information.  Often, the Internet is simply becoming an integral part of our lives. </p><p>  And of course, in situations where, for some reason, the Internet connection is interrupted, we are overwhelmed by negative emotions.  There is a desire to find and fix the problem that could lead to such a shutdown as soon as possible. </p><p>  In this article we will try to make life easier for those who may suffer such a sad fate.  We‚Äôll just look at a few situations in which the Internet connection may be lost, and also give tips on how to resume it.  Well and, of course, here are some common reasons why problems with the Network may arise. </p>

    <h2>  No internet connection.  First steps </h2><p>  Imagine a situation in which you do not have the Internet.  You understand that you would like to go to your favorite social network, watch a movie or perform any other action, but instead sit "waiting for a miracle."  The first step is to determine at what stage the error occurred.  Here it is necessary to answer a number of questions and conduct several tests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Did you have the Internet before, or is this its first launch after some updates?  If the answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative, then your task is to find the very changes, after which the access to the Web has disappeared.  Otherwise, if you change something (for example, change the router), look for the cause of the problem, which is quite obvious, you need it.  In the framework of this article, in order to learn how to establish the reason for the loss of the Internet connection, we will analyze all the nodes in stages and describe what questions may arise at each stage. </p>

    <h2>  Provider </h2><p>  First of all, of course, the reason for the loss of the Network may be an error on the side of the provider.  This is the original link in our ‚Äúnetwork chain‚Äù.  The reason for the loss of Internet access, in this case, may be, for example, non-payment for the next period of use.  However, in this article we will not talk about this, since such problems are too commonplace to focus on them. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to diagnose an error with a provider - just remember if this happened before;  ask your neighbors who have the same Internet if they have access;  Think about whether you changed anything in the system that could lead to a situation where there is no Internet connection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, if the whole matter is really a mistake on the part of the provider, you can‚Äôt do anything - you just have to wait or use the services of another company if such a disconnection occurs too often or takes a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Modem </h2><p>  Often there are situations when access to the network disappears along with the fact that the modem signals some errors.  Then you need to turn to him - to find out what exactly those or other signals on the device mean;  try to understand why the connection disappeared.  The most common problems in such cases are problems with connecting elements (wires, adapters, poor contact somewhere at the input).  Check them, disconnect and reconnect, and if possible - rearrange, replace with new analogues.  After that, it will be clear what the cause of the problem is - in the modem itself or in the wires that directly serve to transmit the signal. </p><p>  If the matter is in the wires, then replacing them with new ones will not be difficult;  if it turned out that the problem lies with the modem, we recommend that you contact the service center.  However, as a rule, the modem itself should not fail for no apparent reason.  Perhaps part of the board burned out in it, or the device was damaged, but then this should have been preceded by a wet modem or its failure.  Thus, remembering such events, you can unravel why there is still no active connection to the Network. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There may also be a situation when a Wireless Modem Intertelecom (Sprint) is used to connect to the Network.  ‚ÄúNo Internet connection‚Äù - Windows XP may then display this message for the reason that the system simply does not have the appropriate drivers in order to ‚Äúsee‚Äù this device and recognize its signal.  The problem is solved by simply installing software suitable specifically for this modem.  Finally, if this does not help, check the technical health of the device;  try to remember, after which an error could occur, if there were any damages and so on. </p><h2>  Device for receiving </h2><p>  If the provider is doing well and your modem is working fine, you need to pay attention to the device itself, which is used to receive the signal.  Everything is simple here: if you reinstall the operating system, then, obviously, the message: ‚ÄúNo Internet connection‚Äù Windows 7, installed instead of Windows XP, displays precisely because of the lack of proper settings.  Do not panic.  The only thing that is required of you is a little time and, preferably, access to the Web on another device to search for tips and answers to questions of interest to you on sites and forums.  And the solution to the problem is to simply configure the Internet connection, which is carried out as required by the type of connection used.  Modem access, for example, often does not need to be configured at all;  and establishing a connection through a VPN service can, on the contrary, seem like a rather complicated process. </p><p>  If we are talking about accessing the Network on a mobile device, for example, and the phone or tablet says: ‚ÄúThere is no Internet connection,‚Äù you just need to know the Wi-Fi network key and its name.  You can see them in the settings of the router.  If you are worried about the mobile Internet, then you need to configure it by entering the data of the access point.  You can learn them, again, from the operator or consultant.  Also, service providers often offer an automatic settings package to simplify the user's task. </p>

    <h2>  Router </h2><p>  If you understand that the device works flawlessly, there are no problems on the side of the provider and modem, and the router does not want to connect to the Network in any way, obviously, that is the point.  Firstly, in this case, you need to install, after which WiFi is gone.  The Internet connection could also be lost if the device was somehow damaged, its settings have changed.  If the matter is about the settings, carry out the procedure for entering the necessary parameters in the software part of the router again.  In case of mechanical damage, the device must be carried for repair. </p><p>  Again, if the inscription "No Internet connection" (via WiFi) Windows 7 displays after the reinstallation of the operating system, the maintenance of new parameters is required.  To understand whether this is the only reason, you can also find out, using another computer, whether the problem extends to it. </p><p>  If there is no Internet connection via a router, but no one has touched the operating system, go to the device settings (using the address 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).  For authorization, use the admin username and password and see if the router connects to the Network, if you entered the data to access the Internet correctly, and so on. </p><h2>  Check </h2>

    <p>  If you see the message: ‚ÄúNo Internet connection‚Äù (via WiFi), Windows 7 with its diagnostic tools will help little.  As practice shows, it gives the most vague advice to cover the widest range of possible problems.  And you need to find and eliminate a specific reason, therefore, we recommend that you check each link as described previously.  In a practical way, even without special knowledge, you can configure your Internet or at least find what the problem is and determine how to solve it. </p><h2>  Nothing helps </h2><p>  Of course, there may be situations where none of the above tips helped, you know what the reason is, and the message ‚ÄúNo Internet connection‚Äù Windows 7 continues to display.  What to do in this situation?  Contact your ISP!  They will advise you and give an answer to the question of what is the cause of the problem. </p><h2>  Master Call </h2>

    <p>  A way out of the situation can also be a call to the house of the master (specialist from the provider).  However, you must admit that sometimes solving the problem on your own can bring more pleasure than the error ‚ÄúNo Internet connection‚Äù eliminated with the help of a competent employee through a router. </p><h2>  There is always a reason </h2><p>  And finally, we give the main advice that you need to remember in any situation when you are trying to find the reason for the lack of an Internet connection on your own.  There is always a reason!  Remember this phrase when you think that the connection to the Network has disappeared by itself, but you still don‚Äôt understand what happened and what you should do now. </p><p>  When <span>you cannot access the Internet,</span> first find out where the failure occurred, what prevents you from connecting to the service of your provider, at what stage the error was made, and only after that look for the answer to the question of how to fix the problem.  In this case, of course, it is desirable to have access to the Network from another device (for example, with mobile Internet on the device, unless the same tablet writes: ‚ÄúThere is no Internet connection‚Äù, or with a neighboring computer), in order to look for explanations to your situation on various forums and sites.  After all, no matter what mistake you may have, in the world there are at least several hundred people (if not more) who have already encountered it and managed to discuss it to the smallest detail. </p>
