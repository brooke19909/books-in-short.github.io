  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summer knitted dresses with patterns and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitwear looks very beautiful and original.  However, only professional craftsmen can independently develop various patterns and use them to create real masterpieces.  For beginners, at first, instruction is required.  Therefore, in the current article, we propose to study the technology for the implementation of knitted summer dresses. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted dress step by step" class="if uuid-2896551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896551.jpg"></div><p>  In order to finally get a high-quality product, it must be carefully thought out.  Choose the desired style, choose a pattern, then yarn and tools.  To do this, decide what season a dress is required.  Perhaps it should be made of thick acrylic threads?  If you want to please yourself with an openwork product, you should purchase any cotton threads.  The main thing is monophonic.  However, it is important to consider that additional lining may be required.  After all, some products are too holey or transparent.  However, if a knitted summer dress is prepared for the sea season, you can do without this detail.  In any case, you can work with both knitting needles and crochet. </p><h2>  Original patterns </h2><p>  The technology for making dresses is not as complicated as it seems at first glance.  And in this we will try to convince the reader later.  In the meantime, consider the most popular patterns.  Schemes for knitting needles are shown on the left, and for the hook on the right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted dress pattern pattern" class="if uuid-2896584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896584.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing the right style for the conceived knitted summer dress, we outline its silhouette on a sheet of paper.  Next we will paint the parameters of the model, which we will knit.  In order not to get confused in the calculations. </p><h2>  Measurement Rules </h2><p>  Dresses come in different styles.  Therefore, in the first place, this particular feature of the product should be considered.  And after that, prepare an elastic centimeter and start measuring the model: </p><ul><li>  A is the estimated length of the product; </li><li>  B - chest circumference; </li><li>  In - waist circumference; </li><li>  G is the height of the gate; </li><li>  D is the length of the sleeve; </li><li>  E - girth of the forearm; </li><li>  W - neck width. </li></ul><h2>  Loop and row calculation </h2><p>  The construction of the pattern is necessary in order to facilitate the process of performing a knitted summer dress.  However, working constantly checking your product with a centimeter is completely inconvenient.  Therefore, professional masters advise beginners to pre-calculate the number of loops and rows.  It is very easy to do.  But first, with the help of prepared knitting needles and yarn, you need to knit a sample of the selected pattern - a square with a side of 15 cm. After that, count the number of loops and rows.  And divide both values ‚Äã‚Äãby fifteen.  After that, we multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by the parameters B, C, E, Zh. And the number of rows by - A, D, D. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted dress" class="if uuid-2896538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896538.jpg"></div><h2>  The implementation of the main part </h2><p>  It is most convenient to carry out a summer knitted dress with a crochet or knitting needles, starting from the bottom edge and gradually moving to the shoulders.  If the product is short, it is recommended to knit the first 5-7 rows with an elastic band, using a tool slightly smaller than the main one.  And later, switch to the selected pattern and the main tool.  Knit should be on circular knitting needles, moving in a circle.  Having reached the level of the armhole, it is required to divide the "pipe" into two halves - the back and the front.  First knit with an even cloth to the end and close in the usual way.  On the second tie out the gate.  After stitching the dress at the shoulder seams.  If desired, add sleeves, gaining 2/3 of the armholes new loops.  And then moving back and forth to select additional ones for the remaining part.  Having tied the entire neckline in this way, continue the execution of the sleeve to the desired length.  In the end, it is also recommended to make a small gum. </p><p>  That's the whole technology of making a knitted summer dress with knitting needles or crochet.  Both professional masters and beginners can cope with the task. </p><h2>  Dress from motives (crochet) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2896526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896526.jpg"></div><p>  Professional craftsmen note that products consisting of many fragments are most easily performed.  They essentially do not require the calculation of loops and rows.  The knitter simply prepares squares, circles or other elements, and then sews them together, collecting a spectacular dress.  However, many newcomers complain that such work is too boring and monotonous.  In addition, it makes you fiddle with the assembly and stitching of the product for a long time.  Nevertheless, we also included a description and patterns of knitted summer dresses, consisting of individual motifs.  So that the reader has the opportunity to choose the most suitable option for himself. </p><h2>  Dress in two parts (knitting) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2896532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896532.jpg"></div><p>  Most beginners note that it is much easier to knit lace or lace products with knitting needles.  Because these tools allow you to not tighten the loops too much.  Is this so, the reader can verify for himself.  To do this, we offer a detailed description of a beautiful openwork dress.  However, it is important to consider that it uses a pattern with a rapport of ten loops horizontally and twelve vertically.  Therefore, when calculating the total number of loops, it is necessary to take into account that you need to dial one that is a multiple of ten, not counting the two edge ones.  Rows should be varied so that the rapport is complete. </p><h2>  Knitted dress for girls (knitting) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted dress for girls" class="if uuid-2896533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2896533.jpg"></div><p>  Not only girls and women want to look beautiful.  Their daughters also tend to be like their stylishly dressed moms.  Therefore, in the current article, we propose to study and make a children's knitted summer dress with knitting needles.  The pattern scheme in this case is not required, because it is quite simple.  The main thing is to follow the steps in the description: </p><ol><li>  To begin with, you need to prepare the yarn in the main color and a few additional ones. </li><li>  After that, we put on the knitting needles the number of loops equal to two girths of the chest. </li><li>  We knit the front loops on the front side, the wrong ones on the wrong side. </li><li>  After the 20-30th row, we begin to sharply reduce the loops, so that in the end it turns out as much as is required for one and a half girths of the chest. </li><li>  Then we knit to the waist. </li><li>  Then we reduce the loops so that their number becomes equal to one girth of the chest. </li><li>  We knit several rows with an even cloth. </li><li>  Then, for several rows on the front and back side, we knit the front loops. </li><li>  Then we carry out the pattern called "speckles".  In the front row we alternate one front and back loops one at a time.  In all other rows, over the front knit seamy, over the back - facial. </li><li>  Sew the finished product and tie the gate and armhole with a hook. </li></ol><h2>  Dress for girls (crochet) </h2><p>  A huge number of people much better understand and absorb the information that is obtained through the organs of vision.  For this reason, we have also included a detailed video master class in the current article.  He will help beginners learn the technology of making a knitted summer dress with a diagram and description.  And then tie the product for the smallest family members.  It can be made plain or striped.  Professional masters note that dresses in pink and brown colors look very impressive.  Thanks to this combination, the baby resembles a delicious cake.  Also interesting combinations are turquoise and white, pink and green, yellow and gray, brown and red, purple and blue, red and blue. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HUTIeJstauE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1241&amp;v=HUTIeJstauE" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/1/4/0/10140.jpg"></div><p>  So, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current article was that knitting the desired product is not as difficult as it might seem.  Therefore, professional masters advise beginners not to be afraid of difficulties, constantly master new technologies and often turn on their imagination.  Very often, incomprehensible or difficult patterns can be replaced by similar simple ones.  It is only necessary to bring the idea to life with great desire and love.  And then knitting will bring only joy. </p>
