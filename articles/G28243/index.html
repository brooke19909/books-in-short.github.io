By this concept is understood a system of common values ‚Äã‚Äãand opinions that are shared by all members of one company.  Organizational culture is the foundation of a corporation‚Äôs life potential.  Experience shows that progressively developing companies are characterized by a high level of spiritual achievement. </p><p>  Organizational culture is a system of norms and rules of behavior, common values ‚Äã‚Äãthat every employee of the organization accepts.  Considering this concept, it is impossible not to note its connection with the general totality of social, spiritual and industrial achievements of people. </p><p>  The manner of behavior, language, speech, main values, principles of activity and life of the company are reflected in the organizational culture that distinguishes one structure from another.  In addition, all these factors together have an impact on the development and existence of the corporation in the future. </p><p>  Along with this, the dual nature of the organizational culture is also visible.  This is manifested, on the one hand, by the influence of prevailing values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideas, goals, outstanding leaders, rules and standards.  On the other hand, <span>corporate culture</span> itself forms its own <span>value system.</span> </p><p>  The existing set of spiritual achievements in the company is based on the corporate philosophy developed within the framework of generally accepted provisions and laws.  The fundamental acts include, in particular, the <span>Declaration of Human Rights,</span> religious teachings, the Civil Code, the Constitution, the <span>Charter of the enterprise</span> and others.  The development of the company's philosophy should be carried out in accordance with the national composition of its members, the number of employees, regional specifics, the cultural level of the staff, the standard of living, and the type of production.  Neglect of the established provisions within the enterprise leads to the development of conflicts between employees and the administration, consumers and suppliers.  In the end, the image of the company is reduced, a crisis sets in the structure of the corporation, leading, as a rule, to ruin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most common types of organizational culture - a culture of power, roles, tasks and personalities - can be considered a kind of guideline when defining or shaping a particular philosophy in an enterprise.  This takes into account the desires and the situation.  The presented typology of organizational culture was developed by the English professor of management Charles Handy. </p><p>  As a rule, small enterprises are engaged in securities, real estate operations, and trade.  In such companies, a culture of power thrives, wholly dependent on a central source.  Basically, such structures are made with the help of acquaintances or friends, the final decision on the device depends on the head of the enterprise. </p><p>  Bureaucratic organizations are characterized by a culture of role.  These enterprises are characterized by a high degree of formalization due to strict adherence by employees to the rules.  The main <span>source of power</span> here is the position, the strength of the specialist is evaluated in conjunction with the corresponding position. </p><p>  The task culture is inherent in organizations based on working groups or teams that are formed to solve specific problems.  The structure of such an enterprise evaluates the strength of a specialist and his ability to work in a team. </p><p>  In the case when an enterprise is formed in order to facilitate the embodiment of the interests of several (or one) personalities in its structure, a personality culture takes place.  The specificity of such corporations is that the objectives of one or more employees are prioritized over common goals.  By and large, organizations with a personality culture owe their existence to this person.  That is why everything is subordinated to her interests. </p>
