Suvorov about the army, soldiers, tactics.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very well characterize the <span>historical figures of</span> their <span>statements.</span>  <span>Suvorov</span> in this regard is one of the most colorful representatives of his era.  He became famous not only for his numerous victories, but also for his well-aimed aphorisms about his homeland, honor, and war.  These expressions betray him as a wise man, educated, but most importantly, close to ordinary soldiers who loved and understood their commander.  The Generalissimo believed that the main guarantee of success does not lie in the number of troops, but in the art of using it, he argued that one must "fight not by numbers, but by skill." </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  When it comes to this illustrious commander, his statements are first remembered.  Suvorov was very tagged and sharp on the tongue, although he did not receive professional education.  He was born in 1730 in Moscow in the family of a general.  The young man was engaged in self-education, he served in several regiments.  Subsequently, he participated in seven wars, sixty battles, none of which he lost.  The hero of our article was not only a brilliant tactician and strategist, but also an excellent theoretician, wrote books on the art of warfare. </p>

    <p>  His main principle in the attacks was surprise, which was reflected in his next phrase: "He who won, he surprised."  Despite his fame, he was for some time out of favor with the imperial court, although he took part in such major events as the suppression of the Pugachev uprising, the Polish uprising, in Italian campaigns.  The <span>famous commander</span> died in 1800 and was buried in Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Suvorov's statements about the army" class="if" height="488" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1337220.jpg" width="360"></div></h2><h2>  Tactics </h2><p>  The ability of the Generalissimo to skillfully conduct the battle was reflected in his statements.  Suvorov very accurately and accurately knew how to convey his thoughts regarding the most effective method of attack, defense, attack.  His strategy had the advantage that it was understandable and accessible to almost everyone.  As mentioned above, he considered the main condition for success a sudden but carefully planned attack on the enemy, which was expressed in the following laconic phrase: "Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis needed, but haste is harmful."  Among his military exploits, the capture of the Turkish fortress Ishmael is usually most often recalled.  It was during her assault that his tactical principles for taking fortified points were fully manifested.  In this case, one can recall his following words: ‚ÄúThey do not take by the standing of the city‚Äù.  So, swiftness, speed, onslaught were the main principles of warfare of the commander. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Suvorov's statements about soldiers" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1337218.jpg" width="368"></div></h2><h2>  About the army </h2><p>  The versatility of his personality is evidenced by the statements.  Suvorov attached great importance to the patriotic education of soldiers.  Many of his aphorisms on the Russian people, weapons, allegiance to the fatherland, and the courage of soldiers have been preserved.  So, he said: "The Rusak is not a coward."  Alexander Vasilievich was convinced of the strength and power of the Russian army, the development of which he attached so much importance.  In his opinion, in the case of skillful use of its best qualities, you can always achieve victories.  He changed the linear tactics of warfare and began to attach great importance to the tactics of columns and loose battle.  At the same time, Suvorov believed that success was achieved through a sudden and decisive turning point in the battle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, he attached fundamental importance to the national factor, arguing that "We are Russians, we will overcome everything."  Such statements by Suvorov about the homeland indicate that he very well understood the need to maintain a patriotic spirit in the army.  The success of his military campaigns is also explained by the fact that there was complete trust between him and his soldiers: ordinary soldiers loved their commander and trusted him.  The above statements by Suvorov about the army testify to his understanding of the character of the soldiers, which made him a favorite of the troops.  The uniqueness of his personality lies in the fact that he was not only a talented military man, but also well versed in diplomacy, understanding its conventionality: "They lie in the office and beat in the field." </p><h2>  About soldiers </h2><p>  The commander was a favorite among ordinary fighters for personal courage, courage, understanding, and democratic behavior.  They appreciated him for being exactly his own.  In addition, the generalissimo was able to literally do almost impossible things (for example, his famous passage through the Alps - an event that created a splash not only in the theater of war, but also in political circles).  The commander believed that education was of great importance for the successful conduct of battle and for effective actions on the military front, as evidenced by the following statement: <span>"Learning is light, and ignorance is darkness."</span>  He himself wrote two books on the art of warfare. </p>

    <p>  Suvorov‚Äôs statements about the soldiers prove that he very sensitively felt the peculiarities of the battle, perfectly understood the strength and capabilities of his wards and skillfully, effectively used them.  By giving orders, he sought conciseness and clarity of expression, so that everyone understood him.  He said this: "It is necessary that the troops of his leader understand."  Suvorov attached great importance to mutual assistance and willingness to sacrifice life for the sake of saving a colleague.  He claimed that "perish yourself, and help a comrade."  The Generalissimo understood that army unity was the key to victory. </p>
