  <section class="page js-page"><h1>limited monarchy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the emergence of such a <span>form of government</span> as a monarchy begins even under the slave system.  And over time, it developed and under feudalism became the main one.  In bourgeois society, its traditional features have been preserved. </p><p>  However, the monarchy still exists.  She has changed a lot, but there are basic features inherent in her. </p><p>  One of the varieties of this type of government - a limited monarchy, is considered to be its form in which the state supreme power is divided between the monarch himself and another one or more bodies.  Examples are Parliament in Britain or the Zemsky Sobor in imperial Russia. </p><p>  As a result, a limited monarchy leads to a peculiar duality of state power, expressed in the fact that the monarch is actually and legally independent of the ‚Äúparliament‚Äù - so collectively they are called those bodies that limit its power.  However, the king is often forced to reckon with parliament, he has the right to appoint the <span>composition of the government,</span> which bears responsibility to him, however, the work of this government can be discussed or criticized in parliament. </p><p>  However, a representative institution under such a <span>form of power</span> as a limited monarchy acquires control functions, acting as such a legislative body, the authority of which the ruler is forced to reckon with.  Moreover, the monarch can have a strong influence on the parliament of his country: he can impose a ban on his laws, appoint deputies, dissolve parliament. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A limited monarchy can be of two types: constitutional or parliamentary and dualistic.  Its first variety is distinguished by the fact that legislatively monarchist power is limited by parliament, and executive by government. </p><p>  However, this form of government does not at all mean that the monarch does not have any role in the state.  He has a fairly wide range of powers, for example, declaring martial <span>law</span> or a <span>state of emergency, the</span> right to declare war or stop it, etc.  However, the king can take advantage of his functions only when his state is really in danger. </p><p>  Such a limited monarchy is also called constitutional, for the reason that the power of the monarch can be limited by the constitution of the state.  That is why with this form of government, acts emanating from the king come into force only after they are approved by the parliamentary majority.  In this case, the king is considered a kind of symbol of the nation and people, for example, the <span>Queen of Great Britain.</span> </p><p>  Today, almost all the monarchies of Europe are parliamentary or constitutional: Spain, Great Britain, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, etc. </p><p>  The dualistic limited monarchy is transitional from absolute to parliamentary.  <span>The separation of power</span> in this form of government takes place formally legally between parliament and the monarch.  Thus, the monarch governs his country through the government appointed by him and at the same time responsible to him, while parliament passes laws. </p><p>  Let us try to analyze the existing difference between the <span>parliamentary monarchy</span> and its dualistic kind.  It is clear that in a dualistic monarchy, the head of state - the monarch - is deprived of any legislative power.  Whereas in parliamentary or constitutional the same monarch is deprived of both legislative and executive powers. </p><p>  The dualistic monarchy is associated with the emergence of uprisings in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, requiring the restriction of the rights of monarchs, opposed to absolutism. </p><p>  Examples of limited dualistic monarchies today are Nepal, Kuwait. </p>
