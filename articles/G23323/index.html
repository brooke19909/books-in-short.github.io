Interestingly, the morphological features of each such structure directly depend on the function it performs.  It is customary to distinguish several of their types: </p><ul><li>  educational; </li><li>  coverslips; </li><li>  mechanical; </li><li>  conductive; </li><li>  the main ones. </li></ul><p>  Each structure has certain features, which will be discussed below. </p><p>  <strong>Educational plant tissue</strong> </p><p>  Educational fabrics are also called meristems.  Such a structure consists of small, multifaceted cells with thin walls.  They are tightly interconnected.  Under the microscope, you can see that they have a large core and many small vacuoles.  A feature of this tissue is the ability of its cells to continuously divide.  This is what ensures the constant growth of the plant.  It is customary to distinguish the following types: </p><ul><li>  Primary meristem - in an adult plant, this tissue is stored at the tops of shoots and the tips of the roots.  It is thanks to her that the primary growth of the plant is carried out in length. </li><li>  Secondary meristem - represented by cambium and pellogen.  These tissues provide secondary growth of the stem and root in diameter.  At the location, apical, lateral and intercalary secondary meristems are distinguished. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Plant integumentary tissues</strong> </p><p>  The integumentary tissue is placed on the surface of the plant body.  Its main function is protection.  Such structures are responsible for the resistance of plants to mechanical stress, protect against sharp temperature fluctuations and excessive evaporation of moisture, protect against pathogenic microorganisms penetrating inside.  Cover elements are usually divided into three main groups: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The epidermis (skin) is the primary tissue, which consists of small, transparent and tightly closed cells.  Typically, this type of tissue covers the surface of leaves and young shoots.  The epidermal layer of the leaves also includes the stomata - formations that are responsible for the processes of gas exchange and transpiration. </li><li>  Periderm is a secondary integumentary tissue that is located on the surface of the stem and root.  Consists of felogen and <span>cork.</span>  <span>The cork</span> is a dead layer of cells whose walls are saturated with a waterproof substance suberin. </li><li>  Peel is a fabric that is characteristic of trees and some bushes.  This layer of integumentary tissue is the outer part of the cork. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Conductive plant tissue</strong> </p><p>  The main function of this group of tissues is the transport of water and minerals through the body of the plant.  It is customary to distinguish the following varieties of conductive elements: </p><ul><li>  Xylem - provides the movement of water with dissolved minerals from the root system to the terrestrial part of the plant.  It consists of special vessels, the so-called trachea and tracheids. </li><li>  Phloem is a tissue that provides a downward current.  Through <span>sieve tubes,</span> all organic nutrients that are synthesized by the leaves are carried to other organs of the plant, including the root system. </li></ul><p>  <strong><span>The main</span> plant <span>tissue</span> : parenchyma</strong> </p><p>  This tissue consists of small living cells with thin walls.  It is she who forms the basis of all organs.  It includes: </p><ul><li>  Assimilation tissues - their cells contain a huge number of chloroplasts and are responsible for the <span>processes of photosynthesis</span> and the formation of organic substances.  Most of these tissues are found in leaves. </li><li>  Stocking tissues - useful substances are deposited in the cells.  This tissue is concentrated in fruits, root crops, and seeds. </li><li>  Aquifers - serve to accumulate and preserve water.  These tissues are characteristic of plants living in hot and dry climates, for example, cacti. </li><li>  Airborne tissues - such tissues have huge intercellular cavities that are filled with air.  Aerenchyma is characteristic of wetland and <span>aquatic plants.</span> </li></ul><p>  <strong>Mechanical tissue of plants</strong> </p><p>  Responsible for creating a solid frame.  They maintain the shape of the plant, making it more resistant to mechanical stress.  Such tissue consists of cells with thick membranes.  Most strongly <span>mechanical tissues</span> are developed in the stem of the plant. </p>
