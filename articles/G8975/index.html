He was an ardent participant in the revolutionary movement, despite his descent from a wealthy family.  With the advent of Soviet power, he became a diplomat.  Several important peace treaties were signed with his hand.  The political activity of this person could continue, but the insidious infection and loss of faith decided everything.  Who was Adolf Abramovich? </p><h2>  Life before the February Revolution </h2>

    <p>  Working in Japan, A. A. Ioffe caught a severe infection - multiple polyneuritis.  Due to an illness, he was sent to Austria, where in 1924 he began to occupy the post of political representative in Vienna. </p><p>  The disease deprived him of the ability to move.  He was forced to be in bed.  He could not conduct active political activity in this position.  The mental state of the activist was undermined by the decision of the Central Committee, which refused to provide him with financial assistance for therapy abroad. </p><p>  Before his death, A. A. Ioffe wrote a farewell letter on ten pages.  It was intended for Trotsky, whom he called for waging an uncompromising struggle. </p><p>  The politician and revolutionary on November 17, 1927 did not become.  He committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. </p><h2>  Grave politics has become a memorial </h2>

    <p>  They buried the remains of a politician at Novodevichy.  The coffin was carried by his colleagues in diplomatic activities - Litvinov, Chicherin, Karakhan.  Farewell speech at the sepulcher delivered Trotsky.  It was the last public appearance of the revolutionary and comrade of the deceased. </p><p>  Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Estonian Embassy in Moscow annually celebrates the anniversary of the signing of the Tartu Treaty at the Ioffe grave.  Ioffe was the head of the delegation from Soviet Russia.  As a result of this agreement, Estonia received significant land, part of the gold reserves of Tsarist Russia and other concessions from the Soviet government. </p><p>  The memorial event is attended by many Estonians who live in Moscow, including embassy workers. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Ioffe Adolf Abramovich (1883-1927) was married twice.  His first wife was Berta Ilyinichna, in girlhood she bore the name Tsypkina.  She gave birth to his daughter Nadezhda in 1906.  Since 1929, the daughter was in exiles and camps, until she was released after twenty years of wandering.  A woman died in 1999. </p><p>  The second wife was called Maria Mikhailovna, in girlhood - Hirschberg.  The woman, like her daughter Nadezhda, spent twenty years in the camps.  She died in 1989.  She gave birth to his son Vladimir in 1919.  At the age of eighteen, he was shot in Tomsk during the repressions of the thirties of the last century. </p><p>  From the daughter many memories of the father remained.  She described his character, habits, attitude towards colleagues in revolutionary activities.  Hope represented the father as an organized person, to a certain extent pedantic.  He did not like to be late, believing that everything should be done on time.  According to her, Ioffe was carried away by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrevolution because of books that he read in his youth. </p>
