Visitors note primarily the courtesy of the staff and the convenience of the rooms of this hotel.  Wi-Fi at the hotel is pretty slow, however, for surfing on regular sites on the Internet, its speed is enough. </p><p>  Many people like the comfort of the beds in the rooms.  Sleeping on them is really comfortable.  The hotel is located in a quiet place, and therefore noises do not bother guests at night.  The mattresses on the beds, judging by the reviews, are very soft, and the blankets are warm.  Some of the inconveniences of the hotel include only that the water in the shower can arbitrarily change the temperature, which, of course, is not too pleasant. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping and places of interest </h2><p>  Where can you go to those who stayed in such an institution as the Ibis Hotel (Moscow, Paveletskaya)?  Near this hotel there are several places worthy of tourist's attention.  For example, the State Tretyakov Gallery.  Also, guests of the Ibis Hotel on Paveletskaya can view the building of the International Industrial Academy and the Institute of Business Economics.  Red Square is only 5 minutes from the hotel by metro. </p><p>  The ability to purchase food right next to the place of residence is also what makes the Ibis hotel convenient.

However, you can buy food even closer - in the shopping center ‚ÄúPerekrestok‚Äù located right next to the hotel. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Guests find this hotel quite cozy.  The positive aspects of the visitors also include the courtesy of the staff and the ability to use dry cleaning.  Clean the rooms daily and well.  Some guests note that the rooms do not open windows.  In the summer, of course, this may not be too convenient.  Some rooms do not have refrigerators, and hotel guests have to store food in the kitchen at an additional cost.  What can also be attributed to the disadvantages of the hotel. </p><p>  But the convenience of the location is what this ibis hotel is praised for.  Moscow (hotel address - Schipok St., 22) - the megalopolis is truly huge.  Therefore, many of her guests arriving at the Paveletsky train station prefer not to look for the hotel too far and stay in Ibis. </p>
