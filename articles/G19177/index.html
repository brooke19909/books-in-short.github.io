    <p>  The formation of the Galicia Volyn principality occurred at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries.  Before its formation, the story is filled with boyar conspiracies, internecine wars, belligerent activity of the population.  Interventions of foreign sovereigns in internal political conflicts were also frequent. </p><p>  The Galician Principality of Volyn was formed by <span>Roman Mstislavovich</span> Volynsky.  In 11-12 centuries minor rulers sat on the future united territory.  They were sent by the <span>great princes of</span> Kiev.  Vladimir Monomakh served in these places (being the governor of Svyatoslav Yaroslavich). </p><p>  The Galician principality of Volyn was formed on the basis of lands located on the southwestern and western borders of the state.  The places here were (more than in other areas) suitable for trade, economy, and the development of foreign policy relations. </p><p>  The Galicia Volyn principality on one side had borders with the foothills of the Carpathians, which rested on the Danube.  From here paths opened to Hungary, Bulgaria, the trade road along the Danube led to the center of Europe, the Balkan countries, Byzantium.  From the north-east and north, the Galicia Principality of Volyn principality was surrounded by Kiev lands, which, having lost their power, not claiming the neighboring lands, provided protection to the neighbor from the onslaught of the Rostov-Suzdal rulers. </p><p>  During the existence of Ancient Russia, many cities were formed and expanded in its southwestern territory.  Thus, the cities of Vladimir-Volynsky, Galich, Przemysl, Berestye, Terebovl and others flourished in the Galicia-Volyn principality.  These lands have a high level of craft production.  The agricultural culture of the Galician Volyn Principality laid the foundation for arable farming in the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Trade roads passed through the territory: to the Black Sea from the Baltic (along the Vistula, Dniester, <span>Western Bug).</span>  Land trade routes also passed to the southeastern and central European countries. </p><p>  Vladimir-Volynsky - one of the largest cities of the principality - for a long period was the residence of the governors of the grand dukes.  The city was named in honor of Vladimir I. The city of Galich flourished on the solet trade.  Here, by the middle of the 12th century, independent boyars arose, and active layers of the population formed. </p><p>  Centers in local specific principalities have also grown markedly.  The descendants of Rostislav ruled here, who was the son of Vladimir, who, in turn, was the son of <span>Yaroslav the Wise.</span> </p><p>  Rostislav Vladimirovich became the life ruler in Vladimir-Volynsky.  Subsequently, the Rostislavovichs owned such cities as Kholm, Lutsk, Turiysk, Buzhesk, Terebovl, Dorogobuzh, Przemysl.  These territories were beautiful and rich.  In the cities there were many stone buildings, almost all were excellently fortified.  In ancient times, these territories were conquered from Poland by Vladimir, and later by Yaroslav the Wise.  Thus, the cities first became part of the Old Russian state, and then the foundation of the Galicia-Volyn principality - an independent territory with reliance on Galich and Vladimir-Volynsky. </p><p>  By the second half of the 12th century, the descendants of Monomakh and Rostislav took an active part in the <span>political development of the</span> territory.  Narrating the history of the Galicia-Volyn principality, one cannot fail to mention the five princes who ruled in this territory: the grandson of Rostislav - Vladimir, the son of Vladimir - Yaroslav Osmomysl (known from the "Tale of Igor's Regiment"), the cousin of Yaroslav - Ivan Berladnik.  The Volyn princes ruled here, the descendants of Monomakh - great-great-grandson Roman Mstislavovich Volynsky and his son Daniil Romanovich Galitsky (a participant in the battle of Kalka against the Mongol Tatars).  These were the most outstanding figures of the time. </p>
