  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a house out of paper? Tips, schemes, options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to make a house out of paper with your own hands?  Actions are performed only according to the drawing.  The principle of manufacturing various crafts is the same, so if you understand the implementation of one project, you can subsequently diversify it in every way, adding small details of the interior or increasing the number of storeys of the building. </p><p>  Knowledge of how to make a house out of paper can be useful for making a model of a city street, crafts for a corner of the road in a school or kindergarten.  With a house, assembled from thick paper, you can play "mother-daughter" at home, collect crafts for the child‚Äôs games on the road, for example, in the country or at a party.  It is fast, convenient, and will distract the baby from pranks for a while. </p><h2>  A simple diagram of a one-story house </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to make a house out of paper with your own hands according to the schemes.  The principle of drawing construction is as follows: </p><ul><li>  two rectangles perform the function of the walls of the building - this is the first and third part of the structure; </li><li>  Figures 2 and 4 have the shape of a square base and a triangular part for the roof; </li><li>  the square or rectangle shown below is the floor of the future structure; </li><li>  draw a separate roof consisting of two paired rectangles. </li></ul><p>  The size of all groups of parts depends on the height and width of the structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="house layout diagram" class="if uuid-2481579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481579.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a house of paper next?  Very simple.  On the contours cut the workpiece with scissors.  Do not forget to leave 1 cm of paper along the entire perimeter for folding and joining the elements together.  Make these strips with beveled corners so that the paper does not clatter on the corners of the craft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only selected strips are smeared with glue.  To do the job carefully, use a brush. </p><h2>  Square house </h2><p>  If all the walls of the house are depicted in the drawing as square, then the structure will turn out with equal sides.  Before you make a house out of paper, consider the shape of the roof.  For a small square house, it is better to make it high.  Before assembling, parts of the building can be painted by drawing tiles on the roof, carving and decorating windows and doors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.remodelaholic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small paper house" class="if uuid-2479275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2479275.jpg"></div><p>  You can draw carved shutters, green flowers, or a climbing plant on the wall of a building.  Do decoration still in expanded form, right on the drawing.  This is much more convenient, since the paper is on the table.  It is inconvenient to decorate the walls in assembled form, you can crumple the structure when gluing. </p><h2>  Home for interior decoration </h2><p>  How to make a house model from paper, you already understood.  Now let's look at how to use the craft, creating a cozy home interior.  The collected houses with a candle inside will look beautiful in the evenings.  For safety, the roof is made high, and the floor is not painted at all.  The house is glued only on the roof and on the back side to the side.  Light a small candle in a metal jar.  Then the house is placed on top. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.remodelaholic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house with a candle" class="if uuid-2479277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2479277.jpg"></div><p>  Light cuts through small cut-through windows.  The room immediately becomes cozy and romantic.  However, do not forget about safety measures, in order to prevent the fire of paper, you need to consider some important details.  Paper for the house should be thick so that the craft under the weight of the roof does not deform and does not fall into the fire of a candle.  Secondly, be sure to check that there is no draft in the room, so that the flame from the wind does not go to the side.  It is advisable to use such a lamp in the winter, when all windows are closed tightly.  After admiring the beauty, do not forget to put out the flame and take out the candle. </p><h2>  Round Tower </h2><p>  To play the princess or the knights, you may need not a simple house, but a round tower of the castle.  Making <span>a home-made mock-up</span> of paper is even easier, because you only need to draw two details.  This is a cylinder and cone.  To draw a cylinder, you need to make the following drawing: </p><ul><li>  base and top are two circles; </li><li>  the central part is a rectangle, the length of which is equal to the length of the circles, and the width is selected depending on the height of the tower. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mayamoka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round turret" class="if uuid-2479285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2479285.jpg"></div><p>  The cone is easily made by turning the cylinder around.  Cut off the bottom excess paper and glue the side.  You can make the roof on a separate base of a circular shape.  Then, when connecting parts with glue, a circle is smeared.  On a still rectangular rectangular blank, they draw with markers or make applications with doors, windows, shutters, bricks, etc. </p><h2>  Origami house </h2><p>  How to make a house out of paper?  To place the structure in the picture, you can use the origami method.  You can fold the paper in any color, but it should be double-sided.  On the craft, both the front and the back will be visible.  The photo below shows that for an origami house you need to fold A4 sheet three times into equal parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an origami house" class="if uuid-2479322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2479322.jpg"></div><p>  Then the workpiece is turned over and the sheet is folded in the same way and in width.  It remains to align the corners of the upper part of the workpiece, as shown in the image, and push the corners of the roof to the sides. </p><h2>  DIY decoration </h2><p>  The house assembled in an origami way can either be placed horizontally on a sheet of cardboard to create a flat picture, or glue the central parts on the back of a strip of paper and put the craft vertically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami house" class="if uuid-2479293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2479293.jpg"></div><p>  It is desirable to decorate the house with small details of the application.  Windows can be arranged symmetrically, on both sides of the central joint.  It is interesting to paint the roof with wavy or broken lines, as well as long horizontal stripes. </p>
