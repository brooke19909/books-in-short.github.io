List, Description, Features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the capital of a huge country and at the same time a city in which the number of inhabitants exceeded 12 million people, there should be several stations.  This allows you to ensure continuous trouble-free movement of residents.  Someone comes to the city to earn money, someone as a tourist.  It is logical that each remotely located area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metropolis has its own departure point.  How many stations in Moscow?  The list shows that there are nine of them now, if we take into account only the railways.  There are also river, not so popular and used mainly for sightseeing trips on the river. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow stations list schedule" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2080709.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  General list </h2><p>  The list of stations in Moscow has objects of various degrees of congestion.  Relatively fewer people can be found at Savelovsky station, for example.  This is due to the fact that you can leave this place only by commuter trains.  If the required direction is outside the Moscow region, then you should use the services of other stations. </p><p>  Below is a list of Moscow railway stations by their names: </p><ol><li>  Kazan. </li><li>  Kursk. </li><li>  Paveletsky. </li><li>  Leningradsky </li><li>  Yaroslavsky. </li><li>  Kievsky. </li><li>  Savelovsky. </li><li>  Riga. </li><li>  Belorussian. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that all the objects from the list are architectural monuments and significant cultural objects.  The infrastructure of the territories is developed, everywhere there are lounges, restaurants, service centers.  Increased attention is paid to the safety of citizens.  If you have any questions, you can contact the staff for help. </p><h2>  Kazan Station </h2><p>  From the general list of 9 Moscow stations, each has its own architectural features.  Kazan - one of the oldest, appeared in the XIX century.  More specifically, the building was built in 1862.  The former name is Ryazan Station, by the name of the highway, which he served at that time. </p><p>  Since the 90s, the movement of trains to the city of Kazan was opened, in connection with which the point was renamed.  The building was also reconstructed, but at the beginning of the next century.  The layout was improved, now the case has become more spacious and roomy.  The appearance of the building has also changed: according to the project of architect A. Schusev, the building was supplemented with two towers.  The overall composition combines elements of Russian and Eastern styles.  In the 90s of the XX century, the third tower was completed, which now houses exhibition halls. </p><p>  From <span>the</span> train <span>station,</span> trains go to Adler, Samara, Voronezh, still to Kazan and some other cities. </p><h2>  Kursky and Paveletsky stations </h2><p>  The building of the Kursk station has a more modern look.  Despite the fact that the departure point itself appeared in the 19th century, a new project was implemented in the 1970s.  The old building was made of wood and was located in a slightly different place.  Then they called him Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The modern structure is made in the style of post-constructivism, where concrete is combined with glass.  The 9-meter peak ‚Äúaccordion‚Äù complements the design.  Once it was the largest object from the list of stations in Moscow.  Transportation is carried out in the southern directions.  It is from here that you can leave for Belgorod and the North Caucasus, as well as in the suburbs. </p><p>  Particular attention is paid to the safety system at the station.  On the territory there are recreation and waiting areas - ordinary and business class rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow railway stations list" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2079274.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also in the direction to the south you can leave from the Paveletsky station.  From there trains to Central Asia and the Volga region follow.  In addition, the departure point of the Aeroexpress train, which carries passengers to Domodedovo Airport, is located nearby.  During the years of Soviet rule, for several years, the station was called Leninsky.  It was here that the train arrived that transported the body of Vladimir Ilyich to the capital. </p><h2>  Leningrad and Yaroslavl stations </h2><p>  Both buildings are located on Komsomolskaya Square, in the same place as the Kazan Station.  Leningradsky specializes in the north-west direction.  In particular, it transports people to St. Petersburg, Murmansk, Pskov, as well as to large cities of other states: Tallinn and Helsinki.  The building is an architectural monument.  From the list of train stations in Moscow, this was built first.  The reason is the need to connect the two largest cities with a railway line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the northern capital, they created an identical Moscow building in the style of classicism.  The case is two-story, compositionally symmetrical.  In the central part on the roof there is a small clock tower.  The last reconstruction was completed in 2013.  As a result, more modern interiors appeared, the premises are food courts, numerous shops, a service center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="9 stations of Moscow list" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2079291.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of the most unusual buildings in construction is the Yaroslavsky railway station.  It is made in the Neo-Russian style according to the project of two architects: F. Shekhtel and L. Kekushev.  In the external design, you can notice the traditional elements of Russian architecture.  These are patterned decorations, small turrets, arches. </p><p>  The construction looks like a tower in its appearance.  Of the materials, reinforced concrete and facing slabs were used mainly.  From the station you can get to Siberia, the Urals and the Far East.  It is from this point that the branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway begins, the longest road on the planet. </p><h2>  Kiev railway station </h2><p>  Trains to Ukraine, Moldova and the countries of Southeast Europe follow from the station of the Kiev station.  Initially, the point was intended to connect Moscow with Bryansk.  The structure was renovated after the 1917 revolution. Now it has become stone.  On one side is a tower with a clock over 50 m in height.  On the side are colonnades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow stations list schedule train" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2079273.jpg"></div>  A distinctive feature, which is not found in any of the list of stations in Moscow, is a unique landing stage.  During its construction, a combination of glass and metal was used.  The impressive design is 321 m long and 28 m high.

    <p>  Another important point: at this station there is a stop of the Aeroexpress train, a special train transporting people to Vnukovo Airport. </p><h2>  Savelovsky station </h2><p>  The starting point for most trains is Savelovsky Station.  It can be found on Butyrskaya Zastava Square.  Unlike other buildings already mentioned, it looks pretty simple and concise.  It is a low two-story building in the Art Nouveau style, painted in pinkish-white tones.  Earlier, long-distance trains departed from the station, but at the turn of the century this was no longer necessary. </p><p>  Now electric trains from the station are moving to Dubna, Lobnya, Savelovo and other settlements.  The exact schedule of Moscow train stations from the list, including those departing from this station, can be obtained from the dispatcher of the help desk of the station itself by calling the telephone number on duty. </p><h2>  Riga station </h2><p>  The building appeared later and still remains one of the less crowded stations of the capital.  From this point you can go to Riga, Pskov.  The station is located on the only railway line, from where you can get to Latvia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many stations in Moscow list" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2079278.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The appearance of the building attracts with the presence of many details, patterned carvings, platbands on the windows.  In all this you can see the shades of ancient Russian architecture.  <span>A beautiful building,</span> standing parallel to the tracks, has more than once become the backdrop for Soviet and Russian films.  For example, they shot "Station for Two" - a popular film with L. Gurchenko in the title role. </p><p>  Near the tracks, an exposition of the railway museum is currently presented.  It was discovered relatively recently - in the early 2000s. </p><h2>  Belorussky railway station </h2><p>  On the <span>Tverskaya Zastava</span> square there is another Moscow station from the list - Belorussky.  According to the name, the point connects the capital of Russia with the cities of Belarus, as well as with Lithuania and some countries of Eastern Europe.  The object is considered historically significant: in 1941 it was the point from which soldiers went to fight and defend their homeland.  Later, several films dedicated to the Great Patriotic War were shot against the background of the building. </p>

    <p>  As for the style, the building combines elements of classicism and Gothic.  The color for painting the walls was chosen calm gamut of greenish shades.  Now inside, in addition to ticket offices and waiting rooms, a museum is located.  Like other station premises in Moscow, it was reconstructed and improved.  The quality of customer service is at a high level. </p><h2>  List of Moscow river stations </h2><p>  The schedule and the list of Moscow railway stations on the Moskva River can be found in the tour agencies involved in river transportation of passengers.  There are two such points in the capital city.  The Northern River Station is located on the coast of the Khimki Reservoir, next to the park.  This is another architectural monument, which all guests of the capital come to see.  It was erected in 1937.  It resembles a ship in shape; it belongs to the Stalinist Empire style.  The author of the project is A. Rukhlyadev. </p><p>  The building has a tower with a spire.  From the side of the reservoir you can see a magnificent staircase made of granite, the steps of which descend to the water.  On the facade of one of the blocks painted discs are placed.  They feature a variety of subjects: the construction of the Palace of Soviets, the development of the Arctic and others. </p><p>  The station is intended primarily for <span>cargo ships.</span>  It is also used as a point from which excursion ships leave.  South River Station is used less frequently.  Pleasure boats for tourists and vacationers also depart from there. </p>
