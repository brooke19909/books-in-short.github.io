Prices for all services depend on the chosen institution, so most prefer to stay not in the city itself, but on its outskirts, which is much cheaper and more convenient in terms of location near the sea. </p><p>  Those who like to relax in Anapa or near this city have already heard about Dzhemete.  The history of the village is not so long: it was created as a military fortification in 1828.  Over the past almost two hundred years, the settlement has not really grown - about 1000 people live here.  But in the season, the local population increases 4-5 times, or even more.  The reason for this is the convenient location of the village, because it is located almost on the seashore: from the most remote street you can reach the beach in just 8-10 minutes. </p><p>  But the best thing, of course, is to live right by the sea in order to be able to enjoy sea sunsets in the evenings, and in the mornings, having overcome only a few steps to the water's edge, immediately plunge into the waves giving coolness.  That is why, if not all, then very many visitors settle in those hotels or private houses that are built right on the beach.  One of these places is the Dzhemete Dunes Guest House.  The hotel is housed in a modern seven-story building equipped with an elevator.  There are noisy establishments nearby, which guarantees a relaxing night's rest. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

Nearby are a supermarket, food market, dolphinarium. </p><p>  Families with children are not forgotten either: in the courtyard of the hotel there is a children's playground with swings and slides, and there is a swimming pool with a children's section.  By the way, the pool is equipped with heating, so you can swim in it even on those days when it is cool outside.  In addition, animation is organized three times a month for children, where professional presenters with competent speech conduct provocative games.  Moreover, everything is organized in such an interesting and exciting way that usually not only children, but also adults are delighted with the event. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure and service </h2>

    <p>  For a complete rest, guests have a double French bed with orthopedic mattress.  In addition, there is a corner sofa, which can be used as a sleeping place for another resident - a child or an adult.  Another difference is accommodation: it is located on the sixth floor.  This allows you to admire the sea distance opening from here or the coast - depending on the location of the room. </p><h2>  Arrival and Departure Information </h2><p><strong></strong>  Estimated time - 12.00.  If for some reason the guest wants to check out later, it is possible, but such a service is paid: </p><ol><li><strong> </strong>  Departure was delayed until 18 hours - you need to pay 500 rubles. <strong></strong></li><li>  Time from 18 hours to midnight will cost half the cost of living <strong>.</strong> </li><li>  If the check-out is delayed from midnight to noon, then you need to pay an amount equal to the cost of living per day. </li></ol><p>  Check-in at the Dzhemete Dunes guest house takes place at 2 p.m., but if there is free space prepared for the new tenant, the client can check in earlier. </p><h2>  Opinions of vacationers </h2>

Reviews of those who stayed in it!  And there are a lot of them, although the institution was opened only 2 years ago.  Among the positive aspects, it was most often noted:

    <ol><li>  Perfect cleanliness both in the hotel and on site.  Dust, debris, and dirt were not noticed even on air conditioners, cabinets, and other ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù. </li><li>  Attentive, friendly staff. </li><li>  Great wifi. </li><li>  The pool is clean, there are plenty of sun loungers around it. </li><li>  The quality of service is excellent. </li><li>  Food - varied, the dishes are very tasty and fresh, the diet is planned correctly.  Chicken broth, steam cutlets, pancakes, casseroles, various cereals are cooked daily for children, and so tasty that even the most capricious ones usually eat everything.  The waiters are unobtrusive and welcoming. </li><li>  The bus stop is near the hotel, so getting here, going on excursions or shopping is very simple.  Moreover, buses and fixed-route taxis often run towards Vityazevo and Anapa. </li></ol><p>  In addition, the competent arrangement of split systems was especially emphasized.  For families who relax with children, this is of great importance. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, a small number of outlets were noted.  The power supply scheme of the rooms is arranged in such a way that you cannot leave the phone / tablet for charging in your absence, so some vacationers say that the number of outlets should be increased. </p><p>  In other words: the Dunes Dzhemete hotel is a 3-star guest house, which fully corresponds to its level and if it raises complaints, it‚Äôs not for serious reasons. </p>
