Reminder of them are only silent architectural structures and city museums.  What is remarkable about Nantes and what is definitely worth seeing in this city? </p><h2>  Modern Nantes </h2><p>  France is proud of the city - one of the first eight metropolises of the state.  In another way, Nantes is called the Metropolis of the Great West.  The city is central to the Loire department.  In terms of population, the commune ranks sixth in the country. </p><p>  The city is just a couple of hours drive from Paris.  The terrain around Nantes is swampy on one side and hilly on the other.  Small rivers of the Loire Valley encircle its territory with a dense network, which is why the city is often called Western Venice. </p><p>  The Ministry of <span>Culture of France</span> has included Nantes in the list of cities of art and history.  The area from the Buffay quarter to the marina de la Foss is the largest protected area in the state. </p>

    <h2>  Pages of history </h2><p>  The city received its name from the gall-namnets, whose tribes came to these lands more than 2 thousand years ago.  In the 9th century, the Franks and Bretons, led by the Duke of Nominoe, fought for the right to own the city.  In 939, it becomes the capital of Brittany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the <span>Loire Valley,</span> on which Nantes is located, paths crossed from Lower Brittany to Poitou.  This geographical position played an important role in the development of the city, making it a major commercial and transport center. </p><p>  Nantes became widely known during religious wars.  The urban community supported the Catholic side, refused to let the ardent Protestant Henry IV into Nantes.  In 1598, agreement was nevertheless reached by signing the Edict of Nantes.  92 clauses of the agreement confirmed the equal rights of Catholics and Protestants. </p><p>  In the XVII century in Europe, the trading scheme of the "ebony triangle".  African slaves are sent to America to grow sugarcane for England, Scandinavia and France.  Europe, in turn, exports jewelry to Africa.  The city of Nantes becomes the main <span>French port,</span> and candy and chocolate factories open one after another in the river valley. </p><p>  The abolition of slavery and the replacement of cane with sugar beets led to a decrease in trade.  The heyday of Nantes comes to an end.  The city‚Äôs second wind opens in the 19th and 20th centuries, when new harbors are built on the river. </p><h2>  City blocks </h2><p>  In architectural terms, one of the most interesting French cities is Nantes.  France was badly damaged during the war, many cities were destroyed.  Nantes managed to survive, preserving the historical heritage represented by many architectural monuments. </p><p>  Neighborhoods of the city demonstrate the architecture of different styles and eras.  The streets of Decre and Buffay are represented by medieval half-timbered wooden buildings.  Here is the main castle and the Gothic cathedral. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The building in the city center dates from the 18th century.  Famous architects Maturin Cruzi and Jean-Baptiste Seinerai were involved in the design of the buildings.  The most famous buildings here are the Chamber of Commerce (now Regional Prefecture) and the Exchange Palace. </p><p>  In the central quarters is the Marechal-Forsch Square with a 16th-century column, Royal Square.  The most crowded place in the city, as usual, is Torgovaya Ploshchad, and there is a theater on Graslin Square. </p><p>  Some rivers of <span>the Loire Valley,</span> flowing through the city, were used in 1929 as canals.  They penetrate Nantes, washing Feydo Island and Market Square with their waters. </p>

    <h2>  Castle of the dukes </h2><p>  The symbol of Brittany and the modern city of Nantes is the Castle of the Dukes of Breton.  Guy de Tuar began building the castle in 1207.  In the XV century, the appearance of the castle was somewhat changed.  Seven castle towers are interconnected by curtains.  A bypass road is open along the ramparts.  Outside the building is surrounded by a moat with water, inside there are buildings dating from the XV ‚Äì XVIII centuries. </p><p>  The castle has long served as the residence for the Dukes of Brittany.  Within its walls, <span>Anna of Breton</span> was born <span>,</span> and the Edict of Nantes was signed.  The view of the castle changed during the reign of Anna of Breton.  On her orders, coats of arms and superstructures in the form of balconies were placed on the fortress. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, the ancient walls served as a barracks, and during the Second World War, the Nazis built a bunker in the castle.  In the 90s of the XX century, the fortress was reconstructed.  Now here is the Nantes History Museum, where photographs, historical documents and multimedia materials are presented. </p>

    <p>  The estate of the famous navigator Thomas Dobre now houses the museum of the same name, which presents antique items, furniture and weapons.  The Museum of Fine Arts exhibits are represented by paintings and sculptures of the 12th-19th centuries. </p><p>  In 2007, the open-air museum "Machines of the Island of Nantes" was opened.  France became famous not only thanks to its historical heritage, but also due to the amazing creative project of Pierre Orefis and Francois Delarozier. </p><p>  Some metal structures are driven.  An elephant 12 meters high carries up to 52 passengers on its back.  The huge merry-go-round ‚ÄúSea Worlds‚Äù is able to ride 800 people at a time.  Guests of the island can walk along the branches of the ‚ÄúHeron Tree‚Äù, which is 47 meters in diameter, and sit near huge metal birds. </p>
