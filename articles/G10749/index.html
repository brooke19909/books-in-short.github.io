Nevertheless, the most advanced tourists have long chosen this corner of the Finnish land, finding for themselves a lot of interesting, informative and fascinating.  This article will focus on a city called Oulu (Finland). </p><h2>  Quick reference </h2><p>  The village is located in the center of the province of the same name, which is located in the north-west of the state, in the Gulf of Bothnia of the Baltic Sea.  The city is the fifth largest land of Suomi.  The city of Oulu was founded in 1605, and therefore it is rightfully considered the oldest in all of Northern Finland.  The population is in the range of 140 thousand.  Sex ratio: 51% are women, 49% are men. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oulu Finland" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1342293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Oulu is a subarctic climate zone, which, in turn, is characterized by sufficiently snowy and cold winters.  Summer is warm, but not too long.  The average annual temperature is -2.7 degrees Celsius.  Over the year, 508 millimeters of rain fall in this tourist center.  Moreover, the bulk of them occur in late summer and autumn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the shops of Oulu (Finland).  It should be noted that for the local population, trade is an essential part of life.  As evidence of this fact, you can specify a monument to the Market Police officer, which is installed on the central trading floor of the city, immediately before the entrance to the shopping arcade.  The monument has been mounted for a long time, and now it is not an ordinary statue, but a real symbol of the city.  A policeman figurine as a souvenir can be bought on almost every corner, as it is very popular in Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Finland" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1342295.jpg" width="600"></div>
