The city is located in the intermountain pit, almost at the very northern border, on the banks of the Vardar River. </p><p>  The capital of Macedonia has an amazing, dramatic history.

After about a hundred years, Emperor Domitian founded the colony of Flavia Elia Scoopy on this site.  That is why the name of the capital has an ancient antique sound.  The village of Skopje was beautiful: many temples and magnificent palaces, fountains and markets ... But in 518 an earthquake hit it that destroyed Skupi.  Gradually, the city was restored, since then the year of foundation of Skopje is considered to be 518.

    <p>  Today, the capital of Macedonia is home to 860 thousand people.  As before, ancient traditions are respected and cultural heritage is maintained.  These facts contributed to the fact that Skopje is one of the most interesting cities in the world, and many international agencies offer tours here.  Macedonia combines the incongruous.  Despite the fact that the 1963 earthquake destroyed most of the historical monuments, the Middle Ages and Turkish rule were reflected in modern cities.  An example is the small church of San Salvador, built in the seventeenth century and having an amazing iconostasis.  Another of the most beautiful buildings of the medieval period is a stone bridge, built in the middle of the 15th century in the very center of the city.  Currently, it connects the two banks of the river and is intended exclusively for hiking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Macedonia" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/16070.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Another attraction from the past is the Saat Kula Clock Tower.  At one time, the Turks brought a watch from Sighet and installed it on the tower.  Their battle was heard for several kilometers.  During fires and earthquakes, the structure was destroyed, so it was restored several times, but it was not possible to restore the watch. </p><p>  The capital of Macedonia became famous for its fortress Kale, which was built in 518, after a natural disaster.  Blocks of the destroyed city served as material for its construction.  In the modern world, it is one of the most visited places by tourists. </p><p>  Wars, earthquakes, political confusion in 1991 left their mark on the historical and cultural development of the Republic of Macedonia.  Skopje is currently the seat of the president, government and parliament. </p>
