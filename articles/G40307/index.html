This hobby can grow into a business of making things for sale.  You can also make furniture to order for money. </p><h2>  Decoupage.  What can be done? </h2><p>  Thanks to extensive research, almost everything can be decoupage.  Besides, of course, food.  What is needed for decoupage?  About it further.  But first, let's say that there are a huge number of types of materials that can be used for crafts.  This is wood, and plastic, metal (yes, metal!), And ceramics, and paper.  The materials used can be purchased at specialized stores.  And if you have a tiny budget, almost everything can be found in your apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What materials are needed for decoupage?" class="if uuid-2413868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413868.jpg"></div><h2>  Glue </h2><p>  What materials are needed for decoupage?  Glue.  To make a decoupage of an item, whether it is furniture, home decor or clothing, you will need glue.  There are many options.  And everyone has advantages and disadvantages.  Do I need to use a certain type of glue for decoupage?  No, here the choice will depend on the type of work you are doing.  Best of all, good old PVA glue.  It has been used since school.  Or you can use diluted glue - either clerical or ‚Äúdry‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paper </h2><p>  Need to use special decoupage paper?  Not.  You can use almost everything - newspaper clippings, brown paper and even some types of fabrics.  You can use photos.  But it‚Äôs best to make high-quality photocopies that are easier to work with.  The golden rule is - the finer the better.  You can also use: </p><ul><li>  candy wrappers; </li><li>  foil; </li><li>  postcards; </li><li>  cards; </li><li>  a newspaper; </li><li>  old magazines; </li><li>  brochures. </li></ul><h2>  Napkins </h2><p>  What napkins are needed for decoupage?  Externally, wipes are the same as ordinary ones that are used in everyday life.  The only difference is the ornament.  It should be bright, original.  Napkins are single, double and triple.  The most important thing is thin paper.  The thinner the better the image will look.  When decorating, only the top layer of napkins is used, which is varnished.  When buying napkins, it is best to purchase several identical copies.  So you can create many original kits.  When purchasing a three-layer napkin, use only the top bright layer, previously coating it with varnish.  It turns out an original idea for the decor of a vase, flowerpot or dish.  It is advisable to choose napkins with large patterns that do not get your hands dirty. </p><p>  Napkins can be too delicate for work, cloth can also be used.  This is a fantastic alternative and excellent material that can be used on furniture designs and craft projects.  When working on a large object using decoupage fabric, you can create an amazing result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvyhomemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is needed for decoupage for beginners?" class="if uuid-2413869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413869.jpg"></div><h2>  Other materials and tools </h2><p>  What other materials and tools are still used? </p><ol><li>  Textured wallpaper.  Using wallpaper for decoupage can add a unique feature to the product. </li><li>  Quality scissors.  The main thing is that they are sharp.  Get different sizes, from the smallest to the largest. </li><li>  Brushes.  It is best to use not large brushes, a couple of centimeters wide. </li><li>  Lacquer.  What varnish is needed for decoupage?  Such funds are matte and glossy.  The main difference is that matte varnish will add dullness, the products will resemble those that were old, and glossy makes the appearance shiny. </li></ol><h2>  Necessary elements for work </h2><p>  What is needed for decoupage for beginners?  List of materials that are useful: </p><ol><li>  Several types of varnish.  For example, it can be matte, glossy, with sparkles and others. </li><li>  Primer.  It will help level the surface before starting work. </li><li>  Skin.  It will help to smooth out a rough surface. </li><li>  Rhinestones.  They will give originality to the work. </li><li>  Acrylic paints.  They will help to complement the composition. </li><li>  A set of brushes of different sizes (for convenience in work, depending on the size of the object). </li></ol><h2>  Tips for Beginners </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvyhomemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage Materials" class="if uuid-2413870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413870.jpg"></div><p>  What is needed for decoupage (the list is presented above)?  We have already figured this out.  And what materials can you work with in this technique and how to do it?  Now we will tell.  Depending on the surface, there are some features of the coating: </p><ol><li>  Wood - grinding is required, it is necessary to wipe, and then you can apply a primer or base coat. </li><li>  Metal - wash with soap and water, and then wipe with a damp cloth dipped in white vinegar.  After that, you can apply a base coat. </li><li>  Canvas - wipe and then add primer. </li><li>  Glass / Ceramics - Wash with soap and water.  Wipe with a damp cloth moistened with alcohol. </li></ol><h2>  The best tips for cutting and gluing </h2><p>  Where possible, cut with a sharp blade and at a slight angle to get a beveled edge.  This will give a smoother edge after gluing. </p><p>  When curling the paper before applying the adhesive, cracks will appear for the adhesive to penetrate.  This avoids air bubbles.  Apply glue with a wet brush - this will allow to dry without any brush strokes.  Use your fingers to smooth the paper.  Apply glue with a thin layer and very little when working on glass.  If the layer is too thick, it will become a piece.  Because glass is not a porous material. </p><h2>  Top Finishing Tips </h2><p>  After the product is completely dry, you can apply varnish - a couple of layers will help protect the paper.  With more layers, there will be more shine and the paper will begin to look as if it is painted.  You can use PVA glue or special varnish.  Lacquer is good for objects such as furniture, which can be slightly scratched.  In the process, do not allow dust to hit the object, otherwise it will remain there forever! </p><h2>  Troubleshooting tips </h2><p>  Are there any bubbles?  Use a damp cloth to smooth them until the glue is still dry. </p><p>  Are the edges rising?  Take a toothpick, lift the edge and apply another layer of glue.  Smooth as usual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvyhomemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage Tools" class="if uuid-2413872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413872.jpg"></div><h2>  Step 1. Choosing what decoupage awaits </h2><p>  So, the materials are prepared, what is needed for decoupage?  First decide which element you want to convert.  You can create art on a blank canvas made of wood, plastic, metal, ceramic or paper.  You can also convert old furniture.  What else can you do?  It can be picture frames, buckets, photo albums, shelves, vases, boxes, candles and even gym shoes. </p><h2>  Step 2. Preparation </h2><p>  Whatever item you choose, it should be clean, free of dust and dirt.  If you want to draw some kind of drawing on an object, do it at least twenty-four hours before you start decoupage. </p><h2>  Step 3. Prepare decoration materials </h2><p>  After you have selected an element, you need to decide what you will use to cover it.  Despite the literal meaning of the name, decoupage should not be limited to just cutting.  You can use images from magazines or books, wrapping paper, wallpaper, tissue paper or even fabric.  Craft shops even sell custom-made decoupage paper.  If you have a good printer, then print pictures or personal photos on it.  Note that when cutting patterns, be sure to use sharp scissors or a blade.  Tilt the cutting edge slightly towards the outside.  So you make a beveled edge on paper and avoid hard, rough edges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wearethought.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What varnish is needed for decoupage?" class="if uuid-2413882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413882.jpg"></div><h2>  Step 4. Organization of materials </h2><p>  After you cut out all the photos, decide how you will organize them.  Pictures can be laid out in any order and even overlap.  Be creative in this business.  Keep in mind that at this stage nothing sticks together.  Therefore, if you do not like the location of the cutouts, just change them.  If you want to change something after you have already done some bonding, most materials will come off using water if you do this before the product is varnished. </p><h2>  Decoupage bottles </h2><p>  What is needed for bottle decoupage? </p><ol><li>  Scraps of colorful patterned paper. </li><li>  Purified glass bottles or jars. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Soft brush. </li><li>  Scissors (optional). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wearethought.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What napkins are needed for decoupage?" class="if uuid-2413880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413880.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instructions for transforming the bottle </h2><ol><li>  Wash the glass bottle or jug ‚Äã‚Äãby placing it in hot water and removing any labels.  Then wipe dry. </li><li>  Collect scraps of patterned paper.  This can be a different paper - wrapping paper, napkins, greeting cards, clippings of magazines, a beautiful notebook or pages from books. </li><li>  Work quickly, apply a thin layer of glue to a portion of the surface of the glass using a soft brush. </li><li>  Use the same brush to pick up a piece of paper - to prevent glue from getting on your hands.  You can tear up all the paper in advance or use scissors if necessary. </li><li>  Place the paper on the glass and smooth the creases by applying another layer of glue on top. </li><li>  Continue adding paper until the bottle is completely covered.  Then leave for 1-2 hours. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wearethought.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is needed for bottle decoupage?" class="if uuid-2413883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2413883.jpg"></div><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  If there is a problem with creasing or bubbles appear, do not paint the paper until the glue dries.  This will minimize the ingress of air under the material.  You can experiment with a small cut-out floral print, draw over pasted paper, or even add decorations such as lace, flowers, or ribbon. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Remember that decoupage offers endless possibilities for imagination.  At low cost and minimal effort, a simple thing can become an exclusive masterpiece. </p>
