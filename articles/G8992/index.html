  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of personality in sociology as a conscious member of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Man is the most amazing creature of nature, which seeks to know himself.  His interest in his origin and development does not run low over time, and sociological discoveries are increasingly prompting action in this area.  What does the <span>concept of personality</span> include in sociology?  This article will devote to the popular disclosure of this issue. </p><p>  All concepts of personality in sociology are dedicated to understanding the true <span>essence of man.</span>  And although it seems to us that everything lies on the surface, the more complex question of who to be considered a person and who not, perhaps does not exist.  After all, a person is similar to animals in many ways, but leads a special lifestyle that is not available to his younger brothers.  And this applies not only to upright posture, the weakness of many feelings and instincts, physical strength and inability to external, natural factors.  More striking differences lie in the <span>structure of the</span> brain, which forces a person to make informed decisions in a given situation, as well as in the properties of self-control. </p><p>  The typology of personality in sociology is based on the fact that a person turns into a personality not just like that, but thanks to a bodily-mental organization that encourages creativity to achieve a goal.  This is facilitated by the level of development of speech and writing, the ability to generalize the properties of phenomena and develop natural wealth to create new cultural phenomena. </p><p>  All concepts of personality in sociology are associated with its social properties.  For an individual to become a person, he needs to live and act in human society.  Indeed, the concept of personality in sociology is defined as the subject of relations and conscious activity, which has stable qualities of socially significant traits.  In this regard, the typology of personality in sociology distinguishes two types of characteristics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the first case, it is an active participant in actions that are determined by him freely and are aimed at cognizing and changing the world.  Such a person has the ability to independently determine their lifestyle and give self-esteem to their actions and individual capabilities.  She lives and acts in accordance with social and moral standards, has a critical mind, controls herself and her actions, bears responsibility for them and is well oriented in the current situation, finding the right way to solve the problem. </p><p>  Another concept of personality in sociology is considered through that set of functions and roles assigned to him in society.  Through them, he manifests himself and acts in accordance with the arising situations and circumstances.  An example is two different relationships between senior and younger members of the tribal system and modern society. </p><p>  At the same time performing several roles, for example, employee, family man, athlete and others, the person commits such acts in which he manifests himself consciously and actively, but in different ways.  He may be a good family man, but not a very diligent worker, and vice versa.  A true person cannot be indifferent to any side of his life.  She does not allow indifference and indifference. </p><p>  Both aspects of the definition of modern personality are closely interconnected.  Role-based definition involves human interaction with society.  A person cannot love, work and feel outside of society.  His qualities are manifested only in this area. </p><p>  Thus, the concept of personality in sociology identifies the essential characteristics associated with its properties in connection with the historical formation, social affiliation, <span>national character</span> and professional activities. </p>
