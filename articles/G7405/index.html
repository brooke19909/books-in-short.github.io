    <h2>  The coordinates of a small village </h2><p>  One of the most economical and comfortable options is Mahmutlar.  Turkey is full of such inconspicuous towns, but most tourists are eager for large resorts.  Here, due to the relative distance from international routes, prices are relatively low even in high season.  Mahmutlar on the map of Turkey hid not so far from the fashionable Antalya - only 160 km.  And from the traditional airport for arrival to Mahmutlar even closer - 135 km. </p><h2>  What is the best way to get there? </h2><p>  The most convenient way to get to the village is by car or transfer bus.  A straight straight road (as far as it can be straight in the mountains) will not cause problems, and a view of the emerald waters of the sea and pine-covered mountainsides will brighten up the travel time.  From Alanya you need to overcome another 10-15 km - and here it is, Mahmutlar.  Turkey is famous for its resorts, and this village is one of the many tiny gems on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Soon a new airport will open in Gazipasa.  From it the road to Mahmutlar (Turkey) is even shorter - only 30 km.  The authorities also promise the appearance of a <span>high-speed train,</span> which will connect Antalya and Alanya with a direct flight.  So there are many opportunities to get to Mahmutlar. </p><p>  The road from Alanya to Mahmutlar can be mastered on foot - especially when you consider that all 10 km of the route will be near a clean, well-kept sandy beach and parks.  In the opposite direction, in the direction of Gazipasha, the beach is not too kindly paid attention of the administration.  Lovers of natural pristine nature will enjoy it.  Additionally, you can admire the banana plantations, which were deployed by enterprising locals directly on the mountain slopes. </p>

    <h2>  Attractive outback </h2><p>  Mahmutlar - Turkey, although provincial, but quite civilized.  Yes, and it can be called a settlement only conditionally.  Up to 40,000 inhabitants live here, about half of them are Europeans.  By the number of real estate acquired by foreigners, Mahmutlar is in first place among Turkish cities.  In this regard, he left far behind both Antalya and Istanbul.  Mahmutlar is the only place in Turkey where there are fewer indigenous people than foreign migrants.  Which is not at all surprising - a small, fairly young and actively growing city, where from the farthest street to the sea no more than 15 minutes on foot, cannot fail to attract clients of real estate agencies.  And how can the path to the sea be long if the whole Mahmutlar, as well as nearby towns, is the central highway and a couple of parallel cozy streets? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mahmutlar has never been an industrial center.  The main area of ​​activity of the settlers is the tourism business and agriculture, so there are no environmental problems here.  In addition to the opportunity to walk through the fields and gardens, this guarantees tourists perfectly clean air. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The resort village is warm, like the rest of Turkey.  The weather in Mahmutlar is rarely cold.  Even in January, the temperature does not fall below + 7 ° C at night and + 15 ° C during the day.  It is hotter here in July and August - about + 30 ° C, and the water warms up to + 27 ° C during the season. </p><p>  Choosing the best hotel does not make much sense.  Almost all of them are kept at a stable good level, although they do not shine with delights.  The most famous places for tourists are hotels with 4 stars Klas, Happy Elegant, Xeno Alpina and Bone Club SVS.  In each, a foreigner will receive a decent room in a multi-story building, a small recreation area adjacent to the hotel, and a pebble beach.  Another advantage is low prices, which, combined with a decent level of service, make these hotels the most attractive for visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Hiding places </h2><p>  In addition to the beaches for leisure and the adjacent well-kept parks with lovely fountains, in Mahmutlar you can find many attractive and mysterious places for walking.  Entire groves of banana and <span>orange trees</span> beckon in their shadow, and the fruits can be enjoyed right on the spot.  At every step - ancient churches or mosques, the remains of settlements destroyed centuries ago.  Periodically, during the construction of new buildings, if not a treasure, then a sarcophagus or other artifacts of antiquity is found.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the ancient cities of Siedra and Laertes in the vicinity of Mahmutlar, where there are beautifully preserved mosques and Caravanserai. </p>

    <h2>  Corners of paradise </h2><p>  Another local attraction deserves special attention - the Dimchay River.  Beginning its journey high in the mountains, near the ancient city of Konya, a stream along the steep mountain slopes tends to the Mediterranean Sea.  Dimchay may not be too famous, but the lack of high-profile fame does not make the river less attractive.  Near Mahmutlar in Dimchay, a salt cave and the same salt lake formed.  From all sides this corner is surrounded by <span>stalactites and stalagmites.</span>  Walking among the limestone formations, it is quite possible to imagine yourself in deep dungeons somewhere in the north.  However, it is still warm Turkey, Mahmutlar.  Every self-respecting tourist should bring a photo from the background of caves, ancient geological structures and bright greenery from vacation.  The value of a mountain river is not only aesthetic, but also quite practical.  Dimchaya teems with trout in clear water.  Satisfied with impressions, a foreigner will certainly go to a local fish restaurant to satisfy his physical hunger. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As in any typical resort town, in Mamutlar no one is in a hurry.  Here it is customary to slowly and fully enjoy your vacation, relaxing on sunny beaches or in a pleasant chill on the park benches.  For tourists who are tired of lying motionless on the sand and just fans of an active lifestyle, Mahmutlar is full of not only fitness centers, but also city sports grounds with exercise machines, horizontal bars and other sportsman's joys </p><p>  Fans of bargaining with truly oriental ardor can be advised to look at the local bazaar.  They arrange it twice a week, and from the goods available only local fruits, vegetables, shoes and clothes.  And, of course, mountains of souvenirs.  Experienced buyers are advised to come to the market in the late afternoon.  The choice, of course, is narrowing somewhat.  However, the benefits of a late visit are incomparably greater - there is no fuss and bustle, the hot sun of Turkey does not tire out anymore, and traders rushing home, become much more accommodating and generous with discounts. </p><p>  Along the local park, Barbaros Avenue stretches, where in the summer it is full of artists and artisans vying to offer all the same souvenirs - knitted clothes, clay utensils, jewelry and more original pumpkin trinkets.  A special kind of local souvenir is "ancient coins."  Of course, you can buy them.  But it is worthwhile to understand that in 99% of cases the real age of a souvenir money is a week or two, no more. </p><p>  Those who prefer "European" shopping and large shopping centers should head towards Alanya.  Alanyum, Kipa and Metro are on the way to the neighboring town - shops familiar to western tourists.  It accepts credit cards, local lira, euros and dollars.  Although the last two currencies are more profitable to exchange in advance - here, away from "civilization", the exchange rate is far from the most attractive. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  According to legend, Queen Cleopatra was especially fond of Mahmutlar.  Turkey with all its charms and beauties was at the feet of the ruler, however, it was this paradise with golden sands that insidious, pretending to be dying, begged Mark Anthony from.  Along with Mahmutlar, Alanya and all the surrounding beaches, groves and gardens became the property of the Egyptian queen.  Turkey lies between 4 seas.  But the longest beaches and the purest gold of sand are here in Mahmutlar.  The name of one of the local beaches of Altyn Kum speaks for itself.  Translated, it means nothing other than "Golden Sand". <br>  A piece of paradise on earth that anyone can afford is what Mahmutlar, Turkey is.  Reviews about this resort village on the Mediterranean Sea cannot be contradictory.  Comfortable, inexpensive and exciting - the general opinion that has developed among foreigners who have visited Mahmutlar. </p>
