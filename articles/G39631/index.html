Previously, you had to personally visit a banking institution, spend a lot of time in line, and also collect a lot of documents.  Now, in many banks, an application for a consumer loan <span>can be</span> <span>issued</span> <span>on the site, so you do not need to spend time visiting the office.</span>  <span>The main thing is to provide reliable information, because they are still checked.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="kirov-portal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="get a consumer loan without information and guarantors" class="if uuid-2489734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2489734.jpg"></div><p>  The application is considered in a short time.  It all depends on the term, the amount chosen by the organization.  For example, in Sberbank an application for a loan secured by real estate is considered 10 working days, and in the Agricultural Bank - 5. The decision is usually communicated by SMS or by <span>phone.</span> </p><p>  Many things can be obtained on credit right in the store.  But this method has a significant drawback - high rates.  Although for regular and conscientious customers, more favorable conditions apply. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  Today, there are many methods of paying debt for customers.  You can make a monthly payment, partially or fully pay the amount through: </p><ul><li>  branch of a financial organization; </li><li>  partner bank branch; </li><li>  ATM; </li><li>  The Internet; </li><li>  mobile banking. </li></ul><p>  Each payment method has its own rules, but among them there is still the most profitable one.  It is possible to activate a service in which the bank itself will debit the payment from a salary or credit card.  This is even more convenient, because you will not need to waste time sending. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Consumer lending is in demand.  Its main advantages include: </p><ol><li>  The ability to draw up a contract for a long period and for a large amount. </li><li>  The response on the application is provided within 1-10 days. </li><li>  Convenient repayment methods. </li><li>  Minimum documents. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.tututix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apply for consumer cash loan" class="if uuid-2489199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2489199.jpg"></div><p>  But still this service has its drawbacks.  This is an increased misuse rate.  Therefore, if the funds are needed for a major purchase - the purchase of a car or apartment, it is advisable to choose targeted lending. </p><p>  Thus, although consumer lending is considered to be profitable, nevertheless, when applying, you need to consider your financial capabilities.  Only after evaluating the important nuances regarding the processing of a loan, it is necessary to make a decision. </p>
