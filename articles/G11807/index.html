    <p>  We will talk about the most famous recreation centers so that you can make your choice and go on a vacation next summer. </p><h2>  The youngest recreation center Shchurovo - base "Forget-me-not" </h2><p>  Quite small, but very comfortable, it will gladly open the doors for its guests.  It works all year round, giving people the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of each season.  Pine forest, fresh air and ringing silence - isn't that why we are trying to get out of the city?  They place tourists in cozy white-stone cottages.  Double or quadruple rooms are at your service.  For a friendly company there are large six-bed apartments.  And if you want privacy, then we advise you to rent a separate house, which is designed for four people. </p><p>  On the territory there is an amazing Russian bathhouse, billiards, a dining room and a wonderful children's town.  As already mentioned, this is a new recreation center Shchurovo.  The Forget-Me-Not base was built with love for people and nature.  Located between centuries-old pine trees, it organically blended into the life of the forest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Entertainment for guests </h2><p>  While the children are busy on the territory (and there are many opportunities here - bicycles and rollers, chess and tennis, cartoons and pools), you can go camping.  Today, the administration of the base offers an amazing weekend tour - rafting on the river.  It has nothing to do with extreme rafting.  This is a family event during which you can admire the beauty of the river bed. </p>

    <p>  This is a very welcoming, green and amazingly cozy place where you are expected at any time of the year.  The local beach is very happy - the cleanest and most beautiful in the whole territory of Shchurovo (recreation center).  "Pine" most often becomes the choice of beach lovers.  It has everything you need - a large number of umbrellas and deck chairs, tents and mushrooms, fine sand and a smooth descent to the water.  This is especially important for those who are going to relax with their children.  The beach here is quite small, but there are not too many people here.

In addition, small and cozy wooden log cabins are scattered throughout the base, under the arches of which it is so wonderful to listen to how autumn rain is knocking, or to watch how snow is falling.  And in the summer you can go to the site in front of the house and sit in a cozy gazebo. </p>
