    <h2>  First steps </h2><p>  At the dawn of its formation, Soviet diplomacy was significantly different from that known by world politicians and ordinary people.  There were no trained professional diplomats, and people from activists and public figures had to be involved in this work.  There was a need for translators to competently represent the interests of a young country.  The first diplomats did not have special ranks and did not represent authority for the entire diplomatic service.  Over time, the number of diplomatic contacts and missions in other countries only increased.  This gradually made it possible to bring the USSR to the arena of foreign relations and establish radically new international relations. </p>

    <h2>  Features of USSR diplomacy </h2><p>  Over time, diplomacy took on certain characteristics and developed its own principles for negotiating.  In addition, taking into account changes in the balance of power in the international arena, it was necessary to change the main tasks and goals in order to strengthen the position of the Soviet Union in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modern Russia could take advantage of the knowledge and practical skills of Soviet diplomacy.  This is especially true for the high professionalism of personnel of that time and activity for the good of the national interests of the country. </p><h2>  Documents </h2>

    <p>  The ‚Äúfirst sign‚Äù in the documentation of diplomatic bodies was the Decree of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets in 1917.  Its provisions created the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.  It was a standard organ of a young Soviet country, because such bodies were also created in other areas - the economy, economy, and the army. </p><p>  The Constitution of 1918 gave a clear definition to the department, and it was called the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Foreign Affairs.  The new rulers understood the need to represent and promote the interests of the created state on the world stage. </p><h2>  Difficulties of diplomacy </h2><p>  But it was not so simple, because the young state for a long time remained unrecognized by other countries.  Civil war and military intervention took place in its territories.  This was the reason that consular missions abroad were immediately liquidated and consuls sent back to their homeland.  No one wanted to ratify the newly created state, and there were no good reasons for this.  The situation in the Soviet Union was incomprehensible to the end, and the new authorities were not able to prove their authenticity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But general disarmament and peace policies demanded a more loyal attitude towards the institution of Soviet diplomacy.  And at the end of 1919, the VII Congress of Soviets recommended that Entente participants begin new negotiations on a peaceful settlement, which became the reason for the active work of the new diplomatic bodies of the Soviet Union in this direction. </p><h2>  First consulates </h2><p>  This served as the beginning of a new round in relations between countries, and finally the Soviet Union managed to establish the first diplomatic ties. </p><p>  New conditions dictated new requirements, and the participation of Soviet diplomats in the international arena became simply a necessity.  In 1922, the USSR first participated in an international conference in Genoa.  Its result was the <span>Rapallo Agreement</span> on International Cooperation with Germany.  After that, Soviet Russia expanded its diplomatic relations through the opening of consulates in Europe and the Mediterranean. </p><h2>  Prewar diplomacy </h2><p>  Who is Evgeny Zabrodin?  What role did he play in the development of Soviet diplomacy? </p><p>  With the beginning of the 30s, a new era began in the establishment of recognition of the Soviet Union in the world.  Over time, it became clear that a new conflict could not be avoided, because new regimes required the redistribution of territory and the spread of their ideology. </p><p>  One of these figures was Yevgeny Zabrodin, whose biography is closely connected with the diplomatic life of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Position in Japan </h2><p>  Diplomat Evgeny Zabrodin graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies and in 1936 entered the diplomatic service.  Appropriate education predetermined the beginning of his career.  Evgeny Zabrodin received a post in the Soviet Embassy in Japan.  His activities were closely connected with this country and diplomacy on the part of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <p>  During the Second World War, the diplomat worked intermittently in the Central Office of the USSR People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs and in Japan. </p><p>  For almost 10 years of service, Eugene Zabrodin established himself as a responsible and professional specialist and already in 1945 he took the post of deputy head of the II Far Eastern Department of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, and in 1950 became its head. </p><p>  Moving up the career ladder, he managed to work in Indonesia, Nepal and Japan. </p><h2>  Russian-Japanese relations </h2><p>  The headquarters of the Kwantung Army in 1938 developed a plan of war against the USSR.  In general, from 1936 until the outbreak of hostilities on Lake Hassan, the military forces of Japan and Manchuria committed more than 200 violations of the borders of the Soviet Union, some even escalated into military battles.  This greatly intensified relations between countries.  The fact that these conflicts did not result in more serious clashes is a merit of all Soviet diplomacy as a whole. </p><p>  Evgeny Zabrodin in these years worked as an employee of the USSR Embassy in Japan.  A diplomat will connect his work with this country for a long time, right up to the end of World War II. </p><p>  The presence of the ambassadors of the USSR in the country was extremely important, because Japan tried in every possible way to unite with Nazi Germany and Italy. </p><p>  Together, the Soviet Union managed to defer the Japanese attack and sign a neutrality pact. </p><h2>  Russian-Nepalese relations </h2>

    <p>  Evgeny Grigoryevich Zabrodin worked the longest as an ambassador extraordinary plenipotentiary in Nepal.  This was an active period in the development of Russian-Nepalese relations.  In 1959, a number of agreements were signed by countries that were aimed at providing technical and economic free assistance in the construction of industrial facilities, hospitals and power plants. </p><p>  Evgeny Zabrodin acted as the discoverer of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Nepal, which in those years was undergoing a transformation of the monarchical system. </p>
