So, the developer of Android devices introduced the world to a new device at an affordable price.  This is a smartphone <span>Lenovo K3</span> Note, a review of which will be the basis of this article.  Its cost in the online store of the company is only $ 150, while the functionality and capabilities of the model went far beyond this price segment. </p><p>  What is this smartphone, what technical characteristics does it have, finally, what kind of reviews can be found on the Internet - all this you will learn from our article. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The model is really offered to customers as a budget, more affordable version of a productive and powerful smartphone from a Chinese developer.  However, there is nothing wrong with the fact that the country of origin of the model is China.  Build quality, stability and the level of components themselves indicate that the device is worthy of us.  A brief overview of the characteristics, taking into account the price of Lenovo K3 Note White, makes it possible to note a really attractive ratio of quality and price of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The model is offered in the original box from a simple, matte with yellowness cardboard.  It indicates the name of the manufacturer and a brief information in Chinese.  There are no official deliveries of the phone to Russia, so no one will adapt such details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Opening the box with the Lenovo K3 Note K50, you can see the device itself, instructions (written in hieroglyphs), as well as a set of adapter and cord for connecting the smartphone to a PC.  No other accessories or additional options were found with the device. </p><h2>  Design and Build </h2><p>  The body design of the device does not contain anything original, but is presented in a somewhat unusual form for Lenovo.  So, the entire back part, as well as the side faces of the smartphone, are united by one plastic cover.  The front part is a protective glass under which the display hides.  Thus, the apparatus consists, like a sandwich, of two layers stacked together.  Although this does not prevent the phone case from being monolithic and tightly knocked down. </p>

    <p>  The texture of the mentioned cover is also quite pleasant to the touch - it is matte, due to which the phone lies comfortably in the hand.  Three combinations will be on sale - yellow, black and white.  And in general, all dimensions of <span>Lenovo K3</span> Note (the review proves it once again) are selected as accurately as possible and beneficial to the user.  Thus, the smartphone is really easy to use. </p><p>  The navigation buttons located on the sides of the device are attached directly to the back cover.  Having removed the latter, it will not be possible to fully control the model.  In addition to the side, there are also stationary navigation elements located on the front of the case.  These are the physical keys of the ‚Äústandard set‚Äù, which are located under the display, hidden by a protective glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  By the way, speaking of the model‚Äôs display, it should be noted a somewhat enlarged (by the standards of the usual 5 inches) screen, whose size is 5.5 inches.  The display operates on the basis of IPS technology, so the colors of the Lenovo K3 Note smartphone gives out saturated and moderately bright.  The clarity of the picture is also quite high - it is about 400 pixels per inch with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels. </p>

    <p>  Around the display on the smartphone is visible the frame, the thickness of which at the widest point is 18 mm.  At the same time, due to the dark color and large size of the phone, visually it is quite a bit noticeable. </p><p>  The display feels up to 5 simultaneous touches;  in addition, it can be unlocked by brief double tapping. </p><p>  The software part of the brightness adjustment is the presence of special settings.  They are able to switch the mode of changing the degree of illumination of the display (between manual and ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù). </p><p>  The display of the smartphone, of course, is protected by a special scratch and damage-resistant glass.  In addition, we can positively note a special anti-reflective coating that increases the comfort of working with the model. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The device operates on the basis of <span>MediaTek MT6752</span> - an eight-core processor that can play rather bulky games and applications smoothly, without delays or freezes.  The clock frequency of each core can reach 1.7 GHz.  The amount of RAM is 2 GB, which confirms the high performance of the device.  Despite the fact that such a technical stuffing, like MTK chips, is designed to work with mid-class devices, in some of their functionality they are not inferior to the ‚Äútop-end‚Äù solutions from Qualcomm, although they have a lower cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Speaking about the technical platform, I would like to mention the phone's memory.  So, 16 GB are preinstalled on the device (of which only 10 are available directly for placing user files).  Of course, the gadget supports a slot for installing micro-SD - a memory card that allows you to significantly expand the disk space of the model. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The device has two cameras.  The resolution of one is 13 megapixels, the other is 5 megapixels.  There are no flashes, which could illuminate the photographing area somewhat, the device has a special software option that gives the pictures brighter tones. </p><p>  The quality of the pictures, judging by the reviews of buyers of the device, is quite good.  Not the last role in this is played by automatic focusing and a color stabilization system. </p><p>  On the positive side, the presence of various filters and color combinations can be characterized to further change the quality of the image.  On the one hand, they do not overly complicate the camera interface, thus, do not create difficulties in using the device, on the other hand, you can quickly change the image for publication on social networks beyond recognition. </p><p>  Perhaps a negative moment in the camera‚Äôs operation is the presence of ‚Äúblur zones‚Äù.  If you look at individual pictures, some of them are noticeable with less accuracy of drawing than the photo as a whole.  For ordinary users, this defect is not always noticeable, and experts say that the problem is most likely in the software flaw of the camera. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the device turned out to be budgetary, it still supports work in 2G / 3G and LTE-format networks.  Therefore, if you live in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãa high-speed Internet connection network, this device can easily turn into a device for surfing the Internet and downloading materials, including films and TV shows, in a matter of minutes. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the GSM module, the phone also has a Bluetooth adapter, as well as Wi-Fi for working with stationary wireless networks.  The phone works with two SIM cards, switching between them is quite simple - a special settings menu is provided for this. </p><p>  Complaints about how the navigation system works on the smartphone also cannot arise - although Lenovo K3 Note Teana only supports GPS connection, the location of the gadget is determined in a minute. </p><p>  In addition to the above, there is also a system of magnetic field sensors that act as a virtual compass, correcting data on the location of the device. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  On the phone we are describing, it is installed, as expected, the Android OS most relevant at the time of the release of the version - Lollipop 5.0.  In addition, the device has an option that allows you to update software via a Wi-Fi connection, depending on the availability of a more recent version.  So, for example, as soon as your Lenovo K3 Note is connected to the Internet, its firmware will begin to be updated to the new version. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAbove‚Äù the specified system, the smartphone also has a Lenovo-developed interface called Vibe UI.  Outwardly, it is somewhat different from the original Android, and in terms of logic and device, in some moments it is even simpler and more understandable. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If you look for recommendations and specifications left about the Lenovo K3 Note Yellow, you can meet a lot of positive points that users note about.  For example, this is the functionality of a smartphone, its low price, build quality.  However, there are some negative nuances.  For example, this is a Lenovo K3 Note camera.  The review that we conducted showed that the device does pretty good pictures, although many users disagree with this. </p>

    <p>  There is also information that the device periodically loses contact with satellites and, therefore, cannot determine the location.  Another Lenovo K3 Note review claimed that many users complain about the lack of security of the model.  And in some ways this is true, because the phone‚Äôs body is made of plastic, which is unlikely to help in the event of a fall or serious physical impact of another kind.  To help prevent a malfunction, a special case for Lenovo K3 Note will help.  You can find one in any Chinese online store. </p><p>  There are, of course, other comments on this phone.  For example, this is low autonomy: some are not happy with how the 3000 mAh battery that is preinstalled on this device works.  There were also comments regarding the lack of illumination of the lower buttons on the front of the device. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In fact, there are a lot of reviews about the model - some of them really contain constructive and important comments about the device, its design, operation, as well as its software part.  Well, to the device itself, it was not without reason that we gave you the opportunity to first familiarize yourself with the technical parameters of the model in order to find out its indicators and initially have some formed opinion about it.  And after reading the reviews, knowing what the smartphone is, you can make your own conclusion. </p><p>  I would like to summarize: the device in front of us is really worthy of attention and in demand on the market for good reason.  If you are interested in a low price and wide functionality, Lenovo K3 Note is what you need.  When choosing a phone with similar characteristics, take a look at this.  And maybe you will be pleased with him. </p>
