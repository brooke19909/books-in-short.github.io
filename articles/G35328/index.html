The nobleman built a small castle here, on the site of which the Binnenhof is currently located.  By the 14th century, the Hague had turned into a large village, but then it did not receive the status of a city.  In the XVII century, several thousand inhabitants lived here.  The Hague became the third largest in the country, but still remained a village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dutchreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the Netherlands The Hague" class="if uuid-2909118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909118.jpg"></div><p>  The status of the city of The Hague (Netherlands) received only in 1806.

It is from these cities that it is most convenient to get to the southern capital.  The fact is that the city does not have its own airport.  The Hague (Netherlands) can be reached from Rotterdam and Amsterdam.  It is in these cities that there are airports.  And you can move around the city by subway, trams and buses. </p><h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  The southern capital of the Netherlands - The Hague - is currently a large and important railway junction.  Trains from Utrecht, Groningen, Schiphol, Cologne, Berlin, Basel, Frankfurt, Prague and Copenhagen come to the city station. </p><p>  The Hague has become a very famous city that is known throughout the world.

He received such status for a reason.  After all, the Hague has more than 150 international organizations and numerous foreign embassies.  Various international conferences are regularly held in the city. </p><h2>  Binnenhof </h2><p>  The Binnenhof Palace complex is the main attraction of The Hague (Netherlands).  Currently, it houses the residence of the Dutch parliament.  This is the oldest building in The Hague.  The palace complex is located on the site of the same hunting castle with which the whole history of the city began.  On its territory there are many historical buildings.  Binnenhof is located in the very center of the city, and since the 15th century it has been the center of Dutch politics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Netherlands Index" class="if uuid-2909134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909134.jpg"></div><p>  You can freely enter the courtyard of the palace complex and enjoy the building.  Here tourists will see local deputies and ministers.  Binnenhof is not in vain considered the main attraction of The Hague.  Indeed, on its territory are architectural masterpieces of the era of the XIII-XIX centuries.  In the heart of the complex in 1280 a unique Riddersaal was built.  This is nothing but the Knights Hall.  The building has two pointed towers on both sides and a ceremonial room, which is open for sightseeing groups.  Within the walls of the Knights' Chamber every year on the third Thursday of September, the ruling monarch opens the parliamentary session.  At the celebration, the queen is in a golden carriage with an escort.  Not far from Riddersaal, a monument to King William II was erected.  This is one of the few equestrian statues in the Netherlands. </p><p>  Unfortunately, other premises of the complex are closed to visitors.  But guests can attend the parliamentary session.  The First House meets only once a month, but the Second House meets daily. </p><h2>  Palace of Peace </h2><p>  This is another attraction of The Hague (Netherlands), located on Carnegie Square.  It is here that the UN International Court of Justice and the Arbitration Court sit.  The building is very beautiful and has a patio with a fountain.  It is surrounded by an English-style garden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="goodlifeoclock.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City The Hague Netherlands photo" class="if uuid-2909145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909145.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the palace was completed in 1913.  He was fully funded by Carnegie.  The building was erected according to the project of the French architect.  It became an exact copy of the town hall of Calais.  The palace combines elements of Gothic, Byzantine and Romanesque styles. </p><h2>  Scheveningen </h2><p>  This is one of the eight districts of The Hague (Netherlands).  The photo gives you the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the area, which is considered the best seaside resort in the country.  Guests of the Netherlands who are not aware of its existence will be very surprised by the local infrastructure and the possibility of a great holiday.  The North Sea is not sunny Caribbean, but you can still have a great time here.  Not only tourists gather on the coast of the resort, but also kiters and surfers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelaroundwithme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Netherlands Attractions" class="if uuid-2911587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2911587.jpg"></div><p>  Scheveningen is interesting in terms of attractions.  Its old streets are pleasant to walk.  Here you can admire the ancient church of the 15th century, walk along the promenade, visit the many shops, dine on the pier in the restaurant.  Scheveningen has a long sandy beach. </p><h2>  Kurhaus </h2><p>  In the same area is the famous five-star hotel.  It was built in 1885 and originally combined a hotel and a concert hall.  But literally a year after the construction was completed, the building was damaged by fire, so there was a need to rebuild it. </p><p>  The rich exterior of the palace corresponds to no less rich decoration from the inside.  In the heyday of the hotel, representatives of the royal families and famous politicians stayed at the hotel.  And in the concert hall of the hotel world-famous stars performed.  The last concert in its walls took place in 1964.  The Rolling Stones band performed on stage at that time.  Subsequently, the institution's affairs deteriorated and it was closed.  The Kurhaus survived only due to the fact that in 1975 it was included in the lists of historical sights.  Otherwise, it would be demolished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photos The Hague Netherlands" class="if uuid-2909155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909155.jpg"></div><p>  The Kurhaus was reopened in 1979.  Currently, in its building is a well-known hotel chain. </p><p>  Cultural lovers can visit the Scheveningen Museum.  Within its walls, you can learn a lot about the stages of the development of the region from an ordinary fishing village to the level of a modern resort.  The museum has collected artifacts, restored historic interiors and recreated original boats. </p><h2>  Voorhout </h2><p>  This street is located in the center of the ancient part of The Hague (Netherlands, photo is given in the article).  She is considered the most beautiful in the city.  Its length is 470 meters.  The street runs along Lake Hofvijver and ends near the Lange Vohorhout Palace, which currently houses the Escher Museum.  The boardwalk is very quiet and calm.  Here you can admire very old lindens, whose age reaches 475 years.  The street is lit by beautiful lamps with golden crowns.  Every year, in September, the ruling monarch speaks at it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Netherlands" class="if uuid-2909162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909162.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the street began in the XIV century.  At that time, the government was reconstructed, and therefore there was a need for the construction of new buildings.  If previously the street was surrounded by farms, now politicians and farmers began to live on it.  The first castles of nobles were built here. </p><p>  Currently, on the street you can see mainly the Renaissance buildings of the XVIII and XIX centuries.  All of them are national monuments of architecture.  In addition, there are numerous government offices on the street. </p><h2>  Mauritshuis </h2><p>  This is an art gallery located within the walls of a historic mansion in 1641.  The building was restored several times after the fire and other adversities.  Recent restoration work was carried out in 2014.  Currently, the building is one of the most significant in The Hague along with the royal palace.  In Mauritshuis, a small exhibition devoted to the history of the building is presented to the gaze of the guests of the gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam or The Hague." class="if uuid-2911598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2911598.jpg"></div><p>  In 1820, the government acquired a mansion to house the royal collection of art.  And since 1875, the institution was used as an art gallery.  Here you can see more than 250 works of famous Dutch painters.  No less impressive are the interiors of the building with silk-studded walls and monumental painted ceilings.  The museum has 16 halls.  Despite the fact that his collection is not so large, canvases by Rembrandt and Vermeer can be seen here.  Among the most significant works, it is worth highlighting ‚ÄúThe Girl with the Pearl Earring‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Garden of Eden before the Fall‚Äù.  One hour is enough to inspect the entire exposition. </p><h2>  A park </h2><p>  If you happen to be in The Hague, or the trip is only planned, Madurodam should be included in the plan of sightseeing.  You will enjoy a walk in the park, which is considered one of the most interesting places in The Hague.  Madurodam is a Dutch town in miniature.  It was discovered in 1952.  Gradually, the city developed and expanded.  And now it is a whole park.  The sight is very interesting and unusual. </p><p>  The park was named after George Maduro.  About four kilometers of the railway were laid on the territory.  The motto of the park is the slogan "City with a smile."  Initially, the mayor of the town was Princess Beatrix.  Then she was still a schoolgirl.  Later, becoming the queen, she resigned.  Since then, a tradition has emerged to elect a mayor from among high school students. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.netherlands-tourism.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Hague Netherlands court" class="if uuid-2909224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2909224.jpg"></div><p>  In the park you can see a variety of landscapes.  It has its own Binnenhof, airport, pile houses, the port of Rotterdam, tulip fields and windmills. </p><h2>  Updated Madurodam </h2><p>  By 2011, public interest in the park decreased significantly, so it was decided to renovate it.  Soon, three thematic zones were equipped in Madurodam: </p><ol><li>  "The Netherlands as a source of inspiration for the whole world." </li><li>  "Historical cities." </li><li>  "Water as a friend and as an enemy." </li></ol><p>  Each of them has its own light show programs with musical accompaniment.  Now the park even has bridges with hoisting mechanisms, a tanker engulfed in a fire, and other interesting objects.  Guests can watch video presentations. </p><p>  The realism of the miniatures in the park is simply amazing.  Such a sight cannot be missed.  The beauty of Madurodam is that the city is interactive.  Guests can independently manage dams, trucks and other facilities.  Traveling in the park is a fun activity that will appeal not only to children, but also to adults. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Sometimes confusion arises, and tourists are perplexed as to which city is the capital of the Netherlands: Amsterdam or The Hague?  In fact, everything is very simple.  According to the Constitution, the capital is Amsterdam.  And in The Hague is the government and numerous government agencies, international organizations and other institutions. </p><p>  The city has a rich history and numerous attractions associated with its development, which attract tourists here.  And modern power structures are no less interesting to tourists than ancient architecture.  The Hague is a stunningly interesting city that is worth a visit to all the guests of the country. </p>
