  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is transport tax calculated?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The calculation of the <span>transport tax is</span> carried out by the ratio <span>of the vehicle</span> and its power.  You can do this event yourself.  On many sites, you can calculate the transport tax through a special calculator.  You only need to choose the appropriate city or region, as well as the transport option - scooter or motorcycle, truck or passenger car, bus, self-propelled or water transport, sail-motor ship or jet ski.  Then enter the power value in the next column, and then determine the result. </p><p>  For each city and country, the calculation of transport tax occurs at its own rates.  It is also determined based on the object of taxation and capacity.  For example, for a car up to 100 <span>horsepower</span> , the tax rate will range from 6-24 rubles, depending on the region.  For buses with a capacity of up to 200 horsepower - from 11 to 50 rubles, also due to the city and country in which this vehicle is located.  And so - for each object of taxation, its own calculation of the transport tax. </p><p>  Today, almost every resident has a means of transportation, it can be both a passenger car, a bus, pneumatic and caterpillar cars, water and <span>air transport.</span>  And for his "brainchild" the owner must pay a special tax that exists by law.  Due to the fact that base rates are subject to change, in each region the rate for the transport tax is determined differently. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, owning a car is not as prestigious as unprofitable.  Permanent repair, updating of parts, refueling, all this can cost the owner a pretty penny.  Yes, and pay a tax once a year, although once, but the amount is growing every time.  Transport tax is usually calculated by the tax authorities, which send the holder a form for payment.  If you do not pay the duty on time, you can meet such negative concepts as ‚Äúfines‚Äù and ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù. </p><p>  The calculation of the transport tax is carried out from the moment when the vehicle was put on registration with the tax authority.  The following vehicle options are exempt from this duty: </p><p>  - cars belonging to people with disabilities; </p><p>  - cars that are received through social protection bodies whose power does not exceed 100 horsepower; </p><p>  - special vehicles - tractors, combines that belong to agriculture, transporting milk, livestock, poultry, mineral fertilizers, intended for maintenance and veterinary care; </p><p>  - transport, which is wanted according to relevant documents; </p><p>  - fishing river and sea vessels; </p><p>  - motor and rowing boats, the power of which does not exceed 5 horsepower; </p><p>  - helicopters and airplanes of the medical service and medical aviation; </p><p>  - and other vehicles. </p><p>  Thus, the payment of transport tax may not be charged on all options.  But for such vehicles on which the duty still applies, it is necessary to make this very contribution, and regardless of whether the available means are used or not. </p><p>  In 2011, some heads of the Russian government proposed the abolition of this tax on certain <span>modes of transport.</span>  In many cities, this idea was supported by almost all motorists, but having learned that the <span>abolition of the transport tax</span> will be offset by an increase in fuel prices, opinions diverged.  At the moment, it is still not decided what to do with this duty - to leave it as it is or to remove it forever.  After all, paying every time for expensive gasoline is much more difficult than paying the tax only once. </p>
