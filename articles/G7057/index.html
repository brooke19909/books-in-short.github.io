  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find out the doorphone code?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you yourself or one of your relatives, acquaintances or friends lives in a large and apartment building, then the question of how to find out the code of the intercom system becomes very relevant from time to time. </p><p>  In this article, I suggest possible solutions to this situation. </p><p>  <strong>Section 1. What is an intercom?</strong> </p><p>  Before deciding how to open a doorphone without a key, let's try to define the device itself. </p><p>  So, by intercom should be understood a special <span>intercom</span> created to establish a connection between the owner of the premises and his visitor.  There are a lot of manufacturers of this equipment, and the most popular among which are the brands Commax, Hyundai Telecom, Tornet, Gardi, Polyvision and Kocom. </p><p>  If we take into account the principles of operation of intercoms, they are of two types: audio and video. </p><p>  The first of them are intended for two-way communication carried out by means of an audio device consisting of a handset and a special panel. </p><p>  Video intercoms allow you to see your visitor on the video panel screen, both color and black and white. </p><p>  As a rule, two types of equipment are installed in residential buildings: vizit or digital, and their price is directly proportional to the functionality. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2. How to find out the doorphone code?</strong> </p><p>  I would immediately like to note that any universal combination of numbers simply does not exist, and if you encounter a similar problem, the best solution would be to contact the installer directly. </p><p>  If this is not possible for some reason, try one of the following methods: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Contact the housing office.  Most likely, they retained data about the company that installed this equipment in your home.  They will tell you the treasured phone number, or they just call the company, and you can find out its coordinates in the local press or on the city website. </li><li>  As a rule, a monthly <span>fee</span> is charged monthly for the possibility of using the intercom <span>.</span>  Examine the receipt carefully, very often you can find a service phone on it. </li><li>  In the end, ask your neighbors.  Surely the older man on the porch has a contract signed with the installation company. </li></ul><p>  <strong>3. <span>How to find out the</span> doorphone <span>code</span> ?</strong>  <strong>Ways to get out of an unusual situation.</strong> </p><p>  Sometimes in the virtual space you can meet questions about whether it is possible to find out similar information at the address. </p><p>  By the way, sometimes these data are offered to be provided in exchange for a certain amount of cash reward.  Remember, this is not possible.  Technically, finding out is simply unrealistic.  After all, this combination of numbers has absolutely nothing to do with either the address or the number of the house or entrance.  It depends on the manufacturer of the device itself, or is installed at the discretion of the company providing these services. </p><p>  So, if you can‚Äôt boast of excessive concentration and periodically tend to lose or forget your keys in the most unexpected places, I suggest you use one of the following tips: </p><ul><li>  Find out the universal code for the doorphone of your brand.  For example, if a Vizit device is installed on the door, then most likely you can get home by dialing * # 4230 or 12 # 345.  Although for newer devices, most likely, the set of numbers will be one of the following: * # 423 or 67 # 890.  But I would advise you not to rely too much on it.  Now installation companies are trying to actively prevent any hacking and that is why they often change combinations and practically do not leave the factory settings.  It is likely that someone was already trying to crack this password, so the representative of the service company just had to change it. </li><li>  Make some spare keys.  And you can ask for help from the masters in the nearest market.  The existing opinion that it is absolutely impossible to make a duplicate is wrong.  Practice shows the opposite.  Sometimes craftsmen still succeed. </li></ul><p>  Now you already <span>know how to find out the</span> doorphone <span>code</span> .  Nevertheless, I would like to suggest that you use the legal method by contacting a company that provides this range of services to your home. </p>
