    <h2>  Media about the Great Victory </h2><p>  Some time before the holiday, many documentaries and programs about the <span>Great Patriotic War</span> began to be shown on television <span>.</span>  An example is the series of Liberators programs led by <span>famous actor</span> Dmitry Dyuzhev.  He interestingly and colorfully talks about various events of the war. </p><h2>  Pioneer Heroes </h2><p>  A lot of books have been written about the exploits of great warriors.  Do not forget about it.  This article will tell about a man who, without hesitation for a second, gave his life so that we all would now go out and see a peaceful sky above our heads.  First of all, the younger generation needs to know this, because, unfortunately, there are less and less heroes every year. </p>

    <p>  Pioneer heroes are those representatives of the pioneer community who have accomplished a huge number of feats.  Back in 1954, a list of these people was made up of twenty-two names.  But today we will talk about one of them: you will find out <span>who the pioneer</span> Marat Kazei is and what trace he left in the history of our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Birth of Marat Kazey </h2><p>  The future hero was born on October 10, 1929 in the small village of Stankovo, Minsk Region.  The choice of name was made by his father Ivan, who was a convinced communist, and before that he served in the Baltic Fleet.  The name of the future hero was chosen in honor of the Marat ship, on which the boy’s father served. </p><h2>  The tragic fate of the father </h2><p>  Ivan Kazei was a Bolshevik to the core, he was very much loved by his colleagues.  In addition, he led the training of tractor drivers and participated in a friendly court.  Unfortunately, fate ordered tragically: in 1935, Ivan Kazei was arrested on charges of sabotage.  By the way, the accusation was undeserved.  A reference to the Far East was chosen as a sentence.  He was rehabilitated after 24 years posthumously. </p><h2>  The fate of the mother of the hero </h2><p>  The sentence of Ivan Kazey also affected his wife: she was fired from her job and expelled from the institute.  Children were sent to relatives.  Marat Kazey's mother was arrested, and she was released shortly before <span>the war.</span>  Soon after her release, Anna went into the partisans. </p><p>  The first Minsk partisans did not last long, because the Gestapo exposed them.  After that, all the underground were executed.  Among the executed was the mother of 13-year-old Marat and his 16-year-old sister Ariadne.  This event prompted young people to leave for partisans, where Marat Kazei fought until the end of his life.  The feat, the brief content of which will be described later, forever entered the name of the pioneer in history. </p><h2>  Marat joins the partisans </h2><p>  In 1942, Marat became a scout.  His task was to penetrate the enemy’s garrison and extract valuable data, thanks to which the partisans were able to recapture an important point in Dzerzhinsk. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The first feat of Marat Kazey </h2><p>  On the account of a brave boy is not one brave deed.  So, in 1943, the first <span>feat of Marat Kazei was</span> dated <span>:</span> he saved a squad of his comrades from death.  German troops surrounded the partisans, but Marat was able to get out, but not to save his life: he was able to bring help, and the enemy was defeated. </p>

    <p>  Toward the end of the same year, the feat of Marat Kazei was awarded an honorary award - the Order of the Patriotic War of the first degree, as well as medals "For Military Merit" and "For Courage". </p><h2>  Tragic death </h2><p>  In 1944, Operation Bagration began, thanks to which Belarus was liberated from the Nazi invaders, which Marat Kazei could not see.  The Nazis entered the partisan detachment near the village of Horomitsky.  A battle ensued in which partner Marat instantly dies.  The Germans surround him, hoping to capture him.  Soon Marat ran out of ammunition, then he makes a fateful decision: to blow himself up with a grenade. </p><p>  To date, there are two versions that explain this feat of Marat Kazei: </p><ol><li>  The hero pioneer did this to prevent a punitive operation in the village. </li><li>  To destroy the Germans. </li></ol><p>  Partisan was buried in a village in his small homeland.  For heroism, he was awarded the title <span>Hero of the Soviet Union</span> in 1965.  Such a short but full life was lived by Marat Kazei. </p><p>  The summary of the hero’s biography is completed.  After the end of <span>World War II, the</span> sister of Marat Kazey returned to her home in Belarus.  Having lost both legs during the struggle against the enemy in partisan units, she nevertheless graduated from college and became a teacher.  She passed away in 2008. </p>

    <p>  The memory of the exploits will live forever, although both Ariadne and Marat Kazei have long died.  A monument to the hero was erected in the <span>capital of Belarus</span> as far back as 1959, many streets in several countries are named after him. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  In 1965, when Marat Kazei was awarded the title of Soviet Union, his picture was required.  Sister Ariadne found the best photo of her brother, which, ironically, was taken by a German photographer who ended up in the house of the future hero at the very beginning of the war.  This photo can be seen in every encyclopedia. </p><p>  That was the feat of Marat Kazey.  Do not forget your heroes and remember that without them we most likely would not live in peace now.  The Great Patriotic War is a terrible event not only for Russia, but for the whole world.  I really would not want this to happen again. </p><p>  History does not know many heroes like Marat Kazei.  The feat, a brief summary of which is given in this article, should be an example of courage for all living. </p>
