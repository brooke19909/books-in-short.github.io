    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Mirage New Hawaii Resort has more than 400 rooms, more precisely - 461. They are divided into several types, as in other similar hotels: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  standard; </li><li>  Junior Suite </li><li>  family type rooms. </li></ul><p>  Standart room - medium-sized standard rooms that occupy about 32 square meters.  m. There are 437 such rooms in the hotel.  The decoration of the apartment is fully consistent with photos from virtual sources.  It has everything you need for a comfortable pastime - a bathroom, toilet, satellite TV, individual air conditioning, telephone, hairdryer, safe, minibar.  Each room has a furnished balcony or terrace, depending on whether the windows look out onto the pool, the sea or the garden. </p><p>  Family-type rooms are designed to accommodate three or more tourists.  There are such rooms in Mirage New Hawaii Resort 22. The average room area is 67 square meters.  m - this is quite enough for a vacation with several children.  Unlike standard rooms, family apartments have an extra room for young tourists.  There is a sleeping bed, an armchair and a bedside table.  The rest of the room is no different from the standart room. </p><p>  If you plan to move in with great comfort, then you need to book a junior suite, especially since their number is limited - the hotel has only 2 such rooms.  Room size is 64 square meters.  There are several rooms: a living room, a bedroom, a small corridor.  A large double bed, interior doors and adjustable individual air conditioning - these are the main differences between the junior suites of the Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel (photos of the hotel are presented in the article). </p><p>  Vacationers in any type of room can expect a kettle and coffee / tea making facilities.  A feature of absolutely any apartment is the fact that the bathroom must have a bath, not a shower.  This can not boast of all the "luxury" rooms in five-star hotels. </p><p>  Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa only accepts non-smoking tourists in its rooms, pets are not allowed. </p><p>  The hotel is famous for its high level of service.  This is true - the maids clean the rooms daily, bring clean linen and towels.  They do not need to be reminded of their responsibilities.  Tipping is not forbidden, but this does not affect the quality of services, hotel staff always does their job well. </p>

    <h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa is often visited by families with children.  For children there are special children's playgrounds.  Children can splash around in a shallow heated pool.  Note to parents - only <span>fresh water is</span> used in the reservoir for young guests <span>.</span> </p><p>  On the territory near the pool, a team of animators works all day.  The staff amuses vacationers, plays sports games with them, holds entertaining competitions, and organizes watching cartoons.  In the afternoon, a mini-disco opens for children, where clockwork music sounds. </p><p>  There is also a children's play club on site.  Entrance is limited to the age of the kids - from 4 to 12 years.  For visiting the children's center you need to pay separately. </p><p>  As for the rooms, parents need a cot to stay with children.  It is available upon request at the Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa.  Reviews of tourists who came to rest with a child are mostly positive, parents are satisfied with children's infrastructure and a set of entertainment for kids. </p><p>  The hotel also provides <span>babysitting services.</span>  When parents need to relax a bit and be alone, specially trained staff who have extensive experience in communicating with the kids can be with the children.  Nannies speak many languages, so there should be no problem understanding.  Accordingly, this service is also paid in advance. </p><p>  The main restaurant has a special children's area with furniture for babies (chairs, tables).  The menu has a regular section of diet food, and on prior request, you can order children's dishes for lunch or dinner. </p><h2>  Cost of tours to the hotel Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; SPA (Hurghada) </h2><p>  One of the main reasons why Russian tourists choose hotels in Egypt is the low price of tours.  Despite the fact that the favorite resorts of Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh are considered the most equipped in terms of infrastructure and developed, the cost of recreation there is quite acceptable.  For example, if you spend a week in a standard one-room Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa (reviews of which are often positive), then this will cost tourists an average of 26-30 thousand rubles.  If you book hotel rooms in advance, then you can count on discounts and bonuses.  In addition, you can save by purchasing a tour at a "burning" price.  This method is not suitable for everyone, because everyone knows that such vouchers involve departure in the coming days. </p><p>  Also, the cost of tours depends on the season, type of room, etc. Given these factors, most often the price for a vacation at the Mirage New Hawaii Resort is 35-40 thousand rubles for two.  Accordingly, a trip for 10, 11 or more nights will cost more - in the range of 50-60 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations and reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Impressions about the rest in the Mirage New Hawaii Resort among tourists are very diverse.  But for the most part, vacationers put a solid four in the hotel complex, which fully corresponds to the category and stardom of the hotel.  Of course, travelers who have already been to European hotels believe that 4 stars for the Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa (Egypt) is a bit much.  But based on low requirements for Egyptian service, even the most demanding tourists agree to a rating of "4 with a minus." </p><p>  For many, the prices at the resort were not high, which is rare for holiday destinations of this magnitude.  Tourists liked the hotel's convenient location - not far from the main streets with many shops and souvenir shops.  From the exotic sightseeing places of Hurghada, the hotel is also located nearby.  This fact did not go unnoticed by tourists with experience. </p><p>  Many travelers would love to re-spend their vacations at Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa.  Such tourists leave only positive and positive reviews.  Basically this category of persons includes young couples, lovers of excursions to interesting places and novice tourists who first came to Egypt. </p><p>  As for the service and cleaning of the rooms, here the opinions of vacationers are divided.  More than half noted the arrogance of workers who forgot to clean the rooms.  According to them, when the employees were comfortable, then they had no problem understanding what they wanted from them.  The Internet worked only after the employee at the reception was tipped, linen was changed periodically.  It happened that the maids were not embarrassed by the Do Not Disturb signs that hung on the doors, and the cleaners came in without knocking.  Someone had poor air conditioning, someone broke the washbasin - and there are a lot of such stories from tourists.  Some vacationers, on the contrary, noted that the staff is very friendly and open, always went towards their guests and offered their help in every possible way.  The reason for this scatter of opinions is unclear, perhaps the hotel has several shifts of employees, some of which conscientiously carry out their work, while others do not. </p><p>  According to the guests, the tourists who came here to swim and dive will be unhappy with the depth of the sea.  To get to the water level in human height, you need to walk about 300 meters.  Plus, you can easily hurt yourself on the coral bottom.  However, the impressions of the picturesque pier and the fact of being close to other beaches and lagoons covered all the negative impressions.  Many were pleased that the hotel gives out a mask for snorkeling for free, when in other hotels renting equipment costs money. </p><p>  According to the absolute majority, the main advantage of the Mirage New Hawaii Resort is its cuisine and local menu.  Guests were pleasantly surprised by the variety of dishes, products and serving sizes.  Every evening, tourists were treated to fruits and berries, and the supply of fresh watermelon or melon was mandatory.  During the rest, the local cuisine did not have time to bother anyone.  In addition, the undeniable advantage of the hotel is the well thought-out food system for vacationers.  Own pastry shop, a variety of treats, cook shows, etc. - all this contributes to a pleasant impression of the hotel as a whole. </p><p>  As for the <span>work of animators, there are</span> no serious complaints about entertainment programs and shows.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some complained of noise and loud music, but this did not suit only those tourists whose windows overlooked the pool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oddly enough, at 23.00 local time near the hotel it was always quiet and calm.</font></font></p><p> In recent years, the service and infrastructure of the hotel have become much better, this was noted by tourists who returned this year to the Mirage New Hawaii Resort &amp; Spa.  Reviews in 2014 became more positive and kinder.  <span>The quality of service has</span> reached a new, higher level, and this is good news.  This means that the opinions of guests are taken into account over time, problems are solved, and mistakes are corrected.  For this special "thank you" to the management and administration of the hotel. <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  To summarize, this hotel is recommended for those who are counting on an economical option for a vacation.  There is no specific category of vacationers for this hotel, it is quite versatile and is suitable for both older tourists and families with small children.  It mainly stops for those who value peace and quiet, as well as those travelers who plan to spend their holidays in excursions to local attractions.  Students and young couples can also stay at Mirage New Hawaii Resort SPA 4 *.  Reviews from this category of guests are often only good.  The positive aspects of relaxation at this hotel can be safely called a kitchen and a food program, entertainment and infrastructure, convenient location, private beach and pier, green garden, various bonuses, etc. </p>
