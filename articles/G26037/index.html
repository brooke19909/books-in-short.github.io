Important information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When we are going on long trips, we are sure to lay time on the road.  We are afraid of traffic jams, accidents, and a deflated wheel, which in the end threatens to be late for the plane.  There is a way out - the railway.  It is only important to remember what the aeroexpress train looks like at Sheremetyevo and from which station it leaves. </p><h2>  Sheremetyevo airport </h2><p>  It is the largest airport, not only by the standards of a multi-million dollar city, but in and throughout Russia, and also one of the largest in the world.  The huge airport terminal serves hundreds of Russian and foreign flights daily, and delivers thousands of passengers around the world.  This runway complex has six terminals that are interconnected by walking corridors.  From which station is the aeroexpress train to Sheremetyevo, we will tell further. </p><p>  The airport is located in the north of Moscow, about thirty kilometers from the city.  There are many ways to get to it.  Public transport will take you to the airport in about two hours if there are no traffic jams.  You can take a taxi that will bring you in 40 minutes.  But this method is quite expensive, and not everyone can afford it. </p><p>  The most popular and reliable, combining an acceptable price-quality-speed ratio, is a specialized shuttle.  It is familiar to all travelers by the bright red color of trains.  Information on which Aeroexpress train to Sheremetyevo departs from which station is in each directory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visual.rzd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ticket offices at Belorussky Train Station" class="if uuid-3010524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3010524.jpg"></div><h2>  Trip planning </h2><p>  Traveling people who value time mainly prefer rail transport.  Including when traveling to the airport.  Here important questions arise: which metro station leads to the Sheremetyevo express train, which train station you need to leave to arrive on time, where to buy tickets and how long the trip will take. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Residents of the capital know what the aeroexpress train to Sheremetyevo is, from which station and what time it leaves.  We tell Moscow guests that the airport can only be reached from the Belorussky railway station.  It is located at the intersection of the Ring and Zamoskvoretskaya lines.  You can use any exit - they all lead to the station. </p><p>  To make a trip to the airport, you must purchase a ticket.  Its price is about 600 rubles one way.  All passengers buy them in a special terminal. </p><p>  Aeroexpress is a train of high comfort, where all conditions are created for travelers: comfortable chairs with folding tables, wireless Internet, and newspapers.  The speed of the train is 130 km / h, so the travel time is short, only 45 minutes.  He leaves every half hour, so you need to lay down a spare time in case of unforeseen circumstances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mosday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aeroexpress in Sheremetyevo" class="if uuid-3010509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3010509.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get from the airport </h2><p>  Those who have arrived in Moscow on business, already upon landing, are interested in the question of which station the aeroexpress train arrives from Sheremetyevo from.  From the airport you can only get to Belorussky Train Station - the largest transport hub in Moscow, from where transport departs to all corners of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mosday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aeroexpress in Sheremetyevo" class="if uuid-3010515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3010515.jpg"></div><p>  The first train goes towards Moscow at 5 am, and the last at 00:30.  Ticket price is 600 rubles in the standard class.  Therefore, if you or your relatives arrived at an uncomfortable time, there is no need to wait all night.  Having received your luggage, you can have a cup of coffee in any of the dozen cafes located in the airport building.
