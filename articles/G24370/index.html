  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Extreme vacation in Madagascar</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who are accustomed to comfort and passive relaxation, Madagascar will definitely not like it.  This is a unique island, which can not be compared with anything.  You begin to understand this at the moment when the plane goes down.  A picture worthy of the work of impressionist artists opens up before tourists from the air: a riot of colors, a game of angry and red colors.  <span>The burgundy color of the</span> soil is due to their lateritic composition.  The rich flora and species of animals characteristic of these places is the main reason why tourists choose holidays in Madagascar.  On the island there are practically no fashionable hotels and pathos nightclubs.  In some cities, people still live on <span>subsistence farming.</span>  Exotic tourists come here from all over the world. </p><p>  You can start your vacation in Madagascar by visiting one of its largest cities, Antananarivo.  Locals call him Tana.  The city is located between two hills, and its small houses rise up their slopes, thus forming a complex labyrinth of arches, buildings and alleys.  The most interesting in Tan can be called the ensemble of palaces of Ruva Ambuhimang, which consists of the ‚ÄúDouble Palace‚Äù of Mandzamiadan, Tranavalun, Mahitsilafanzak, Manampisoa and the tomb of Madagascar kings.  Also very beautiful are the Presidential <span>Palace, the Palace of the</span> Prime Minister, the National Library, the Municipal Theater of Izutri and many other buildings.  This city has a very large number of museums, among which the <span>Botanical Garden, the</span> Besareti <span>Garden</span> , the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, etc. stand out. It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Madagascar without visiting a crocodile farm.  It should be noted that the reptiles on the island are in abundance, however, like other exotic animals.  Lemurs are common among others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second largest city is Tuamasina.  Here you can spend an excellent vacation in Madagascar, strolling through the numerous parks, museums.  Tuamasina is a port of world significance, where many ships cross every day from all over the world.  One of the most interesting places in this city is its central market ‚ÄúBazaar-be‚Äù and the market smaller than Koli.  Here you can find almost everything, on the shelves a huge amount of products made by local artisans.  Even if the tourist is not keen on shopping, then this place will be interesting to him, because it is able to tell about the life of the island more than any museums.  Not far from Tuamasin is the Ivuluin Zoo, where a large number of species of exotic animals are represented on a large territory.  There are 134 reserves and 3 <span>national parks</span> throughout the island <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the north of the country you can see in large quantities the world famous red soil.  This is a feature of this area, characteristic of African countries.  They do not come to Madagascar for city entertainment and comfort.  They are not here.  But there is a surprisingly beautiful nature, places almost untouched by man, huge sandy beaches.  Last minute packages to Madagascar are rare because this destination is not very popular among tourists.  This is explained by the impossibility of rest with children, the high cost of flights, a large number of vaccinations from bites of tropical insects.  This absolutely does not mean that last-minute tours to Madagascar are meaningless and not interesting.  The country will open from all sides only to those people who will be interested in its rich nature and history.  No zoological diversity can be found anywhere in the world like here.  Going here, many tour operators recommend purchasing extended medical insurance, because in an <span>exotic country the</span> risk of getting a rare disease is very high.  Having settled all the formalities, you can safely go to meet the wild world of Madagascar. </p>
