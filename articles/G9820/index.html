This war was fought between Argentina and Great Britain in 1982. It lasted less than three months.  Why did this happen and what made these countries wage war among themselves?  Read more below. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  At the end of the 17th century, the Falkland Islands, an archipelago, were discovered by European sailors, but due to their close proximity to Argentina, this country has always considered them to be part of its territory.  On the archipelago, consisting of two large and more than seven hundred small islands and rocks, there was no indigenous population, and over the years it passed from hand to hand more than once.  In the XVIII century, an English settlement was founded here, but during the <span>US War of Independence,</span> Britain was forced to leave these lands.  In 1820, Argentine migrants arrived in the Falkland Islands.  Great Britain established control of the islands in 1833, reiterating its rights to these territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="falkland war" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the second half of the 20th century, Argentina took a series of diplomatic steps to eliminate the colonial status of the Falkland Islands.  This country had claims to these territories and wanted to extend its sovereignty to them.  The issue of decolonization was considered at UN meetings, but has not yet been resolved.  The 1982 Falkland War just happened because of this unresolved dispute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who should the islands belong to? </h2><p>  The situation was aggravated in early 1982, when the head of the military junta, who came to power in Argentina in 1979, decided to invade the Falkland Islands.  The war began at a time when Argentina was not going through the best of times.  In this regard, the military regime of General Leopoldo Galtieri made an attempt to seize the islands in order to divert the attention of the population from the internal problems of the country, as well as to strengthen national pride and rallying the people against a common enemy, in this case Great Britain. </p><h2>  Capture the islands of Argentina </h2><p>  So, on April 2, Argentine military units landed on the Falkland Islands, thereby unleashing the ensuing conflict.  The capture of the islands that defended about eighty English marines stationed in Port Stanley, occurred without bloodshed.  The British surrendered, and a new government was established in the Falklands, led by Argentine general Menendos.  In this regard, the Falkland War took place, the reasons for which are that both conflicting parties claimed this territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="falkland islands war" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The day after the landing of the Argentinean units in the Falkland Islands, a resolution was passed at the UN Security Council calling on the parties to the conflict for a peaceful settlement.  Great Britain broke off all diplomatic relations with Argentina and sent a military contingent to the region whose task was to regain control of the Falkland Islands.  Argentina, in turn, deployed additional troops there and announced the beginning of the draft of the reservists.  Countries imposed sanctions on each other.  The Falkland War was brewing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Escalation of conflict </h2><p>  Great Britain immediately organized a <span>special forces</span> group <span>,</span> tasked with returning the islands.  On April 25, <span>British troops</span> landed from riparian warships occupied the island of South Georgia, located less than 1300 km east of the Falklands.  The next day, <span>the UN Secretary General</span> called on Britain to cease hostilities, but the country rejected this recommendation.  The Falkland War continued to erupt, the parties to the conflict pulled additional forces into the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Falkland War 1982" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994597.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On April 30, Great Britain embarked on a complete blockade of the islands through submarines and aircraft.  England determined a combat zone with a diameter of 200 miles, which was not recommended even to civilian ships and aircraft.  Argentine positions were hit, which resulted in significant damage to aviation, airfields and other infrastructure. </p><h2>  The further course of the war.  Defeat of argentina </h2><p>  <span>On May 2, the</span> Argentinean cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by Great Britain, which caused the death of 323 crew members.  The international community was extremely outraged by this act, especially since at the time when the English submarine torpedoed the cruiser, it was outside the 200-mile zone established by Great Britain itself.  <span>The Argentine</span> Navy was recalled to its bases and was no longer involved in the conflict. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="argentina falkland war" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Subsequently, the main course of the Falkland War shifted to airspace.  On June 12, Britain launched a massive attack on Port Stanley, in which Argentina concentrated its main forces.  The Falkland War was at an end.  The British marines and paratroopers participated in this operation, and a powerful bombardment of the city was carried out, resulting in civilian casualties. </p><p>  After Port Stanley was finally surrounded by British troops, a ceasefire was concluded between the parties to the conflict.  Thus, on June 14, Argentine troops surrendered, and the British occupied the city.  On this conflict was settled, the Falkland Islands returned to British control. </p><h2>  Consequences and Outcomes </h2><p>  As a result of the Falkland War, Britain lost 258 people killed, more than 700 were injured.  Argentines killed 649 people, more than 1,000 were injured, and more than 11 thousand were taken prisoner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1982 Falkland Islands War" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The 1982 Falkland Islands War, in which Argentina suffered a humiliating defeat, subsequently led to the overthrow of the Galtieri military junta regime.  But Britain, this small victorious war has benefited by raising the national confidence of citizens in the government and allowing the country to establish its position in the international community. </p><h2>  Current situation </h2><p>  Relations between Argentina and Great Britain escalated in 2010, after the latter began oil production offshore the Falkland Islands.  In addition, England deployed an additional military contingent on the islands, in connection with which Argentina criticized it, accusing it of militarizing the region.  The Falkland War and the unresolved dispute are still the cause of tensions between the countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="falkland war causes" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33387/994594.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2013, a referendum was held in the Falkland Islands, at which a question was raised regarding their status.  It is known that 98% of respondents voted for the islands to remain <span>British overseas territory.</span>  However, about 3 thousand people live on the islands, most of them are of British origin.  Argentina, in turn, said it did not recognize the results of the referendum, as it was held without UN approval.  Therefore, the country to this day continues to claim these territories, considering them their own. </p><p>  Unfortunately, even in the modern world, conflicts such as the Falkland War are taking place.  It's just that little is known about many of them.  By the way, in Argentina, the Falkland Islands are commonly called the Malvinas. </p>
