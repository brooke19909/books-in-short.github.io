As if you are in an oriental tale.  However, this is not a fairy tale.  This is the name of the Crimean village.  And Koktebel is called the "edge of the blue peaks."  It really is.  Mountain ranges covered with forests, like fairy-tale heroes surrounded the village, protecting from the cold wind.  With their peaks the mountains go to the sky.  Against their background, air flocks of clouds occasionally swim through the clear sky.  The incomparable air of the forest and mountains mixes with the aromas of flowers and the sound of the surf.  Having warmed up on the coastal beach, with great enthusiasm, vacationers run to plunge into the clear cool water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel as el koktebel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1434493.jpg" width="600"></div>
