It spreads over the territory of southern Belarus, northern Ukraine, and captures a piece of the Russian Federation.  The name itself implies that there are many forests in the region.  And these are real pine forests.  The needles, as you know, disinfect the air, making it crystal clear.  Evergreen pine trees create a calming mood.  Ukrainian Polesie is rich in lakes.

It is said that its reserves in Ukraine are greater than in the Baltic region.  Zhytomyr region is especially rich in ‚Äúsun stone‚Äù.  But the sanatorium described by us is located a little to the west - between the cities of Rivne and Lutsk.  How to book accommodation and treatment at the Chervona viburnum health resort?

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  "Chervona viburnum" is a sanatorium located outside the village outskirts, in the middle of an extensive pine forest.  But walking through the woods is not the only pleasure of vacationers.  The health resort has its own comfortable beach on the shores of a wonderful lake.  The entire territory of the sanatorium complex is landscaped.  In addition to coniferous forests, there are planted five gays of various trees, as well as medicinal bushes and herbs.  On the lake, artificial islands, ‚Äúhuts‚Äù and gazebos along the shores were created.

Vacationers leave numerous reviews about the landscaping.  Every year something new appears that pleases the guests.

The chemical composition in them is different.  From the first source <span>iodine-bromine water</span> beats <span>.</span>  Its mineralization is 37 grams per liter, which is about the same as in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic).  Magnesium chloride water is obtained from the second key.  Its saturation is 10 grams of salts per liter.  In composition, it resembles Mirgorodskaya.  But the water from Zhobrin is much stronger, and therefore more useful.  Because of two different sources, we can say that Chervona viburnum is a wide-ranging sanatorium.  Here they treat both diseases of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, and there are pathologies of the musculoskeletal system.  Baths miraculously affect women's and men's health, eliminate dermatological problems.

Guests are offered spacious, clean rooms, filled with everything you need for a good rest.  The whole complex, with few exceptions, is built under a common roof.
