His niche in the resort business is a good economy class vacation.  At the same time, we note that three stars does not mean a decrease in the level of services.  The price of a tour to this hotel for a period of 7 nights in the velvet season of 2014, taking into account medical insurance, flight, transfer, is from 17.8 to 21.8 thousand rubles.  Travel agencies willingly cooperate with the hotel, because the quality of rest in it is consistently soundly.

    <h2>  Other infrastructure </h2><p>  The open part of the restaurant, designed for simultaneous meals of 120 vacationers, also goes onto the terrace here. 200 people are accommodated in the restaurant hall itself. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel complex is equipped in such a way as to provide an interesting rest, quality food, substantial leisure, as well as health promotion.  Built in 2007 and modernized in 2011, the infrastructure of Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * is gradually developing.  The reviews indicate that there are also therapeutic services: the Finnish and Turkish baths work.  For an additional payment, if desired, you can receive either sessions or a massage course.  The hotel SPA-center with wide possibilities for face skin and body care, which provides complex procedures, is very popular among the beautiful half. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the convenience of guests taking a rental car at the hotel, there is parking for vehicles.  There is also a left-luggage office in the lobby area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel complex. </p><h2>  More about the rooms </h2><p>  The rooms of the hotel complex are air-conditioned and cleaned daily and carefully.  They have a solid European-quality repair.  The hotel window overlooks its relaxation area with a swimming pool.  The hotel suites are equipped with comfortable bathrooms, a bathroom and a panoramic balcony for relaxation.  New stylish furniture and properly functioning household appliances in the rooms - a business card of Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 *.  Guest reviews more than once express gratitude to the hotel administrators for organizing such comfort for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side yesiloz hotel 3 side manavgat" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/500441.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms also have a refrigerator, telephone, hairdryer, TVs (in family rooms there are two of them).  In the settings of the latter, several Russian channels are carefully provided. </p><p>  Towels are changed twice a week.  The prevailing calm warm pastel colors in the rooms of Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 *.  Guest reviews about them indicate that the rooms are cozy and contribute to a quality guesthouse. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All-inclusive hotel catering exceeds the three-star level.  The assortment of main dishes consists of all kinds of cooking options for chicken, turkey, liver, three to four types of fish, delicious sausages, sausages, soy meat with various sauces.  Why is there practically no beef and lamb in the everyday menu? </p><p>  When answering, try to solve a simple problem: the price of beef in Turkey is $ 100 per kilogram.  For comparison, the cost of a guest's guesthouse, which he pays to an economy hotel, is about $ 100.  An adult male tourist, staying at a boarding house, can eat about half a kilogram of meat per day.  The question arises: for what money, subject to the presence of beef on the menu, pay the owner the work of the staff? </p><p>  But back to the menu.  It should be noted the abundance of side dishes.  Vegetables are very tasty, it is especially worth taking eggplant.  Nice restaurant soups.  There is relatively little baking.  But very tasty buns that are prepared right in the presence of the spa man.  From drinks: sprite cola-fant, coffee, tea, packaged juices.  From free alcoholic drinks: vodka and beer. </p><p>  After 22-00 all inclusive ends, food and drinks become paid. </p><h2>  Road to the sea </h2><p>  The distance from the hotel complex to the sea is about a kilometer.  If you are not lazy, you can walk on foot.  However, this is inconvenient.  There is a more comfortable option: a bus runs from the stop opposite the hotel every 15 minutes to the beach from 8:30 in the morning until the evening.  However, during rush hours, that is, for example, when the bulk of vacationers rushes to the beach after breakfast, the bus is full.  However, this is far from a stalemate, just wait 15 minutes before the next flight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side yesiloz hotel 3 photos and reviews" class="if" height="483" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/500444.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is another option for those who wish: you can almost for free rent a bike here in Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * Side (Manavgat), and the beach immediately becomes more accessible. </p><h2>  Beach, outdoor activities </h2><p>  Now directly about the beach itself.  Its length is 50 meters.  It is equipped with trestle beds and umbrellas in sufficient quantities.  In a word, complaints from holidaymakers of the type "we arrived at the beach later, but there are no places" - in the reviews of guests it was not noticed. </p><p>  It's nice that the beach is sandy, smooth entry into the water is convenient even for children.  Water is pure, warm as milk, has a soft turquoise hue.  It is viewed to a considerable depth. </p><p>  However, as they say, beach swimmers from Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * Side (Manavgat) do not enjoy swimming and sunbathing alone.  At their services also paid entertainment in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach.  Resorts who want to join diving, thanks to experienced instructors, really have this opportunity. </p><p>  The hotel instructors also conduct classes, according to their licenses, in water skiing and parasailing (flying with a special parachute behind the boat). </p><h2>  Near shops </h2>

To the right of the hotel is the Migros store.  It is possible to make a purchase in it for $ and for ‚Ç¨, however, customers expect, that is, they give change, exclusively in <span>Turkish lira.</span>  Prices are reasonable.  Convenience is obvious: here you can always buy a souvenir before leaving home.

    <p>  Hotel sweet shop - a real gift for sweet tooth Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * (Side).  Reviews about him wish their owner long life!  Prices are significantly lower than in Side.  Compare yourself: the price of Turkish delight is $ 12 versus 20. </p><p>  To the left of the beach bus stop is a small shop with inexpensive and tasty wines and juices.  Nearby there is a fruit market with fairly reasonable prices. </p><h2>  Excursion program </h2><p>  Someone who, and vacationers who have chosen a tour to a three-star hotel complex, initially and quite adequately understand that the cultural program of vacationers is the business of vacationers themselves.  Therefore, in fact, they preferred a three-star hotel to more fashionable options in order to save money.  What kind of excursions are not bought by the guests of Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 *!  Photos and their reviews on the pages of forums and social networks demonstrate the most popular tourist attractions of the Country of Stars and Crescent.  Moreover, experienced tourists are not guided by tours that hotel guides, working from a tour operator, are trying to sell them.  Who is pleased to pay a double mark-up of real value? </p><h2>  Ancient side </h2><p>  Where to start your personal excursion program for the guests of the hotel complex under consideration?  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with ... a walk.  Why?  It's elementary, you are in Side.  The <span>Side</span> Yesiloz Hotel 3 * <span>hotel</span> itself is located to the right of the chic archaeological site, one of the most spectacular in Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel side yesiloz hotel 3" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/500440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ancient Side was a fortified city, protected from both the sea and land.  Moreover, despite the earthquake, the walls protecting it from the land side have been preserved well.  The central gate erected by the ancient Greeks leads to the main square, which has a horseshoe-shaped outline.  The second gate, also of Hellenistic origin, the Roman, having tetrahedral towers, are better preserved.  From them leads the ancient central street of Side.  Tourists can also see the agora (public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city) here.  Strangely enough, the guests of Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * (Side), most of all, write about ancient public toilets (there are 24 of them in Side).  Although they are, for obvious reasons, now not used for their intended purpose, they are potentially functional today.  Under them (after all, ancient technologies in some aspects are more reliable than ours!) The existing sewage system and water supply with clean running water were saved.  There is something to learn for our plumbers, the system has been working "only" for a thousand and a half years! </p><p>  Unfortunately, the ruined center of the agora is of interest, where you can see the ruins of the temple of <span>Ceres (the goddess of</span> fertility and agriculture), as well as the slave market. </p><p>  However, the most spectacular surviving ancient structure is the amphitheater in Side.  On a scene with a length of 63 m, which can be seen even today, in hoary antiquity, gladiators fought among themselves and with wild animals. </p><h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  Visiting Turkey and not swimming in the Cleopatra basin located in Pamukkale is the same as visiting Paris and managing not to see the Eiffel Tower.  This is understood by the health resort Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 *.  A photo on the background of the Cotton Castle (as Pamukkale is translated) adorns many photo albums of tourists.  This unique natural cascade of travertine baths was created by nature itself.  Mineral thermal water has healing properties.  Externally, the walls of the baths are covered with a layer of crystallized salt deposits.  Therefore, the exterior of Pamukkale is original: a delicate <span>pastel-pearl color.</span>  An unforgettable sight! </p><p>  The largest bath, heated by a separate geyser, served as a pool to the ancient Romans.  They equipped this place for their baths, providing columns and a portico (unfortunately, these creations of human hands were destroyed by an earthquake). </p><h2>  Other excursions </h2><p>  We list other excursions that guests <span>of the Side</span> Yesiloz Hotel 3 * <span>(Turkey)</span> prefer <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> accurately determine the list of such visited places: an amazing joint creation of the nature of human hands - Cappadocia, a city in stone;  the beautiful stalactite grotto Dalmatash, the ancient secret refuge of the corsairs;  preserved Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side yesiloz hotel 3 side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/500446.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, it is worth visiting the eastern market and, of course, bargaining on it.  This is a kind of rite.  If you liked something, ask for a price.  They call you.  You divide the named figure by three and declare that you will pay such an amount for the goods.  The merchant clutches his head and runs off to "consult with the owner."  An experienced buyer calmly waits.  The merchant, meanwhile, comes running and asks to increase the price.  The buyer indulgently calls half the original price.  Only so, calling for the second time, you should buy a product.  Bargaining "just like that" in the East is not accepted.  As a result, you buy a good leather product for 50-60% of what you would pay for it in Moscow.  This is it - the eastern bazaar: both profitable and not boring. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize the above, we can recommend Side Yesiloz Hotel 3 * (Turkey) for buying tours.  The hotel complex is economical, it guarantees a good guesthouse (both food and living conditions).  The cultural program should be taken care of by vacationers themselves.  This is natural for a three-star hotel.  Meanwhile, it should be recognized that it is a convenient platform for any excursions both in Turkey and with a temporary trip outside its borders. </p>
