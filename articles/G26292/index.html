This mooring complex was opened in 1982 to receive cruise and ferry vessels.  His inability to receive ships reaching more than 200 meters in length led to the need to build a new passenger terminal.

    <p>  Maritime Station is the departure and arrival point for cruise trips operated by ferries from St. Petersburg Anastasia <strong> </strong>  and Maria, owned by ST.PETER LINE.  With the commissioning of the cruise-ferry station in the passenger port, the vessel Princess Maria, sailing from North Palmyra to Helsinki, was transferred to the Marine Façade, and the second ferry was supposed to be transferred to the new terminal from October 2011.  The project was not implemented, and the ferries again depart from the Marine Station.  The reason was justified by the inability of the road junction in the Passenger Port area to withstand the load of cars transported by ferry. </p><p>  It should be noted that since 2003, the Georg Ots ferry regularly traveled to Kaliningrad from the Marine Station.  In 2010, the ferry to the westernmost regional center of the country was closed; ferries from St. Petersburg do not come here.  Kaliningrad is now connected with Russia and Europe by two ferry routes operated from Baltiysk. </p><h2>  Ferry Boom </h2><p>  There was a time when for several years there were no regular ferry lines in St. Petersburg.  The situation changed with the adoption of a law allowing passengers traveling by ferry to stay in Russia without a visa for 72 hours.  In 2010, along with ST.PETER LINE, the well-known company S-Continental launched its vessels in the Baltic cities.  Petersburg became a transit city between Russia and Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Since that time, they began to actively plan the development of the ferry service of St. Petersburg with neighboring countries - Estonia, Poland, Germany.  At the same time, it was assumed that the new lines will be used for the transportation of passengers and the delivery of goods using road trains. </p><p>  Since 2010, ST.PETER LINE has opened a new direction St. Petersburg - Helsinki, carried out by the cruise <span>ferry Princess Maria.</span>  The next year was marked by the opening of another ferry line to Stockholm.  Since then, the <span>Baltic</span> Sea <span>cruises</span> operated by this company have become the most popular tourist destinations in the region.  This attracted a considerable number of tourists to the Northern capital, and the city itself received the status of the Ferry Capital of Russia. </p><h2>  First ferry operator </h2><p>  The private shipping company ST.PETER LINE was founded in 2010.  This is the first Russian ferry operator, and the only one operating year-round in the market of its field.  The company’s foreign passengers are allowed to stay in Russia without a visa permission for 72 hours.  This feature of travel was highly appreciated by tourists and attracted an additional influx of tourists from 138 states to St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Special tours </h2><p>  Very interesting cruise trips to nearby European countries for the May, New Year holidays are regularly organized by ST.PETER LINE.  You can find out about them on the official website of the company; these tours are also offered in numerous travel agencies. </p><p>  Winter cruises have long been a reality.  They allow you to get a lot of refreshing impressions and a cheerfulness charge for a long time, to celebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays beloved by everyone in the circle of your loved ones or colleagues. </p><p>  To register, tourists come to the Marine Station, from which ferries depart from St. Petersburg.  The reviews that they leave on the forums upon their return from the trip indicate an interesting time spent on the additional service of travel companies offering travel.  Experienced tourists share their impressions of what they saw, advise the services of some companies that offer hotel room reservation in the country of arrival, transfer or car rental.  Such services allow you not to waste time organizing your leisure time and spend several days traveling comfortably on the Baltic. </p><p>  There are also negative reviews.  Of course, there are always hungry and dissatisfied with the service, but most often the disappointment of travelers is caused by a long wait in the queue for registration.  For many, it causes shock.  According to many tourists, the capacity of the station and the capacity in the passport control area clearly do not correspond to the number of passengers traveling by ferry on a cruise. </p><p>  But perhaps the main thing that you need to learn when going on a trip is not to be upset if something goes wrong.  There are bad weather, and hotels, and cabins that do not live up to expectations, and mistakes in planning holidays, leading to a loss of time.  However, any trip, not even the most comfortable, after some time will be perceived as an adventure, which is still nice to remember. </p><h2>  Additional excursions </h2><p>  One of the most common destinations among tourists is Finland.  A ferry from St. Petersburg regularly departs for Helsinki.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  about travel <strong> </strong>  explain the chosen route <strong> </strong>  availability in the price range, maximum information richness and minimal organizational costs.  And indeed it is.  A sea voyage is much more comfortable and interesting than hours of sitting on a bus tour.  During the trip, a lot of entertainment and leisure activities are offered.  You can transport cars with you on the ferry.  It also presents a unique opportunity to visit the capitals of neighboring states.  For 3-4 days of travel, a number of interesting additional excursions are offered: city sightseeing tours, visits to the Silife Aquarium and the Murulandia Family Development Center in Helsinki, the Vasa Museum, the Skansen Museum, the Royal Residence in Sweden, the Rakvere Castle in Estonia and others. </p>
