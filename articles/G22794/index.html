Crocheting a square napkin for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even today, crochet square napkins, the patterns of which have come to us from our grandmothers, are in great demand.  Learning to knit them is not so difficult.  The main thing is to master several techniques and read the diagrams correctly. </p><h2>  Fillet knitting </h2><p>  The easiest way to <span>crochet a napkin</span> in the sirloin technique.  To do this, just learn how to make double crochet posts.  The essence of fillet knitting is to paint over some cells and leave others free.  From this the pattern is built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="square crochet napkins" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/838154.jpg" width="292"></div>

    <p>  We collect a series of air loops and in the fifth loop we knit a column with two crochets.  Next, a chain of two loops and in the third loop a <span>column with two crochets.</span> </p><p>  To paint over the cell, as required by <span>crocheting</span> square <span>napkins</span> , we knit four columns in a row with two double crochets.  In width they will be the same as an empty cell.  The alternation of filled and free cells forms a pattern. </p><p>  At the end of the work, the edges of the product must be crocheted with an edge pattern.  The simplest of them are fans.  To do this, it is enough to alternate several <span>columns with a crochet</span> in one loop and half columns. </p><h2>  Pineapple motif </h2><p>  After you master fillet knitting, you can begin to knit more complex square crochet napkins.  The schemes of such products are very complex, but they are also quite simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet square doily with patterns" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/838353.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An example of this will be a napkin made of small square motifs with pineapples.  It does not fit in a circle, but from below.  In this scheme, chains of air loops, double crochets, single crochet posts and half columns are found. </p><p>  When the main part of the motive is ready, it is bound by an openwork edge.  It is the arches of the harness that will become those places for which motives will then be interconnected. </p><p>  The convenience of this method of knitting is that the craftswoman can choose the size of the product herself, making it both very small and adjusting to the size of a tablecloth or bedspread. </p><p>  The finished product is also bound by an openwork pattern, which adds a finished look and elegance to the napkin.  The scheme of this openwork edge is simple and understandable even to a novice craftswoman. </p><h2>  And again about pineapples </h2><p>  Another square <span>crochet napkin</span> (see the diagrams below) is built on the basis of the pineapple pattern.  Only the principle of her knitting is a little different.  It runs from the center, like most classic round items.  Only in the process of knitting is it given a square shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet square napkins" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/838351.jpg" width="529"></div>

    <p>  We start from a self-tightening ring, into which we knit three air loops and two double crochets, then two air loops and three double crochets.  So it should turn out 11 columns, between which there are chains of air loops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We knit a chain of lifting and continue according to the scheme.  It is quite simple and has no difficult places.  If you strictly follow it, you get a not very large, but graceful and delicate square napkin crocheted.  For beginners, this is not a big deal.  And professional craftswomen can improvise a little, adding more complex elements to the pattern. </p><h2>  Combined Options </h2><p>  Above, we examined crochet square napkins.  The schemes show in detail how to create them using one of the knitting methods.  But there are beautiful options when several techniques and patterns are combined.  They look more complex in execution, which means they have great artistic value. </p><p>  But in order to create them, you must learn to read complex patterns.  Without this, it is impossible to create true beauty.  When this level of mastery is achieved, one can begin to improvise.  Even at the planning stage, a good craftswoman knows which patterns are the best to combine and how to achieve the desired effect. </p><p>  But first you need to learn how to crochet square napkins, the patterns of which are read without any difficulty.  The necessary skills come only in practice.  The more products that are connected, the higher the level of understanding of combining different schemes and techniques. </p><h2>  Beautiful and unusual napkin </h2><p>  Even a square napkin can start from a round motif.  First, we knit a flower in which the number of petals is divided by 4. There are twelve of them in this scheme.  It is believed that this is the most optimal amount. </p><p>  Next, the transition to a square shape is made.  For this, an additional arch of air loops is knitted in four corners.  It will become the basis for the future square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet square napkins" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/838352.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  After that, the pattern is built on double crochets that create a dense canvas, as if separating the round core from the square edge.  And after a homogeneous pattern is light and openwork.  It facilitates the overall appearance of the napkin, making it more refined.  This is what <span>crocheting is.</span>  <span>The schemes of square napkins are</span> quite simple, if you know the basics of symbols. </p><p>  In this particular pattern, chains of air loops and double crochets are found.  In order for the product to work out, it is enough to carefully follow the scheme.  In order not to get confused in the number of air loops, their number is written on the diagram. </p><h2>  Useful hobby </h2><p>  It may seem to someone that square crochet napkins, the patterns of which we examined, have long gone out of fashion, that knitting them is completely pointless and uninteresting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet square napkin for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/838153.jpg" width="503"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  This is actually not the case.  There are entire communities of craftswomen who are not only looking for beautiful ready-made schemes, but also striving to create something new and original.  An example of this is the complicated version of the filet pattern, which is presented in the photo below. </p><p>  The craftswoman complicated it by linking non-traditional oblique elements instead of ordinary square cells.  From this innovation, the napkin became more festive, and the main pattern stood out even more. </p><p>  This indicates that even the most inconspicuous changes and improvisations in ordinary patterns allow you to get the final product more refined and unusual.  The main thing is not to be afraid to try to do something new. </p>

    <h2>  Fields of application </h2><p>  Square napkins are quite popular in many interiors.  Today, a simple rural style is becoming fashionable again.  And it is impossible to imagine it without snow-white napkins on the shelves and bedside tables. </p><p>  In the style of shabby chic, great attention is also paid to vintage elements.  But this does not mean that the product must be old.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to do something antique.  For example, the same napkin can be connected according to grandmother's schemes, which are stored in family archives. </p><p>  Small square napkins look good as <span>coasters for mugs</span> and glasses.  They serve not only as an element of decor in the interior, but also protect expensive surfaces from scratches and moisture that remain after the dishes. </p><p>  Therefore, you should not think that crochet napkins are irrelevant.  Needlework is always in fashion. </p>
