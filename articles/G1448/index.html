What can a household microwave do?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>A microwave</span> is a great home appliance.  Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine a house in which it would not be.  Such a thing is useful not only to an experienced hostess in the kitchen, but also to absolutely anyone.  The popularity of this device is not surprising.  It is quite easy to use, even children know how to communicate with the microwave.  However, even the owners of such household appliances do not always know the limit of their capabilities.  They refuse to read the instructions and other information about the device, and do not always know what can be put in the microwave and what not. </p><h2>  Consequences of stupidity </h2><p>  Search sites are simply teeming with queries like "what happens if you put your phone in the microwave?".  And it‚Äôs good if the owners of microwave ovens read about the possible consequences of such actions and calm down.  But no.  There is sure to be some kind of "wise guy" who decides to check what he has read on his own experience.  And on the Internet every day there are more and more videos on this topic.  People put various objects in the microwave, watch what happens next, and even shoot the entire process on video.  And all would be fine, but often such actions can lead not only to damage to the household appliance and things that were nearby, but also to injuries, and even death.  In this article, we will tell you not only what will happen if you put the phone in the microwave, but also what happens if you put other things in there. </p>

    <h2>  Features of a household microwave </h2><p>  Until recently, people could have done without such a device.  But if the microwave oven appeared in the house - you can hardly refuse its further use.  Its main advantages are high functionality and ease of use.  Simply plug the appliance into a power outlet, put food in, press a couple of buttons and wait for it to complete.  It would seem that could be easier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An ordinary household microwave performs a number of useful functions.  She can warm already cooked food.  Now you do not need to do this on the stove.  You do not have to wait until a whole pan, for example, borsch, is warmed up.  And you don‚Äôt need to dump cutlets in a pan, while adding oil, in which there is a lot of cholesterol.  Food warms up in minutes.  Business people who have every minute counts cannot do without such an adaptation. </p>

    <h2>  Cooking and defrosting foods </h2><p>  But this is not all the possibilities of a microwave.  With it, you can quickly and easily cook food.  The latest models of microwave ovens are equipped with a host of new modes and interesting functions so that they can completely replace a conventional stove.  On the Internet you can find a bunch of recipes for this device, and cooking in it is quite simple. </p>

    <p>  Another mode that is present in most microwave ovens is defrosting.  Previously, the products we got from the freezer could melt for hours.  For example, a large piece of meat went through a defrosting process for more than one hour.  In the microwave, this can be done in just half an hour. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a household appliance is not expensive, very compact, and with proper use it can last you for many years.  You can learn about precautions when using a microwave oven from the instructions, and we want to tell you about objects that should not be placed in this device. </p><h2>  List of items that should not be put in the microwave </h2><p>  Firstly, do not put <span>eggs in the microwave.</span>  It does not matter what they will be: chicken, goose or quail.  They simply explode inside the oven.  At a minimum, particles of the egg will fly all over the device and stick.  Washing them later will be quite difficult.  At maximum, the appliance may open or explode.  Then the parts of the eggs will fly around the room, and you can be injured by a blow.  Worst of all - if the microwave explodes or lights up. </p><p>  The same thing will happen with tomato, persimmon, watermelon or citrus.  The juice inside is very hot, and the product itself will swell.  As a result, an explosion will occur.  The consequences will be the same as when placing the eggs in the microwave. </p><p>  The following items from the list are marmalade, soap or chocolate.  Many microwave owners try to melt these items in the oven.  They will just start to bubble, smoke and burn. </p><h2>  Non microwave items </h2><p>  Discs, plastic dishes or foil.  All this is contraindicated to put in the microwave.  And even if the material itself from which these things are made does not spark or explode, then after being placed in the microwave they cannot be used.  The disk will cease to be working, and harmful elements of plastic dishes run the risk of getting into food and causing poisoning.  If you need to use the foil in the microwave for cooking, buy one that is specifically designed for this purpose. </p>

    <h2>  What happens if you put the phone in the microwave? </h2><p>  Back to the phone.  Many users often ask the question: "What happens if you put the phone in the microwave for 1 minute?".  It does not matter for what period of time you want to do this.  Occupation is rather useless and stupid.  Of the minimum losses, only a breakdown of the device can be called.  But it costs a lot.  The phone will begin to smoke, sparkle and burn.  What to do if I put the phone in the microwave?  Turn it off immediately and remove the phone, until this leads to unpleasant consequences.  If you put the phone in the microwave and make a call, as you know, nothing good will happen either. </p><p>  Recently, a video appeared on the Internet about how to put a phone in a microwave, and not harm either one or the other.  To do this, the young man wraps the phone in a newspaper, foil for a microwave, and then again in a layer of newspaper and foil.  After which he turns on the household appliance for about a minute.  After a series of such manipulations, he shows that the phone can be put in the oven without harmful consequences.  He then demonstrates that his phone is operational, even if you call him while the microwave is working.  But in any case, we do not recommend you to do this. </p><p>  Owners of microwave ovens conduct another experiment - they simply check the signal through the walls of the microwave, that is, they put the phone inside and do not turn on the microwave.  In most cases, the phone perfectly receives the signal, and the housing of the kitchen appliance does not interfere with this at all.  But you should turn on the microwave - the phone burned out in a matter of seconds. </p><p>  Sometimes it occurs to people to dry the phone in the microwave after they drop it into the water.  Then the fatal outcome for the phone is provided even faster: the water that has got inside will instantly heat up, and the device itself will explode. </p>

    <p>  Surely, after reading about the fact that people can put the phone in the oven, you have a question: why do this?  Just look at the consequences?  Maybe.  But it's not only that.  Recently, the Internet has launched a ‚Äúduck‚Äù that if you put the phone in the microwave, it will charge in a minute.  You should not believe such rumors, and if you think carefully, it will become clear that this is just a hoax.  But many owners of microwave ovens hastened to independently verify such a rumor, as a result of which they lost their telephone and household appliance.  In the "duck" it is said that recharging from a microwave oven is a possibility of a new firmware.  But in fact, the phone‚Äôs software does not affect the ability of the charge, this is the technical capabilities of the phone, and they are not related to the firmware.  Therefore, if you do not understand such devices, do not put expensive and dangerous experiments on health and life. </p><p>  We told you what will happen if you put the phone in the microwave or other extraneous things.  Do not repeat the mistakes of others. </p>
