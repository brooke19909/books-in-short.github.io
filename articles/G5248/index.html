Appearance, catchy views of customers, an abundance of very acceptable and frequently used functions - all this makes us pay attention to this device.  It is quite suitable for vegetarians, young mothers, retirees, people with impaired digestive tract functions and just for those who are tired of fatty and fried foods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker scarlett sc 411" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065527.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <p>  The Scarlett SC 411 crock-pot (white) will captivate with its delicate palette of colors and beautiful design.  For its value, it will delight you with many functions that completely replace everyday cooking on the stove.  One has only to try the device in practice, and it will become an indispensable "girlfriend" of a housewife. </p><p>  The software is designed for 10 functions.  Using them, you do not need to worry about the cutlets being burned, and the jelly broth will turn out cloudy.  The main advantage is the following: while cooking your favorite dishes, the hostess can read, relax or do other housework.  Thanks to the use of the SC 411 multicooker, the family diet will contain a maximum of nutrients and vitamins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Model feature </h2><p>  Any young girl will love the Scarlett SC 411 multicooker thanks to the delicate pink print and curls that distinguish this model from the rest.  The appearance of the device can be safely called universal, so it can easily fit into the design of any kitchen: from classic to high-tech.  The hostess can choose the model at her discretion: pink in flower or blue with folk ornaments. </p><p>  Turning to the technical characteristics, you must immediately clarify that the body is made of plastic that is resistant to high temperatures.  Perhaps this criterion can be called one of the most important.  The case does not require large-scale maintenance, so it won‚Äôt take too much time to wash it. </p><p>  <span>The control buttons</span> are located on the outside of the panel, located vertically.  A capacitor, or rather a compartment for it, can be found on the side.  This location was not chosen by chance.  It is here that the device can be protected from circuitry as much as possible.  The Scarlett SC 411 crock-pot is completely tight inside, therefore the chance of hit of moisture is minimum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crockery scarlett sc 411 reviews" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Management: brief instruction </h2><p>  The display perfectly reproduces the text, it is designed for two colors.  A good feature of the screen is that the numbers and modes can be seen from a long distance.  Next to the timer button are special indicators: ‚ÄúHeating‚Äù, ‚ÄúDelayed start‚Äù.  The manufacturer brought them out with separate keys for easy operation and quick access. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Scarlett SC 411 multicooker works thanks to mechanical (non-touch) buttons, which have a soft structure but are covered with plastic for additional protection against mechanical stress.  When choosing these keys, the manufacturer took into account that more susceptible options cause problems after the first few months of operation. </p><p>  The advantage of the material is that it is practically impossible to damage them with wet or dirty hands.  Even with fairly frequent use of the device, they will ensure flawless operation.  It is very easy to wash such buttons: with a soft kitchen sponge dipped in soapy water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker scarlett sc 411 customer reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065533.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  It has everything you need for cooking.  In particular: </p><ul><li>  Special capacious container for steam cooking. </li><li>  Teflon coated 4 liter bowl.  It can prepare a full breakfast or lunch for four people. </li><li>  Ribbed spoon.  It is designed to stir ingredients such as rice.  This item is made of a special material that does not damage the coating of the bowl. </li><li>  A book with recipes designed for cooking in an appliance such as the Scarlett SC 411 multicooker. </li><li>  Beaker.  It is made of plastic and has a volume of 200 ml.  It has a scale on it, which is very important when dosing the ingredients. </li><li>  Cord for outlet. </li><li>  Operational book (instruction). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker scarlett sc 411 instruction" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065573.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Basic multicooker programs </h2><p>  As already described above, the multicooker includes 10 options for convenient and quick cooking.  But the key features are just two: </p><ul><li>  "Delay start."  It allows you to start cooking at the time that the hostess needs, and everything is done automatically without human intervention.  You just need to put the ingredients and set the timer (range - no more than 24 hours). </li><li>  ‚ÄúHeating‚Äù is the second most important function.  If you do not want to eat a long-cooled breakfast or warm it using oil, you can use this option. </li></ul><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Why the Scarlett SC 411 crock-pot (customer reviews can be found a little lower) attracted housewives, it is quite clear: inexpensive price and appropriate quality. </p><p>  In addition to these criteria, there are other advantages to this model.  Consider them: </p><ul><li>  variety of functions; </li><li>  quite understandable program interface; </li><li>  delicate coloring and attractive appearance; </li><li>  a protective coating of the bowl of three layers and a smooth bottom; </li><li>  acceptable price; </li><li>  small sizes that allow you to install the appliance even in small kitchens; </li><li>  removable cord; </li><li>  the presence of the ‚ÄúDelay start‚Äù function. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disassemble a crock scarlett sc 411" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065587.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  However, making a review of this model, you can not keep silent about its shortcomings.  These findings were based on consumer feedback.  All claims that appear when using a household appliance are due to the fact that the Scarlett SC 411 multicooker (the instructions are written correctly and there are no complaints) is outdated and new models with a large number of functions for the same money have already appeared.  It is more suitable for those who will not use the device very often, and will also be useful for people who are satisfied with a minimum of programs. </p><p>  The main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the cord is only 1 meter; </li><li>  there are not many recipes in the book; </li><li>  it is inconvenient to wash the panel, as it cannot be removed; </li><li>  there is no disconnect button, therefore, in order to turn off the multicooker, you must unplug the cord from the outlet; </li><li>  the "Frying" mode stops working too quickly or does not initially work. </li></ul><h2>  Is it possible to disassemble a multicooker? </h2><p>  People who have already purchased such a model noticed that minor breakdowns often occur.  In order not to spend money on fixing and not swearing with representatives of service centers, many owners of the device asked themselves the question: ‚ÄúHow to disassemble the Scarlett SC 411 multicooker?‚Äù. </p><p>  First, it‚Äôs worth clarifying that the most problematic mode is ‚ÄúFrying‚Äù.  In order to fix the problem, just open the instrument panel and replace the fuse.  Its malfunction is a common cause of a malfunction. </p><p>  Disassembling a slow cooker is very easy.  It is enough to take a Phillips screwdriver and unscrew 4 screws at the bottom of the case.  It cannot be opened completely, since wires are welded to it, but this is not necessary.  The fuses are located on the white insulating wires, and they look like two strips of silver color.  It is enough for the tester to check the serviceability of the red and blue wires and replace the blown elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker scarlett sc 411 white" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1065584.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  <span>The Scarlett SC 411 crock-pot, reviews</span> of which in most cases are positive, everyone works without fail for different times.  This can not be called a disadvantage, since almost all household appliances can be manufactured defectively, moreover, regardless of the manufacturer.  Everyone understands that it is impossible to wait for something super powerful for a low price, but for some people the device refused to work after a month. </p><p>  As a rule, the main advantages of the multicooker, according to customers, are appearance, compactness, overall bowl, which is light in weight and has a convenient handle.  However, after reading the negative opinions of many users, we can conclude that such modes as "Frying" and "Baking / Soup" stably stop working.  Some functions are able to work through time. </p><p>  The Scarlett SC 411 crock-pot (reviews confirm the following facts) cooks porridge much better than it can be done manually on the stove.  Boiling and unnecessary fumes, odors are not observed during cooking. </p>
