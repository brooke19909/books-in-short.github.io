Over five million tourists visit it every year.  They are attracted here by the picturesque nature, comfortable living conditions, a variety of entertainment and hospitality of the local population. </p><p>  In Pattaya, you can not only relax perfectly on the well-equipped beaches, but also explore unique natural and iconic sights.  It seems to us that Pattaya is a universal resort, suitable for lovers of nightly entertainment, and for families with children, for those who dream of peace and quiet on vacation.  But in order for the trip not to disappoint, you must choose the right place to live, because the districts of Pattaya (Thailand) are so different for each other that sometimes it seems that they are in different parts of the country. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.9235557" data-lng="100.88245510000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/9/7/17397.png"></div><p>  Below we will present you a brief description and reviews of tourists.  I want to believe that this will help you make the right choice of vacation spot. </p><h2>  Northern part of the city </h2><p>  It includes the Wongamat microdistrict with a beach, which is considered the best in the city.  There are many luxury hotels in North Pattaya, the infrastructure is well developed.  All major shopping centers and entertainment venues in North Pattaya are located in the area of ​​North Pattaya.  In addition, there are many car dealerships.  In the north of Pattaya you should see: the spiritual and Orthodox complex of the Temple of Truth, the Fairtex sports complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Truth" class="if uuid-3214709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214709.jpg"></div><h2>  Naklua </h2><p>  This is a quiet and peaceful area of ​​the city, one of the most popular in Pattaya.  He stretched almost 10 kilometers.  Tourists can relax here on several beaches.  The most famous of them is "Wong Phra Chan", a length of about a kilometer.  Lovers of secluded relaxation prefer to be here.  Near the beach there are several comfortable hotels with developed adjacent infrastructure and well-groomed beach area. </p><p>  The small and very quiet “Palm Beach” is covered with soft fine sand, and the water here is crystal clear.  There are no palm trees familiar to Thailand, leaning over the water, but nearby is a shady park, loved by tourists, which is located right on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Naklua District" class="if uuid-3214706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214706.jpg"></div><h2>  Naklua Hotels </h2><p>  The coastline of this Pattaya area is densely built up with hotels that protect the beach area from city noise.  Hotels here are for every taste and budget.  Nevertheless, most tourists believe that Naklua is great for those who want to relax with minimal financial costs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And lovers of a comfortable stay can settle in this area in hotels of a higher price category, which have bars and restaurants, spa complexes, fresh and sea water pools (Basaya Beach Hotel &amp; Resort, Lux SL Luxury Style of Life 3 5 *, Rasha Residence). </p><h2>  Where to eat? </h2><p>  Naklua has a large number of catering outlets - from cheap macaroons and inexpensive cafes to luxurious restaurants serving European and Thai dishes.  In addition, there are fruit and fish markets, grocery stores. </p><h2>  Shopping centers </h2><p>  There are no large supermarkets in this area of ​​Pattaya, but they can be reached in just 20 minutes at the local tuk-tuk in the Central District.  Tesco Lotus Shopping Center is located on North Street. </p><h2>  Wongamat </h2><p>  Considering the best areas of Pattaya, more precisely, those located in the northern part of the city, we suggest you pay attention to Wongamat, which is part of Naklua.  The Long Beach Garden Hotel has a kilometer stretch of coastline.  In addition, there are secluded beaches about 200 meters long.  In recent years, our compatriots like to relax in this area of ​​Pattaya, so signs in travel agencies, menus in restaurants, Russian-speaking managers are not uncommon here. </p><p>  Experienced tourists believe that families with young children will feel comfortable at Wongamat, as there is a gentle gentle slope into the sea.  In order for an adult to have water to the waist, you should walk at least 10 meters.  In the center of the beach there are numerous water activities available - skis, bananas, motorbikes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wongamat District" class="if uuid-3214716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214716.jpg"></div><h2>  Central Pattaya </h2><p>  Now move to the central part of the city.  It is suitable for people who prefer fun and nightly entertainment.  From south to north it is limited by the streets of South and North Pattaya, respectively.  Here is popular among tourists Beach Street and the main promenade of the city. </p><p>  The largest and busiest beach is Pattaya Beach, 4 km long, spread over the bay.  For lovers of outdoor activities and various water sports at Pattaya Beach, ideal conditions are created.  The disadvantages of relaxation in this part of the city are not very clean water, so lovers of diving and swimming go to neighboring islands, which are located nearby.  In Central Pattaya, beaches are busy around the clock.  In the daytime, the whole territory is lined with sunbeds and umbrellas, and in the evening, guests are attracted by the pedestrian path that stretches along Beach Street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Pattaya" class="if uuid-3214713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214713.jpg"></div><p>  There are many entertainment venues in Central Pattaya where various entertainment and festivities are held: bed races, fireworks festival and many others.  Incendiary discos and night clubs offer interesting programs.  In this area of ​​Pattaya there are massage parlors that offer services for every taste.  In addition, shopping enthusiasts will enjoy shopping a lot. </p><h2>  South Pattaya </h2><p>  This part of the city is located between Central Pattaya and Jomtien.  Vacationers here are much less than in other areas.  Here you will find the South Bus Station, Bali Hai Pier, a race track and Big C supermarket.  Kilometer street after 18.00 becomes a pedestrian.  At this time, numerous cafes, bars and nightclubs open.  There are many hotels in South Pattaya, both luxury and budget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="South Pattaya" class="if uuid-3214715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214715.jpg"></div><h2>  Jomtien </h2><p>  The area received the same name with a village and a local beach.  The Jomtien area in Pattaya has formed around them.  On a rather long (6 km) and clean beach, not only tourists, but also locals like to relax.  It is conditionally divided into zones that are suitable both for active and noisy recreation of youth companies, and for family holidays with children.  Various mass events are held here: volleyball, beach soccer, windsurfing tournaments.  Here you can rent a sunbed, or you can sunbathe on the sand in separate areas. </p><h2>  Shops and Markets </h2><p>  In the northern part of the district there is a huge night market, they understand Russian quite well, since there are many of our compatriots here.  Near the market there is a Tesco Lotus hypermarket and an Outlet Mall boutique.  There are no major shopping centers in this area.  Tourists travel to nearby areas for shopping.  On the Sukhumvit highway, passing nearby, you can find various shops, including King Power, car dealerships and hypermarkets.  Here are restaurants and world famous McDonalds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jomtien Beach" class="if uuid-3214717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214717.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  When it comes to which areas in Pattaya are more suitable for living, most tourists from Russia consider this to be Jomtien.  New hotels and hotel complexes are being actively built here.  The most famous and popular of them is the Ambassador 4 *. </p><p>  Those who wish can find budget accommodation in 2 * hotels - Marina Hotel 2 *, Neo 2 *, Shakespeare Inn 2 *, as well as rooms in the private sector with a bathroom, a TV, air conditioning and a refrigerator.  Everyone who loves a relaxing holiday, rent a house in a quiet part of the area.  On this territory there are hotel complexes and separate bungalows. </p><p>  There are many exotic parks, pools.  And on the seafront guests are waiting for famous seafood restaurants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya areas" class="if uuid-3214697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214697.jpg"></div><h2>  Pratumnak </h2><p>  The area got its name by the name of the highest point of the resort - Pratamnak hill.  Here is also located a popular beach among tourists from Russia.  It is well equipped, in sufficient quantities there are umbrellas, deck chairs.  And the ubiquitous merchants offer a variety of food, funny souvenirs, beachwear. </p><p>  The Pratumnak district in Pattaya and the “Russian Village”, in which tourists from the countries of the former USSR most often live, are famous. </p><p>  In our opinion, the infrastructure on this beach is well thought out.  Those who wish can visit the golf club and go-kart center, a water park and many attractions.  This is a prestigious and rather expensive area.  Here is the residence of the princess of the country, and expensive hotels rise along the coast. </p><p>  For example, Pattaya Park with the highest tower in the city and its own water park.  Fascinating attractions for children, the proximity of a clean and well-kept beach attract families with children here for a vacation.  Observation platforms, a large city park with unusually beautiful exotic plants, and a Buddha statue are equipped on the territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationmultimedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="North Pattaya" class="if uuid-3214702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3214702.jpg"></div><h2>  Which area of ​​Pattaya is better? </h2><p>  To this question, we, like many tourists, do not have a clear answer.  All areas of Pattaya in Thailand have their own characteristics.  Therefore, the choice of vacationers largely depends on the purpose of their trip.  For example, young people and those who come to the resort in search of a fun nightlife should stay in South and Central Pattaya.  Numerous discos and bars will have a great time after relaxing on the beach. </p><p>  If you are planning a trip with children, then the Jomtien area and its famous Pattaya Park hotel are ideal.  For those who go to Pattaya for a beach holiday, the areas of Pratumnak, Naklua and Jomtien are suitable. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists who know all areas of Pattaya, reviews about the rest leave positive.  They are attracted by the year-round tourist season, magnificent nature, a varied rich excursion program, budget holidays.  Its disadvantages include a high level of humidity and too many Russian-speaking tourists. </p><p>  Whichever area of ​​the city you choose, you must remember that a successful vacation depends on your mood.  For the most part, Pattaya hotels do not suggest that tourists will spend 24 hours a day in them.  Therefore, relax on the beaches, see the sights, move from one area to another.  In this case, your vacation will be truly interesting. </p>
