Beeline offers its customers some very interesting actions that can be carried out with it.  Firstly, you can get a personal card from the company.  An interesting offer, but not many use it.  Secondly, it is possible to pay by phone ("Beeline") with a credit card.  With "plastic" you have the right to recharge the balance of the SIM card, as well as payment for communication services and purchases in the online store of the company.  This is a more important point that subscribers are paying attention to.  Now we have to learn how to replenish Beeline from the card of any bank. </p>

    <h2>  About personal card </h2><p>  How to top up Beeline from a card?  First, a few words about the debit "plastic".  This is a fairly new service that has become available to all subscribers of the company.  Now you can draw up a personal card from Beeline and pay with it for your purchases.  The same as the "plastic" in an ordinary bank. </p><p>  For registration you have to write a special statement.  Beeline bank card can be purchased on the official website.  To do this, you need to make a request in electronic form.  In addition, it can be purchased at any office of the company.  Choose the type of debit "plastic" (Visa or MasterCard) and issue, as in a regular bank.  After some time, you will have to pick up a card from the Beeline office.  Or, in general, you can apply for a house.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the Beeline bank card is not very popular.  After all, payment for some services and purchases in stores may simply not go through.  It turns out that paying a Beeline card can be quite problematic.  And it’s almost impossible to withdraw cash from such a “plastic” - there are no ATMs to make the idea a reality. </p><h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  Having learned all about the Beeline card, we will analyze the possibilities of replenishing the SIM card account with the usual “plastic”.  In fact, subscribers are offered a lot of solutions to the question.  First of all, you can replenish Beeline with a credit card through the official website of your mobile operator.  It is here that everyone is able to bring almost any idea regarding a SIM card to life. </p>

    <p>  What does that require?  Go to oplata.beeline.ru/mobile.  This page allows you to replenish the account of a particular SIM card in a single order.  First, you need to fill in all the specified fields, and then send the appropriate request.  The main advantage of the service is its extreme simplicity and convenient navigation.  Interactive images on the web page will help even a novice subscriber to easily find the necessary data and enter them in the appropriate fields. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, if you pay attention to the site, you can notice that in its upper part there are several tabs.  For example, “Internet” and “TV”.  When you click on one of them, you get the opportunity to pay for a particular service using a bank card.  This, do not forget, a one-time payment.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><h2>  Threshold auto payment </h2><p>  True, there are several more quite interesting options for solving the problem.  For example, activation of the “Auto payment” service.  It helps to top up your account quickly and automatically without commission.  There are several layouts.  The first of them is replenishment of an account to achieve a certain “threshold” of funds.  In this case, the service will be activated after the amount specified in the settings remains on the SIM card.  Very convenient - you can always be in touch. </p><p>  To implement the idea, an SMS team is suitable.  With its help, even a novice subscriber can easily and simply manage to cope with the task.  In order to activate "Auto Payment" by "plastic" on "Beeline", type the message of the following type: "Number-sum-threshold-last digits of the card."  As soon as you cope with the task, it is enough to send SMS to number 900. And that’s it, you can wait for the result.  Please note: number, deposit amount, threshold on the account and card numbers are written with a space.  Otherwise, the request will not be processed. </p>

    <h2>  Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Sometimes you need to set up "Auto Payment" with some frequency.  Once a month, for example.  Here the official website of your bank will help us.  In our case, it will be Sberbank of Russia.  He has a service called Srebrank @ Online.  He is what we need.  By the way, many cellular subscribers have bank cards from Sberbank.  This means that this service is very popular. </p><p>  Paying by phone (Beeline) with a credit card can be done using Auto Payment.  To get started, log in to the Sberbank Online website, and then select the “Payments and Transfers” item: “Mobile Communications”.  Then you will see images of mobile operators.  Next to some will be the inscription "Auto payment".  Click on it near the Beeline, and then proceed to fill in the details.  We select the frequency of replenishment, the amount of charges, indicate the number of the recipient and save the changes.  After processing the operation, you will receive a message that "Auto payment" is connected. </p><h2>  Terminals </h2><p>  Another solution to our problem is payment terminals.  It doesn't matter what your bank card is.  Beeline is a fairly large company, which is present in the terminals of almost all banks.  How can I connect to myself "Auto Payment" using this "machine"? </p>

    <p>  To do this, just go to the terminal, insert “plastic” into it and select the desired function in the corresponding menu.  Then we indicate the telecom operator (“Beeline” in our case), click OK and agree with the conditions displayed on the screen.  Now you need to fill in all the details that the system requires.  Ready?  Then confirm the action and receive a check.  "Auto payment" is connected.  This is a free service that many banks have.  You can disable it at any time in the same way. </p><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  The last thing that can be offered is replenishment of the SIM card account with “plastic” using these devices.  This method is good in that it does not require a commission from you.  So, all debited funds will come to the account. </p>

    <p>  Insert the card into the ATM, enter the pin code and on the screen click "Mobile Communications".  Now you just need to select a Beeline operator, indicate your phone number (or any other topped up number).  Then confirm your actions and write down the payment amount.  Finish working with an ATM and receive a check at the exit.  Now you know how to pay (“Beeline”) by credit card, on the company's website, as well as using terminals and ATMs. </p>
