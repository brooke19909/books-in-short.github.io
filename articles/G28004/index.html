The best shockproof and waterproof smartphone on Android</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are used to the fact that smartphones are fragile graceful everyday helpers that require careful attitude and additional protection in some situations.  For example, you should use such a device in a case so that in case of a fall its internal components are not damaged;  and in order to maintain the integrity of the fragile touch screen, you need to use a protective film, which serves as another layer, taking all the scratches onto you.  So, most users manage to maintain both the appearance of the device and its functionality at the factory level. </p><p>  However, there is a category of smartphones for which all these and other measures are not required.  These are telephones, which, in essence, are protected, protected from any possible damage.  They are also called ‚Äúshockproof smartphones‚Äù, because such a phone, despite its functionality, is not afraid of falls from a height or any other mechanical influences.  In today's article, we will consider just a few of these devices so that the interested reader knows what they are and what they are. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Immediately I want to describe the concept that manufacturers who manufacture shockproof smartphones adhere to.  Typically, such devices are equipped with a high degree of protection, represented by a powerful glass, reinforced housing, as well as a rubberized shell that can prevent moisture from entering the housing.  Due to this, most phones in this category have a somewhat bulky and rather large appearance.  For example, using them in everyday life will be somewhat inconvenient (especially for girls). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, not all shockproof smartphones are like that.  There are also gadgets with a sophisticated design and easily fit in your pocket.  True, their degree of protection without a dense layer of plastic or rubber is seriously reduced. </p>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  As a rule, shockproof smartphones (reviews of them confirm this) do not have such a productive technical stuffing as the usual devices that we use in everyday life.  The reason for this, apparently, is the purpose of the phone: as a rule, protected devices are needed in ‚Äúfield conditions‚Äù, where high-speed processor operation or the presence of a high-precision camera are not required.  Such phones are required, for example, to be able to determine the location using GPS, to communicate via the network in areas where the signal is weak;  support for the work of two SIM cards, the presence of memory cards and other things will not hurt. </p><p>  In view of this, protected shockproof smartphones are equipped with not the fastest processor, a small amount of RAM, not a new version of the operating system. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  An important aspect of the functioning of any such device is the availability of a volume battery.  This follows from the needs that stand in front of a phone of this class - the need to hold a charge as long as possible in the absence of any power sources.  This is logical, because in nature (camping, hunting or traveling) there is no way to connect the phone to a charger, which requires a powerful battery.  As a rule, developers take this into account when bundling their shockproof smartphones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The best models </h2><p>  In order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe devices that we characterize in this review, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with some of the best-in-class gadgets presented as recently as possible.  In the article we provide not only a brief description of them, but also a number of characteristics that are of interest to us.  Thus, they will be reviewed and, in addition, a picture will be made of what the devices are.  Below they are listed. </p><h2>  Runbo x6 </h2><p>  One of the most successfully sold devices, released under the brand so unfamiliar to us.  The phone has an unusually high technical performance due to fairly powerful equipment.  For example, here stands the MTK6589T processor, installed on budget models of full-fledged smartphones.  In addition to it, the device boasts 2 GB of RAM, a colorful screen that transmits high-quality images, as well as a 13-megapixel camera.  With its parameters, the device breaks stereotypes (in particular, one of the ones we described above) that an shockproof smartphone on Android cannot be productive. </p>

    <h2>  Viking tor </h2><p>  This is another powerful new product with a 4-core MTK processor, which will give odds to many ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù phones without a rubberized case and protective panels.  The phone has an attractive ‚Äúsevere‚Äù design, which carries not only aesthetic value, but also helps to increase the security of the device.  Again, this is a shockproof and <span>waterproof smartphone that</span> can remain operational in almost any environment. </p><p>  However, here manufacturers miscalculated somewhat with the battery capacity by installing a 2650 mAh battery on the phone.  This is frankly not enough. </p>

    <h2>  Sonim land rover s2 </h2><p>  This device is slightly different from those mentioned above.  In terms of technical characteristics, it really lags behind - it has a small screen (2-inch diagonal), a simple processor that does not differ in performance, and a 1950 mAh battery.  In addition, some additional modules are installed here: <span>3G-adapter, Bluetooth,</span> WiFi, GPS. </p><p>  But in terms of security, this is the best shockproof smartphone.  He earned such a title thanks to a number of practical tests, for which he was included in the Guinness Book of Records. </p>

    <h2>  Ginnzu RS61D Ultimate </h2><p>  The name of the company producing this phone is unlikely to tell the majority of readers of this article.  The developer has prepared an interesting solution for real travelers and extreme sports.  This is a ‚Äúhybrid" phone and walkie-talkie.  From the first, a powerful quad-core processor is installed here, which resembles the first two of our ‚Äúheroes‚Äù of the review, as well as additional systems inherent in many smartphones.  From the walkie-talkie here, in fact, there is only a signal transmission and reception module, operating in such a way that it can be caught at a distance of up to a kilometer (in an urban environment).  It is possible that in an open area, the signal strength will expand this range, allowing you to keep communication with other participants. </p>

    <h2>  Ginzu RS9 Dual </h2><p>  And this participant in our rating proves that not all shockproof smartphones are expensive.  The review showed that there are budget models that have a high level of security and, thus, can behave perfectly in practice.  At least this sample in question has 1 GB of RAM, an MTK6589 processor with a core frequency of 1.2 GHz;  8 megapixel camera.  The cost of the model is about 10 thousand rubles - for this money the buyer receives a display with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels.  The battery pre-installed here has a capacity of 2800 mAh. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As we prepared the reviews that you reviewed above, we also came across reviews of some smartphones.  They are of a different nature and for the most part positively note the level of work of the device itself.  In particular, from the point of view of security, the models really show themselves on the good side.  However, there are shortcomings in something else: audibility, battery endurance, stability.  After all, first of all, the shockproof smartphone on Android is a phone that can also have some minor flaws that make interaction with it less comfortable.  Therefore, choosing such a gadget, you should pay attention not only to how it is protected, but also how it behaves in everyday life. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Today, a shockproof and waterproof smartphone can become indispensable somewhere on a long journey, away from civilization and our usual comfort.  However, for this you need to make sure that the device meets all your requirements and does not fail at the most inopportune moment.  To do this, we recommend not to chase budget, so as not to run into low-quality Chinese products, but to choose more carefully.  We hope this review helps you make the right choice. </p>
