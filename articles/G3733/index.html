Anatoly became a first-class student at the age of nine, at the age of 11 he fulfilled the norm of a candidate for master.  Further success was achieved under the guidance of S. M. Furman, an experienced grandmaster mentor.  At the age of fourteen, he became a master of sports; at the age of eighteen (in 1969), chess player Anatoly Karpov excelled at the World Championship among young men.

    <h2>  Championship without a decisive battle </h2><p>  While still a student of the Faculty of Economics, Karpov came close to the chess crown.  In 1072-1975, he went through all the qualifying rounds of the World Cup, at the end of winning contender matches with the strongest rivals - Viktor Korchnoi, Lev Polugaevsky, <span>Boris Spassky.</span> </p><p>  Most likely, analyzing the games of Anatoly Karpov, the current champion <span>Bobby Fisher,</span> wishing to leave ‚Äúundefeated‚Äù, refused to fight.  A unique case in history: in the spring of 1975, the applicant was declared FIDE the twelfth world champion, having not played a single game with the previously acting ‚Äúking‚Äù in the final match (as you know, the main match according to the rules should last until 6 victories of one of the participants), nor in other international competitions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parties of Anatoly Karpov" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7089/753661.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Sports achivments </h2><p>  Fischer, who left the fight, set a precedent when the announced champion had to prove his title in other competitions of a high rank.  And Karpov brilliantly dealt with this.  The Soviet chess player in the same 1975 won the prestigious tournament in Milan.  He defended his champion title in matches with Victor Korchnoi representing Switzerland: in 1978 in Baguio (Philippines) he won the last crucial game with a score of 5: 5 (the result of the match was 16.5: 15.5), then in 1981 he won in Italian Merano.  Having lost in only two games with ten draws, Karpov defeated his opponent with a convincing score of 6: 2 (11: 7) within twenty-eight tournament days. </p><p>  For twelve years, from 1971 to 1981, the athlete received the Chess Oscar nine times as the best grandmaster in the world.  Three times, in 1976, 1983 and 1988, he won the USSR title (in 1988, along with Garry Kasparov). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatoly Karpov biography" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7089/755162.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <h2>  Fights with Kasparov </h2><p>  The most dramatic, memorable throughout the country period of the champion‚Äôs sports career is the defense of the title in the confrontation with the talented young compatriot Garry Kasparov. </p><p>  Karpov‚Äôs initial success (score 5-0 for victories, in which it was enough to win a single game) was minimized by the strong-willed effort of the applicant.  The match was stopped by FIDE without declaring a winner with a score of 5: 3 and 40 ‚Äúdraws‚Äù (a record number of games played for meetings of this rank).  A pair of Soviet chess players set another peculiar record - Karpov and Kasparov met in the decisive championship match 5 times (before them they challenged the highest rank counterpart Smyslov and Botvinnik). </p><p>  The first match, which began on September 9, 1984, lasted until February 15 of the following year.  In the same 1985, a new match took place, where the final score was symmetric: 5: 3 in favor of Kasparov.  How strong was the chess player Karpov, the fact that, losing to his fateful opponent a rematch in 1986 (with a difference of one victory), he twice acted as the only possible challenger.  Moreover, in 1987 in Seville, only an unfortunate mistake in the 11th game caused by tremendous nervous tension, and his missed chance to use Kasparov‚Äôs miscalculation in a decisive match (with a score of +1 in his favor) did not allow Anatoly to return the title.  According to chess experts, the three-year drawn-out confrontation led both opponents to be creatively and psychologically exhausted. </p><h2>  Anatoly Karpov - chess player and man </h2><p>  In 2002, Anatoly Karpov defeated Kasparov in an unofficial match, having drawn the main part of the tournament in a draw and won an extra in quick chess with a score of 2.5: 1.5.  He won the first place in the competition in Linares (1994), the victory over Jan Timman, <span>Gata Kamsky,</span> Vichy Anand: three times after the split in the world of chess championships, he won the highest title according to FIDE (in 1993, 1996, 1998). </p><p>  Karpov Anatoly Evgenievich, thanks to his upbringing and character, was not a rebel either in terms of organizing chess championships or in civilian life.  At the same time, he proved himself to be a man of a wide soul, in 2007 he sought a meeting with his former main rebel rival, who was arrested for participating in the ‚ÄúMarch of Dissent‚Äù. </p><p>  Karpov in 1982 headed the International Association of Peace Funds.  He is the author of several fascinating books about his favorite intellectual game, a philatelist who has assembled one of the richest collections of chess brands.  A long-standing passion, according to Anatoly Evgenievich, disciplines thinking, develops memory, which is so necessary for calculating variations of moves. </p>
