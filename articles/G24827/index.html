It is not surprising that the <span>Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (CBD)</span> is one of the most popular places in <span>domestic tourism</span> .  <span>The Caucasus Mountains</span> attract travelers with their beauty and mystery, and the subject itself is increasingly attracting the attention of investors. </p><h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  The peoples who lived on the modern territory of the CBD were known in antiquity.  About them wrote historians who lived before our era.  However, more or less definitively ethnic composition was formed only in the Middle Ages, and in the XIX century this land became part of Russia.  It has been in its current borders since 1921 and is called the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic. </p><p>  The capital Nalchik began its development with a small fortress built in 1818.  The first information about the settlement in this area dates back to the 18th century, and in 1921 it received the status of a city and at the same time the capital of the republic.  During the war, he was seriously injured, but immediately after the liberation, restoration of buildings and normal life began.  Nevertheless, the troubles of the local peoples did not end there.  In 1944, the Balkarians were forcibly deported to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in order to transfer part of the land for the military needs of Georgia. </p>

    <p>  On the whole, this city developed like any other: new enterprises were created, and strong economic ties gradually formed.  And after the collapse of the USSR, it all had to be re-established.  Despite the relative proximity to the so-called "hot spots", the entire Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, the capital and major cities remain quite prosperous in the sense of terrorist threats.  The most significant episodes remain incidents that occurred in 2005 and 2011. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, the capital and largest city of which is still Nalchik, is an important subject of the Russian Federation in terms of recreational, environmental, and forest resources.  This is an important agricultural center, and has been actively developing infrastructure and services recently.  In addition, the region has an amazing distinctive culture, preserves the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the titular nations as state, in addition to Russian. </p>

    <p>  On its territory, the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic contains the highest peak in Russia - Elbrus.  As a rule, this mountain, due to the blurred <span>border between Asia and Europe,</span> is also attributed to the famous list of "Seven Peaks", sometimes replacing it with Mont Blanc.  In addition, there are also 6 more so-called "five-thousanders", attracting a huge number of climbers. </p><p>  In recent years, the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (Nalchik) has experienced a gradual but constant outflow of the population, as well as the subject as a whole.  Now about 850 thousand people live in this region, about half of them are Kabardins. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Since the active development of the city began relatively recently, absolutely old buildings and examples of architecture can not be found here.  But this does not mean that the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic is completely uninteresting, and there is nothing to see in the whole region.  The most popular place for tourists in Nalchik is the park.  Here is the building of the famous restaurant "Sosruko", built in the form of the head of a hero of a legend popular among locals.  Even in the city there is evidence that people lived here long before our era - a burial ground, of which there are many in the North Caucasus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about what is of interest to the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic as a whole, then the first thing that comes to mind is, of course, mountains.  Almost all the attractions are connected with the landscape: high peaks, picturesque gorges, lakes, waterfalls, parks.  Perhaps, indeed, nature will be the most interesting for tourists here. </p><p>  Firstly, it is impossible to ignore Elbrus and the adjacent territories, which are protected.  In the same area is the extremely popular <span>Baksan Gorge,</span> where hundreds and thousands of tourists come annually. </p>

    <p>  Another destination that attracts travelers to the CBD is the Cherek Gorge.  Before the entrance there are the famous Blue Lakes, as well as the equally popular Lost Lake, which is now a funnel with almost sheer walls, at the bottom of which you can find a pond.  In the gorge itself, tourists must visit the <span>Chegem waterfalls.</span>  In addition, in the gorge itself there is a large number of ancient buildings, the ruins of villages, fortresses, etc. In general, you will not be bored. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Of course, the intangible heritage of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic cannot be ignored.  The capital, of course, is not the place where you can see people in national costumes and horses on the streets, but in some places you can see it.  Despite the fact that much was lost in Soviet times, the customs and rituals that have been part of the life of local peoples for hundreds of years are now being restored and redistributed.  Many of them are inextricably linked with agriculture and the life cycle, as well as family holidays.  Vocal art and folk crafts are reviving, festivals are regularly held. </p>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Traditionally, local farming is built on agriculture.  There are also large industrial enterprises, but, like almost everywhere in Russia, in the last decades they are in a state of stagnation.  The service sector is in the process of formation.  Perhaps, any serious development can now only be talked about in the energy sector. </p><p>  In recent years, as part of a program to develop infrastructure and support small enterprises on the basis of Kabardino-Balkaria, the creation of special business incubators has begun.  One of them is located in the capital, the other - in the second most populated city, Prokhladny.  The third is in the Baksan district. </p><h2>  Investment climate </h2><p>  The already mentioned business incubators assist novice entrepreneurs, including the provision of suitable production facilities.  Real estate of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (CBD) has sufficient potential for the development of the business environment.  But the country does not stop there. </p>

    <p>  Not so long ago, its native, Yuri Kokov, who was elected head of the CBD, is building his regional development policy fairly evenly, affecting all major industries.  He is engaged in the development of infrastructure, social services and, of course, industry and services. </p><p>  Not so long ago, a special program was launched called "Investment passport of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic", which is multi-tasking.  In accordance with this plan, potential sources of capital can receive a variety of relevant information on the economic condition of the subject, possible interesting areas, the business environment as a whole. </p><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  The main difficulty of the CBD, as well as many other subjects of the Russian Federation, are difficulties with attracting investments.  The problem of population outflow, which has become relevant in the past few years, is superimposed on this.  Strong dependence on the federal budget and proximity to regular conflict points also does not make life easier.  Together, this forms a whole complex of interrelated problems not only in Kabardino-Balkaria, but also in the whole of the North Caucasus as a whole.  However, this region has enormous potential. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  In general, the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, the capital, large settlements and the south-western part with the Elbrus region are potentially quite interesting for investors.  The whole region has great chances to soon become an extremely popular ski resort and a great place for ecological, gastronomic, health-improving, cultural and many other types of tourism. </p><p>  This, however, does not put an end to other sectors of the economy.  Reasonable investments and federal subsidies can help the entity literally ‚Äúblossom‚Äù.  And bad governance is to nullify all the local advantages. </p>
