  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development of the global web or who invented the internet?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the 1950s, there was a great deal of passion in the world over a possible war with the USSR.  America, it seemed, invulnerable due to its geographical location, began to seriously think about the theoretical possibility of hostilities.  One of the main aspects for the military and the requirement for scientists was the creation of a network for the exchange of information between units and military units, in the conditions of total bombing. </p><p>  The result of these tasks was a contract assignment from the US Department of Defense to four leading organizations in this area.  Answering the question - "who invented the Internet?"  - it is necessary to clarify exactly what was meant.  If we talk about the progenitor of the Internet as the Global Web, then we can consider the founders of three universities (California, Utah, California) and a research center at Stanfort.  It was they who created the first "mini-global network" - ARPANET, in 1957.  The main purpose at that moment was the use of the network by these scientific organizations. </p><p>  Having departed a little from the network, it is necessary to note who invented the first computer?  After all, the network at that time was a cable connection of heavy-duty computer stations (they had huge dimensions).  In 1946, ENIAC launched the world's first electronic computing tool.  Of course, the PC of our days is significantly different from that of EMU, but nevertheless it is already close.  In April 1964, IBM Corporation already released a serial PC (still of impressive size) - System 60. However, not everyone knows that from a legal point of view, the first patent for a "universal" prototype of a computer was obtained by the inventor of the "intellect" from Omsk Gorokhov . </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now the picture is clearer and it is possible to answer the question ‚Äúwho invented the Internet?‚Äù From a different point of view.  September 1969 - the first server ever appears at the University of California (Los Angeles).  The machine was recognized by Honeywell and was designated DP-516.  Now "selected" users have the opportunity to create and store centralized databases.  Indeed, try to imagine the current Global Web without servers - these will be only email clients, personal resources and torrent sites. </p><p>  In October of the same year, an attempt was made to transfer online at the office of California University.  Pundits wanted to print the word "LOGIN" on the computer of another university.  And even though they didn‚Äôt do it the first time, they did it anyway.  Speaking in which year the Internet was invented on-line, then this is that date.  It would be difficult to imagine modern services and services not on-line.  The user is spoiled, he needs here and now.  Then the greatest minds of the world could hardly do it. </p><p>  But what was the Internet of that time?  Now the question ‚Äúwho invented the Internet?‚Äù Is not relevant, the question ‚Äúwhat was in it?‚Äù Is relevant.  But there was actually not much.  These days, such a network is unlikely to interest an ordinary user.  But people saw the prospects and understood that everything was just beginning.  Only in 1971 did the prototype of a modern email sending program appear.  People instantly appreciated this and began to get involved in this network. </p><p>  The ARPANET network entered the international level in 1973.  This year, the first connection of computers from the UK and Norway took place.  This was made possible by using a <span>transatlantic cable</span> for telephone lines.  The Internet has changed.  <span>Mail clients</span> (creating mailing lists) began to develop, message boards and news prototypes of blogs appear.  Entrepreneurs immediately realized that this was a gold mine, and began to not only be interested in the new phenomenon, but also invest in it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But ARPANET did not rest on its laurels for long.  In 1984, people started using an alternative - NSFNet.  This once-integrated structure of university networks also began to gain popularity.  Its creators - the NSF of the United States, did not think to miss this opportunity and watch how their competitors gain world recognition.  In 1988, something similar to modern chat appears.  People prophesy the future of a phenomenon called "Internet."  But back to the competition.  The Internet and the World Wide Web are two different things.  But now is not about that.  The term "Internet" was convenient for people, therefore, a struggle developed for this title. </p><p>  On the net now asking the question ‚Äúwho invented the Internet?‚Äù, You can find the name Bernes-Lee Tim.  This is not a mistake, this is again a relative point of view.  In 1989, at the ECNR, this outstanding programmer introduced the concept of a ‚Äúsingle space‚Äù.  Several years will pass and he will introduce the HTTP world, on the basis of which HTML will be created.  This is the usual classification and routing by url.  Perhaps the emergence of a generalized standard, which allowed not to redo, but to layering (convert) networks of various protocols, should really be considered the birthday of the "normal Internet". </p><p>  In the 90th year the ARPANET network completely ceased to function, having given NSFNet laurels.  What contributed to this is hard to understand.  But history will still show interesting points.  Also note the first ring on the network this year.  In 1991, the world's first browser "Mosaic" from the company NCSA.  Now the Internet is not only affordable, but understandable to everyone.  You probably know the history of the development of browsers;  In any case, this is a separate issue.  The main thing is that the popularity was such that the need to connect your PC to the World Wide Web was out of the question. </p><p>  Returning to the mysteries of the development of companies and their products, it is worth noting that NSFNet went into the scientific community and completely gave the network into the hands of regional providers.  The Internet has become a proper name, and its structure has laid down by region. </p><p>  Now the Internet is an entire information system that can practically live independently. </p>
