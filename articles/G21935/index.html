Price, living conditions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our article, we presented material on how the hostel differs from the hotel.  This information will be useful both for travelers and for those who often travel on business trips.  I would like to immediately note that there are a lot of differences between these accommodation options.  About how the hostel differs from the hotel, later in the article.  But first, let's understand the concepts. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúHotel‚Äù and ‚ÄúHostel‚Äù: what do these concepts mean? </h2><p>  Hotel is a hotel type service company.  It provides accommodation services for a certain period of time.  Hotels vary by star rating.  Hostel is a European way of accommodation.  In this case, the guest is provided with a bed in the room without additional amenities.  The first such facility was opened in Germany. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hiusa.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels and hostels" class="if uuid-3069331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3069331.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  So, the first difference is the price.  The hostel was originally conceived as cheap temporary housing.  To rent a bed there was much (three to four times) cheaper than in a regular hotel.  Note that living in a hostel is more profitable than renting a house for rent.  But in this option of living, of course, that is its inconvenience.  These include: </p><ul><li><p>  shared kitchen; </p></li><li><p>  shared bathroom (which is located somewhere at the end of the corridor); </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  unwanted neighbors. </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.hiusa.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel living conditions" class="if uuid-3069334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3069334.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel and hostel: living conditions and accommodation </h2><p>  The key difference between the two is that the hostel is almost a hostel.  Although there are hostels in which you can book individual rooms.  But this is most likely an exception to the rule.  And they become more like an inexpensive motel.  I would like to say that the hostel‚Äôs device often resembles a guesthouse, that is, owners live somewhere nearby, while free rooms are rented out inexpensively. </p><p>  Typically, these rooms are designed for a small group of people, from two to ten.  Although there are large rooms.  For example, in which 20-30 people can immediately live.  Similar hostels in Europe are called dormitories. </p><p>  The hotel provides guests with private rooms.  Moreover, they come in different categories.  For example, standard, comfort, junior suite and suite.  The cost of these rooms is different.  The rooms for guests are decorated and filled in different ways, depending on the category. </p><h2>  Budget and location </h2><p>  If we compare the hotel and the hostel, we can safely say that the second option is budgetary, and the first is not.  If you delve into this issue, you can draw some conclusions.  That is, in a hostel, as a rule, you rent a bed, and in hotels - a room.  In the latter case, you will be alone in the room.  Also, as a rule, hotels are located in a separate building with an impressive number of rooms.  Hostels are often located in residential buildings, in ordinary apartments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between a hostel and a hotel" class="if uuid-3069335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3069335.jpg"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Another difference between a hostel and a hotel is its different service.  In the first case, it is at a lower level. </p><p>  Hotels offer guests comfortable rooms with amenities.  Often, the price of accommodation already includes breakfast (or full board), and the use of various benefits of civilization: beach, bar, pool and more. </p><p>  It also happens that the hotel has hairdressers, conference rooms, laundries and others.  For this reason, hotels can be called multi-functional accommodation. </p><h2>  To rent a hostel in Moscow cheaply or check into a hotel?  Differences from accommodation options in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  You can cheaply rent a bed in a hostel in Moscow.  In the capital of the Russian Federation there are a lot of such housing options.  Those who plan to stay in such a place need to know how the hostel differs from a hotel in Moscow.  I would like to say that you will not see a hostel: </p><ul><li>  personal bathroom; </li><li>  separate TV; </li><li>  personal telephone set; </li><li>  a maid who will change clothes daily. </li></ul><p>  A standard set of services awaits you at this place.  The hostel has: </p><ul><li><p>  shared kitchen; </p></li><li><p>  shared shower; </p></li><li><p>  shared bathroom; </p></li><li><p>  common lounge; </p></li><li><p>  more strict schedule than in the hotel (that is, for example, you need to return to the hostel before 22:00 or 23:00). </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel in Moscow cheap" class="if uuid-3069330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3069330.jpg"></div><p>  Do not expect that the hostel will be perfectly clean, and that you will have a quiet working environment.  Of course, this means that mountains of mud await you.  But before you settle in a hostel, you should be prepared for anything. </p><p>  The main advantage of the hostel in comparison with the hotel is the price.  However, the standard of living in the first is much lower. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how the hostel differs from the hotel.  We examined the main differences between them.  This information helped you understand which housing option is right for you and why. </p>
