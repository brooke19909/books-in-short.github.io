This question was asked by almost all mobile device users.  Especially often, inexperienced users have various doubts about incomprehensible pictograms, but it‚Äôs not surprising, because it‚Äôs not so easy to figure it out right away.  So, ‚ÄúH‚Äù on the phone - what is it? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h on the phone what is it" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1651948.jpg" width="315"></div></h2><h2>  One of the communication standards </h2><p>  Mobile users often see clear and not very clear icons in the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen.  These designations tell us how much battery power is left, whether there are new messages, how well the network is catching at the moment. </p><p>  And the letter "H" on the phone - what is it?  A similar icon makes it clear to the user that he is in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãhigh-speed Internet, which is related to 3G technology. </p><h2>  What does it mean </h2><p>  Your mobile device currently uses one of the high-speed methods of connecting and working on the network.  These are quite high speeds, for example, an excellent solution for watching a small clip on the Internet or when listening to music.  At the moment, this is one of the most popular ranges of mobile Internet broadcasting. </p><h2>  Other designations </h2><p>  We hope you figured out the ‚ÄúH‚Äù on the phone - what is it.  Now it will be much easier for you to understand what is behind the following notation: "E", "3G", "LTE", "H +".  First of all, they signal the speed at which your device is working, and then we will tell you more about them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  <em>E</em> is one of the slowest standards, such a connection may mean remoteness from <span>base stations</span> or features of your operator‚Äôs tariff.  This is a very slow Internet, it‚Äôs enough to watch the weather with a delay, and then in the best case. </li><li>  <em>3G</em>  This is a more advanced technology.  It allows you to calmly communicate on social networks and listen to music with a little download, but about seven years ago it was a real breakthrough in the field of mobile Internet. </li><li>  <em>H</em> (sometimes referred to as 3G +), the same icon at the top of the screen that bothers so many.  It means that a fairly good Internet connection is provided, at high speeds.  It‚Äôs possible to watch videos or play online games on mobile devices. </li><li>  <em>LTE (4G).</em>  This is the latest communications standard for mobile Internet access.  The speed of such smartphones is comparable to connecting to a regular, wired Internet.  You can safely upload quite capacious files, watch movies, use social networks.  However, in Russia, and in the rest of the world, this technology is relatively young, so the coverage area is not as large as previous standards, which means that the network can sometimes disappear. </li></ol>

In this case, it is better to contact the operator and choose a more favorable tariff so that it does not stand idle. </p><p>  If you need to temporarily disable the Network, then just go to the settings, depending on your smartphone.  Usually this is the so-called curtain - when you drag your finger down the screen and select the column "mobile data" or "connection".  Then you just need to uncheck - and you temporarily turned off the Internet on your device. </p><p>  In order to turn on the Network again, you should do the same operations in the reverse order. </p><p>  But for the Internet to work and the icon to disappear, most likely, more complex technical manipulations with installing additional software will be required, which is long and pointless. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, we figured out and answered the question: "H" on the phone - what is it.  As you can see, such an icon is a completely harmless indication of the range in which the Internet operates on your smartphone. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h on the phone what is it" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1651994.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you need to remove another of the above pictograms (which will also lead to disconnection from the Internet, then you should do the same operations through the settings. </p>
