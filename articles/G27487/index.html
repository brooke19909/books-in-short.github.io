The city of Sharjah is a surprisingly organic combination of oriental and modern architecture.  It is rightfully considered the cultural capital of the UAE, since a large number of theaters, museums, galleries and other institutions are concentrated here.  In addition, the city has long gained popularity among tourists.  Currently, Sharjah is a well-known resort in the UAE, a lot of hotels have been built on its territory, among which there are modest hotels and fashionable apartments.  In our article we want to talk about Arbella Boutique Hotel - a three-star hotel in the center of Sharjah. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Arbella Boutique Hotel is a modern multi-story building, made in the Moroccan style.  The hotel is a 30-minute drive from Dubai Airport and a 20-minute drive from <span>Sharjah Airport.</span>  Opposite the hotel there is a Mega Mall shopping center, which has a good supermarket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arbella boutique hotel" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830838.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel, located in the heart of Sharjah, can be attributed to the urban complex rather than to a beach hotel, since the sea coast is quite far away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Arbella Boutique Hotel consists of 107 rooms.

The assortment of the restaurant offers local and international dishes.  The institution itself is not very spacious, so all the tourists at the same time do not fit in the hall.  Sometimes in a restaurant there are a lot of empty seats, and sometimes visitors are forced to sit down one at a busy table.  A lot of people in the institution, usually in the morning.  The rest of the time there are few guests here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arbella boutique hotel 3 stars" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830844.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel has luggage storage.  The complex does not accept tourists with animals.  In addition, people with bad habits should know that smoking is strictly prohibited not only in the rooms, but throughout the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sharjah arbella boutique hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830854.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the hotel‚Äôs reception, guests can book horseback riding and visit the golf course.  The hotel complex is focused on all categories of tourists, so not only couples with children, but also young people can have a good time in it.  In addition, the building has a business center, the services of which can be used by people who have arrived in Sharjah on business. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Arbella Boutique Hotel 3 * is located near the center of Sharjah.  The beaches are at a sufficient distance from the hotel.  For this reason, guests have the option of using the free shuttle service to Al Khan Beach.  Bus schedules can always be viewed at the reception.  In the morning there are three flights and two more at lunchtime.  Sometimes there are much more people who want to go to the beach than there are seats in a minibus, so some guests have to go while standing.  As additional flights, Infiniti and Toyota cars periodically run. </p><p>  A taxi to Al Khan Beach costs about 14-15 dirhams (at the rate of one dirham is 15.52 rubles).  Tourists from many hotels are brought to the beach.  Here the coast has a good sand cover.  For a fee on the beach, visitors are offered umbrellas and sunbeds.  The coastal territory in this area is very wide and spacious, there is enough space for all vacationers.  In addition, there is a cafe on the beach, there is a playground for young vacationers, a shower.  Nearby on the coast are the Maritime Museum and an aquarium. </p><h2>  Arbella Boutique Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, it is worth paying attention to the reviews of tourists who lived in it.  Should vacationers pay attention to this institution?  Most of the tourists in vain prefer to travel to Dubai, which is associated with some misconception.  In fairness, it makes sense to pay attention to the beautiful resort - Sharjah.  Arbella Boutique Hotel, although it has only three stars on its sign, is popular among our compatriots.  Many tourists come here to rest on last minute packages offered by tour operators.  According to their reviews, it can be judged that sometimes good discounts are offered on tours, their cost decreases to thirty or even twenty thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arbella boutique hotel 3 sharjah" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830869.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Arbella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Sharjah) is more like a city hotel, since it is removed from the coastline.  However, in Sharjah, a sufficient number of such complexes are functioning.  Each of them gets out of the situation, offering guests free transfers.  Experienced tourists also use taxi services, gathering in small groups to save on travel.  Otherwise, the location of the Arbella Boutique Hotel (Sharjah) is quite convenient, since in the immediate vicinity there are numerous catering establishments, a shopping center, and bus stops. </p><h2>  Hotel room reviews </h2><p>  Arbella Boutique Hotel 3 * (Sharjah) offers different rooms, which have their own characteristics.  According to tourists, it is very important to get the keys to the apartments, which overlook the shopping center.  Such rooms can be considered the most successful, because the accommodation is comfortable and free from extraneous noise.  But in the rooms facing the temple, it is impossible to sleep, at five in the morning the muezzin calls for the prayer of the townspeople, thereby awakening the guests of the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel is diverse.  Depending on the category of apartments, there may not be a refrigerator and a safe, and bathrooms can be equipped with cabins or bathrooms.  All rooms at the hotel are air-conditioned.  But the rooms are combined in blocks of three.  Each of them has only one remote control for air conditioning, so the "weather in the room" sets only one lucky one.  Not always selected temperature conditions are comfortable for neighbors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arbella boutique hotel sharjah" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830862.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The rest of the rooms are quite comfortable and equipped with good furniture.  High-quality cleaning of the apartments is daily.  Maids replenish supplies of drinking water and detergents every day, linen changes according to schedule.  For each guest at the hotel, only one bath towel is issued, so tourists recommend taking a few more sets from the house.  But beach towels can be taken daily at the reception without restrictions and returned there after use. </p><h2>  Catering reviews </h2><p>  At Arbella Restaurant has beautiful interiors and offers a varied range of dishes.  At the request of guests, I deliver food to my room.  If you leave for an excursion early in the morning or fly home, the staff provides a lunch box.  According to tourists, the food for a three-star establishment is very good.  On the tables there is always a good selection of dishes that are regularly replenished.  Fresh juices are especially pleasing.  There is no problem with eating babies, since cereals, milk, yoghurts and mashed potatoes are always present on the tables. </p><p>  In the evening, the restaurant is open √† la carte.  If you prefer only breakfast at the hotel, then there are a sufficient number of restaurants and cafes within walking distance of the hotel.  In the case when tourists plan to spend time on the beach, it is advisable to book half board, because it makes no sense to return to the hotel in the afternoon for lunch.  On the coast you can always eat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arbella boutique hotel reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1830866.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the guests of the establishment are very pleased with the food.  For children from the restaurant you can always take a few sandwiches, the staff never interferes. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, Arbella Boutique Hotel (Sharjah) is a good city hotel of the famous resort of Sharjah.  Its only significant drawback is the distance from the coast, which is partially offset by a free hotel transfer.  In addition, the hotel offers its guests a free shuttle bus to Dubai on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Tourists are delivered to the Deira City shopping center.  But guests must get back to the hotel on their own.  This is not difficult, since the transport connection in the country is very well established.  Experienced tourists recommend that newcomers who first come to the Emirates take excursion trips to Dubai.  In the future, it is already possible to move independently, without adjusting to the group. </p><p>  Overall the hotel makes a very good impression.  Of course, as in any institution, there are disadvantages and advantages.  For this reason, going on vacation, it is worth carefully studying the reviews of tourists in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. </p><p>  Hotel guests note the pleasant and polite hotel staff, as well as the lack of deposit.  Based on the positive feedback from tourists, we can recommend the complex for consideration as a place to stay in the center of Sharjah. <strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
