  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocheted sweater for girls: competent preparation and implementation of the idea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How cute children in knitted clothes look!  Many mothers are so moved by this sight that they also begin to look for the right thing for their child.  In addition, the desire to demonstrate the beauty and uniqueness of their baby often pushes parents to independent creativity.  However, at first it is important to be guided by something. </p><p>  Therefore, we offer a step-by-step master class on how to make a beautiful and comfortable sweater for a girl.  A hook as a tool, any children's yarn as the main material for knitting and great enthusiasm - that‚Äôs all you need to work! </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovecrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for girls" class="if uuid-3074300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074300.jpg"></div><p>  Before embarking on creativity, it is necessary to clearly define the appearance of the intended product.  Professionals even recommend drawing the desired option.  And if nothing comes into your head at all, you can go shopping and choose the most suitable copy. </p><p>  In addition, it is important to note that a crocheted sweater for a girl (as, incidentally, for a boy) should not be loaded with a complex pattern or too colorful pattern, yarn of various colors and types, an abundance of jewelry.  It is better to dwell on one thing - to emphasize, add a twist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pattern selection </h2><p>  If a novice master takes up work, one does not need to try to do something beyond his skills.  Experienced needlewomen say that it is more appropriate to approach knitting sweaters for girls with a crochet with imagination.  For example, you can embroider a small animal on your blouse or a whole picture, while making the product simple columns. </p><p>  If you want something unusual, you can take the scheme of a square or rectangular napkin and use it to knit a blouse.  That is, make two delicate details of the same size.  Then sew along the side and shoulder seams, leaving holes for the handles and the head.  And further along the armholes, tie up the sleeves and collar. </p><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sferamagazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for girls preparation" class="if uuid-3075883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075883.jpg"></div><p>  Earlier, we already noted that for <span>crocheting sweaters</span> for girls 3 years old or younger, it is better to use special children's yarn.  Only in this case, you can be sure that the finished thing will not cause an allergy in the baby.  Modern manufacturers offer a range of different types and shades.  Therefore, each mother will be able to choose the option that completely suits her. </p><h2>  Hook selection </h2><p>  It is not so important whether you buy a knitting tool or choose from the available ones.  You will have to carefully consider your decision.  Firstly, because it is much more convenient to work with a metal hook.  The thread glides along it well, the creative process goes much faster, and the thing turns out better.  Secondly, you should correctly determine the size of the hook for knitting a sweater for a girl.  Its ideal length is equal to the length of the palm, and the diameter is the thickness of the selected thread.  Thirdly, you need a smooth tool.  Therefore, in the presence of "burrs" or roughnesses, another option will have to be considered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="morningchores.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted blouse for girls" class="if uuid-3075889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075889.jpg"></div><h2>  Can standard parameters be used? </h2><p>  When studying various master classes presented in the virtual space, one often stumbles upon the general dimensions for people of different sex and age.  Some novice needlewomen enjoy using them when creating.  However, the result is far from always getting a positive one. </p><p>  The main reason is that we are all very individual, both externally and internally.  Therefore, professional craftswomen do not advise beginners to work with standard parameters. </p><h2>  How to take measurements from the child? </h2><p>  Crocheting a <span>sweater</span> for a girl (at 3 years old, younger or older - it does not matter) is not at all difficult.  But only if you carefully consider the entire workflow. </p><p>  Having dealt with the style, design, yarn and tool, you should go to one of the main stages. </p><p>  Of course, measuring your baby can be quite difficult.  But you can‚Äôt miss the necessary action.  Therefore, we collect more air into the chest, prepare a centimeter tape, a pen and a picture of the future product.  After we measure: </p><ul><li>  distance from shoulder-neck points to the bottom edge; </li><li>  armhole height; </li><li>  chest circumference; </li><li>  girth of the neck (note: at the base); </li><li>  distance from the tip of the shoulder to the tip of the sleeve. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for girls measurements" class="if uuid-3075906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075906.jpg"></div><h2>  How to build a pattern? </h2><p>  Some experienced craftswomen advise beginners to draw a conceived product on graph paper.  And in full size.  And then knit, sticking to the pattern.  However, this is rather inconvenient.  In addition, you need to start somewhere.  That is, dial the desired number of loops.  How to do it by eye? </p><p>  Professionals, talking about the principle of crocheting sweaters for girls, recommend acting differently: </p><ol><li>  Tie a square of 10x10 cm. </li><li>  Calculate how many loops and rows fits 1 cm. </li><li>  Divide horizontal and vertical measures by the desired value. </li><li>  If necessary, round the result to the nearest whole, relying on the rapport of the selected pattern. </li></ol><h2>  Step-by-step process </h2><p>  As you can see, the preparation does not imply overly complex actions.  Therefore, even beginner masters will be able to carry it out.  Well, then you should work on your own calculations.  Here is the detailed technology: </p><ol><li>  We knit a chain of a certain number of loops (chest girth).  Lock in the ring. </li><li>  Focusing on the pattern of the pattern you like, we make lifting loops. </li><li>  We knit a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù, moving in a circle. </li><li>  When we rise to the height of the armhole, we divide the product into two parts: the back and the front. </li><li>  We tie each part separately, moving back and forth. </li><li>  We turn the product and sew the shoulders. </li><li>  On the front side we collect loops on the armhole. </li><li>  We knit the sleeves of the desired length, moving in a circle. </li><li>  We tie the gate. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extra long blouse for girls" class="if uuid-3075912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075912.jpg"></div><p>  These are the recommendations for making a crocheted sweater for a girl.  The foundation is ready!  Now it can be decorated at your own discretion. </p>
