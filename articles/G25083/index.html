    <h3>  Valuable modern coins of Russia, cost </h3><p>  Since 1991, many coins have been issued in Russia.  Most of those that were released before the denomination cost nothing (except as scrap).  Those that are currently in circulation can mainly be sold at face value.  But among those and others, no, no, and even a round flashed, because of which numismatists are ready to part with a tidy sum.  And all because not all of them are the same.  In some years, the circulation was limited.  Once he was completely withdrawn from circulation.  Some coins are made not according to the standard, and some had a factory defect.  These are the modern <span>valuable coins of</span> Russia.  There are not so many of them, and therefore their cost is high.  For some of them you can get only a little more than they cost at face value.  For example, in this way 10 or 50 kopecks turn into 2, 3 or 7 rubles.  Other coins cost several tens or hundreds of rubles.  But there are also such modern valuable coins of Russia, the monetary equivalent of which is already estimated at thousands and tens of thousands of rubles, and for some collectors they can even pay out about 200,000. Finding them, of course, is extremely difficult.  And basically everything that we are given as change is an ordinary trifle.  But what if luck has smiled on you today?  Want to delve into your wallet for luck?  It is very difficult to list absolutely all modern valuable coins of Russia.  Although they are much smaller than ordinary trifles, they are nevertheless enough.  Therefore, we will name only a few of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  List of valuable coins of modern Russia </h3><ol><li>  Let's start with the rarest and most valuable banknote.  Many collectors consider it a myth.  They say that he never graduated.  But there are photographs, exhibitions were held where this coin was presented in all its glory.  This is 5 rubles issued in 1999.  If you accidentally lost such a coin in your wallet, congratulations - you can become wealthier by about 200 thousand rubles. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern valuable coins of Russia" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/247377.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Another coin from the area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmyths‚Äù is 50 kopecks of 2001, minted by the <span>Moscow Mint.</span>  The circulation of that year was withdrawn from circulation, and it is difficult to reliably say whether there is somewhere the original of this banknote.  If there is, he can bring his owner from 100 thousand rubles.  But be careful.  Craftsmen often try to turn 2004 or 2007 on the reverse in 2001. But what is interesting: there is a case where even such "folk art" was sold at auction for 4,500 rubles, while it was initially stated that this was a fake. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of valuable coins of modern Russia" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/247376.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The cost of two other banknotes of 2001 is slightly lower: denominations of 1 and 2 rubles.  They will bring their owner "only" 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  1997 and 1998 also gave the world modern valuable coins of Russia with a face value of 1 ruble.  But here it is worth being careful.  There are not only these rare coins in circulation, but also the most common ones.  We are only interested in coins with a wide edging.  They can cost from 4000 (1997) to 10 000 (1998) rubles. </li><li>  Also, coins with production defects, which may be considered, for example, the absence of a mint mark, are of some value. </li></ol>
