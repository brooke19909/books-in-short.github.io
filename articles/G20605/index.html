In honor of the patron saint of sailors and fishermen, a magnificent Orthodox church was built in the city. </p><h2>  City Chernomorets (Bulgaria): description </h2><p>  The picturesque and very green town of Chernomorets is a great place for lovers of relaxation on the less crowded coast.  There are five beaches that are separated by beautiful rocky shores.  A kilometer from the city is the picturesque Vromos Bay, which was chosen by lovers of underwater fishing.  And two kilometers from Chernomorets there is a beautiful beach, one of the best in the country - camping Gradina, which was previously called the Royal Beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is not at all like other similar structures.  His yard has been turned into a real paradise.  Each centimeter is planted with amazing plants.  Orchids and lotuses, <span>marsh irises</span> and lemon trees, paradise apple and kiwi are just some of the inhabitants of this marvelous garden. </p><p>  The temple was erected, as they say, by the whole world, and its construction was completed in 1858.  To worship the shrine of the temple - the holy relics of Nicholas - pilgrims came here not only from all over Bulgaria, but also from abroad.  In 1994, a terrible fire destroyed almost all the interior decoration, but many considered it a great miracle that the fire did not touch the wooden cross and the icon of St. Nicholas.  For voluntary donations of citizens and residents of other regions of the country, the temple was restored in a very short time. </p><p>  But in 2014, the world community was shocked by the terrible sacrilege.  The temple was hacked and the relics of St. Spyridon and St. Nicholas were stolen from it.  In order to somehow calm the feelings of believers, the Italian city of Bari sent an ark from the world of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  The Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church also helped.  She donated to the cloister the relics of eleven saints revered and respected in our country. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  There are not many tourists from Russia in Chernomorets.

Chernomorets <span>(Bulgaria), reviews</span> about the rest in which is always positive, has several beaches.  They are located in small sea bays and are distinguished by cleanliness and grooming.  It is very comfortable to relax with young children here: the entrance to the sea is smooth, the depth is increasing gradually. </p><p>  In southern Bulgaria, the summer is early, so the holiday season begins already on the twentieth of May and ends in the middle, and sometimes at the end of October.  The best time to relax is June and September. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  In Chernomorets there are no very large hotels and hotels.  Some vacationers consider this a disadvantage of the resort, while others consider it a virtue.
