    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The whole balneological hot springs of Tyumen were glorified throughout Siberia.  The Volna (a photo of this unique object is demonstrated by one of the pools) differs from the others in that a well-designed infrastructure is created around it.  Once there was a sanatorium, but it was closed.  Now the source is patronized and guarded by the employees of the Volna recreation center.  Here they built a cascade of pools with several hydromassage installations (geyser, shallow water, water guns, a jacuzzi).  There is enough space for everyone, because the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pools is 370 m <sup>2</sup> .  The water temperature in them is always 40 ¬∞ C - 43 ¬∞ C, the depth drops from 1 meter to 2.5 meters, which allows both children and adults to rest comfortably.  A playground has been built for children near the pool area, there is a store nearby with some goods for recreation.  Visitors can have a bite to eat at the caf√© and barbecue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Water composition </h2><p>  The hot spring "Volna" in Tyumen has healing properties due to the chemical composition of its water.  Scientists conducted its laboratory analysis and found that it contains the most chloride ions (4964 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ), sodium (3023 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ), bicarbonates (220 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ) and calcium (208 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> )  Relatively much in medicinal water of magnesium (62 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ), potassium (30 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ) and bromide ions (29.75 mg / dm <sup>3</sup> ), and in addition, it contains fluoride ions, iodide ions , iron, lithium and ammonium.  The water in the pools, filled directly from the source, is clear, blue or, as visitors say, sea-colored, tastes very salty, but odorless.  Its pH is 8.04 units. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot spring Wave Tyumen reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1640539.jpg" width="502"></div>
