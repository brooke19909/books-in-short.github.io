Gogol, because the main character of this novel Khoma Brut is a bursak who went home during a vaccination.  In the works of this particular writer, this educational institution is mentioned very often (Andrey and Ostap Bulba were also Bursaks).  These theological schools have become more widespread in Ukraine (Russian Empire) and in Poland.  Both Kuprin and Pomyalovsky wrote about the graduates of the bursa. </p><h2>  Metamorphoses of the term </h2>

Then, in the Middle Ages, this concept was understood as the general ticket office of an educational institution, monastery, union or fraternity.  Gradually, the term transferred its meaning to the cash desk of the theological school, and then to the seminary itself and the hostel attached to it.  It is not surprising that educational institutions with the same name first appeared in France, because the language of this country is vulgar Latin.

    <p>  The apartment with full content provided to students of certain educational institutions was called a bursa, and the students living in it were called bursaks, but in French it sounded much more beautiful: bursarli or bursiati.  In France, until the end of the 19th century, bursa were very common. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most famous bursa of the Russian Empire </h2>

    <p>  In Ukraine and Poland, bursa is specifically a religious school, which in Kiev later transformed into a theological academy.  In Krakow, the Dlugos bursa lasted until 1840.  The aforementioned Kiev-fraternal school and dormitory under it was formed under Peter the Grave, Metropolitan of Kiev, Galitsky and All Russia in the 17th century. </p><p>  Life in the bursa was not easy, because it was provided by donations mainly from Cossack entities, which began to dissolve in the 17th century.  Since the food, clothing and shelter provided free of charge were more than scarce, the Bursaks began to provide alms with their survival.  The pupils themselves were doing this.  In their midst annually and solemnly a group of persons was selected who were engaged in the collection of alms and their distribution.  These were prefects, assistants and secretaries.  With a special book, Album, <span>proxies</span> went around asking for alms. </p><p>  In addition, gifted children formed artels that earned the necessary funds by reading poems, directing services, staging plays and performing editions. </p><h2>  Symbol of base </h2>

Because Metropolitan Arseny, a preacher of the court of <span>Elizabeth Petrovna, was</span> concerned about the fate of the Bursaks.  He increased the funds allocated to him and transferred the school from a wooden structure to a stone, thereby improving the living conditions of the seminarians.  Nevertheless, the collection of funds by the Bursaks was finally banned in 1786.  Obviously, there were abuses, and study in the bursa suffered.

Along with rhetoric, philosophy and theology, history, geography and mathematics were studied.  But theological seminaries were provided for children from more or less well-off strata of the population, while burses were intended for the poor, the term of education did not exceed 2 years, and the amount of knowledge provided was minimal.  They were dominated by unsanitary conditions and cruel customs, the children were malnourished and lacked sleep, and there was no reason to talk about getting a decent education.  All this is very well described in the "Essays on the Bursa" by N. G. Pomyalovsky.  It should be noted that the book caused a very wide resonance in society.  Perhaps that is why educational institutions that do not provide solid knowledge are called dismissively bursa. </p><h2>  Other values </h2><p>  But bursa is not only all of the above.  What other meanings of this word?  Bursa is Turkey‚Äôs fourth largest city located in the north-west of Antalya.  In addition, there is the abbreviation BURS, which stands for <span>"</span> ignition and alarm <span>control unit</span> ." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burs scheme" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/813491.jpg" width="600"></div>  Without these units, automation of steam and <span>hot water boilers is</span> impossible <span>.</span>  It provides a semi-automatic start of the boiler, maintaining the desired temperature and pressure, fuel supply and other functions.  Of course, for each block only the intended BURS scheme is provided for it.
