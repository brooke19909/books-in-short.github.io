  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sergiev Posad Museum-Reserve: expositions, opening hours, address</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Sergiev Posad Museum-Reserve began its work in 1920, having at the base of its collections the property confiscated at the closing of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra.  An authoritative commission, which included representatives of culture and the Russian Orthodox Church, worked on a list of objects for several months.  Thanks to this work, the greatest historical and artistic values ​​were preserved for posterity. </p><h2>  The beginning of educational activities </h2><p>  The artist VD Derviz was appointed the first director, and art historian A.N. Svirin was the curator.  The commission completed its activities in 1925, transferring all its authority to the museum management.  It was during these years that the direction of the new cultural institution was determined.  The members of the Commission in the process of forming the museum collection issued a small brochure in which they talked about the collection of ancient Russian art, emphasizing its uniqueness, value and significance in the development of the cultural life of Soviet people.  Thus, almost the entire monastery collection participated in the first exposition of the museum. </p><p>  The struggle against religious beliefs, which broke out with renewed vigor in the 30s of the last century, closed the museum’s expositions on this subject, some of the items from the collection were transferred to Gokhran. </p><p>  But from the very beginning of their work, employees of the future Sergiev Posad Museum-Reserve included in the scope of their interests collecting and studying objects of traditional folk crafts and decorative and applied art.  The collection was replenished by donation and consisted of a huge number of household items, antiquities, and “handicraft” products.  From the 30s they began to be actively included in the museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  Since 1946, religious life has been resumed within the walls of the Holy Trinity-Sergius Lavra: the monastery has begun to operate again, services are being held in churches, and religious schools are opening.  The museum not only began to coexist with the monastery, the new conditions required close contact in various matters.  For example, regarding the restoration work that was actively carried out on the territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prosvetcult.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village life" class="if uuid-3073741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3073741.jpg"></div><p>  The compilation and study of ancient and modern collections continued, and a full re-exposure of the museum was made.  Visitors could now familiarize themselves with the history of the region by visiting such exhibitions as “Old Russian Painting”, “History of Laurels”, “Contemporary Decorative and Applied Art”. </p><h2>  Contemporary Museum of Sergiev Posad </h2><p>  Now the fund of the museum totals more than 170 thousand exhibits.  These are the richest collections of icons, manuscripts, ancient books, precious metal products, paintings and graphic works, patterns of patterned sewing, lace-making and folk art objects of various directions.  The Hermitage of Russian Culture, this is the name of the institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch layout" class="if uuid-3073727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3073727.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of 2000, a large-scale relocation of the museum was held in order to free the premises that were returned by the Russian Orthodox Church.  Today, the Sergiev Posad Museum-Reserve is located in four buildings that are not far from each other.  One of the branches, the Sacristy, remained on the territory of the laurel, the rest were moved outside its walls.  Currently, restoration work is underway in the Sacristy, but some of its exhibits can be seen in other branches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Main building.  Prospect of the Red Army, 144 </h2><p>  In the halls of this building is an active exhibition work.  The products of contemporary artists from Sergiev Posad and other cities of Russia are demonstrated here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prosvetcult.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Folk crafts" class="if uuid-3073740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3073740.jpg"></div><p>  Classes, master classes, meetings, conferences, seminars are also held in the building of the Main Building.  The area of ​​the room allows for theatrical performances. </p><h2>  Local history building.  Ovrazhny Lane, 9A </h2><p>  The building, which houses exhibits telling about the life of the population of the region, was the pride of local residents in the late 30s of the last century.  Built specifically for the kindergarten, it stood out among the inconspicuous buildings surrounding it.  One of the exhibitions working in the local history building is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of kindergarten No. 1, the first in Sergiev Posad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="museum-sp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Local history building" class="if uuid-3073765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3073765.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, there is an exhibition on the Trinity Railway, which connected the provincial town with Moscow, which greatly influenced his life. </p><p>  Several halls tell about the city’s path from the revolution to World War II, about the life of the “front-line” Zagorsk (the name of Sergiev Posad in the Soviet years), about the participants in the battles in “hot spots”. </p><p>  It is interesting to visit the exposition about the children of the USSR.  Here the theme of growing up is revealed - from birth to entry into adulthood.  Moreover, a look at things is served by children's eyes. </p><h2>  "Horse Yard" in Sergiev Posad, street of the 1st Shock Army, 2 </h2><p>  The building occupied by the museum complex is the oldest in the city; it has long been one of the most valuable architectural monuments.  Built in 1790 to keep the monastery horses in one courtyard (previously there were several small, wooden stables), its architecture deserves a comparison with a small “monastery”.  Today, the restored building is occupied by the Sergiev Posad Museum-Reserve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voxxter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Horse yard" class="if uuid-3073747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3073747.jpg"></div><p>  It is here that part of the collection from the Sacristy, which is under reconstruction, is taken out.  These are the values ​​that were the beginning of the museum collection.  Rare and unique icons, books, jewelry, which were kept for centuries by the monastic brotherhood, are gifts from princes, kings, and aristocracy. </p><p>  The story about the life of the monastery from its inception until the last days is in the halls of the Horse Courtyard.  The materials characterize it as a center of ancient Russian culture, which possessed invaluable wealth in the form of an extensive library, great creations of art.  A visit to the monastery by kings and emperors, a siege of the fortress by enemies, a pilgrimage to its shrines - the next exposition will tell about this. </p><p>  “The World of the Russian Village” is a story about the environment in which folk craftsmen worked.  Rites, holidays, events, everything that is reflected in the work of folk craftsmen, as well as their works are shown in this exhibition. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.3127837" data-lng="38.135925799999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/2/2/4/14224.png"></div><p>  Products made of bone, wood, clay, porcelain, glass, metal, made in the centers of traditional art crafts and domestic industries are presented in the following rooms. </p><p>  Once to get acquainted with the museum’s expositions it will not be enough, you will have to return to this town near Moscow, maybe more than once.  On one of the visits, you can relax in the city park called Skitsky Ponds.  In Sergiev Posad, he appeared in the XVIII century for walks of royal people who arrived on a pilgrimage.  Today, the well-groomed territory is a resting place for citizens. </p>
