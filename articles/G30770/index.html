These are the manifestations of human feelings that any of us have to face.  Sometimes the situation we find ourselves in is such that people do not think about unpleasant communication at all.  They worry about their own safety.  Not everyone will carry a serious weapon for self-defense.  After all, you need to not only handle him correctly, but also have the appropriate permission to keep him with you.  All this will require considerable investment of time and money. </p>

    <p>  A bit and a piece of reinforcement are not acceptable options when it comes to women or girls.  How to protect yourself in the most extreme situations, when aggressive and inadequate people meet on the way?  The way out is pretty simple.  As a weapon for self-defense, a shocker flashlight can be bought.  The reviews of those who have already purchased this device confirm that wearing it does not require obtaining permits and passing a medical commission.  The only condition for legal possession is the age of majority. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Recently, flashlights-shockers are very popular among consumers.  They are distinguished by their small size and ease of use.  Shock flashlights can be worn not only in the bag, but also in the pocket.  At the same time, none of those around you will even guess that you are not as defenseless as it might seem at first glance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Today‚Äôs most popular devices are applicable even if you were unable to knock down the enemy in order to paralyze him with an electric discharge.  It is enough to frighten a person who is aggressive, and he will take flight.  Shock flashlights give such a powerful discharge that your offender will be immobilized.  Using a pause, you can either run away or take some other action.  Using the device is very easy.  So after his acquisition, special training and training will not be needed.

    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The device of the shocker-flashlight is quite simple.  Near its illuminating part there are coronary diodes.  The distance between them is about 1 cm. These diodes, in contact with the body of the attacker, transmit an electric charge, the power of which is enough to ‚Äúturn off‚Äù the offender for a while. </p>

    <p>  A person feels a short-term unpleasant pain or fades for a short time from bright light. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to use devices? </h2><p>  To the one who purchased the shocker flashlight, the instructions attached to the device will explain what to do with it in case of an attack.  There are two buttons on the device case.  One of them serves to switch the lighting mode directly to the flashlight.  The second drives the shocker.  A fuse has been inserted into the back of the case.  It protects the owner of the device from involuntary electric shock.  Discharge occurs only when the fuse slider is moved to the ON position. </p><p>  Often a fabric case is included in a set of flashlights-stun guns.  It allows you to wear the device on the belt.  For reliable and more complete neutralization of the enemy, a flashlight-shocker is used several times.  In this case, the discharges are sent to different parts of the body of the attacker. </p><p>  The instructions for the device list the basic rules for its use.  The device owner is required to carefully read the information contained in the instruction manual and observe safety precautions.  So, you should not use the shocker while charging - the device will simply burn.  The simultaneous operation of the lighting part and the shocker can also lead to damage. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the scheme of the shocker-flashlight is quite simple (it is presented below), you should familiarize yourself with the advantages of each model before buying.  And the first thing you need to pay attention to a potential buyer is the technical characteristics of the device.  The main one is discharge power.  To date, in the best flashlight-stun gun, it is 20,000 KV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Just one second is enough to influence the offender with this device, so that any desire to show aggression disappears. </p><p>  The second main technical characteristic of a flashlight-stun gun is its battery.  The design of some modern models (for example, "Polis" and "Sherkhan") provides for revolutionary development.  This is a replaceable lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity in its volumes is significantly higher than that available in the device of standard mobile phones.  Its value is 4200 mAh.  It is because of this that the device does not have to be charged often. </p><p>  This type of battery does not have a function that indicates its level of readiness for use.  Therefore, the stun gun-flashlight can be inserted into the outlet for ten minutes, and for the whole day.  What is the life of this battery?  It can be different.  Depending on the model, the device provides from one hundred to three hundred working discharges.  This battery is enough for 2-3 years. </p><p>  You should also pay attention to the power of the LEDs.  The best in this regard are the Cree XPE Q5 models.  But it is worth remembering that, despite their high power, these elements do not guarantee protection against dogs. </p><p>  If you decide to purchase a stun gun equipped with a built-in battery, then you should ask the seller for a document confirming the quality of the goods.  This will protect against the acquisition of a fake, the effectiveness of which is approaching zero. </p><p>  When buying, you must check the equipment.  It is advisable that, besides the flashlight-stun gun itself, you will be sold a battery and a charger.  In the box must be present instructions.  Car enthusiasts are advised to additionally purchase a cigarette lighter charger. </p><h2>  First steps after purchase </h2><p>  Before using the device, the shocker flashlight is charged.  Depending on the characteristics of the battery, it can last from two to four hours.  The specific time will be indicated in the instructions supplied with the device. </p>

    <p>  If the device has not been used for a month, then there is a need for preventive charging.  This restores battery performance.  But it is worth remembering that the first time to the end, you do not need to charge the battery.  Because of this, he may lose his performance. </p><h2>  Storage </h2><p>  The appliance must be in a dry place.  Low temperatures are not recommended for a shocker flashlight.  Users note that because of this, the device may deteriorate. </p><h2>  The body's response to discharge </h2><p>  Before use, the flashlight-shocker must be removed from the fuse (if any).  Only after that the device is brought to an open area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe body and a button is pressed.  After 1-2 seconds of using the flashlight-shocker, the enemy will feel severe pain. </p>

    <p>  When exposed for 2-3 seconds, the offender temporarily loses coordination and orientation.  When a discharge is received within 4-5 seconds, the attacker loses control over the body.  This occurs as a result of a violation in the tissues of neural connections.  Such a condition often causes a brief loss of balance and consciousness. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the described device for self-defense looks very high quality, it may stop working over time.  This happens from a quick discharge of the battery or from falls.  How to disassemble a shocker flashlight and restore its former life?  At first glance, it seems that solving this issue is not an easy task.  After all, the case of the device looks cast.  But disassembling a flashlight-shocker, according to users, is within the power of everyone.  And you should start here by removing the tape protecting the mounting screws.  Next we need a screwdriver.  It is easy to unscrew the four mounting screws located on the housing.  After that, we separate the back of the device, in which, in addition to the elements of the charger, a piece of foam is laid for greater density. </p><p>  Next, the front part is removed.  She, like the back, should be pulled to the side.  In front of the flashlight-shocker are high-voltage conductors.  According to them, electric current goes to the front arrester. </p><p>  Dismantling the shocker flashlight allows you to determine the cause of its malfunction.  After its elimination, the device will start working again. </p><h2>  Device advantages </h2><p>  A person who decides to purchase a flashlight stun gun should remember that this tool is a contact.  That is why causing damage to the aggressor is possible only if he is at arm's length from you. </p><p>  But in any case, the enemy will have a psychological impact.  He will not like the creak of current, which will prevent physical contact.  A potential aggressor can simply be made clear that it‚Äôs not worth contacting you. </p>

As noted in user reviews, a powerful ray of light directed into the eyes of the attacker, for a short time will blind and disorient him.  This will allow you to gain time for a counterattack or retreat.
