    <h2>  Coat time </h2><p>  Today, a coat can be seen not only in the usual spring and autumn season, but also in harsh winter and even in the summer season.  It is understandable.  Technical progress has affected this segment.  <span>Coat fabric was</span> used to make the product <span>.</span>  Drap, in the first place, was associated with a traditional coat.  Nowadays, a large number of duplicate materials have appeared that are absolutely not inferior to natural fabrics, and the sewing technology has changed.  The corporate manual labor necessary for sewing a coat in the distant future is automated in some operations.  In this regard, in large factories it is necessary to spend from four to ten days to completely release the finished product, but this is only with the adhesive technology of production. </p><p>  As for sewing a coat completely handmade, it sometimes takes eight times as long to produce it.  In this way, only an elite class coat is now sewn.  At the same time, a high-level master is required, which, of course, affects the cost of the finished product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want your coat to look 100% full, then the sewing master should be really good.  At the same time, it is not only necessary to sew well, it is also necessary to understand which fabric is best to choose for this particular model, to choose the right lining and insulation, if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the right fabric? </h2><p>  Now in the windows you can find a huge variety of fabrics suitable for tailoring coats that retain heat well and have increased wear resistance.  Therefore, before you go to buy fabric, you need to decide for whom you will sew and for what weather.  Oddly enough, but the fabrics can be intended for children, women and men, and can also be divided into winter, demi-season and summer. </p><p>  Of course, <span>mainly fabrics</span> are intended for the autumn-spring period, as well as for winter.  Fabrics for a <span>demi-season coat</span> should have special properties <span>,</span> since insulation is not supposed in such a product, which means that fabrics must have high thermal insulation.  Coats for the winter season consist of directly upper fabric, followed by wind-resistant, warming and cushioning fabrics.  That is why winter fabric should not have special thermal insulation.  It is necessary that it be light, beautiful and water-repellent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for <span>summer coats,</span> anthers and raincoats, then the main criterion for selection will be a water-repellent property. </p><h2>  Types of Tissues </h2><p>  Depending on the structure of the material and raw materials, all coat fabrics are divided into two main types: cotton and wool.  In turn, woolen fabrics for coats are divided into: worsted, rough-woolen and fine-woolen. </p>

    <h2>  Drap </h2><p>  This type of fabric, like most natural materials, has a glorious and centuries-old history.  Its production became possible only after the invention of a special loom.  This machine is capable of producing fabrics in which threads are arranged in several rows.  Drap is a fabric that mainly consists of two layers of thread, although it can have one and a half layers.  This feature allowed us to experiment with warp and weft, while creating a large number of material variations. </p><p>  Over time, the technology improved, and the craftsmen began to replace the inner thread with cheaper and worse quality.  The cost of the material was reduced.  Later, <span>wool</span> was replaced by linen and cotton, resulting in new varieties of drape. </p><p>  Drap is a fabric ideal for making coats.  You can verify this by looking at fashion magazines for several years.  This material was used to make casual, sports, youth, elegant and, of course, business clothes. </p><p>  Drap is a fabric with excellent thermal insulation properties, which is why it is not blown away by the wind and people in clothes made from it are not afraid of even the most severe frosts.  The fabric holds its shape well and perfectly emphasizes the silhouette. </p>

    <h2>  Fabric structure </h2><p>  If the material is of the highest grade and consists of double-sided wool, then the front and back sides are almost indistinguishable.  This effect is achieved only if pure-woolen yarns of perfect spinning are used.  This feature allows you to reuse the material.  If the seams are frayed, then the coat can be altered by replacing the wrong fabric with the front.  This distinguishes it from other drap materials. </p><p>  The composition of the fabric may vary slightly, depending on its type.  So, in pure-wool drape, additives make up only 15%, and they, by and large, are wool, only restored by the chemical method.  Blend wool contains 30 to 85 percent wool.  The front side of the fabric is made of pure wool, and viscose, nitron or nylon fibers can be used for the wrong side.  The disadvantage of this type of fabric is its friability and softness.  Therefore, it is most often used for the manufacture of workwear and protective suits. </p><p>  There are pressed, velor and fluffy drapes.  A fabric that uses threads of different colors is called melange drape.  The fabric, the photo of which is below, just refers to this type of material.  As a classic, it is considered only that fabric that is made according to a certain technology and contains exclusively wool in its composition.  In its production, the technological process is strictly observed. </p>

    <h2>  Variety of drape </h2><p>  One of the most popular varieties of coat fabrics is drap velor.  This fabric has a velvety surface and consists of fine wool.  Most often used for the manufacture of hats and winter coats. </p><p>  The linear density of velor is 100 tex, and consists of two-face weave hardware yarn.  The density on the basis of 98%, the weft 151%, 760 g / m¬≤ surface tension has a drape.  During finishing work, the fabric is subjected to strong napping and felling, resulting in a beautiful and soft. </p>
