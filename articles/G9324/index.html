If earlier a bag decorated with flowers made of fabric or a bracelet made of <span>decorative cord</span> was the property of the boho style or sometimes the boho-chic style, now they are gradually turning into casual casual style. </p><p>  By the way, a bag is an accessory that women and girls need almost all the time.  That is why hand-decorated bags are especially popular in hand-made stores.  However, if you are a creative person and like to create something new, then you can purchase a simple bag and decorate it as you wish.  Nobody will have such a thing, only if you do not dare to repeat her design. </p><p>  But how to decorate a bag if there are a lot of decor options or, conversely, if nothing comes to mind? </p><h2>  Temporary bag decoration </h2><p>  This option is suitable for those who are not ready to completely and irrevocably change the appearance of their bags or their backpack, clutch, but want to make any changes at least for a short while. </p><p>  First of all, consider the overall design of your accessory so that the jewelry is appropriate.  So, how to decorate a bag, clutch or backpack temporarily: </p><ul><li>  Attach badges or brooches to the surface.  Suitable for fabric bags and a backpack made of not very dense material.  Make sure the pins do not leave holes or marks. </li><li>  Tie a silk scarf to the handle of the bag.  It will be especially beautiful if you have a solid frame monophonic bag and a scarf in a contrasting bright color. </li><li>  Hang a bright big keychain or even not one on the ‚Äúdog‚Äù of the zipper or on the ring in the handle of the bag, if any.  The main thing - then do not lose.  Make sure the keychain holds well. </li></ul><h2>  Materials used in the decor </h2><p>  If your goal is to decorate the bag so that it is completely transformed, then you will probably need certain skills and materials for needlework.  In order not to spoil the bag, try practicing in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since decorating a bag seems like a simple task for those who see materials that can be used for this purpose, we will study them in more detail. </p><ul><li>  Beads, sequins, bugles, beads.  Since they need to be sewn, they are suitable for decorating bags made of soft material.  You can also make a chain of beads, which will also participate in the decor. </li><li>  Rhinestones of different sizes.  They are glued to the surface of the bag.  You can arrange them in a chaotic manner, or you can lay out any pattern from them. </li><li>  Cords, ribbons, lace, ribbons.  You can sew, but you can stick.  They are also used in the technique of embroidery with ribbons.  Also, from the ribbons, you can make flowers and stick them or sew them to the bag. </li><li>  Threads.  Knitting, embroidery, appliqu√©s are a far from complete list of what can be done using threads.  However, if you sew any materials, you will need threads anyway, but not decorative or woolen, but ordinary sewing. </li><li>  Buttons  From them you can make a beautiful application. </li><li>  Pieces of fabric.  Suitable for applications, or in order to make them flowers for the bag. </li><li>  Ready-made artificial flowers, fabric or plastic figures, artificial feathers, pompons - in other words, any already prepared decor that can be found in needlework stores. <div class="photo" data-original="captaincrafty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawing on fabric" class="if uuid-2667815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667815.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  In addition to knowledge in terms of how to decorate a bag with your own hands, you also need to understand that handmade accessories require special care.  This is especially true for products that combine several different materials, requiring a different attitude when washing.  In particular, rhinestones in general can easily fall off when washed in a machine with an incorrectly set mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="splendideclutchbags.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage Bag" class="if uuid-2667813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667813.jpg"></div><h2>  Dressing leather bag </h2><p>  A leather bag is usually very dense, and therefore, materials for decor need to be selected so that they can be attached to its surface, and also so that they fit well.  Read how to decorate a leather bag quickly and easily. </p><p>  If you plan to sew something, you will have to use an awl or a very tight needle.  You can make holes with an awl in advance.  Then pass a beautiful leather or other decorative lace into the hole.  You can lay out a specific pattern from it.  This is a very simple but incredibly beautiful reception. </p><p>  Also, glued stones and rhinestones look good on leather bags.  Use high-quality glue so that rhinestones do not fall off.  Painting with a special paint on leather fabric may also be appropriate if you can draw.  Another original option is decoupage.  Of course, the bag is unlikely to be similar to a handmade product, but it will be bright and interesting. </p><p>  Thus, with the help of your imagination, you can decide how to decorate the bag with your own hands.  The photos below will hopefully help you find some inspiration for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artiamano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather bag" class="if uuid-2667803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667803.jpg"></div><h2>  Jeans bag decoration </h2><p>  Denim is a soft material, so the question of how to decorate a denim bag usually does not cause difficulties. </p><p>  The advantage of this material is that you can easily sew any decor on it.  Denim products are known for their simplicity, because you can easily combine denim background, knitted flowers, decorative cords, beads, ‚Äútorn‚Äù effect and much more in one accessory. </p><p>  You can add a denim bag with denim patches of a different color.  For example, if a bag is made of blue material, then pieces of different shapes can be cut out of blue: geometric, in the form of pockets, flowers, hearts - as you wish.  Then you can stick them to the bag, but it will be better to sew.  After all, the edges of the denim can open, and your patch will deteriorate over time.  In addition, sewing on patches makes it possible to make a very interesting effect if you sew patches with a cord of the same color as the background of the bag.  That is, you get a blue patch on a background of blue denim, sewn with a decorative seam. </p><p>  The same method can be used to restore the bag if it is worn, well, or simply if the rubbed area was a design element, but then tired.  Just sew or glue the fabric over. </p><h2>  Knitted bag decor </h2><p>  To decide how to decorate a knitted bag, you must first determine the purpose of this bag.  Typically, knitwear or craftswomen knit independently crochet or knitting, or buy for the beach season.  In the first case, the bag is softer, possibly openwork, flexible, and in the second - dense. </p><div class="photo" data-original="disha-foundation.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bag with beads" class="if uuid-2667812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667812.jpg"></div><p>  If you plan to carry a bag to the beach or in the summer in the city, then it can be decorated in a marine style.  For example, crochet different figures in the form of a starfish, seahorse, shells, supplement them with beads with imitation under pearls, and then sew them to the bag.  It will look especially original if the yarn is white.  Then the color decor will stand out. </p><p>  If the bag is suitable for more formal use, then it can be decorated with concise beads, beads, rhinestones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turntopretty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bag decor" class="if uuid-2667809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667809.jpg"></div><h2>  Handmade fabric bag: how to decorate </h2><p>  If you sew the bag yourself, then you have the opportunity to start its decor already in the process of sewing, because the question of how to decorate the bag at the end of the manufacture of the product may no longer arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dulhaz-dulhanz.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewn bags" class="if uuid-2667807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667807.jpg"></div><p>  The patchwork technique - stitching different pieces of fabric in a special way can already become a sufficient decor, especially or use pieces of fabric in bright colors and with a different pattern.  See that the drawings are combined. </p><p>  Embroidery on the bag is also an original move.  You can also embroider only the owner‚Äôs initials or some meaningful word with the help of a cord or thick threads.  It is better to embroider on a pattern, since the embroidery process on the finished product has certain difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bag with embroidery" class="if uuid-2667806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2667806.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the finished fabric bag can be decorated with decoupage or applique from pieces of fabric or buttons.  Buttons in general look interesting on fabric bags, regardless of how they are sewn: randomly or in the form of any pattern, make up some interesting pattern.  Decoupage on fabric bags is also very easy. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of ways to decorate bags.  The fantasy of the craftswoman, who visited her inspiration in the process of decorating the bag, as well as the experience of other needlewomen, can help in choosing the perfect design. </p>
