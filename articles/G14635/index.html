  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual SIM for registration, calls and SMS</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A virtual sim card is issued through special service sites, they provide services for free or for money.  But most of these services provide a temporary period or clearance with restrictions.  There are also stationary operators who will issue such a SIM card, but all information about the profile will be downloaded "by air".  The virtual SIM itself replaced the old standards of the <span>mobile network,</span> when everyone was tied to operators, tariffs, this is especially noticeable for people who use SIM cards in different places with different communication coverage. </p><h2>  SIM card concept </h2><p>  This is a special module that identifies the subscriber in the cellular network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.argos.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="O2 Triple SIM Card" class="if uuid-2557528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2557528.jpg"></div><p>  They support a variety of digital mobile cellular standards and frequencies. </p><p>  They can perform different functions: </p><ul><li>  Be a memory for phone numbers. </li><li>  Keep lists of calls that have been missed and received, outgoing calls. </li><li>  Receive messages. </li></ul><p>  But now these functions are not used, since modern phones already come with a large amount of memory, and on the SIM cards themselves only a small part of the information. </p><h2>  SIM card design </h2><p>  Usually, SIM cards are issued by transferring passport data to mobile operators, so that, in turn, they allow you to use their services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.adafruit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual sim card for registration" class="if uuid-2557530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2557530.jpg"></div><p>  A virtual SIM card may also need this data, but you can use the services to hide your identity. </p><p>  Before registration, it is necessary to carefully consider all the options that the service and / or mobile operator provides. </p><h2>  Using a virtual SIM card and virtual numbers </h2><ol><li>  When traveling to another country.  For example, you use a regular SIM card that you bought at the place with which roaming charges for calls and messages will be charged.  But thanks to the virtual SIM card, you can easily change the profiles of operators and save on roaming. </li><li>  Fraud schemes.  When you issue a room on various forums or special services, you can hide your identity.  It is against the law!  (It's about virtual numbers). </li><li>  For practical jokes.  When you need to play a person who knows your number, but you do not want him to recognize you, you can use a virtual SIM card and change the numbers until you turn blue. </li><li>  No access to the operator‚Äôs office.  You have decided to issue a SIM card, but the nearest office is located far away from your location.  In such cases, a virtual SIM card or virtual number is suitable for you. </li><li>  Creating additional accounts in the services of gambling, sports betting, social networks, dating sites, all other suspicious sites.  Easy registration through the service, and a SIM card in your device.  It follows that a virtual sim card for registration on various sites where it is needed is suitable. </li><li>  Engaging for business purposes, but it‚Äôs better to use paid services. </li></ol><h2>  Benefits </h2><ol><li>  Lack of expensive roaming.  A virtual SIM card for receiving SMS while roaming is ideal. </li><li>  Just one card, instead of several. </li><li>  Quick change of operator. </li><li>  You yourself choose the best rate. </li><li>  Using a virtual SIM card everywhere.  Seriously, it can be used anywhere. </li><li>  Spam protection. </li><li>  The ability to send mass messages. </li><li>  Fast call forwarding to the specified number. </li></ol><h2>  Differences between virtual number and SIM card </h2><p>  At times, not all operators have advantageous offers when designing a virtual SIM.  Then a virtual number comes to the rescue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.emprosoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Virtual sim card" class="if uuid-2557531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2557531.jpg"></div><p>  The virtual number works like a virtual SIM card or city number, you can receive calls and messages via the Internet.  No equipment needed.  Forwarding possible. </p><p>  It is also protection against spam, but it is especially useful when shopping at some online stores or when applying for a loan from various sellers (you do not need to ignore the bank).  In the same sense, it saves you from deducting funds from the telephone balance after downloading for "free." </p><div class="photo" data-original="composs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual number" class="if uuid-2558245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2558245.jpg"></div><p>  Again, you save on calls to different countries and cities.  You can make calls at competitive rates, you do not need to carry a telephone cable. </p><h2>  How to make virtual sims, design a virtual number </h2><p>  As an example.  Do you have a MTS SIM card and need a virtual SIM card? </p><p>  How to attach to MTS: </p><ol><li>  We go to the official website in your personal account. </li><li>  There we connect the service "Virtual Number". </li></ol><p>  More options.  Connection of a virtual number (without category): </p><ol><li>  Dial the combination * 760 * 01 # (call).  For the "golden" category at the end * 02 #, for the "platinum" * 03 # instead of * 01 #. </li><li>  Send a message with the text "01" to the number 7600. For "gold" 02, for platinum 03. </li><li>  There are features of a call using a virtual number.  When dialing a number, you need to enter additional characters, which can be viewed in more detail on the official website. </li></ol><p>  It is likely that your operator provides this service, just look in your account and on the website of the service provider.  You can call the operator, and he will explain all the features and nuances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Whatsim sim card" class="if uuid-2557533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2557533.jpg"></div><p>  So, you have decided to issue a virtual SIM card.  To do this, you will need to perform several actions: </p><ol><li>  Find an operator or website service for issuing a card or number. </li><li>  Complete a simple registration procedure.  Usually you need to enter your email and / or passport data, fill out all the other items. </li><li>  Choose a suitable rate. </li><li>  Proceed to use the card for calls, messages and doing various things. </li></ol><p>  Services where you can connect: </p><ul><li>  Twilio; </li><li>  Textnow </li><li>  Countrycode.org; </li><li>  zadarma.com; </li><li>  sms-reg.com; </li><li>  Pinger; </li><li>  smscan.com; </li><li>  Onlinesim.ru; </li><li>  Sonetel.com. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="freezvon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual sim card" class="if uuid-2558226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2558226.jpg"></div><p>  Most services provide services for free, both on the basis of a trial period and on the basis of viewing ads by the user.  There may be problems when the provided number refers to a foreign one, if you need a Russian one.  The toll free numbers have a trial period of call forwarding, you can also purchase additional services for business.  At times, sites hold promotions during which they provide a real or virtual number for free.  You can get a similar promotion if you follow their appearance. </p><p>  Just a quick note.  Soon it will be possible to use mobile communications using <span>blockchain technologies.</span>  There are already many startups in this direction.  For example, Google Project Fi, which operates as a virtual operator based on two national core networks.  However, while there are restrictions on Internet speed for 120 countries. </p>
