    <p>  If you are interested in the best resorts of Cambodia, what is worth starting, perhaps, with a visit to the city of Siem Reap.  Here you can spend whole days in fascinating travels while enjoying the monuments of Angkor Wat.  In this unique place are numerous ancient temples with ancient Buddha statues and interesting bas-reliefs. </p><p>  Angkor Wat is the country's cultural center, located a few kilometers from the city of Siem Reap.  Actually, all travelers stop in the city where the tourist infrastructure is well developed.  There are many hotels of different categories, as well as numerous cafes and restaurants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Typically, tourists, spending all day in Angkor Wat, spend the night returning to Siem Reap.  But for this day for many does not end, because the city has nightclubs and discos.  You can also visit the night market - a local night market where you can buy everything from expensive gold jewelry to elegant silk scarves or simple bamboo crafts. </p><h2>  For young people </h2><p>  Travel agencies offer different tours for fans of trekking through the impenetrable jungle.  This can be a one-day walk or a multi-day motorcycle ride.  The choice always remains with the client. </p>

    <p>  Beautiful waterfalls, mountain lakes and impenetrable vines - this and much more awaits curious tourists on the proposed hikes.  Naturally, such entertainment is suitable for trained and physically developed people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists leave interesting reviews after visiting the Phnom Kulen waterfall, which goes into the jungle.  In its warm waters you can swim.  Travelers say this is a really good place to have a great day! </p><p>  Some travelers want to get acquainted with the identity of the Khmer village, to see with their own eyes how the descendants of the ancient culture live today.  For them there are specially designed tours to the Cambodian outback, where there are no paved roads, and there is no electricity in the houses of the local population.  Many travelers are advised to visit villages in the provinces of Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri (of course, accompanied by an experienced guide). </p><h2>  Sihanoukville </h2><p>  If you are looking for Cambodian resorts on the sea, then you should pay attention to Sihanoukville.  Once in this small city for the first time, many return here more than once.  Here you can find ancient Buddhist temples, modern spas, nightclubs and discos. </p><p>  But the most attractive in Sihanoukville is its endless sandy beaches.  Popular with local people and tourists are beaches such as Ochetel, Serendipity, Independence, Hawaii, Victory Hill and Otres.  Tourists arriving, choose a place to stay according to their tastes and preferences. </p>

    <p>  Usually young people stop at Ochuteel or Serendipity, because it is here that life does not stop for a minute.  During the day, you can sunbathe and dine in the restaurant right on the beach.  And in the evenings, these same restaurants turn into night clubs and work until dawn. </p><p>  Hawaii and Victory Hill are calmer areas.  There are fewer large hotels and restaurants.  Many tourists rent apartments here for a month, enjoying a vacation on the snow-white seashore. </p><p>  Otres is chosen by those who have come to the resorts of Cambodia to find privacy.  This beach is significantly removed from the city center and the benefits of civilization.  But unforgettable sunrises, clear sea, white sand and silence - this is something that can be enjoyed only here. </p><p>  According to numerous reviews of tourists, we can conclude that this city is perfect for long stays and opening a business.  For example, many expats say that this place is perfect for doing business, for many Cambodia has already managed to become a second home. </p><h2>  For romantics </h2><p>  For those who are looking for romantic beach resorts in Cambodia, an ideal vacation on the island of Koh De Kul is ideal.  Of course, the famous Sihanoukville, like other cities in the country, are great for a vacation.  But it is on Koh De Dec Kul that many travelers prefer to spend their honeymoon. </p>

    <p>  Among connoisseurs, the island of Ko De Dec Kul has long been in first place in the list of "The Best Resorts of Cambodia on the Sea."  This island has been privately owned for several years, and an exclusive five-star hotel has been built on it. </p><p>  The hotel is small, it has 12 rooms, each of which is a separate villa with a private pool.  Here you can guaranteed to enjoy privacy and freedom.  Young couples come here to relax and enjoy time spent with each other. </p><h2>  Eco vacation </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the resorts of Cambodia can hardly be called popular tourist destinations.  There are few travelers here, so nature has retained its original appearance.  There are many places in the country where the tourist‚Äôs foot has not set foot.  Many travelers choose Cambodia for secluded relaxation and eco-tourism. </p><p>  Deserted places where you can spend the night directly in the open air, can be found near Siem Reap or Sihanoukville.  To do this, you just need to get away from popular resorts.  But despite the proximity to big cities, one should not forget about caution - snakes and other dangerous animals walk free. </p><h2>  The islands </h2><p>  Real Cambodian <span>beach resorts</span> are located on local islands.  For example, Koh Rong Island is well suited for recreation, where you can set up a tent right in the middle of the jungle.  For a better overview of the surroundings, you can take a walk to the Cardamom Mountains.  Those accustomed to a comfortable stay can pre-book a room at a local hotel. </p>

    <p>  An eco-friendly paradise can be found on the nearby islands of Koh Kong, Koh Rong Samloem and Koh Ta-Kiev.  Nature there is almost untouched.  Here you can admire the amazing mountainous and forest landscapes, as well as watch the life of animals and birds with interest. </p><p>  After visiting the island of Koh Rong, tourists share their impressions and say that there is very clear water and the most beautiful beaches, and one day to get acquainted with the area is clearly not enough. </p><h2>  For divers </h2><p>  If on earth there are places created specifically for divers, then some Cambodian resorts are on this list.  Almost every tourist city has good conditions for diving. </p><p>  Good diving schools can be found in Sihanoukville.  Experienced and novice divers are more comfortable on the island of Ko Kong.  It is here that you can swim among various marine animals and explore the sunken ships, of which there are many on this island. </p><p>  Those wishing to swim among the coral reefs go to the island of Koh Rong.  Popular diving sites are located here, and they are good for both beginners and professionals. </p><p>  According to numerous reviews of tourists, the amazing resorts of Cambodia remain in memory forever.  Here the traveler will find the friendliness of the local population, an unusual atmosphere and stunning landscapes. </p>
