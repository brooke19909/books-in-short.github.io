  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami frogs according to the schemes - three options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The technique of folding various shapes from a sheet of paper is popular in all countries of the world.  There are models for beginning masters and children, and there are complex options only for adults and experienced.  Figures of animals and birds created using the origami technique can be used for volume applications and for games with children. </p><p>  Models of boats, boats and aircraft can be launched by water or by air.  But frogs often make origami for a board game.  After all, if the figure is pressed to the table, and then released, then it bounces up or forward.  You can arrange a competition whose frog will jump further.  Children love to play with mobile, moving toys.  Static they quickly get bored. </p><p>  The article will describe how to make origami frogs in different ways.  The paper folding job itself is educational and informative.  A child who makes origami learns to be neat, to bend the sheet evenly and clearly, to smooth the folds well, so that the work is neat.  Fine motor skills of hands and fingers, memory and attentiveness are developing, and yet these qualities will come in handy later in school. </p><h2>  Easy option </h2><p>  To learn how to make origami frogs correctly, you need to be able to use figure assembly schemes.  The figure below has a sample, where the numbers indicate the sequence of work.  First you need to prepare a square sheet of paper.  To do this, you can draw a square on the sheet using a ruler or make the necessary shape by wrapping one of the corners of an A4 sheet to the opposite side.  Cut off the excess rectangle with scissors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Further, all actions are performed according to the frog origami scheme.  We will learn in more detail how to make bends to make a jumping frog. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple origami frog option" class="if uuid-2701597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2701597.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  First you need to make bends along the diagonals of the square and in a horizontal line in the center.  Then take the figure by both sides and use your fingers to bend the side triangles inward.  It turns out a voluminous figure with an "accordion" inside.  The top part of the frog origami must be wrapped up so that the sides of the triangles meet along the center line, as in the diagram under number 3. We make a similar fold again.  Further, the craft turns over to the back side, and work is already done with another triangle, the outer corners of which drop down until the sides meet along the center line. </p><p>  Further, the folds are repeated, reducing the sides by half, as in the figure under No. 6. These will be the hind legs of the origami frog.  Now you need to bend them twice, making sure that the figure bounces off the surface of the table.  That's all, the work is completed, and you can start the game. </p><h2>  How to fold a frog figure? </h2><p>  For older children, there is a more complicated option of folding origami frogs from paper.  Parents can help them read the diagrams.  Although children of senior preschool and primary school age should already know the numbers, so if they already have experience in making origami, then they can cope on their own.  Beginners can be helped by the fact that a mother or teacher will perform work next to the child, clearly showing the procedure for folding a sheet of paper. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami frog pattern" class="if uuid-2701472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2701472.jpg"></div><p>  We will not repeat with a step-by-step description, since everything is visible in detail in the diagram presented above.  They begin the work by preparing a square sheet of paper, and only then they simply bend it, according to the images under serial numbers. </p><p>  If you managed to make the previous origami, then you can make another figure with thin paws.  Complicate the work gradually, do not rush the child.  Indeed, it often happens that if children do not succeed the first time, then they can quit the lesson and not want to return to work.  Take your time, try first yourself to make such a complex model according to the described scheme.  Then in case of failure, you can help your child, give useful advice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make origami frogs" class="if uuid-2701593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2701593.jpg"></div><h2>  How to decorate a figurine </h2><p>  To make it more fun to play with the resulting frog, you can stick her eyes out of colored paper, make the claws a marker and stick a long red tongue inside.  It is interesting to make several figures of different colors and sizes so that you can clearly distinguish whose frog. </p>
