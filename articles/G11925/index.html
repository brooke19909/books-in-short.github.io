    <h2>  Club Sun Heaven Family (Alanya): reviews, negative comments </h2><p>  Going on vacation, first of all, you should get acquainted not with positive, but with negative reviews.  This will save you from unpleasant surprises and disappointments.  If we talk about such a resort institution as Club Sun Heaven Family 4 * (Alanya, Konakli), based on the reviews, the following negative points can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the hotel territory is quite small, and when you consider that two new buildings were built, there are even less places for walking and recreation; </li><li>  the presence of Russian-speaking workers at the reception was always considered a positive moment, but not in this case (here they behave defiantly and boorishly with guests, and therefore it is better to try to find a common language with the Turks); </li><li>  in rooms located in old buildings, furniture, plumbing and other equipment are in poor condition; </li><li>  one gets the impression that the guests are specially lodged in the "killed" rooms, so that later they require an additional payment for changing the room; </li><li>  very poor breakfasts (daily eggs, porridge, cakes and cheese slices are served); </li><li>  Wireless Internet works with big interruptions, and if we talk about numbers, then it practically does not catch there; </li><li>  <span>beach towels</span> are issued once for the entire period of rest, and if you want to change them to clean, you will have to pay 1 dollar for this service; </li><li>  photos of rooms presented on the official website and booking services do not correspond to reality; </li><li>  from maids and staff it is impossible to replenish stocks of shower gel, shampoos and other cosmetics (even after persistent demands and calls you will be assured of your wrong); </li><li>  the playground is very dusty (it would be nice for the employees to periodically wash the coating); </li><li>  very few seafood on the restaurant menu; </li><li>  central air conditioning (that is, included only at certain hours); </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to cross the roadway; </li><li>  if you order the transport in advance, then on the appointed day they may simply forget about you, and therefore it will be better if you remind yourself about the day before departure. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Club Sun Heaven Family 4 * hotel is exactly the case when the number of stars does not reflect either the living conditions or the quality of service.  Unfortunately, many guests are not aware that the hotel has old buildings with a "worn out" room stock, and therefore they will be shocked and disappointed upon arrival.  In addition, all attempts to resolve the situation will be futile, because the guardians of the hotel are the rude administrators.  Naturally, it does not make sense to turn to them for a solution to a problem.  If you still choose this hotel for yourself, then stock up on hygiene products (they will not be provided here), and also try to switch your attention to the beautiful nature, not paying attention to what is happening around. </p>
