As a result, some users experience situations when the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù freezes and does not turn on.  What to do in case of such trouble?  We will tell further in the material. </p><h2>  Mechanical damage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Physical damage to the device" class="if uuid-3082559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082559.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all users try to be careful with the device they just purchased.  They buy a durable case and screen protector.  Nevertheless, over time, the likelihood of any damage to the smartphone increases.  The reasons may be different, but the result in most cases is always the same. </p><p>  So, for example, when a phone with a molded case falls, the battery could shift.  As a result of this, a smartphone with Android does not turn on.  What to do in such a situation?  First of all, it is worth examining it for the sinking of the buttons from the blow.  Quite often, they could also move from their usual position.  As a result of this pressure on the switch does not occur.  Therefore, the device does not turn on. </p><p>  If all the keys are in place, the screen is intact and the phone simply refuses to turn on, then take it to a service center.  There, the masters will disassemble and check all the insides, thus determining what caused the malfunction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Out of memory </h2><p>  A big minus of devices on the Android operating system is a fairly ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù system for saving files and applications.  Initially, the program is loaded into the phone‚Äôs memory, and only after that the user himself must move it to the USB flash drive.  Although the transfer of some software is completely prohibited. </p><p>  As a result of the fact that the device‚Äôs memory is full, it starts to load for a long time.  But in some cases, the Android phone does not turn on.  What to do? </p><p>  If the device starts up after a certain period of time, but immediately after switching on, go to the settings program, from there to the memory and application management subsection and delete everything that takes up too much space.  You need to free up as much device memory as possible. </p><p>  If it is not possible to turn it on, then simply contact the service center with a question for specialists to help solve the problem. </p><h2>  Firmware error </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnetfrance.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the Android Oreo logos" class="if uuid-3082570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082570.jpg"></div><p>  We‚Äôll analyze another example when Android turns on and off itself, and what to do in such a situation.  Quite often, users try to independently install new firmware versions on a smartphone with the Android operating system.  But unlike iOS, it is much more complicated.  But because many who want to update their device will fail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, a simple reboot will not help.  You will need to perform a complete reset of all settings to the factory settings.  At the same time, remember that performing this procedure will lead to the loss of all files on the smartphone, except those on the memory card. </p><p>  But if the smartphone or tablet on Android does not turn on, what should I do then?  The easiest way to take the device to the masters in authorized service centers.  There, they will figure out how to bring your device back to life. </p><h2>  Power button </h2><p>  Quite often, it can also be the reason that the smartphone on the "Android" does not turn on.  What to do with such a problem?  The first thing you need to check: how it is installed in its place.  If you press it very hard or it is not at all possible, then it is likely that it has shifted from its original position and now it is not possible to use it. </p><p>  Another situation may also occur.  The button, on the contrary, has sunk inward, and now when you try to turn on the smartphone, it starts the reverse cycle.  In this case, it is necessary to disassemble the device case and simply return the displaced part to its place. </p><p>  Attention!  Do not perform this procedure yourself if you do not have sufficient experience and necessary skills.  Otherwise, you can simply completely break the smartphone. </p><h2>  Battery malfunction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Replacing batteries on Android smartphones" class="if uuid-3082566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082566.jpg"></div><p>  Consider a fairly relevant reason why the Lenovo phone with the Android does not turn on, and what to do in this situation.  A problem can occur on the device of any brand, so the information will be relevant for all users.  The maximum battery capacity is held at its peak point for no more than a year.  After that, it begins to gradually and sometimes quickly decline quite quickly.  As a result, the phone starts to turn off in the cold or when there is half the charge.  When the battery capacity is too low, the phone will turn off almost immediately after turning it on.  Even if before that he had been charging for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.saga.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charging your Android smartphone" class="if uuid-3082564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082564.jpg"></div><p>  You can do the following in this situation: </p><ul><li>  replace the battery yourself if the device does not have a monoblock design and allows you to perform this procedure; </li><li>  take the device to an authorized service center so that professionals change the battery themselves if your smartphone has a molded case. </li></ul><h2>  Temperature mismatch </h2><p>  This problem is present in one of the most popular smartphones in the world - the Apple iPhone.  The problem is that the permissible minimum temperature should not fall below -5 degrees Celsius.  Which, of course, is almost impossible in conditions of fairly cold Russian winters, with temperatures of -35 and below (in some regions). </p><p>  As a result of this, a hardware failure occurs in other smartphone models.  Then what should I do if Android does not turn on after being in the cold? </p><p>  Most often, the problem can be solved by connecting to charging.  The device will start up and you will be informed that the charge level has dropped to a critical minimum.  In some cases, you can simply reboot the device a little later, and it will start up with an almost zero battery charge. </p><h2>  Low Battery Update </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dead battery on Android smartphone" class="if uuid-3082574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082574.jpg"></div><p>  What should I do if Android does not turn on after the update?  This is a rather rare case, since the device usually warns the user that it is necessary to connect it to power before downloading the data packet.  In some cases, the update simply does not start if the charge level is equal to or below 50%. </p><p>  Nevertheless, if during the upgrade process you have a dead battery, it is recommended to contact a service center.  Since further attempts to deal with a non-starting device can lead to its final failure. </p><h2>  Problem with memory card </h2><p>  Despite the fact that many modern smartphones that support the ability to use a memory card can work with chips of any manufacturers (the main thing is that the type matches), sometimes unpleasant situations can happen.  Often, due to incompatibility with the Android memory card, Samsung does not turn on.  What to do in such a situation? </p><p>  The first and sometimes the only solution is to remove the chip from the device‚Äôs body and try to restart the smartphone again.  This should fix the situation. </p><p>  In this situation, it makes sense to try using drives from other manufacturers.  If the story repeats with each of them, then it is quite possible that you have a problem with the memory card slot.  In this case, it remains only to contact the service center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Authorized Service Center" class="if uuid-3082576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082576.jpg"></div><h2>  On Android, Bluetooth does not turn on.  What to do? </h2><p>  This software failure is also quite common among devices that support this file sharing feature.  The first thing to check is whether your smartphone sees other devices in an acceptable radius.  To do this, through the settings, disable the function (if it worked) and after a minute break, start it again.  If the device search did not return results, then follow these steps: </p><ul><li>  Turn off and restart the device.  Quite often, this procedure helps to solve the problem with software failures. </li><li>  Update your phone firmware to a more stable version.  Quite often, this may turn out to be a malfunction of the new version of the operating system.  In this case, just install the previous one. </li><li>  Reset the device to factory settings.  Before that, save separately all important data and files, since the device will be completely cleared of all information recorded during use. </li></ul><p>  If none of the above helps, contact an authorized service center for help. </p><h2>  Additional ways </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tmcnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Service center" class="if uuid-3082577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112935/3082577.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we consider a list of the most successful solutions to the question: "What should I do if Android does not turn on?" </p><ul><li>  Restarting the device.  It has already been said above that it helps to solve small malfunctions that arose during the operation of the operating system. </li><li>  Battery recovery.  Actual for cases with a sharp shutdown. </li><li>  Reset to factory settings.  At the same time, the latest version of the operating system is installed on the smartphone, which corrects all errors that appeared during operation. </li><li>  Work with the Recovery mode menu.  It is launched by pressing the volume and power keys on the disconnected smartphone.  If there are no results, it is recommended to consult a specialist. </li><li>  If there is no damage, you should try installing the new firmware version.  It is not recommended that you do this yourself if you do not have enough experience.  In fact, this method is not much different from resetting to factory settings.  Only with it all your data is saved. </li><li>  If malfunctions appear after installing some applications, it is recommended that you also reset the settings.  Quite often, after the removal of malicious programs, their files are saved in various memory directories, which allows the error to be repeated. </li></ul>
