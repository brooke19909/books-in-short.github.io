    <p>  Today, in addition to a wide plasma TV, you can also install a compact device in your home that will connect to the translator using a Wi-Fi signal.  Thus, you can enjoy your favorite shows, for example, lying on the couch, at arm's length.  <span>GS700 (tablet)</span> helps to realize this <span>.</span>  Reviews about it, as well as brief characteristics of the device, are given in this article. </p><h2>  <span>What is a</span> GS700 <span>tablet</span> ? </h2><p>  So, let's start with a brief explanation of why this device is needed at all.  The device description indicates that the GS700 is a tablet.  Tricolor TV, the company that presents it on the market together with the developer (GS), also offers a translator with it.  The latter, as already noted above, allows you to connect multiple TVs at once to the signal transmitted from the satellite.  Thus, if you have a large apartment or house in which there are several TVs (or it is one, but you also want to watch from the GS700 tablet), this kit is just the perfect solution.  Well, of course, in addition to being able to enjoy satellite TV, you also get the GS700 (tablet).  User reviews indicate that even without connecting a signal, the device is a good ‚Äútoy‚Äù.  And with it you can chat on Skype, watch downloaded movies, use a browser, read books.  In general, full versatility! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Device design </h2><p>  Even if you take into account only the <span>appearance of the</span> tablet, it can be called pretty.  It, in fact, is not much different from most budget Chinese devices - it has the same rectangular shape, but at the same time it is made of high-quality, pleasant to the touch plastic.  As the reviews characterizing the GS700 tablet are noted, there are not even any defects in the assembly - all panels are perfectly matched to each other, no backlash and creaking is observed. </p><p>  As for the buttons and navigation, there are sound keys at the top, while there is no central ‚Äúhome‚Äù button.  Instead, the developers placed the logo of the company GS, which is engaged in the production of devices. </p><h2>  Tablet processor </h2><p>  The design of the GS700, as you can see, is on top.  As for the "filling", then everything is fine here.  The GS700 Tricolor tablet works (user reviews confirm the convenience of such a solution) based on the MTK8127 Quad Core.  This implies the presence of 4 cores on the computer.  No, this, of course, is not the most advanced solution, but for a device of this class it is quite suitable.  Although the tablet does not have the task of reproducing bulky applications and games (although he will undoubtedly ‚Äúpull‚Äù them), such details will make it possible to cope with its tasks with a bang. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The RAM on the device has a capacity of 1 GB, which, according to those who leave reviews about the GS700 (tablet), is enough for fast and dynamic operation.  There were also no brakes when scrolling through the menu - the tablet is quite ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. </p><h2>  Graphic characteristics </h2><p>  By the way, do not forget about the schedule, because this is a key issue for people who want to watch television from their computer.  So, GS700 operates on the Mali 450 MP4 Quad Core graphics engine.  Paired with a seven-inch <span>screen, the resolution of</span> which is 1024 x 800 pixels, this software is able to give an excellent picture, which most users will be happy with.  Even if we take into account the reproduction of modern games, the GS700 (tablet) - reviews will confirm this - copes with this at the proper level.  This is a good indicator for a budget device, whose main goal is not to work with demanding applications. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Of course, characterizing the OS on which the GS700 runs, we will not tell the readers anything new.  This, of course, is Android 4.4.4.  This version is the most stable, although not new at the moment.  Now (for reference) there is already version 5.1.1, which is installed on Nexus devices.  Nevertheless, even with such a system, the GS700 (tablet) works, the reviews will not let you lie - excellent.  The structure and logic of the system, features make it convenient and simple for any user! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, it is not worth hoping that with KitKat in the future the model will be updated to Lollipop: nobody will likely develop a software solution for such an operation on a budget computer.  And this statement is well founded.  Perhaps in the future, the developer will simply release a new, more modern analogue than the Tricolor TV GS700 tablet.  Customer feedback and expectations can play a role in this. </p><h2>  GS700 Battery </h2><p>  If we are talking about the mobility of the gadget, its compactness and the ability to walk around the house with it, for example, and enjoy your favorite satellite TV, then, of course, it will be interesting for the user to know about the battery capabilities of the device.  In fact, the GS700 (tablet) -instruction, <span>however,</span> does not contain <span>this</span> information, the information is based, rather, on the personal observations of some buyers - it can hold out in active work for 8-12 hours.  It all depends on the strength of the Wi-Fi signal, as well as settings such as mobile networks and screen brightness.  <span>The battery capacity</span> with which the tablet comes in the basic version is 2800 mAh.  In extreme cases, if the time noted above is not enough for someone, you can solve the problem at any time by connecting the device to a network charge or power bank. </p><h2>  The cost of the tablet and equipment </h2><p>  As already noted, the GS700 (the tablet whose photo you will meet in the article) is a typical budget device.  You can buy it at a price of 13 thousand rubles.  A couple of translators capable of receiving a signal and transmitting it using a Wi-Fi format connection (this was mentioned above) will be supplied with the tablet computer.  Nice deal, right? </p>

    <p>  And for 14 thousand rubles, the masters will install and configure you a tablet from the Tricolor TV GS700.  Reviews from those who have already used this turnkey service speak about the practicality of the solution in this case too.  And, of course, the tablet itself comes in a complete package, including a charger, a PC connection cable, and instructions.  By the way, it does not describe a lot of everything - it does not make sense, since working with Android KitKat does not require any special knowledge.  All that a person needs to know is the combination of translators.  However, in the case of ordering settings, even this is not useful.  See how easy it is to get the GS700 Tricolor TV!  Customer reviews confirm that the company serves fairly quickly, and the whole procedure itself is simple. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  We will publish some more recommendations from those who have already managed to use this functionality.  It, as you remember, in addition to the package for broadcasting a TV signal, also includes a GS700 tablet.  Reviews in general indicate a fairly high rating for this product.  People note how convenient the function of simultaneously receiving two profitable products is - satellite TV and a portable mobile device that can work in any conditions.  It turns out that the buyer saves on this service, organized by the Tricolor TV company.  This can explain the demand for the product. </p>

    <p>  Another GS700 - a tablet, the reviews of which we cited above - can be noted as a high-performance, multi-functional device at an affordable price.  With such characteristics, it is difficult to find even the products of a Chinese noname company at the same price.  This is due to the fact that Tricolor TV is profitable to sell this line so cheaply, because each device purchased by the client also includes a package for television services, which will need to be paid for in the future.  It turns out a kind of "subscription", which is beneficial to both parties. </p>

    <p>  In fact, you can feel the same benefit.  As you read, the GS700 (the tablet we reviewed in this article) is a good solution.  If you are fond of satellite television, you might consider purchasing a ‚Äúportable screen‚Äù that can be moved around the apartment or around the house. </p>
