We do not always think about this when acquiring certain gizmos, but, nevertheless, this knowledge will not hurt. </p><p>  A special sign of sexuality and femininity is, of course, a skirt.  Appearing in the 15th century, it has always remained an indispensable item of women's wardrobe.  The history of the creation of the skirt goes back to ancient centuries.  This happened even when the clothes were not divided into women's and men's.  Its origin is due to <span>loincloths,</span> which served to cover intimate places.  Many designers consider the shrami skirts, the aprons worn in ancient Egypt, to be the model. </p><p>  The history of the creation of the skirt and its modifications dates back to the time of Mycenae and ancient Crete.  During this period, radical changes take place in the appearance of this garment, variations begin to appear, which are a set of frills and wedges, and their sewing is done in separate stripes. </p><p>  Studying the main stages of the formation and development of fashion, you can find information that five centuries ago, the skirt appeared in the women's wardrobe and became an independent item of clothing.  The history of skirts in the 15-16 centuries is the creation of a large number of diverse models for the female.  Tailors separated the bodice from it, and the product itself was decorated with frills and other decorative elements.  It was also the time of the creation of the train, which has since been found in clothing of all historical periods and has survived to this day. </p><p>  Spain is a trendsetter, and the history of skirts in this country deserves special attention.  The first models were sewn using metal or wooden hoops on a dense cover.  At the waist they were narrow and extended to the bottom.  In those days when the first models were created, no one yet knew about any sewing equipment.  Later, the fashion of skirt skirts appeared in Germany.  France has its own <span>history of skirts.</span>  In this country, all models, starting from the very first, were light and airy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 17th century, the story of a skirt on a frame ends, but not for long, since this thing just goes out of fashion.  Direct models with folds or draperies on the sides are replacing.  The original samples were also skirts on fittings (flexible metal plates assembled in a frame).  This invention appeared in the 18th century. </p><p>  The methods of dyeing the fabric in those days were very simple, but despite this, the woman had the opportunity to choose the pattern or color of clothes to her taste.  The 18th century is an era of luxury, which can also be seen in wardrobe items.  Skirts with a hair cover or crinoline appear in fashion.  Over time, they improve, become more direct, they are additionally decorated with fabric and folds with bows.  <span>Paul Poiret</span> introduced into fashion in 1913 narrowed down models. </p><p>  A constantly changing fashion brings new ideas that for a period of time become popular.  For example, in the 20th century, corsets were abolished, the length of dresses and skirts was noticeably reduced.  Thanks to the world famous <span>Coco Chanel,</span> pleated and elegant models of medium length appear in fashion, in which various inserts are successfully sewn.  After World War II, tweed suits appear in fashion, the set of which includes a <span>narrow skirt.</span> </p><p>  Mary Kuant in 1965 went the farthest in reducing length, and with her participation mini-models, ‚Äúpencils‚Äù, ‚Äútulips‚Äù appeared, shortened with flounces.  All of them still exist and allow a woman to look sensually, gently and gracefully. </p><p>  The new fashionable item in the women's wardrobe was the petticoat.  It was appreciated by the ladies, calling it a tribute to femininity.  The lower skirt took pride of place among delicate underwear, due to the fact that with its help it is so easy to emphasize femininity and sexuality. </p>
