Many of them seek to make such entertainments on video so that in the future they can share their impressions with their friends.  It is for such people that the so-called action cameras have been created, which differ in their light weight and dimensions, and can also be reliably fixed on various accessories (helmets, mounts or rotary tripods).  One of the most interesting models was the Sony HDR-AS30V camera, an overview of which is presented in more detail below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony HDR AS30V" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/544020.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Construction and Management </h2><p>  The design of the Sony HDR-AS30V model is lightweight and at the same time reliable.  It allows you to use the device in almost any weather conditions.  It is not necessary to hold the camcorder in your hands for shooting - just fix it.  The main controls are located on the side of the case.  Pressing the buttons will not be difficult even with gloves. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Depending on the region in which the model is implemented, the manufacturer may slightly change its configuration.  Be that as it may, the instructions for using the device, a <span>protective box, a</span> cable for transferring images and videos to stationary microUSB media, adhesive fastening, the NP-BX1 battery pack and warranty are part of the standard equipment of the Sony HDR-AS30V camcorder.  If necessary, the buyer can additionally purchase a remote control for a fee.  Thanks to the latter, you can control the camera directly from your wrist via Wi-Fi.  This portable device allows you to start or stop the shooting process, change settings and even crop images. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony HDR AS30V manual" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/544038.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, with the Slow Motion effect, the device is capable of creating HD recordings at a frequency of 120 frames per second.  In general, this Sony digital video camera is capable of shooting video in six modes.  Their choice depends on the wishes of the user and the size of the installed memory card.  If necessary, the shooting can be slowed down two or four times.  The resulting smooth video, as well as fairly clear frames during vibration and shaking, are the result of the functioning of an effective stabilization system called SteadyShot.  For high-quality work at high speed, as well as when performing tricks on a skateboard, bicycle or motorcycle, an ultra-smooth shooting mode is provided.  When activated, recording is performed at a frequency of up to 60 frames per second.  It should be noted and excellent sound settings when shooting video. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  A rather interesting feature that the Sony HDR-AS30V received was automatic video correction.  It is used when watching videos that were shot when the device was in the upside down position.  In order to ensure the completeness of the image taken from various angles of the picture, the developers have provided for the possibility of combining the material captured simultaneously by two cameras into a single whole - Two-Screen Multi View.  A smartphone or tablet can act as a remote control for the model.  To instantly connect the camera to such devices, you need to activate the One Touch <span>Near Field Communication</span> function <span>.</span>  Moreover, users have the option to download the PlayMemories Home app to the Sony HDR-AS30V camera.  The reviews of many of them are a clear confirmation of the fact that in this case, three or even four video clips can be combined quite qualitatively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony HDR AS30V Review" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/544035.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Photo mode </h2><p>  There are times when taking pictures is much more preferable than video recordings.  All that is needed in this case for the model owner is to enable the corresponding mode on his device.  The result is pretty high-quality photos with a resolution of 11.9 megapixels.  Moreover, the model provides the ability to perform automatic serial shooting.  Controlling the camera in this mode is as simple as using a regular camera. </p><h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  An important feature that the Sony camcorder of this model boasts is its equipped with a Wi-Fi module.  It serves to transfer files directly to a smartphone or other compatible device, as well as to implement the remote control function.

    <h2>  GPS module </h2><p>  In addition, the Sony HDR-AS30V camcorder has a built-in GPS module, which opens up a number of additional features for its owner.  It is able to record the location, trajectory and speed of movement of the device due to the Map View function.  All this information is recorded in a separate file.  If you work with video, frames will be displayed starting from the starting point of the route.  In the case when the photo mode is activated, frames are recorded with points and information about the location of captured objects.  When using the Multi View function, indicators can be superimposed on the video as a visual speedometer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camcorder Sony" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/544019.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, users have access to a high-speed HDMI interface.  Thanks to him, you can view videos and photos on a large plasma screen directly from the camera.  It should be noted that the fact that the standard configuration does not provide for the cable to connect through this output. </p><h2>  Cost and optional accessories </h2><p>  The price of the Sony HDR-AS30V camcorder in the US market starts at $ 248.  At the same time, buyers from Russia and the CIS countries will have to pay at least 365 dollars for the device.  In addition, the manufacturer offers a number of additional accessories and devices designed for fixing and carrying the camera.  These include belts, frames, suction cups, head mounts, car chargers and many other devices.  Along with this, attention should be paid to the fact that their cost is considerable, despite the simplicity, as it might seem at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camcorder Sony HDR AS30V" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/544051.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Japanese manufacturer is positioning the Sony HDR-AS30V model as a video camera for adventure lovers and dynamic plots.  This is evidenced by its main advertising slogan.  In general, the model is fully consistent with this phrase, because, being a multi-functional, compact and lightweight device, it allows you to qualitatively capture your favorite pastime.  You can fix it anywhere, but manage it without even getting out of the case.  Moreover, the owner of the camera has the ability to quickly process the captured material and share it with his friends on social networks. </p>
