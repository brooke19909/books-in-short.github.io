What is the difference between iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple has released the 5th generation of its smartphones in several basic versions.  This is an iPhone in versions 5, 5S and 5C.  And if the differences between the first two and third modifications, in principle, can be traced already at the design level, then the iPhone 5 and 5S look incredibly similar.  But the difference between them, if you follow the marketing logic of the brand manufacturer, there must be.  What is it expressed in? </p><h2>  How big is the difference? </h2><p>  Some experts who conducted a study of the characteristics of the iPhone 5 and 5S, a comparison of both smartphones, believe that the difference between the phones is in the nature of individual nuances.  The concept, experts believe, is generally the same for both devices.  But there are those who believe that the fifth generation of iPhones in the new modification, classified by the S index, is nevertheless the result of a rather serious processing of the device of the previous version. </p>

    <p>  So there is no consensus among experts on the similarity of the two smartphones.  It will be even more interesting to study the characteristics of the iPhone 5 and 5S in order to get objective facts at its disposal. </p><h2>  Technical specifications </h2><p>  Compare the basic specifications of the two smartphones.  We will also study them in comparison with another <span>iPhone model</span> in the same generation - 5C.  We list the <span>technical characteristics of the iPhone 5, 5S</span> and 5C, synchronizing information on the phones in relation to each of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The operating system that is installed on iPhone 5 is iOS in version 6.1, however it is possible to update the OS to the 7th.  The devices of the other two modifications already have iOS 7 preinstalled. In principle, at the software level the differences are minimal. </p><h2>  Size and its meaning </h2><p>  The next interesting point is the size.  IPhone 5 and 5S in this regard are practically no different.  The dimensions of both are as follows: length - 123.8 mm, width - 58.6 mm, thickness - 7.6 mm.  In turn, the indicators for the iPhone in version 5C are slightly different: 124.4 by 59.2 and 8.97 mm, that is, it is generally larger than its "brothers".  Mainly due to the size differences relative to other versions, the 5C smartphone is sometimes considered almost as a separate class of device.  How valid can this thesis be?  We will try to answer this question below. </p><p>  The weight of the iPhone 5 and 5S is also the same - 112 grams.  The smartphone in version 5C is slightly heavier - 132 grams.  The case material is the same in iPhones 5 and 5S - this is aluminum.  In turn, the iPhone 5C used polycarbonate. </p>

    <p>  The color scheme in the supplied sets for each version of the iPhone is different.  A smartphone in the 5th modification can be bought in black or white, 5S - in golden, gray or silver, 5C - in yellow, green, blue, red or in white shades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The display characteristics of each of the fifth generation phones are exactly the same.  The diagonal of the screens is 4 inches, the type of matrix used is IPS, the resolution is 640 by 1136 pixels.  The screen of all phones is the same - apparently, it was estimated by Apple engineers that it was already quite good in the first model of the fifth generation. </p><p>  In terms of the processor, there are also differences between the iPhone versions.  The very first gadget of this generation is equipped with an A6 chip with two cores operating at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  In processors installed on two other versions of the device, the clock speed is the same, but in the case of the iPhone 5S, a 64-bit architecture is used.  On the smartphone in version 5C there is the same chip as in the first device of the series. </p><p>  As for the camera, in the iPhone 5S it has undergone a fairly deep modernization.  The aperture in it is f / 2.2 (in the two previous versions - f / 2.4).  However, the resolution of this hardware component is the same in all versions of the smartphone - 8 megapixels.  Also in the camera of the latest gadget line - 5S - appeared optical stabilization. </p>

    <h2>  Dissimilarity theory </h2><p>  The reason to say - yes, Apple has launched a flagship on the market, which is endowed with a number of characteristics that are different from previous versions.  At the same time, the iPhone in version 5S, based on the parameters considered by us, is more similar in hardware with the 5th modification than the same 5C, which, due to the increased dimensions, seems to be a separate class of device (we, by the way, found that this thesis is not entirely valid).  However, it is necessary to study the nuances.  Consider how real the practical differences in the characteristics of iPhones 5 and 5S are in comparison with the declared ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Many experts focus on the fact that in the updated version of the device, individual components were definitely improved.  We said above that the camera in the new version of the iPhone has been upgraded.  Experts believe that it is not in vain.  Moreover, this is not expressed in the superiority of this hardware component in the aspect of megapixels - as we already noted above, this indicator is the same for all fifth-generation smartphones.  According to experts, the difference is completely different - iPhone 5 and 5S produce completely different photos.  All those modes that are stated in the spectrum of camera features ‚Äî shooting in natural light, in the dark, in series or in slow-motion format ‚Äî work, experts say, perfectly. </p><p>  So, in practice, smartphones give out different quality photos.  IPhone 5 and 5S differ in the aspect of camera modernization not only nominally.  This is noted by the owners of the gadgets in question. </p><p>  In a similar way, we analyze the nominal and real differences, simultaneously adding other information regarding other characteristics. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The next aspect in which nominal differences are traced is that the iPhone 5 and 5S are equipped with different processors.  In the older version of the smartphone there is an A6 chip with a frequency of 1.3 GHz and two cores.  The updated iPhone has an A7 processor running on a 64-bit architecture.  We can say that the iPhone 5S is the first of its kind 64-bit mobile device.  At the same time, according to some experts, the practical difference between the performance in version 5 and 5S is not so noticeable, simply because there are very few games and applications designed for 64-bit architecture. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  It is interesting that in the updated version of the smartphone there is a more powerful battery with a capacity of 1570 mAh (whereas in the previous one - 1400).  However, in practice, in terms of the autonomy of the devices, there is no difference - iPhone 5 and 5S have the same level of power consumption.  Therefore, with regard to the battery, there is formally a difference, but in reality it is almost imperceptible. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, some experts, testing iPhone 5 and 5S, compared the resources of both devices in terms of battery life using specialized programs.  In some cases, it was possible to identify that the smartphone of the older version, despite the fact that its battery capacity is lower, could work longer.  In particular, similar results were recorded with the use of the popular GLBenchmark test, which implies a full load of key hardware components of the device. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  If you look at the phone carefully, there is only a slight difference between the two versions - iPhone 5 and 5S are very similar in terms of design.  However, a certain difference is still present.  The fact is that the iPhone in version 5S is equipped with a unique biometric type sensor.  In addition, it is combined with the branded Home button. </p>

    <p>  There is a slight difference in the color scheme of the case.  In the 5th version, its end sections were black, in the 5S modification they acquired a silver shade.  The back wall in the new smartphone model is almost identical in design to the 5th series version.  However, along with the updated version of the smartphone, there are more removable panels that can be installed at the back - at the disposal of the user the corresponding part is provided in three color options.  Difference?  To some extent, yes. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  If we compare the iPhone 5 and 5S on the characteristics of the screen, we won‚Äôt see much difference.  The type of matrix in the new version of the smartphone is the same as in the previous one - IPS, the display diagonal is the same - 4 inches.  The resolution is also identical - 640 by 1134 pixels.  Thus, the screen is a hardware component, in the aspect of which the iPhone 5 and 5S are absolutely no different.  The comparison can be continued, focusing on one of the key innovations of Apple in relation to the updated version of the smartphone - a biometric sensor. </p><h2>  Sensor </h2><p>  In fact, this component does not constitute any revolutionary technology - it is just a miniature <span>fingerprint scanner.</span>  In order to use it, you need to make a number of settings - set password access in the system, and then set a fingerprint as a barrier to entering the interface.  You can even several.  In order for the smartphone to guarantee finger recognition, you will have to attach it to the scanner several times.  The sensor, as experts say, works fine. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  Experts who decided to compare the iPhone 5 and 5S, revealed a number of differences between devices in terms of interface.  For example, it became possible, choosing the option for an incoming call, to use the call reminder option.  In this case, the smartphone performs the corresponding function after a while or as soon as a person leaves the building (in this case, the change in his location is determined via the GPS module).  Also, as experts say, the design in the messaging interface has changed.  For example, you can shift them to the left to form a list where delivery time will be displayed. </p><p>  Among other innovations in the interface - an updated calendar, clock, alarm clock, there is a completely new toolkit for viewing photos in the "Gallery", the weather application has also changed its design.  The built-in browser has been improved a bit with a focus on integration with social networks.  In terms of software, thus, the iPhone 5 and 5S are quite noticeably different.  Comparison of devices in the aspect of the interface is significant for many specialists. </p><h2>  Camera: software </h2><p>  Experts note some changes in the camera control interface.  Software elements for working with this hardware component have become, first of all, simpler.  The corresponding buttons are more convenient in location.  Thus, at the software level, the camera in the new iPhone is significantly different from previous versions.  In terms of performance, this hardware component, as we said above, has undergone significant improvements in the iPhone 5S.  Experts, as well as users, actively praise the quality of photos.  Video recording is in excellent quality. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can we come to by making a short review?  The iPhone 5S and 5, of course, have a number of obvious differences both in the hardware (battery, camera, processor, biometric sensor), and in the aspect of software (the control interface has changed).  However, according to many experts, the new smartphone from Apple can hardly be described as a device that has gone a step ahead of the previous version.  In particular, if we take the processor, the 64-bit architecture does not provide practical advantages now.  The battery, despite the increased capacity, in practice is not able to provide longer battery life (and in some cases - at least identical to that of the previous smartphone). </p><h2>  Conservative flagship </h2><p>  The camera, despite the fact that in the new version of the iPhone it is certainly improved, in all previous modifications of the device was also decent.  Paying, based on the price difference between the two versions of the iPhone, for the camera (as well as for the biosensor), perhaps, only ardent fans of the brand will agree.  At the same time, the experts who examined the smartphone in several versions at once (not only iPhone 5, 5C and 5S, but also fourth-generation gadgets), believe that the new series of devices, the 5th, is very noticeably superior to the previous, 4th . </p>

    <p>  In the fifth generation of smartphones, according to experts, three types of devices have appeared, adapted for different categories of users.  At the same time, analysts call the iPhone 5S the flagship of sales.  In turn, the smartphone in the 5th version, according to some reports, Apple plans to completely replace the new device on the shelves (as it is sold).  As for the smartphone in version 5C, it is assumed that it will be targeted at a youth audience.  And this despite the larger sizes, as we noted at the very beginning of the article.  The iPhone 5 and 5S are slightly smaller, but experts say they are identified by Apple marketers as more conservative models. </p>
