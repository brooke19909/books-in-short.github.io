And it imposes different requirements on graduates of educational institutions than it was several decades ago.  So, a person who has received basic / general secondary education should not only have a deep supply of knowledge, but also be able to navigate the rapidly growing flow of information.  Modern people are forced to adapt to constantly changing conditions.  At the same time, you have to regularly make responsible decisions yourself.  To increase the effectiveness of activities, it is necessary to be able to predict.  And all this can be done only with the fullness of knowledge and skills.

This includes training in kindergartens and specialized centers.  Here, children are taught to hold objects (for example, a pencil and pen), draw figures, develop fine motor skills and so on. </li><li>  Basic education.  This refers to grades 1-4 of the school.  In this case, children are being trained to subsequently master more complex knowledge.  They learn to write, count, draw, learn the basic rules of behavior in the team.  In other words, the foundation is laid for social and creative skills. </li><li>  Basic general education.  These are grades 5-9 of the school.  At this stage, students receive basic information about a large number of different subjects, which are quite difficult to understand.  We will talk about this in more detail in the article below. </li><li>  Secondary general education.  10-11 grades of the school.  At this stage, the deepening of previously acquired knowledge takes place, and new directions are being studied: jurisprudence and economics. </li></ol><h2>  What is GEF? </h2><p>  GEF of basic general education will help to understand the educational system in our country.  This is the document by which the educational process is organized.  Numerous competent authorities are working on its improvement.  The name stands for "federal state educational standards."  It should be noted that the use of the traditional approach, when ‚Äúarming‚Äù people with all the knowledge that could potentially be useful, is now not very popular.  Considering existing trends, it is impossible not to note the fact that the most important is ensuring the socialization of a person and his productive adaptation.  This has led to the fact that considerable attention is now being paid to the personality of the person being trained and to the peculiarities of his thinking.  A large number of mechanisms are being introduced into education, which should contribute to creative initiative, independence, and mobility.  Considerable attention is also paid to providing opportunities for self-realization and personal growth.  An example is university education, where a system is being introduced, according to which a person must obtain most of all knowledge independently through books and other sources of information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Performance </h2>

Of greatest importance in this case is their quality.  That is, the main goal is to teach a person to act in different conditions and solve various problems.  It should be noted that the important role of knowledge is not negated.  The main thing is the possibility of their successful application in practice.

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  As units of the educational result, knowledge and skills are used.  But to be successful in the modern information society, this is not enough.  Therefore, the peculiarity is that a person is helped to master knowledge that will help in the future to form skills.  Everything else is considered by GEF of basic general education as reference information, which can be found in various encyclopedias and specialized literature.  A trained person must be able to find it quickly and accurately. </p><h2>  What is being achieved? </h2><p>  GEF of basic general education provides that it is necessary to take care of creating experience that will help solve various problems that are important for an individual.  The formation of this approach was first applied in 2011.  There is also a whole network of preparatory institutions that engage in advanced programs in individual disciplines.  An example is schools with advanced physics, mathematics, and so on.  Also, one cannot ignore the fact that there are institutions specializing in extracurricular activities, which additionally offer students to comprehend philosophy, economics, visual arts and much more.  There are also schools that teach under the guidance of universities.  This implies the use of their material and technical base and teaching staff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Getting an education </h2>

But the law states that everyone is required to receive a basic and basic general education.  After graduation, a person must pass exams and receive a certificate.  Depending on the results and desires, people choose to get further education or to go into the practical sphere of activity.  The certificate allows you to choose a profession and go to study at a vocational school or college or continue to study at school further.  Basic general education is aimed at helping the formation and formation of personality.  The influence is on moral beliefs, aesthetic taste, communication culture, lifestyle.  In addition, the mastery of the state language, the foundations of sciences, the skills of physical and mental labor is ensured, and inclinations, interests and abilities for social self-determination are developed.

In this case, the only restriction that is provided for in relation to such individuals is the impossibility of obtaining a higher level of education.  It is also necessary to note those who require special conditions for obtaining knowledge.  First of all, this means children with disabilities, as well as those who need long-term treatment and cannot attend an educational organization for health reasons.  In this case, the possibility of home or distance learning.

    <h2>  What goals are being implemented? </h2><p>  The program of basic general education (GEF) is aimed at helping a person to form a holistic view of the world, which is based on the acquired knowledge, skills, abilities and methods of activity.  Various activities are also provided (individual or collective).  Learning people are helped to know the world and themselves.  One of the goals of the program is to prepare a person for the moment when they have to make an informed choice of professional education.  For this, a comprehensive mechanism is provided that should motivate and discipline a person to study.  Moreover, everything is implemented in such a way that the abilities, capabilities, interests and needs of people are most taken into account.  So, teachers are required to engage not only in educational processes, but also in the personal development of children.  Also, each graduate must meet a certain level of literacy.  Moreover, this applies to the mathematical, natural science, and socio-cultural areas of training. </p><h2>  What does the approximate program of basic general education look like? </h2>

Some of them are aimed at making him a citizen of the state.  Others aim to provide society with a healthy individual.  Still others help to understand what is interesting to a person and what he wants to do all his life.  The following items help with this:

Therefore, training does not need to be ignored.  Moreover, the basic program of primary general education should not be the boundary of human development.  At any age, you need to pay attention to your training and improvement.  Science and a rationalistic approach to problem solving should be promoted.  In this case, it will be possible to talk about an increase in the effectiveness of the activities of the people and the state as a social structure.  And it all starts from childhood.  No matter how good the standard of basic general education is, it is still necessary to work on it a lot and fruitfully in order to get the most out of each person who will be trained.  Of course, this is not an easy task.  But what is simple to do in our world?
