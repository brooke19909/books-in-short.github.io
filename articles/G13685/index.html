But they all have different fates.  Some are restored and open to visitors.  Others are abandoned.  There are estates in the Lipetsk region that have long turned into ruins. </p><h2>  Manor Skornyakova </h2><p>  In the Lipetsk region, <span>Zadonsky district,</span> there is an old dilapidated noble estate, which once belonged to Field Marshal Zakhar Chernyshev.  Since 2007, restoration work has been carried out here. </p><p>  The official name of one of the most famous estates in the Lipetsk region is Skornyakovo-Arkhangelskoe.  The estate was built in the XVIII century.  The first owner was a man named Grigory Skornyakov-Pisarev.  Hence the name of the estate. </p><p>  Arkhangelsk in the Lipetsk region is an attraction of high historical significance.  Once the borders of the estate were expanded by order of Empress Elizabeth.  These lands were then owned by her relative.  In 1755, the estate passed to the brothers Grigory and Zakhar Chernyshev, who built a weaving factory and several utility rooms here. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century, a love correspondence between Catherine II and her favorite was discovered.  The find was found in a church located on the territory of one of the estates of the Lipetsk region.  Namely, in Skornyakovo-Arkhangelsk.  The favorite was Zakhar Chernyshev.  In 1837, the estate was transferred to his relative, Natalia Grigorievna.  And she, in turn, transferred all the rights to the estate to her husband, General Muravyov-Karsky.  The hero of the Patriotic War of 1812 spent many years on the estate and was actively engaged in its improvement.  Muravyov-Karsky was fond of archeology, with his assistance, ancient mounds were discovered near the estate in the sixties.  The general lived on the estate for 20 years.  He died in 1966.  He was buried in Zadonsk, on the territory of the Bogoroditsky monastery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before the revolution, the estate was owned by General Mikhail Shidlovsky.  In 1918 the estate was nationalized.  She became part of the state farm, for some time a shelter was located in its walls.  Restoration work is still underway.  In 2013, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel was consecrated, located on the territory of the estate complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Skornyakovo" class="if uuid-2683689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683689.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor of the Taldykin </h2><p>  In the Lipetsk region, several dozen ancient Russian estates were preserved.  But the estate of Taldykin, perhaps, is unlike any of them.  It is located in the Yelets district of the Lipetsk region.  The estate of Taldykin, according to experts, is unique.  There is nothing like this not only in the Lipetsk region, but throughout Russia.  Looking at the photo of the estate, it seems that it is located somewhere in Europe.  For example, in Switzerland. </p><p>  <span>This estate of the</span> Lipetsk region has many secrets.  The Taltykin couple was highly respected by the inhabitants of the environs.  However, the fate of the owners of the estate was tragic - they were killed, moreover, in their own estate. </p><p>  The estate is located in picturesque places in the middle of the Vorgolsky rocks.  Not only the main building has been preserved, but also the old mill.  The estate belonged to the merchant Taltykin, who in Yelets had several shops with fabrics, spices and tea.  The manor, which has long become one of the most interesting sights of the Lipetsk region, he built in 1868. The mill a year later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Taldykin and his wife did not live long in the estate.  They became a victim of robbers.  This crime shocked residents of nearby villages.  Taldykins were engaged in charity work and helped the poor. </p><p>  The whole merchant of Yelets mourned the death of his wife‚Äôs merchant.  After their death, they were considered almost righteous.  And here, of course, there were legends.  One of them says that having visited the grave of Taldykin, you can be healed from an incurable ailment. </p><p>  In the Soviet years, it was decided to put an end to all obscurantism.  The graves of the merchant were desecrated by his wife in order to stop the influx of pilgrims.  Later, their remains were moved to another place.  Where they are buried today is unknown. </p><p>  The estate was badly damaged during the years of World War II.  However, later small repairs were carried out here.  For some time the estate even housed a holiday home.  After the collapse of the USSR, the estate passed from one owner to another.  But a comprehensive restoration was never carried out. </p><p>  The estate, of course, has great tourism potential.  Nevertheless, it remains in desolation.  The estate needs a caring investor, but, according to another legend, only a good, disinterested person can become it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deadokey.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor taldykina lipetsk region" class="if uuid-2683684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683684.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor Polybino </h2><p>  This architectural monument is located in the Dankovsky district of the Lipetsk region.  Polybino Manor belonged to the Nechaev family, known at the beginning of the 19th century, patron noblemen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main building was erected at the end of the XVIII century.  It resembles an empire-style palace.  There is also the water tower of engineer Shukhov. </p><p>  Many important cultural events in Russia are associated with the estate.  Here at different times, outstanding writers and poets visited.  More than once, Leo Tolstoy also visited the estate.  Unfortunately, today the architectural complex is in poor condition.  In one of the wings, restoration work began not so long ago, but when they are completed, it is not known. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ljrate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polybino Manor" class="if uuid-2685214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2685214.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor Khvostova </h2><p>  Once on the map of the Lipetsk region was the village of Shatalovka.  According to 1862, 96 people lived in it.  At the end of the 19th century, the village was bought by the statesman Alexei Khvostov, and he built a huge manor complex here. </p><p>  In 1987, the village of Shatalovka was abolished.  However, Khvostov's estate was preserved.  Once upon a time there was a huge orchard on the estate.  Of course, nothing was left of the apple and cherry trees. </p><p>  After the revolution, like other estates in Russia, Khvostov‚Äôs house was nationalized.  There was a tuberculosis dispensary.  Repair work was not carried out.  But today, despite the desolation, there is something to see.  The estate is located a few kilometers from the city of Yelets. </p><h2>  Castle in Borki </h2><p>  The estate was built in the 19th century.  The name did not come about by accident.  This estate really resembles a medieval castle.  Despite the desolation, the size of the architectural structure is amazing. </p><p>  The main building was once surrounded by an English garden, but all the trees burned during the war.  Those that remained were cut down.  You cannot get into the castle now - restoration work is underway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alterroute.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle in Borki" class="if uuid-2683703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683703.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor in Trubetchino </h2><p>  The dilapidated estate is located in the Dobrovsky district.  The village arose in the second half of the XVII century on lands that belonged to the princes Trubetskoy.  Hence the name.  Since the end of the 17th century, the Vasilchikovs owned the village. </p><p>  On the territory of the manor complex is a church, which was built in 1831.  The refectory and the upper part of the bell tower were restored in 2008. The first residential building was erected 9 years after the completion of the temple.  Around this time, a sugar factory began to operate here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lipland.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of Trubetcino" class="if uuid-2683711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683711.jpg"></div><p>  The manor house was built at the end of the 19th century.  The plant stopped working only in 1917.  Then, after the revolution, the estate was looted, and residents of nearby villages did it. </p><p>  Most of the buildings are abandoned.  In addition to the manor house, here you can see the former barn for grain, household and residential buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alterroute.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Trubetchino" class="if uuid-2683704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683704.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor in Bykovo </h2><p>  The fate of this estate is similar to the fate of the attractions described above.  The estate in Bykovo was built at the end of the 19th century.  It existed, as you might guess, no more than 20 years.  In 1917, there was a revolution that inspired angry villagers in looting and arson. </p><p>  A dilapidated brick manor house is located in the Izmalkovsky district.  Next to it you can see the remains of an old mill. </p><h2>  Manor Kazakovo-Spasskoye </h2><p>  The construction of a three-story house, which was supposed to consist of more than one hundred rooms, began in 1900.  In addition to this building, the manor complex included an observation deck, a water tower, a coach and an orchard.  There was also a spring with a bathhouse in which the inhabitants of the estate took baths in the summer. </p><p>  After the revolution, the Bolsheviks failed to destroy the manor house.  It was built in good faith.  Several times they tried to blow up the building, as a result of which three people died. </p><h2>  The estate of the merchant Shelikhov </h2><p>  This attraction is in good condition.  The manor house is located in Lipetsk, at Frunze Street, house 1. Initially, this building was a merchant's meeting.  Later - trade pavilions. </p><p>  Near the house, which belonged to the merchant Shelekhov, on Frunze Street, there is another manor.  It was built in the 19th century.  Now in the building, which belonged to the merchant Zamyatin in the century before last, there is a philharmonic society. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rasfokus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Zamyatina" class="if uuid-2683926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2683926.jpg"></div><p>  The list of noble estates of the Lipetsk region includes one of the attractions of the Stanovlyansky district.  Namely, the Stakhovichi house, located 15 km from Yelets.  Throughout the 19th century, the building served as the residence of the leader of the local nobility. </p>
