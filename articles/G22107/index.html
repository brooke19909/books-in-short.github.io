Who lived in that era that people felt, dreamed about, how they lived and died?  Each time, visiting ancient cities and settlements, we are faced with a piece of an alien, long-gone era, after which there were houses, utensils, weapons, jewelry, works of art - all that survived for centuries and millennia by their owners. </p><p>  The White Mosque (Bulgar) is a very young architectural monument, but it incorporates the whole culture of the ancient Bulgarian Khanate, which was once so great that it could repulse the Golden Horde. </p><h2>  Bulgarian kingdom </h2><p>  For the first time, Bulgarians are mentioned in the annals of Byzantine sources of the 2nd century, but already in the 4th century they are spoken of as a large union of tribes settled on the eastern coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and the Black Sea. </p><p>  Some of them fell under the influence of the Khazars and left towards the Volga, where they remained in the 10th century, forming the Bulgarian kingdom.  It occupied a huge territory at that time: Kama, the Middle Volga, the Belaya River and the lands along the Ural River. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, the population grew, the influence of the neighbors of the Turks left typos on religion, and people converted to Islam.  Of the cities, the largest was the city of Bulgar, which became the capital of the kingdom.  In the 11th century, 10,000 people lived in it, which at that time was considered a huge city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reason for the fall of the Bulgarian kingdom was the offense inflicted on the Golden Horde.  This happened when the Bulgarian tried to take Genghis Khan with his army, but was defeated, during which 4,000 of his soldiers were captured.  They were not killed or made slaves, but simply exchanged each soldier for one ram, thereby showing who they consider the Tatar-Mongol army. </p><p>  Genghis Khan died, but a mortal resentment remained.  The Bulgars succeeded in revenge only in 1236, when the soldiers of the Golden Horde simply swept the city, destroying its inhabitants from small to large.  You can learn about those events by visiting the open-air museum in the city of Bolgar. </p><h2>  Ancient city </h2><p>  Founded in the 10th century, the capital of the Bulgarian kingdom is located in Tatarstan today, and you can get acquainted with its history by taking a tour from Kazan.  The built White Mosque (Bulgar) is located opposite the old settlement as a symbol of the resurrection of the great khanate from the ashes of time.  After all, a thousand years ago there was a prosperous settlement, where houses and mosques, palaces and fortresses were built, some of which have survived to this day.  Crafts developed in the city and trade was briskly going on, and by the 14th century up to 50,000 people lived here.  Archaeologists have revealed that during this period in the kingdom there were up to 2,000 settlements and 150 cities. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Volga Bulgaria</span> conducted trade with China, Central Asia, Russia and Byzantium, and its products from bronze and silver, fur and leather were well known all over the world.

    <p>  All the monuments are well preserved, and today you can take a step into the present right from the past: the White Mosque (Bolgar) is located on the southern side of the settlement.  Address: Tatarstan, st.  Working.  All people can visit it, regardless of religious beliefs. </p><h2>  The construction of the White Mosque </h2><p>  The White Mosque (Tatarstan) is an example of the culture characteristic of the ancient city.  Looking at this unusually beautiful and airy building, you can imagine what the capital of the great kingdom looked like.  The mosque was built by architect Sergei Shakurov, who previously studied the best Islamic architectural monuments in different countries. </p>

    <p>  The construction of the complex began in 2010 and became one of the projects for the revival of the ancient city of Bolgar.  It took 1200 tons of white marble to decorate the already constructed mosque and the buildings surrounding it, which gave it an unusually light and solemn appearance. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  As a result, the White Mosque (Bolgar) became a real complex consisting of a prayer hall, two minarets, a madrasah and a mufti residence located on a large prayer square.  Around it is a beautiful arcade and a young orchard.  The whole complex, along with floating clouds during the day and stars at night, is reflected in a large artificial reservoir with a fountain, which gives it some resemblance to the famous Taj Mahal mausoleum. </p>

    <p>  Minarets reach a height of 46.6 m, the diameter of the main dome is 10 m, its height inside the mosque is 17 meters.  Outside, the building is traditionally decorated with arabesques, tulips and geometric shapes.  The internal painting contains excerpts from the holy book of Muslims. </p><p>  In honor of the opening of a new mosque and the revival of the ancient city, the White Mosque (Bulgar) received as a gift the world's largest copy of the Koran weighing 800 kg.  To load it, it took the efforts of 16 people, and you can flip it only by putting on gloves. </p><h2>  City of Bolgar, White Mosque: how to get </h2><p>  Nowadays, the tourist route to the city of Bolgar is becoming popular.  The White Mosque can be reached on the Volga by river tram from the river port of Kazan, either by car or bus. </p><p>  The old settlement is of no less interest to people - the remains of the ancient capital of the Bulgar dating from 10-14 centuries. </p><p>  The White Mosque is the crown of the city, but it should be remembered that this is not just a monument of architecture, but an existing religious institution, so local rules must be observed: </p><ul><li>  Shoes should be removed and left at the entrance, and shoe covers put on feet. </li><li>  Women should cover their heads with a scarf and cover their shoulders if they are open. </li><li>  For women there is a special place for prayers at the top of the mosque for a carved parapet. </li></ul><p>  Never <span>insult the feelings of believers by</span> looking at and discussing a mosque during prayer.  Better come back later and consider everything carefully, without disturbing anyone. </p>
