At the moment, it is used as a tourist gathering point.  It brings enormous income to the district budget.  Let's talk about this building in more detail. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The castle was built in the fourteenth century on the site of old ruins.  Initially, in the twelfth century, to protect the approaches to the region, an ordinary fortress was erected.  It was she who could carry out the defense, but after her looting only the basements remained.  After this, the castle is bought by Pieophone from Kierzi.  This genus owned it until the death of its main leader.  After this event, in order to save the region from civil wars, the building passed under the control of Philip Augustus.  It is important that the transfer meant the transfer of the castle and the region from private hands to public use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snoy.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle top view" class="if uuid-2836791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836791.jpg"></div><p>  This approach made it possible, first of all, to choose a new governor who could use the Pierrefon Castle for his own purposes, simultaneously helping the crown and completing its tasks.  In 1392, receiving a castle as a gift, Louis of Orleans introduces the region to the county of Valois.  After that, due to the expansion of the final territory, the community becomes a duchy.  In 1617, the history of the castle of Pierrefonds could come to an end.  The party of dissatisfied, which was not satisfied with the actions of the authorities, decides to take extreme measures.  To protect France from a popular uprising, Cardinal Richelieu with his troops attacks the castle and inflicts significant damage.  There was a plan to demolish the entire structure, but since it would take a lot of resources to do this, it was decided to simply destroy the roof and break the partitions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The castle is a great example of the early Middle Ages.  When there was no clear style, buildings were erected, guided exclusively by a practical point of view.  Such structures had a formidable appearance and clearly calibrated geometric lines.  Moreover, in each castle there was an evacuation system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peccadille.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the towers" class="if uuid-2836799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836799.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of underground tunnels and their use as treatment facilities - this was a separate column in the ability to properly implement resources.  Architects spent less time planning exterior decoration.  The tunnels, like all basements, were built with high quality.  For this reason, it was almost impossible to simply destroy them. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  People almost forgot about Pierrefonds castle, but history decided to do otherwise.  A general wave of romanticism began, when the fascination with antiquity was perceived as another stage in understanding the problem.  This approach has allowed many famous personalities to show their works to the world.  Romanticism entered a new stage of perception, so much so that Napoleon decided to restore Pierrefonds castle.  The reconstruction of the building began under the scrutiny of the architect Viollet-le-Duc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the courtyard of the castle" class="if uuid-2836803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836803.jpg"></div><p>  However, many contemporaries condemned this approach.  The reason was simple: the master only tried to realize his own ideas, not following the way the castle looked from the beginning.  This style of building construction was interesting to many, but it did not preserve the true appearance of the castle.  So many people did not understand why the castle of Pierrefon was losing its splendor, the description of the buildings before and after the restoration differed significantly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.poussinvoyageur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior decoration" class="if uuid-2836821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836821.jpg"></div><p>  Now, in the twenty-first century, restoration takes place once every ten years.  It is fully sponsored by the Valois region, the authorities provide the necessary funds, allocating them from the budget fund. </p><h2>  Reaction in the world </h2><p>  Thanks to many buildings of the Middle Ages, including the castle of Pierrefonds, France is in first place in terms of the number of objects of this historical period.  The rich historical heritage helps to attract more new tourists to the region.  They are ready not only to follow its development, but also to sponsor the construction of new infrastructure items along the way.  Many archaeological missions set off for this land with an empty goal: excavations, during which sometimes surprising facts are discovered.  For this reason, the land around the castle of Pierrefonds is partially fenced.  The castle itself at the time of excavation is closed for tourist visits. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Sightseeing tours to France - the main income of many provinces.  The main goal is to attract the maximum number of tourists.  The region exists thanks to the investments of visiting guests who are ready to sponsor the lives of ordinary residents of the province.  Tours to France from Moscow can be purchased from several authorized distributors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.we-explore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourism in France" class="if uuid-2836826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836826.jpg"></div><p>  The main directions depend on the seasons.  You can buy a trip to both Paris and the provinces.  For example, Bordeaux, Provence, Normandy, Champagne.  The main thing is to accurately formulate what you want and how much you have.  If the trip to the castle of Pierrefonds is not included in the main route, you will need to pay extra money. </p><h2>  Local attitude </h2><p>  Many indigenous people are unhappy that their land has become a tourist destination.  It turned out that the decision was rejected by local authorities for a very long time.  And only after the official decree of the <span>French government,</span> with the personal participation of the Minister of the Interior, did the transformation of France begin.  The main emphasis was on replacing old tourist destinations with new ones that the public might like.  Although the decision was made, it is still not liked by some residents of the region.  And even if we take into account that most jobs are created only thanks to the tourism business, this news has little effect on the real situation.  Although many families are happy to welcome tourists in their home.  This is a great chance to save on a hotel (homestays are cheaper), you can immerse yourself in the local atmosphere and learn the language. </p><h2>  Sights of the region </h2><p>  Sightseeing tours to France are the only way to see most of the medieval castles, which are under the protection of UNESCO.  Near Pierrefound is another province - Languedoc.  This is a historical region of the country with the main city of Toulouse.  Small provincial towns are famous for the preserved monuments of Gallo-Roman culture: aqueducts, amphitheaters, triumphal arches and temples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.messortiesculture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montsegur Fortress" class="if uuid-2836782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836782.jpg"></div><p>  A popular fortress is Montsegur.  This is the place where one of the most dramatic episodes of French history took place.  A little more than fifty people (knights and ordinary soldiers) held the defense for almost a year.  After the fortress fell, and the Qatari nuns and monks were burned in a field near its walls. </p><p>  Many tourists go to take a look at this memorable place and magnificent structure.  It is worth noting that the income received from this almost entirely goes to the restoration of castles.  The tourist tax "settles" in the regions, thanks to this approach, it is possible to distribute finances in such a way as to restore new objects and monetize them in the future. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to get from Paris to the castle of Pierrefonne as quickly as possible?  The answer is simple.  It is required to buy a ticket for a city train heading north.  The final station you need is called the complex.  Nearby, within walking distance, you can find hotels. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="49.346975" data-lng="2.9801830999999765" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/1/0/2/9102.png"></div><p>  As a rule, these are small houses, the owners of which rent apartments for tourists by the day. </p><ul><li>  You can buy a tour by traveling from the Russian Federation or from other countries.  Tours to France from Moscow are a popular destination, departures are made weekly.  Travel companies take a break in the winter, because at this time the French do not accept guests due to the huge number of consecutive holidays. </li><li>  In the case of travel planning without the help of third-party agencies, it is better to immediately choose a path not through the center of France - Paris.  Get to the province through the surrounding areas.  As a rule, it is better to choose the path through Europe, by train or private car.  Otherwise, everything depends on preferences. </li></ul><h2>  Trip price </h2><p>  If you buy a tour, then its cost will depend on several factors.  Firstly, from the popularity of the destination.  Secondly, the number of days (whether you are going on vacation or only on weekends).  Thirdly, from additional options: food, room category and more.  Additional costs (already in place) are usually associated with the purchase of food, souvenirs, visiting attractions, buying excursions, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="French Airplane" class="if uuid-2836834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2836834.jpg"></div><p>  If you get on your own, the trip budget will probably be even less.  However, one should choose not the hot season, when tickets will cost significantly more, but low.  In this case, a great chance to save up to 40%.  Hotel accommodation and food are the main expenses for such a trip.  The French authorities do not allow living in campsites, however, having your own car, you can spend the night in it. </p>
