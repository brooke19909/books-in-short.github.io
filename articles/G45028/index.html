    <p>  If you intend to buy a mid-range SLR camera and you are offered to try out <span>the fastest,</span> lightest or apparatus with the largest viewfinder screen, then the outstanding qualities of the proposed sample can at least be checked and evaluated objectively.  But what if the camera is average in all respects, something is slightly better than that of competitors, something is slightly worse, but in terms of consumer qualities it is almost a complete analogue of the devices already available on the market?  In this case, the assessment will always bear the mark of subjectivity, some will characterize the camera as good and consider such an investment worthy, while others may begin to list existing or imaginary shortcomings and, in conclusion, put the camera ‚Äúunsuccessfully‚Äù.  Nevertheless, let‚Äôs try to figure out a new product in the middle segment from Nikon - the Nikon d5100 camera, which replaced the obsolete d5000. </p><p>  The main characteristics of this camera sound promising: sixteen megapixels, an ISO value of up to 6400, a 3-inch viewfinder display, shooting in video mode with quality up to 1080p.  The design also underwent changes, the camera became rounded and slightly decreased in linear dimensions.  The new Expeed 2 video processor is used in the DSLR (the first Expeed was used in the d5100). </p><p>  The <span>Nikon</span> d5100 <span>camera</span> , reviews about it, by the way, have already appeared on the network, we can state the presence of a complete "gentleman's set" of features that are in all cameras of the average amateur level.  <span>Including 7</span> preset shooting modes.  Focusing is carried out at eleven points, there is the possibility of a single-frame and tracking focus.  During serial shooting, Nikon d5100 is capable of taking up to 4 pictures per second.  It has two dust removal systems, a flash built into the body, there are USB and HDMI connectors, an input for an external microphone, a diopter insert on the viewfinder.  A rotatable and rotatable display adds convenience when taking photos and videos. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And also, reading reviews of Nikon d5100 cameras, one can often find opinions that this camera fits very conveniently in your hands, its buttons are extremely thoughtful and it‚Äôs not difficult to get any of them with one hand.  Also, many note the rather low weight of this DSLR - 565 grams (without a lens), a rubberized coating on the case and a long life from one set of batteries. </p><p>  But there are also drawbacks in the device, the white balance of the Nikon d5100 in the machine sometimes behaves, to put it mildly, strange, leading the picture to either yellowness or cyanosis.  It‚Äôs good that this is rare.  It is gratifying that of the notable problems besides this, no others have been identified so far. </p><p>  The standard AF-S 18-55 <span>whale lens</span> with plastic mount and optical stabilizer is surprisingly very good.  Unlike most competitors, for which the standard lens is just a small and short step, which the user is recommended to quickly ‚Äústep over‚Äù when buying more expensive models, the manufacturer did not leave 18-55 unattended.  The sharpness of the baby at a decent level, in macro mode, photos are obtained if not excellent - then for sure and not "sloppy." </p><p>  And for those who are not stingy with acquiring a 70-300 mm lens for their Nikon d5100, the focusing speed and a significant increase in the maximum distance for shooting will be a pleasant surprise.  The speed and clarity of the autofocus drive integrated into the lens is amazing, for example, you can easily photograph a low-flying plane.  Stabilization is also at a high level, and there are two modes, active and normal, there are not enough stabilizer stars from heaven, but sometimes it helps a lot. </p><p>  If the automation does not work for you, you can correct it with the manual focus ring.  I also want to note the very high-quality covers of both the standard and the telephoto lens, they hold very well and are easily removed. </p>
