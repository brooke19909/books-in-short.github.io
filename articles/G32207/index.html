At that time, only Russia and England continued to maintain independence from all European countries.  Napoleon was particularly irritated with the Russian state, which continued to oppose the expansion of its aggression and systematically violate the <span>continental blockade.</span> </p><p>  Entering the confrontation with the French, Russia acted as an intercessor of the monarchical states of Europe. </p><p>  Been preparing for war since 1810.  Russia and France understood that military action was inevitable. </p><p>  The French emperor brought troops into the <span>duchy of Warsaw,</span> creating armament depots there.  Russia felt threatened and began to increase the size of the army in the western provinces. </p><p>  The Patriotic War of 1812 began with the invasion of Napoleon on June 12.  The 600,000th French army crossed the Neman. </p><p>  Along with this, the Russian government developed a plan to confront the invaders.  Created by the <span>Prussian military</span> theorist Ful.  According to the plan, the entire Russian army was made up of three parts.  Bagration, Tormasov, Barclay de Tolly were chosen as commanders.  According to Ful, the Russian troops were supposed to retreat to their fortified positions systematically and, united, to repulse the onslaught of the French.  However, the Patriotic War of 1812 began to develop in a different way.  The Russian army was retreating, and Napoleon was approaching Moscow.  Despite the resistance of the Russians, the French soon found themselves near the capital. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The situation, which began to take shape, required immediate action.  The post of commander of the Russian troops on August 20 took Kutuzov. </p><p>  The general battle took place on August 26 near the village of <span>Borodino (Battle of Borodino</span> ).  This battle was the most bloody one-day battle in the history of the country.  There was no winner in this battle.  But there were no losers either.  However, assessing the situation, Kutuzov after the battle decides to retreat.  It was decided to give Moscow without a fight.  All the inhabitants were withdrawn from the capital, and the city itself was burned. </p><p>  On September 2, Napoleonic soldiers entered Moscow.  The French commander assumed that the Muscovites would bring him the keys to the city.  But the city was burned, all the barns with ammunition and provisions burned down. </p><p>  Napoleon did not know what to do next.  Discipline began to loosen in the army, soldiers began to get drunk.  Until October 7, the French army was <span>in Moscow.</span>  <span>Napoleon</span> decides to retreat south into territories not ravaged by war. </p><p>  The next battle took place near Maloyaroslavets.  Fierce battles were fought, during which the French army wavered.  Napoleon had to retreat on the same road along which he had come (along Staraya Smolenskaya). </p><p>  The following battles took place near Krasnoye, Vyazma, near the crossing of the Berezina.  The Russian army drove the French from their land.  Thus, the Napoleonic invasion of Russia ended. </p><p>  The Patriotic War of 1812 ended on December 23, about which Alexander 1 signed a manifesto.  However, the Napoleonic campaign continued.  Battles were fought until 1814. </p><p>  <strong>World War 1812. Results</strong> </p><p>  Military action at that time became <span>an important historical event in</span> Russia.  This war caused a surge in the national consciousness of the Russian people.  Absolutely the entire population participated in the battle with Napoleon, regardless of age. </p><p>  The victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 confirmed Russian heroism and courage.  This battle gave the stories of great people: Kutuzov, Raevsky, Bagration, Tormasov and other <span>Russian commanders,</span> whose names are forever in history.  The war with the Napoleonic army was the clearest example of the self-sacrifice of the people in the name of saving their homeland. </p>
