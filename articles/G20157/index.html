    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  This time, the manufacturer offered customers a full-fledged transformer that can change its shape into a laptop.  Its design is made in the usual for Lenovo concepts.  The keyboard and stylus differ from the main matte black case in their red color.  All this corresponds to the elegant appearance familiar to the company's products.  The combination of red and black is also found in the logo, where the letter I stands out against the general background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lenovo thinkpad tablet 2 has all the necessary connectors for connecting third-party devices.  For example, this is an HDMI output for sharing a monitor and streaming data.  On the left side of the device, you can find the unlock and power button.  There is also a headphone jack, as well as a volume control.  In addition, we should not forget about the slots for microSD cards, as well as SIM cards with 3G and 4G Internet.  They are followed by a port for USB wires and data transfer to other devices.  The rear panel of the device is equipped with a stereo speaker and the already mentioned 8 megapixel camera. </p><p>  Particularly noteworthy is the solution with which the developers were able to fit all the necessary details in a small case.  It will be easy for the buyer to navigate the new product from the very first day of operation. </p>

    <h2>  Additional keyboard </h2><p>  Most often, future users doubt whether to purchase an additional Bluetooth keyboard.  Such an addition will cost a considerable amount and at the same time will not change the technical characteristics of the devices.  Here the buyer decides, focusing on his own taste and habits. </p><p>  True, you need to warn: such an additive will noticeably reduce the charging capacity.  She will be depleted faster.  The additional keyboard is made of the same plastic as the main body.  Therefore, it looks organic with its main unit.  The keys on it are designed by the best designers and work well with your fingers.  The size of the add-on is very small, so the buttons will be unusually small for many users.  However, this is a matter of habit, and if you develop a skill, it will be even more convenient.  There is practically no free space on the keyboard; it is occupied by keys.  Therefore, if you are used to the fact that your hands are directly on the front panel, you will have to wean it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This is a separate reason for the pride of Lenovo developers.  Indeed, a 10-inch screen makes it possible to watch video in HD format and with a resolution of 1320 pixels.  In addition, the display is equipped with an IPS class panel.  She has wide viewing angles with their distinct black color. </p><p>  Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 64gb 3G does not have glare on the screen even in the brightest weather.  The Windows operating system is known for its versatility.  However, before this resource could not be used on tablets due to screen limitations.  Now multitouch supports five touches at the same time, which makes it possible to work with the system much faster and open several applications at once.  So this device will be the best purchase for those who regularly use the tablet as a work tool and personal item. </p><p>  You can also interact with the screen using the stylus.  This tool for Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 Windows 10 allows you to activate many additional features.  For example, with its help it is easy to take a full-screen screenshot. </p>

    <h2>  Windows </h2><p>  Buyers' activity suggests that Lenovo thinkpad tablet 2 slim case became popular just because of the appearance of this operating system.  The developers did everything in order to maximize the Microsoft product on the device.  Therefore, users will be pleasantly surprised by the increased performance compared to the previous tablet model. </p><p>  When experts proposed a tiled interface for the next version of the operating system, they, of course, were largely guided by the interests of owners of touch screens.  Such an interface is much more convenient and effective when interacting with your fingers, rather than the mouse cursor. </p><p>  Now a few words about the data processing speed on this tablet.  It is not inferior to its main competitors, although it does not bounce them several times, as a segment leader could do.  Nevertheless, the performance is quite satisfactory.  Installing medium-sized programs like browsers takes about five minutes. </p><p>  In addition, there are no complications with multitasking, which the very first tablets could not cope with.  Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 w3bsit3-dns.com allows you not to waste your time waiting for the next process to load.  Although it should be borne in mind that at the moment when the physical memory is running out, it will begin to hitch with performance due to a lack of internal resource that is spent on creating a buffer. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the new Lenovo product embodies all the advantages of a personal computer with a dynamic operating system.  At the same time, the device is compact and ergonomic in operation. </p>

    <h2>  Factory Applications </h2><p>  Unlike many competitors, Lenovo has not flooded the tablet with endless applications of its production, which cause only annoyance and annoyance of users.  However, something is still present.  First of all, it is an antivirus, however, it can be replaced at any time with another analog or completely removed.  On the other hand, Lenovo installs a useful Skype by default, which will be needed by almost everyone. </p><h2>  Sound and camera </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the format of any tablet does not allow you to install high-quality speakers on it.  However, against the background of its analogues, Lenovo looks and sounds quite worthy.  In addition, everyone can connect their favorite headphones. </p><p>  For example, for video conferencing or watching videos on YouTube, this level is quite acceptable.  The design includes additional protection modules so that the user's ears do not suffer from noise, especially if the signal goes through the 3.5 mm port. </p><p>  The rear 8-megapixel camera has a high-quality LED flash.  Shooting video can achieve 1080p quality.  If you use this device correctly and do not shake hands, the frames will be clear and legible.  By and large, there was not presented anything new compared to previous models from Lenovo. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The combination of the Atom processor and Windows 8 allows the tablet to work without interruption for 10 hours.  Of course, these are the initial characteristics that will decrease over time. </p><p>  In addition, the duration of the work depends on the processes on the tablet.  For example, when watching videos or using photo editors and other large programs, the battery will drain much faster.  In addition, it is consumed more intensively when several applications are opened in parallel.  In any case, this Lenovo model has the most impressive performance among similar models with Windows 8 as the installed operating system. </p><p>  In order to save charge more efficiently, you can work on the tablet in a special mode.  With it, the screen brightness and power consumption are reduced, which makes it possible to use the device longer. </p>
