One of the areas of customization is the installation of high-quality car speakers.  Often, the amplifier built into the radio is not enough to confidently ‚Äúswing‚Äù powerful speakers.  In this case, you have to install a separate external amplifier unit.  This review is dedicated to just such equipment - the fairly well-known Pioneer GM-D1004.  This amplifier is appreciated by many lovers of quality sound due to its pleasant sound and ease of installation.  After reviewing the main characteristics, as well as reviews of real users, we can conclude regarding the advisability of acquiring this device in your car. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  First of all, before installing such an amplifier, you should think about how high-quality the head unit is in the car.  If the sound source produces a bad, poor in frequency signal, the amplifier will not be able to truly show its capabilities.  That is why it is recommended to use processor radios of the same brand with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer gm d1004" class="if uuid-3069159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/3069159.jpg"></div><p>  The second requirement is the presence of powerful acoustics with a good frequency range.  If standard speakers are installed, then an amplifier built into the radio will be enough for them.  If the acoustics are powerful, but unbalanced, then the sound will result in a flat and unpleasant, devoid of saturation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, we can conclude that the Pioneer GM-D1004 amplifier is designed for installation in cars that are already equipped with a high-quality sound source and a good speaker system of the required power. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Up to four speakers can be connected to this amplifier unit at the same time, each of which will have a power of not more than 100 watts and a resistance of 2 or 4 Ohms.  It can work in bridge mode.  In this case, it is possible to connect to the Pioneer GM-D1004 standard stereo system of two 4-ohm speakers with a capacity of not more than 200 watts each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinecarstereo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustics pioneer gm d1004" class="if uuid-3069158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/3069158.jpg"></div><p>  Classic RCA connectors are provided for input signal.  This suggests that not only a radio tape recorder, but also any other device having a linear sound output can be used as a sound source. </p><p>  Frequency response is very inspiring.  The Pioneer GM-D1004 amplifier is capable of reproducing frequencies in the range from 10 Hz to 40 kHz, which completely covers the entire frequency range heard by the human ear.  At the same time, the distortion coefficient is less than 0.05 units, that is, it is practically equal to zero.  Noise is expressed only in a small hiss of the speakers in standby mode, which is completely invisible during the playback of music tracks.  The maximum current consumption corresponds to the characteristics of the Pioneer GM-D1004 auto amplifier relative to the maximum power of the amplifier and is equal to 15 A. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pccomponentes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer gm d1004 reviews" class="if uuid-3069162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/3069162.jpg"></div><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The first distinguishing feature of this amplifier can be called its very compact size.  Its sides are 181 x 38 x 64 mm.  To visualize these dimensions, it is enough to recall the usual building brick.  The amplifier is approximately half the width.  This will allow you to mount the device almost anywhere under the car panel. </p><p>  The second nice feature is the presence of an input sensor.  The amplifier does not need to be turned on and off separately; it is independently activated if a sound signal is detected at the input.  Thus, it is perfect for flush mounting, since access to it during operation is not required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pccomponentes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car amplifier pioneer gm specifications" class="if uuid-3069160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/3069160.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive gadget reviews </h2><p>  In order to clearly understand the characteristics presented in the article, you can read reviews on the Pioneer GM-D1004.  Many of them note the following positive aspects of the apparatus: </p><ul><li>  The ability to connect an amplifier using a standard bus without making changes to the wiring.  This allows you to install it in cars without violating the terms of warranty service. </li><li>  Minimalistic design.  The amplifier is very compact and has no controls, which allows you to covertly install it in any suitable niche under the panel. </li><li>  Actual declared power.  The characteristics of the amplifier are not overestimated, and even at maximum load the sound is not distorted, which indicates a sufficient supply of unused resources. </li><li>  Improving the sound signal.  Built-in basic acoustic filters Pioneer GM-D1004 are able to smooth out some of the disadvantages of the frequency balance that may occur at the level of the sound source. </li><li>  Well thought out cooling.  Due to the fact that the elements are located as rationally as possible, the amplifier does not overheat even during prolonged continuous operation in the conditions of summer heat.  This feature can be useful for those who like to listen to music while camping. </li></ul><h2>  The negative sides of the amplifier </h2><p>  Despite a pretty good list of positive aspects, users were able to find some disadvantages.  The main one is called the difference in power between the amplifier of a standard head unit and an external unit is only two times.  Thus, in some cases, its installation may be impractical. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tw.bid.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer gm d1004 with packaging" class="if uuid-3069161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/3069161.jpg"></div><p>  Another negative feature, some consider the lack of a built-in equalizer, which could be customized for your speaker system.  However, if desired, the desired effect can be achieved by adjusting the head unit.  That is why the installation of a processor radio with fine-tuning the output signal is a priority. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The presented amplifier is perfect for those who want to get high-quality sound of their favorite tracks in the car, but do not want to interfere too much with the wiring.  Connecting the Pioneer GM-D1004 can be done using the classic ISO-connector without soldering wires and other complex manipulations.  The compact size will allow you to find a place for it even in a small car, and the ability to connect any devices can generally save you from installing a radio, replacing it with a smartphone with a high-quality audio path or a good player. </p>
