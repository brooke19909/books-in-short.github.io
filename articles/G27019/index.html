    <p>  Tourists note that the hotel area is very small, there‚Äôs not much to go.  The hotel rooms are quite good for economy class, with working plumbing and normal furniture.  You can enjoy sea or mountain views from the apartment.  The rooms on the ground floors do not have balconies, but open terraces with access to the pool.  Maids clean rooms daily, some vacationers advise to tip (one dollar) to improve the quality of the process, but this is not necessary. </p><p>  It is very convenient that in the hotel, as in all of Kemer, almost all the staff speak and understand Russian, so there is no language barrier.  Reception workers move guests very quickly.  The vast majority of vacationers are Iranians or the Turks themselves, so evening programs are more focused on them. </p><p>  As for food, then, according to tourists, it is very tasty.  Of course, some guests lack a variety of dishes, but in general, the food meets the four-star status of the hotel.  Breakfast includes fritters, sausages, eggs, cereals, preserves, cheeses, sausages, toasts, vegetables and drinks.  In general, a standard set for a continental breakfast. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner on the table there is: lamb, potatoes, pastries, chicken, fish, rice, vegetables, pasta, broccoli, salads and much more.  Indispensable guests of the buffet are delicious desserts and fruits.  Alcohol in the restaurant and bar is free, but this only applies to locally produced drinks.  Foreign brands are paid.  A similar practice exists now in almost all Turkish complexes. </p><p>  Tourists also note that the hotel's beach is a five-minute walk away.  It is not big and there are not enough umbrellas with sunbeds for everyone, especially in the season when the hotel is crowded with vacationers.  On the beach there is a mixture of sand and pebbles; entering the sea is very convenient and gentle.  Pebbles at the bottom does not interfere at all.  But the sea is incredibly clean and transparent.  There are many attractions on the coast: scooters, parachutes, fishing and much more. </p>
