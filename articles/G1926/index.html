Defense of the Pavlov House</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, every tourist, having arrived in Volgograd, seeks to feel all the pain and courage of the Russian people during the Great Patriotic War.  To do this, he goes to Mamaev Kurgan, where all emotions are embodied in wonderful sculptures.  Few people know that, in addition to the mound, there are also historical monuments <span>in Volgograd</span> .  One of the more significant is Pavlov‚Äôs house. </p><p>  Pavlov‚Äôs house in Stalingrad played an important role during the counterattacks of the German troops.  Thanks to the stamina of the Russian soldiers, the enemy troops were rebuffed, and Stalingrad was not captured.  You can learn about the experienced horror even now, having examined the preserved wall of the destroyed house. </p><h2>  Pavlov's house in Stalingrad and its history before the war </h2><p>  Before the war, Pavlov‚Äôs house was an ordinary building with not all ordinary reputation.  So, party and industrial workers lived in a four-story building.  The house, located on Penzenskaya street, at number 61, was considered prestigious before the war.  He was surrounded by numerous elite buildings in which NKVD officers and signalmen lived.  Noteworthy is the location of the building. </p><p>  Behind the building, the 1903 <span>Gerhardt Mill</span> was built.  After 30 meters was the twin house of Zabolotny.  Both the mill and Zabolotny‚Äôs house were almost destroyed during the war.  Nobody was engaged in restoration of buildings. </p>

    <h2>  Defense of Pavlov‚Äôs house in Stalingrad </h2><p>  During the battle of Stalingrad, each residential building became a defensive fortress from which hostilities were fought.  On January 9, all buildings were destroyed.  There is only one surviving building.  09/27/1942, an intelligence group consisting of 4 people, headed by Y. F. Pavlov, having knocked out the Germans from a four-story residential building, began to hold defense in it.  Having penetrated the building, the group found civilians there who were trying by all means to keep the house for about two days.  The defense continued with a small detachment for three days, after reinforcements arrived.  It was a machine-gun platoon under the command of I.F. Afanasyev, machine gunners and armor-piercers.  The total number of arrivals for help was 24 people.  Together, the soldiers strengthened the defense of the entire building.  The sappers mined all approaches to the construction.  And also a trench was dug through which negotiations were conducted with the command, and food was delivered with ammunition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pavlov's house in Stalingrad held out defense for almost 2 months.  The location of the building helped the soldiers.  A huge panorama was visible from the upper floors, and Russian soldiers could keep under fire parts of the city captured by German troops with a range of over 1 kilometer. </p><p>  All two months the Germans strenuously attacked the building.  They made several counterattacks per day and even several times broke through to the first floor.  During such battles, one wall of the building was destroyed.  The Soviet troops held the defense strongly and courageously, so the opponents could not capture the entire house. </p><p>  On November 24, 1942, under the command of I.I. Naumov, the battalion attacked the enemy, capturing nearby houses.  <span>I.I. Naumov</span> died.  I.F. Afanasyev and Y. F. Pavlov received only wounds.  Civilians who were in the basement of the house did not suffer for all two months. </p>

    <h2>  Restoration of Pavlov‚Äôs house </h2><p>  Pavlov‚Äôs house in Stalingrad began to be restored the very first.  In June 1943, A.M. Cherkasova brought the wives of the soldiers to the ruins with her.  And so the "Cherkasov movement" arose, which included exclusively women.  The emerging movement found response in other liberated territories.  Destroyed cities began to be rebuilt by volunteers in their free time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  January 9 area was renamed.  The new name is Defense Square.  New houses were built on the territory and surrounded by a semicircular colonnade.  The project was led by architect E.I. Fialko. </p><p>  In 1960, the area was renamed again.  Now this is Lenin Square.  And from the end wall, sculptors A.V. Golovanov and P.L. Malkov built a memorial in 1965, which has been preserved to this day and adorns the city of Volgograd. </p><p>  By 1985, Pavlov‚Äôs house was rebuilt.  From the end of the building facing Sovetskaya Street, the architect V.E. Maslyaev and the sculptor V.G. Fetisov installed a memorial with an inscription reminiscent of the feat of Soviet soldiers in those days when they fought for every brick of this house. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The great struggle was between the Soviet soldiers and the German invaders for Stalingrad, the house of Pavlov.  History has preserved many unique and interesting documents telling about the actions of the enemy and our multinational defenders of the Fatherland and leaving some questions still open.  So, for example, they still argue whether the Germans were a reconnaissance group during the capture of the building.  I.F. Afanasyev claims that there were no opponents, but, according to the official version, the Germans were in the second entrance, or rather, there was an easel machine gun near the window. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also disputes about the evacuation of civilians.  Some historians claim that people continued to be in the basement all the time during the defense.  According to other sources, the residents immediately after the death of the foreman, who brought food, managed to withdraw through the dug trenches. </p><p>  When the Germans demolished one of the walls, Y. F. Pavlov reported a joke to the commander.  He said that the house remained ordinary, with only three walls, and most importantly, ventilation has now appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Defenders of Pavlov‚Äôs House </h2><p>  Pavlov‚Äôs house in Stalingrad was defended by 24 people.  But, as I.F. Afanasyev claims in his memoirs, at the same time no more than 15 people held the defense.  At first, the defenders of the Pavlov‚Äôs house in Stalingrad are just 4 people: Pavlov, Glushchenko, Chernogolov, Aleksandrov. </p><p>  Then the team received reinforcements.  The accepted fixed number of defenders is 24 people.  But, according to the same recollections of Afanasyev, there were a little more of them. </p><p>  The team consisted of fighters of 9 nationalities.  The 25th defender was Gor Khokhlov.  He was a native of Kalmykia.  True, after the battle he was removed from the list.  After 62 years, the participation and courage of the soldier in the defense of Pavlov‚Äôs house was confirmed. </p><p>  Also, the list of ‚Äúcrossed out‚Äù is supplemented by Abkhazian Alexey Sukba.  In 1944, for unknown reasons, a soldier fell into this team.  Therefore, his surname is not immortalized on the panel of the memorial. </p><h2>  Biography of Yakov Fedotovich Pavlov </h2>
