  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to disable flight mode: a description of the most effective methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very often, phone owners are faced with such a problem as turning off flight mode.  It would seem that this could be complicated, because somehow the same person turned on this mode?  But not so simple.  Sometimes it happens that this mode is activated independently or accidentally, and it can also be turned on by a child inadvertently - anything happens.  So, to help those who are faced with such a problem, today we will talk about several simple and effective ways to turn off airplane mode. </p><h2>  The easiest way </h2><div class="photo" data-original="motorola-phone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turn off mode" class="if uuid-2540689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2540689.jpg"></div><p>  First, it‚Äôs the easiest way to turn off flight mode - use the icon in the status bar or the so-called curtain.  Surely everyone saw her when they lowered the curtain to look at notifications or turn on wifi, for example.  The airplane mode icon looks standard on all phones - this is an image of an airplane.  To disable the mode, you just need to click on this icon. </p><h2>  Phone settings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fly disable flight mode" class="if uuid-2540688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2540688.jpg"></div><p>  The second way to turn off the fly mode is to use the phone‚Äôs settings.  Unfortunately, not on all devices you can turn off the ‚Äúflight‚Äù through the status bar, because there simply might not be a special ‚Äúbutton‚Äù there.  But do not despair, because in this case the settings will help.  So here is what you need to do: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  First you need to go to the phone settings. </li><li>  Next, find the section that relates to networks and connections.  Usually it goes the very first in the list of all parameters. </li><li>  Now you need to click on the "More" button, which is located in this section. </li><li>  In the opened submenu, the necessary switch will be located to turn off the flight mode.  Everything is simple! </li></ol><h2>  Shutdown menu </h2><p>  The third way to turn off the flight mode (fly mode) is to resort to using the special shutdown menu.  This is also a fairly simple, fast and effective method that will allow you to disable this mode (flight) in just a few seconds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paratapok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to turn off airplane mode" class="if uuid-2540686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2540686.jpg"></div><p>  All you need to do is hold down the power button for a few seconds.  A small menu with several items should appear on the screen, one of which is just responsible for turning the flight mode on and off.  All you need to do is click on the appropriate item. </p><p>  Important: on some phone models, especially on Chinese devices, for example Meizu, this menu may not be available, and everything that appears on the screen when you hold down the power button, there are two points: power on and reboot.  So this is also worth considering. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Special application </h2><p>  Well, the last way to turn off the flight mode in your phone is to use special applications and utilities.  Yes, no matter how strange it may sound, but even for such a trifle as the flight mode, there are special small programs with widgets for the desktop through which, in fact, this mode is controlled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apkpure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable flight mode in the phone" class="if uuid-2540687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2540687.jpg"></div><p>  Several interesting applications can be noted: </p><ol><li>  Airplane On / Off Widget is a small desktop widget application that creates a small switch on the screen.  With this switch, you can control the flight mode in one click. </li><li>  Another application similar to the first one is Airplane Mode Widget.  The principle of operation here is the same as above.  A small widget with a switch through which the flight mode is controlled is created on the screen. </li><li>  Multi Switcher is also an extremely simple application through which you can create any widget switch on the desktop, including for controlling flight mode. </li></ol><p>  Download all of the above programs can be absolutely free in the application store. </p><h2>  What to do if I cannot turn off the flight mode (fly mode) </h2><p>  Sometimes, many users are faced with such a problem that none of the above methods work, and you cannot turn off the ‚Äúflight‚Äù.  This is due to a software malfunction in the operating system, and this will not be prevented.  In general, these are all the consequences of poorly optimized operation of the OS, as well as the introduction of certain changes to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="miredmi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turn off airplane mode" class="if uuid-2540685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2540685.jpg"></div><p>  There is only one way to deal with this problem - resetting all phone settings to the factory state.  This is done through the device settings.  You need to find the menu item called ‚ÄúMemory and backups‚Äù (it can be called differently on different devices).  In it, almost at the very bottom will be the item "Reset to factory settings." </p><p>  Actually, this is the only chance to get rid of the problem when you can‚Äôt turn off the flight mode. </p>
