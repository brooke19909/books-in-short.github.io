  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Borovitskaya metro station: location, history and architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Borovitskaya station is located on the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya metro line in Moscow.  It is located in the Central district of the capital, in the Arbat region.  Borovitskaya was opened in January 1986.  It got its name from the Kremlin tower of the same name, located nearby. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Initially, a section of 2.8 km from Serpukhovskaya to Borovitskaya was planned to be commissioned in 1984, but in fact it was only opened on 23.01.1986.  After that, there were 131 stations in the Moscow metro.  With the opening of the Borovitskaya subway, the first interchange hub was formed, which connected four lines at once: Sokolnicheskaya, Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya, Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya and Filevskaya. </p><p>  During the construction process, a brick house was discovered underground at a depth of five to six meters, in which windows, walls, furniture and even household utensils were preserved.  Scientists have found that the building failed due to land precipitation under the foundation. </p><p>  When erecting the lobby of the Borovitskaya metro station, builders also found a number of archaeological objects, including a silver-plated jug, smoking clay pipes and eighteenth-century drugstore banks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kakdobratsyado.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Borovitskaya" class="if uuid-3030842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3030842.jpg"></div><h2>  Lobby decoration </h2><p>  The lobby of the station is a semi-underground pavilion with a niche of the second floor and a common entrance.  The upper level is ground, the lower is underground, and twelve round columns lined with white marble pass through them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the Borovitskaya metro station, the lobby is connected by four stairs and an escalator.  The wall above the escalator arch is faced with red brick, the passages between the pylons are also decorated.  The outdoor pavilion is small in size, in 2016 it was made architectural lighting. </p><p>  The lobby is located on Mokhovaya Street, near the old building of the Russian Library. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Borovitskaya metro station is a three-vaulted pylon structure with a deep foundation.  The side tunnel has a diameter of 8.5 meters, and the central one is 9.5 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="undergroundexpert.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subway entrance" class="if uuid-3030843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3030843.jpg"></div><p>  The station is decorated in the style of the Moscow Kremlin, which transmit decorative, artistic and architectural techniques.  Relatively narrow and long pylons with beveled corners are stylized as walls with gates.  Under the base of the arches, they form wide cornices that protrude towards the side and central halls.  In the eaves there are rectangular cells with fluorescent lamps. </p><p>  The main colors in the Borovitskaya cladding are red, white and gold.  The track walls and the front sides of the pylons are finished with white marble, which is associated with the white-stone Kremlin of D. Donskoy.  Openings made of red cladding brick demonstrate the modern look of the Kremlin, built under Ivan the Third.  Some bricks have ceramic miniatures imitating old hallmarks.  They are a reference to the artisan posad, once located near the walls of the Kremlin fortress on Borovitsky Hill. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transitions </h2><p>  The northern end of the hall is equipped with a four-band escalator seventeen meters high.  With it, you can go to the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line of the Moscow metro. </p><p>  Near the southern end there are four stairs, which are connected above the tracks by bridges leading to the corridor.  Opposite the walkways from the station, an escalator slope arch is located, it leads to a four-belt escalator 37.2 meters high.  With it, you can get to the lower level of the lobby, and from there transfer to the station ‚ÄúLibrary named after  Lenin ‚Äùor go to the two-band escalator 5.6 meters high, which works only on the rise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chto-proishodit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Escalators on Borovitskaya" class="if uuid-3030847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3030847.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and Attractions </h2><p>  Borovitskaya metro station is located between Polyanka and Chekhovskaya.  Her hall is located under Starovagankovsky lane.  There are exits to Borovitskaya Square and Mokhovaya Street.  At the last, not far from the lobby, there is a public transport stop. </p><p>  Since Borovitskaya is located in the very center of the capital, in the immediate vicinity of it are the Moscow Kremlin with its museums and other attractions: the Shakhovsky-Krasilshchikova estate, the monument to V. the Great, Pashkov‚Äôs house. </p><h2>  Incidents </h2><p>  01/12/2016 Borovitskaya was partially cordoned off due to the discovery of an orphan package at the first car of the electric train.  Because of this, passengers had to go to long-distance train cars for disembarkation.  Arriving at the scene, the police examined the suspicious package, but there was nothing threatening in it - only a pair of old boots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="domokucha.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Passengers at the station" class="if uuid-3030848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3030848.jpg"></div><p>  On September 14, 2018, traffic stopped on a gray subway line because an emergency happened at Borovitskaya metro station: a thirty-year-old woman fell on a hard way under an arriving train.  Fortunately, the engineer urgently stopped the train, almost reaching the passenger. </p><p>  The victim was taken out of the way and taken to the Sklifosovsky Research Institute with a traumatic brain injury and a broken arm.  The woman explained her fall on the way by the fact that she suddenly became dizzy.  Doctors of the ambulance, who arrived at the place, found her intoxicated. </p>
