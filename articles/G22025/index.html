Its outline will be given in this article.  And its popularity is not surprising, because this openwork is suitable for dresses, blouses, scarves and shawls.  Each product will look very festive. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out how to knit this pattern and why it is precisely its craftswomen who always leave “in reserve”. </p><h2>  Beautiful pattern.  How can I use it? </h2><p>  Experienced knitters know that any thing that was connected by them with the use of the “Bear Paws” pattern has a rather elegant look.  Moreover, the pattern is suitable for things not only everyday, but also for holiday.  It is still surprising how this happens, because this pattern is not so intricate with knitting needles - “Bear Paws”.  Its scheme is perfectly suitable for autumn-winter sweaters, and for summer blouse-t-shirts. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the fact that <span>this lace</span> can be perfectly combined with others, and it will remain the main focus, does not remain outside the scope of attention.  By the way, the universality of the pattern also adds fans to it.  It can be used not only in the creation of clothing.  It is quite suitable for a variety of accessories - pillows, socks, handbags. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How easy is it to figure out the circuit? </h2><p>  If the beginning knitter decides to choose the “Bear Paws” pattern for work, she should be prepared for the fact that there are several completely different patterns.  And all of them are created in order to carry them with knitting needles.  There are absolutely insignificant differences between them, but it was thanks to them that such a variety was obtained.  The main thing is to check the pattern before starting work, because sometimes typos can occur, which may result in knitting errors. </p><p>  If you look carefully enough, you can understand that the basis in the motive is two zones that create a chess order due to its order.  Typically, knitting starts with the hem and a few loops before rapport.  It will end with loops after rapport and a second edge loop. </p><h2>  Two parts of one lace </h2><p>  The Bear Paws pattern, the pattern of which is really not very complicated, is as follows. </p><p>  Part one (it is she who looks like a bear's paws) is located in twelve loops, and knitting it is not at all difficult.  After all, it is a repetition of a given combination three times.  The front side is a pair of loops knitted with the front method, after them you need to make a crochet and again two front loops together with a broach.  The flip side is as follows: two purl, double crochet, two purl together.  On this side, the combination of loops must be repeated three times. </p>

    <p>  In the second part of the circuit, eighteen elements can be found.  Four rows alternate.  Two of them will be facial, and two will be negotiable.  As a rule, they are repeated three times.  But sometimes it happens that more - four, five times.  And it all depends on what you plan to get as a result, “Bear Paws” - a pattern, the description of which instantly reveals all the secrets of knitting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We sort each row separately </h2><p>  First row.  Here, each element should be knitted only in the front way.  It is necessary to start with the fact that a thread is thrown over the knitting needle, then knit 4 loops, then two with a broach, six loops, then again two with a broach and the last 4.  It ends with another crochet. </p><p>  Second row.  On the wrong side, you need to knit the seams on the wrong side.  It is necessary to knit a loop, then throw a thread, then 4 ordinary ones.  Next you need to knit a loop of two.  Again 4 ordinary eyelets, then knit two for the back half.  Repeat the knitting of the four elements again.  Now put the thread on the knitting needle.  The row ends with a regular loop. </p>

    <p>  Third row.  All loops are knitted with front loops.  It’s better to start with two consecutive ones.  Then you need to make a crochet, four loops.  Next, you need to knit two loops together, making a broach, two ordinary elements, one loop of two, four ordinary, double crochet and complete this row with two loops. </p><p>  Fourth row.  This is the back row.  Everything is wrong here.  It is necessary to knit three loops, a crochet, four, and then two together and two elements that are tied together for the back half.  At the end of the row, knit 4 loops again, double crochet and complete with three purl elements. </p><p>  The knitting pattern “Bear Paws”, the scheme of which is described in sufficient detail, shows that it is quite possible to knit it even to that knitter who has so far not much experience. </p><h2>  How to knit openwork? </h2><p>  Now we know that there are two parts in lace.  And also - in what sequence the loops should make up the pattern of the “Bear Paws” knitting needles.  The scheme, as it has already become clear, is not very complicated, the main thing is to carefully calculate all the loops. </p><p>  So, we begin work.  On the knitting needles 50 loops (and two hem).  Knit using a pattern that shows the front and back rows in exactly the same way as they look on the front side. </p><p>  Front rows from right to left, and wrong rows from left to right. </p>

    <p>  In the pattern repeat 34 loops wide and 24 rows high. </p><p>  You should start with one edge loop and loops before rapport.  Repeat this repeat all the time, but ends with all the loops after the repeat and one edge loop. </p><p>  So repeat everything from the first to the twenty-fourth row. </p>
