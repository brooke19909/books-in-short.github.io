When Ivan was 3 years old, his father died, and his mother raised him, who also died in 1538 when he was 8 incomplete years.  Ivan grew up surrounded by the struggle for power of the boyar clans, which were at enmity with each other, surrounded by palace coups. </p><p>  Violence, murder, intrigue made him suspicious, revengeful and cruel.

He carried out many innovations useful for the state, drew up orders - uniform management bodies.  During his reign, they compiled Sudebnik, the charter of Russian laws.  The first Russian Tsar in domestic politics greatly strengthened the state.  He expanded the borders of Russia, having conquered the khanates of Kazan (1547-1552) and Astrakhan (1556), and began to penetrate Siberia.  In the international arena, Russia's positions have rather strengthened.

Bread was brought to the north from the center, and from there - salt, furs, fish.  Under the reign of Ivan IV, trade with Western Europe began through Novgorod and Smolensk.  Trade with England became more regular.  Through the White and <span>Barents Seas, they</span> opened the way from Britain to Russia.  They founded the English trading house in Moscow, and in 1584 the <span>port of Arkhangelsk</span> on the banks of the Dvina Bay. </p>

The Livonian War (1558-1583) brought failure for Russia.  In 1565, the first Russian Tsar Ivan IV created the oprichnina, and after that they began to call him Grozny.  By terror he wanted to assert his authority.  And he didn‚Äôt even spare his son in this anger.  Oprinchiki in 1569 plundered many Russian cities under the leadership of Ivan the Terrible.

    <p>  The activities of Ivan the Terrible received a versatile description in Russian history, because pre-revolutionary historians described him negatively, while the Soviet emphasized his positive aspects during the reign.  And in the twentieth century, in the second half, historians began to deeply study the domestic and <span>foreign policies of Ivan the Terrible.</span> </p>
