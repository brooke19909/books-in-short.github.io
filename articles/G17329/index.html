But users have a lot of questions about how to unlock iPhone 6.  Not always the word "unlock" indicates a concept such as locking the device with a password.  Sometimes we are talking about problems with a SIM card. </p><h2>  Device lock </h2><p>  Often users forget passwords, thereby blocking their smartphone.  Therefore, they have to look for information on how to unlock iPhone 6 in order to restore the use of the device.  Of course, there are no hopeless situations, even in this case, you can find ways to fix the problem. </p><p>  You can recover a locked phone using iTunes, Tenorshare 4uKey, iCloud.  All three options will help reset the password from your smartphone and return to normal use, but in all cases you will have to say goodbye to user files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikitechy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forgotten Password" class="if uuid-2829472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829472.jpg"></div><h2>  Using iTunes </h2><p>  How to unlock iPhone 6?  If it comes to losing the password and locking the device, this service from Apple can help.  It is necessary that the computer has the appropriate program, as well as a cord for connecting the smartphone to the PC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  You need to connect the phone to the computer, open iTunes and sync. </li><li>  After the backup is created, you can choose to restore the device.  Thus, the program will remove the encryption, and the smartphone will be unlocked. </li><li>  After recovery, you will need to use a backup that will return data to the phone. </li></ol><h2>  Another option with iTunes </h2><p>  But sometimes the user does not synchronize his device with iTunes.  In this case, you will have to use the free ReiBoot, which will help to unlock the smartphone without a password.  To do this, enter recovery mode using a combination of power and home buttons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock iPhone 6 from America" class="if uuid-2829475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829475.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, it is more likely that all data from the phone will be destroyed, so try to periodically make a backup so that in case of force majeure it is possible to restore personal files. </p><h2>  Using Tenorshare 4uKey </h2><p>  This is a tool that will help you unlock iPhone 6 yourself if you forget your password or cannot access the device.  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Install this program on a computer, open it and then connect the phone. </li><li>  The program will automatically detect the device. </li><li>  It will be enough to select "Start" to remove the phone password. </li><li>  In the process, you will need to download the latest firmware. </li><li>  Next, you can start the recovery process, which takes only a couple of minutes. </li></ol><h2>  Using iCloud </h2><p>  You can restore a locked device in this way if the Find My iPhone feature was previously enabled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  You will need to go to the iCloud website from your computer. </li><li>  Go to the search menu. </li><li>  The service will ask you to log in. </li><li>  After will show a list of all available devices that are on the network. </li><li>  Among them, we choose a smartphone. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúErase‚Äù button.  In this case, the personal data and password that you forgot will be deleted from the phone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlocked iPhone 6 s" class="if uuid-2829470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829470.jpg"></div><h2>  Locked smartphones </h2><p>  But ‚Äúlocked‚Äù does not always mean ‚Äúblocked‚Äù.  Among Apple's devices, there is such a thing as linking a device to a specific mobile operator.  In this case, they can also use this term and try to figure out how to unlock iPhone 6. </p><p>  Where did the concept of ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù come from?  The fact is that many fans of the manufacturer want to buy smartphones of the "apple" company.  But not everyone has enough money to get a new one.  Therefore, some prefer to purchase devices not from official distributors in order to save.  As you know: ‚Äúfree cheese is only in a mousetrap‚Äù, so something with these smartphones should be wrong.  Most often, the buyer receives a locked iPhone. </p><p>  Typically, these phones can be found on eBay or Amazon.  Devices are blocked because they were previously tied to a European or American mobile operator.  In this case, the new user cannot install his SIM card, since it is not displayed by the system until the contract with the previously connected telecom operator ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maryellenforohio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlocked iPhone 6" class="if uuid-2829477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829477.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the buyer begins to look for ways to unlock iPhone 6 from America. </p><h2>  Definition of a locked device </h2><p>  To begin with, it is important to immediately determine whether your device is locked up or has other problems.  To do this, you can install another SIM card and call someone.  If you can make an outgoing call, then everything is in order with the smartphone. </p><p>  Sometimes when installing a SIM card, the message Restricted or Contact Service Provider appears.  Verification can also be done through a special service by entering the IMEI code in a specific line.  The site will display information about the phone. </p><p>  The fact that "iPhone 6" is unlocked can be found in the device settings.  You must go to the "Basic" section, and then select "About the device".  Usually, an operator who is attached to the phone is indicated here. </p><h2>  Unlock Options </h2><p>  A little effective, but the easiest option is to wait.  Sooner or later, the contract with the carrier will end, and the phone will become available for cooperation with another.  As practice shows, the maximum period of an active contract lasts 2 years.  After that, it will be enough to unlock the device through iTunes. </p><p>  You can also unlock the phone using the American company AT&amp;T.  In this case, you need to contact technical support and slightly embellish the situation. </p><p>  The operator will ask for data on the contract, we can say that they are lost, the phone is locked, and you are in another country.  In some cases, employees meet and ask for IMEI and email.  Then it remains to wait until the information comes to the mail that you can own the unlocked iPhone 6 S or another model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whytheluckystiff.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-unlock &quot;iPhone 6&quot;" class="if uuid-2829478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829478.jpg"></div><p>  The most expensive, but effective option is to contact special services.  To choose a bona fide company, it is better to carefully review the reviews or contact friends, perhaps someone has previously encountered a similar problem.  The cost of unlocking can be different and most often depends on the operator who ‚Äúsettled‚Äù on the phone.  The most problematic is the American telecom operator Verizon. </p><p>  Conscientious services usually use the official unlock method.  In this case, there are no problems with the software and with the device as a whole.  But if the company uses jailbreaks and other dubious operations, in the future the smartphone may give out system errors, which will be difficult to cope with. </p>
