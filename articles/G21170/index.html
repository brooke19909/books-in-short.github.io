Before you start using the device, you must familiarize yourself with them.  So, for example, it is very important that the radio is not exposed to moisture.  After all, if rain gets on it, then this can lead to a fire or electric shock.  In no case should you open the device case yourself.  It is also not recommended to disassemble it, since it contains important parts of the radio, because of which the device may be broken.  In addition, this device uses such optical devices that may have an increased risk to vision.  Especially dangerous can be called a laser beam, which is located under the body of the device.  It is necessary to carry out maintenance of the radio from a true professional. </p><p>  After the ignition is turned off, press and hold the OFF button, which is located directly on the device.  Hold it until the display completely disappears. </p><p>  Recently, the choice of many car owners is the car radio Sony.  Reviews about the device are more often positive than negative.  Buyers note that the device works well, without failures.  If something is not clear, you can use the instructions that are sold in the kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The price of Sony radio tape recorders depends on their specifications and the functions they perform.

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Sony car radios have several undeniable advantages: </p><ul><li>  A color television system is supported.  It is important that the disc was recorded in the PAL system, and not in any other system, since other formats may not play. </li><li>  The system is able to play any discs that are designed to listen to music.  Moreover, it does not matter what format they have.  But playing discs may be wrong if suddenly the temperature in the cabin is too high or low, so you need to maintain a constant temperature. </li><li>  Supports Sony car radio USB media.  Usually for them there are several inputs on the front panel of the device. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car radio sony reviews" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/973662.jpg" width="575"></div></li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  However, in addition to the advantages, the device also has some disadvantages: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  As with other receivers, you cannot play too small discs (8 cm in diameter). </li><li>  Standard discs will also not be played back if suddenly information is recorded on them only in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã8 cm. </li><li>  Also, do not try to play those discs that have copyright protection.  They will not be lost. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony car radio usb" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/973663.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Device operation </h2><p>  Before you start using Sony car radios, it is advisable to reset the parameters that were installed on the device from the factory.  To do this, remove the front panel, and then press the RESET button.  It should be borne in mind that when you click on it, all the standard parameters of the device are erased, including the time settings.  Therefore, after erasing the factory settings, you will have to perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Set the clock.  It should be noted that the device has both a 12 and a 24-hour indication.  The user can independently choose an option convenient for him. </li><li>  You also need to configure the display itself: select the backlight, picture, etc. </li><li>  It is very important to pay attention to the sound settings, as each user will like one or another sound feature. </li></ul><p>  You also need to pay attention to precautions in the operation of the device: </p><ul><li>  Do not drop the front panel, as this can lead to malfunctions in the operation of the car radio itself. </li><li>  Do not put too much pressure on the front panel during installation.  The same applies to the display window. </li><li>  The device must not be placed in a humid or warm room. </li><li>  It is advisable to take a removable panel with you without leaving it in the car, because because of this, the radio tape recorder can be stolen by intruders.  And the compact dimensions of the front panel allow you to do this. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony car radio prices" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/973664.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Removing and installing the front panel </h2><p>  Sony-car radio, the prices of which can be called quite high, is a tidbit for attackers.  In order not to suffer from criminals, you can remove the front panel from the device.  To do this, you must press the ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù button to turn off the device.  Then press the ‚ÄúUp‚Äù button, after which the front panel can be easily removed.  But for this, you will have to gently pull it towards you.  To install the front panel back, you must do the same steps, but only in the opposite sequence. </p><p>  Thus, all actions to remove, install, replace, repair the radio can be done by yourself.  But it is desirable that they take place under the clear guidance of professionals. </p>
