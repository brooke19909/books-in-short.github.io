Sights of Bryusov Lane</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bryusov Lane, connecting Tverskaya and <span>Bolshaya Nikitskaya</span> Streets, is not very long.  But in the cultural-historical dimension, it is very remarkable and deserves special attention.  This is a very characteristic place for old Moscow.  There are less and less of such people every year. </p><h2>  From Moscow history </h2><p>  Bryusov Lane owes its historical name to the well-known figure of the Petrine era, Field Marshal Y. V. Bryus.  It was in this place in the thirties of the eighteenth century that the estate was founded by the descendants and heirs of the closest <span>associate of Peter the Great.</span>  During their stay, which lasted almost a hundred years, the lane became known as Bryusov.  And earlier it was listed as Resurrection, according to the name of the Church of the Resurrection located here on the Assumption Enemy.  From 1962 to 1994, Bryusov Lane was named after the People's Artist of the USSR Nezhdanova, who once lived here in house number 7. But in the nineties, the tendency of the return of lost historical place names gained strength in Russia.  And the lane in the center of the capital again became Bryusov.  One should only regret that not all Moscow streets returned their original names. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bruce lane" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461897.jpg" width="426"></div>

Moscow is generally distinguished by considerable eclecticism.  It is easy to detect the most multidirectional, sometimes contradictory trends in it.  There is no stylistic unity in the very center of the capital, where Bryusov Lane is located.  Its modern appearance was formed mainly in the first half of the twentieth and in the last decades of the previous century.  Many outstanding masters of their time had a hand in the visual image of the alley, in particular the famous Soviet academician of architecture A.V. Shchusev.  It only remains to be regretted that at the same time the ancient heritage of Moscow architecture was largely lost.  But at the same time, some monuments of ancient Russian architecture were preserved with minor changes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bruce lane Moscow" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461898.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The oldest building, which Bryusov Lane has, is the Church of the Resurrection of the Word, it has been standing here since the first half of the seventeenth century.  This temple had a predecessor, a wooden church built in 1548.  There are no other equally striking architectural sights in Bryusov Lane.  Nevertheless, the type of housing development adjacent to the side street of the blocks can be attributed to them.  Many experts recognize such seemingly unremarkable residential buildings as valuable city-forming objects.  They are very characteristic of historical Moscow.  Also, the unconditional sights of the Bryusov Lane area include the House of Artists and the House of Composer located here.  The Conservatory, whose building is nearby, is no less loved by the creative intelligentsia of Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bruce lane the temple of the resurrection" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461896.jpg" width="416"></div>

A similar trend emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century, and reached its climax in the post-revolutionary era and in <span>Soviet times.</span>  The walls of many houses in Bryusov Lane are decorated with <span>plaques</span> informing passers-by about the famous inhabitants of these walls.  The assumption that here and today live those in honor of whom commemorative signs will ever appear on the walls is quite justified.  It‚Äôs rather difficult to list all the inhabitants of Bryusov Lane, but let's try to recall some.  In different years, such artists and musicians lived here: I. S. Kozlovsky, N. S. Golovanov, N. A. Obukhova, M. <span>P. Maksakova,</span> I. M. Moskvin, V. I. Kachalov, V. E. Meyerhold, A. Sh. Melik-Pashaev, L. M.

    <h2>  From the point of view of a realtor </h2><p>  The Bryusov Lane district was very prestigious and respected throughout the Soviet historical period.  The highest party-economic nomenclature lived here mainly.  Currently, it is one of the most status areas of the capital.  Most of the housing in Bryusov Lane by all criteria belongs to the elite category.  In many <span>residential complexes,</span> apartments are remodeled and redeveloped in accordance with the individual requirements of the owners.  On some buildings, additional <span>attic floors</span> and superstructures appeared.  According to price parameters, housing is quoted at the highest mark in the cost range.  However, it is in steady demand.  Many Muscovites would like to move permanently to Bryusov Lane.  Wealthy people in the capital are more than enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of spiridon of trimifunt" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461894.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Bryusov Lane, Church of the Resurrection of the Word </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest Moscow Orthodox cathedrals.  The Church of the Resurrection of the Word on the Assumption Enemy (such is its full canonical name) did not stop its service for several centuries.  It began in the seventeenth century and did not interrupt even during the years of severe persecution of the church.  The church in the very center of Moscow continued to receive parishioners even in the thirties of the twentieth century at the height of state atheist propaganda.  As is customary to say among Orthodox believers, this is a prayer place.  The architectural solution of the Temple is distinguished by emphasized modesty.  But it has an expressive two-tier bell tower, which is clearly visible even from Tverskaya Street.  One of the most important Orthodox shrines of the Temple is the miraculous icon of St. Spyridon.  She can be seen in the altar of the cathedral, to the right of the image of the Savior Not Made by Hands.  Thanks to this unique icon, the <span>Church of the Resurrection of the Word in Bruce Lane is</span> sometimes called the Temple of Spiridon of Trimyphuntus.  This saint is traditionally considered an assistant and patron of all the poor and destitute.  It is customary to turn to him for spiritual support in a difficult moment of life.  And there is nothing surprising in the fact that the path to the miraculous icon of St. Spyridon has not been overgrown for several centuries. </p>
