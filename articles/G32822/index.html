The word is always a certain kind of business, from which comes the conclusion about what actions can be called speech.  These are any words spoken for a specific purpose, aimed at the result. </p>

    <h2>  Speech act </h2><p>  According to modern linguists H. Grice, J. Searle and J. Austin, speech actions are a conversation with others, and a person, speaking his tasks, already performs a certain action if it is aimed at the addressee.  The speaker‚Äôs intention is called a speech act, speech act or speech action. </p><p>  The variety of speech actions is obvious, their huge number in the arsenal of mankind.  Scientists have compiled a classification where speech intent is the basis.  What actions can be called speech?  Yes, all who strive for one or more goals and speak out with certain intentions.  Most often, the goal is not one, and in a conversation you can distinguish several types of speech and trace several speech acts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Dmitry Likhachev </h2><p>  Truly miracles can do speaking.  Examples can be found at every step.  The commander in his speech is able to push the army to heroism of exceptional heroism.  The tombstone of a relative of a deceased or deceased may cause sobs in a whole crowd, and in some cases even call for revenge.  What are the deputies in the State Duma doing?  Conversation reigns there.  Examples of her targeted presence are constant, for such is the work of a servant of the people.  At the first congress, which took place during the agony of the USSR, Academician <span>Dmitry Likhachev</span> addressed the deputies <span>.</span> </p><p>  You can analyze his speech in order to clearly understand what actions can be called speech.  He speaks first about the state of Soviet culture, about its humanitarian component, and is surprised.  that not one of the people‚Äôs representatives in the election platform even had the word ‚Äúculture‚Äù.  But without the most elementary morality that it gives, social laws cannot act, economic laws - all the more so, modern science dies, because experiments cost money, large projects and basic construction are not implemented due to the lack of momentary returns - and so on.  Likhachev examined in detail the deplorable state of almost all cultural monuments, archives, libraries, museums.  In particular, the culture of speech behavior and aspects of its degradation were also affected.  He talked a lot about education, because that is where culture should be laid.  Then came concrete proposals to improve the situation in the country in this area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Communication and Speech </h2><p>  Analyzing this speech of the academician, it is not so easy to attribute it to a certain type of speech, to reveal intentions.  Of course, it is immediately clear that Likhachev tried, following all the rules of speech behavior, to draw the attention of the people's representatives to the stated facts, to convince them of the priority of the task assigned to them.  It is also immediately evident that the academician, in addition to informing students, tried to induce them to certain actions.  To speak is a speech action, as it turns out.  Talk to the target audience, talk about problems.  And the type of speech determines speech intention. </p><p>  In this case, the speech of Academician Likhachev belongs to the propaganda type, encouraging concrete actions, but with elements of both informing and arguing types.  The structure of the speech act in this speech is such that, perhaps, only the epidemic type is not present - solemn glorification, which is often filled with speeches not only of jubilee corporate parties, but also of congresses of people's deputies.  Why it happens?  Yes, because Academician Dmitry Likhachev, unlike many colleagues, chose the right verbal behavior to help achieve the goal. </p>

    <h2>  Diatribic type </h2><p>  Is speech always action?  And what actions can be called speech?  Each person either used the diatribic style himself, or came across this phenomenon at every step.  It is, rather, not an action, but a speech effect when two bosom friends talk for hours on the phone.  Here, speech itself is self-sufficient and valuable, since it is aimed at obtaining mutual pleasure.  There is no reason for this conversation, there is no purpose, even nothing new most often, none of the interlocutors will recognize anything, since all the ratings have already been set for those around. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But a purely emotional background appears, a certain pleasant joy from communication, and the classification of speech acts contains this type of speech as a separate line.  The diatribic type of speech (for philosophers, this concept is almost abusive) includes cute "inter-boyfriend" jokes, little understood by outsiders, some hints of funny situations, interesting details of adventures known only to these ladies.  All this sets a precedent when speech actions are not actions, but the creation of a certain sensual background, the effect of which gives joy.  Real live communication is filled with many varieties of speech acts, depending on the needs: to make compassion, get help, punish someone or even try to kill with a word ... Speech behavior varies depending on circumstances. </p><h2>  Childbirth and types of speech </h2><p>  <em>1. Academic speech</em> .  It includes university and school lectures, scientific reports, reports and reviews, popular science lectures. </p><p>  <em>2. Judicial speech</em> .  There are two types: lawyer - defensive and prosecutor - accusatory. </p><p>  <em>3. Socio-political speech.</em>  These are reports, various speeches at congresses, conferences, meetings, meetings, these are speeches in parliament, at rallies, military-patriotic speeches, as well as propaganda and diplomatic ones.  This includes political review. </p><p>  <em>4. Social and everyday speech.</em>  There are also a lot of options: speeches at receptions, small greetings, various toasts, as well as grave speeches.  This is the same colloquial speech, examples of which each person observes daily. </p><p>  <em>5. Spiritual, or church theological speech.</em>  There are two options: speech-preaching and official church. </p><p>  The situation is usually dictated by the corresponding speech behavior of the speaker.  The components of the situation are necessarily built into the speech and correspond to its orientation, forming a harmonious unity. </p>

    <h2>  The concept </h2><p>  Conversational speech, examples of which are given above, helps to formulate the very concept of speech activity: it is a fixed psychological content (specific and characteristic objects, means, methods, products and results), entrusted needs, which is the prerequisite for any verbal act.  Plus an analysis of the process, that is, phase, and motivational plans.  From this we can derive the definition that speech actions are fragments <span>of a person‚Äôs</span> general <span>activity</span> in a given period of time. </p><p>  And, therefore, the concept of speech activity also follows from the above: it is a purposeful, active, informative and motivated process of receiving and issuing certain thoughts formulated and formed through the language, expression of will or simply expressing emotions.  And this process is aimed at communication, which can satisfy the communicative-cognitive need.  The units of this activity are speech actions that can be carried out by means of other types or independently, regardless of the general goal.  In any case, one can speak about actions and activities only when there is an impact from them, when it is possible to change the information field as a result of communication. </p><h2>  About Speech Behavior </h2><p>  This is a broader and less defined concept, since the behavior of each person is specific, with a complex system of movements, actions and actions.  This is a social being with functioning in society in one form or another.  The totality of speech actions and activities is especially pronounced in speech behavior: this is a manner, the nature of realization in its somatic activity, and the content of speech behavior is completely and completely adequate to the results of speech activity. </p><p>  The unit here is a speech act (act), which has the character of influence (signified) and external design, that is, the executive part (meaning).  This means that one can metaphorically discuss "grammatical" or "pronouncing" or any other behavior, since speech necessarily includes a certain emotional component, revealing certain personality traits.  Speech itself is interpreted ambiguously: from phonation and speaking through text to communication.  In any case, this is an act of an individual process of expressing thoughts and using the language for your own will. </p>

    <h2>  Speech Processes </h2><p>  An independent type of human activity, its specific form - this is the definition of speech acts.  They present a process of purposeful, active, situation-driven and language-mediated communication, that is, the issuing or receiving of voice messages in a person‚Äôs interaction with other people.  Such a set of actions is included in a wider activity - cognitive, labor, for example, but can exist independently.  However, the speech process and <span>speech activity</span> are not synonyms at all.  Activity is always a process, and a process is not always an activity.  ‚ÄúHello! How are you?‚Äù, A poem, for example, by Lermontov, recited by heart, the teacher giving out or perceiving the student homework and a lot more - speech actions, but not activity and not a process.  To distinguish between these concepts, you will need to consider a number of parameters for analysis. </p><p>  1. Structural organization (external and internal). </p><p>  2. Subject or psychological content. </p><p>  The whole complex interaction of such components of speech activity, as the functioning of perception, attention, memory, thinking, is considered.  And this will require analysis and characteristics of the following components of the ongoing process. </p><p>  3. General functional mechanisms of activity in a psychological context. </p><p>  4. The internal content and external coloring of the dialogue of the parties involved in the process. </p><p>  5. Analysis of activity in the unity of the form of implementation and content. </p><h2>  Internal structural organization </h2><p>  Human activity and its speech component are defined identically - in three phases: </p><ul><li>  motivation phase; </li><li>  research phase; </li><li>  executive phase. </li></ul><p>  Here, complex interaction is realized to obtain the result of activity: need - motive - goal.  The main mover for the activity of a person is <span>need,</span> need, necessity.  Need itself, of course, does not determine the direction of the action, but together with the goal it receives certainty in order to find this direction for itself.  So the subject becomes a motive for speech activity, a motivating factor. </p><p>  Cognition and communication is a constant need and the main source of speech action.  The motive determines the nature and dynamics of them, combining all or many <span>types of speech activity.</span>  The nature of the speech process cannot end with thought, it is the first instance for a long journey, born of a motivating sphere of consciousness with all drives and needs, interests and motivations, affects and emotions.  Following the thought, a tendency of will and affect begins to move, answering the eternal question: "Why?"  Motivation is like the wind, moving the clouds of thought in motion, to shed the life-giving rain of words. </p><h2>  Second and third phases </h2><p>  The second phase - analytical-synthetic or tentative-research - studies the conditions, subject and disclosure of the properties of the subject, makes a choice and draws tools from the arsenal of methods (arguments, coloring) of speech activity.  Here, means are selected to achieve the goal, and personal or borrowed (given) thoughts are formed and formulated to support the process of verbal communication.  In this phase, all available language tools and methods of speech are planned, programmed and internally organized. </p><p>  The third phase - implementing, executive - may not be pronounced, as, for example, the executing person simply listens or reads the order.  Therefore, the third phase is divided into two components: the executive listener phase and the motor executive phase.  The speaking person (presenter, active) is always more vivid than the listener: articulation, intonation of speech, and so on.  Without distinguishing between these components, it is difficult to obtain clarity of definition.  So, each act of speech activity begins with a motive, continues with a plan and specific operations, and ends with a result - positive or negative.  A person who has mastered this communication system perfectly, has formed all speech skills, receives negative results much less often. </p>

    <h2>  Subject matter </h2><p>  Psychological, that is, objective content has absolutely any speech activity, and it is equivalent to its structural construction.  Many elements are included here, such as the item itself, the necessary tools, carefully selected tools, and so on.  The subject of speech activity is considered as the main one, since it determines the nature of future communication and it is in it that the need finds itself.  It can be anything - material, material and even ideal (and what is an object is defined above: it is thought as a form of reflection of the phenomena of reality together with all connections and relationships). </p><p>  Speech actions are similar to a three-level education, where the middle one is motivation, need and goal, the lower one is the objective plan, and the upper level is operational.  In the subject matter of not less than the subject matter, the product is also important - that which unites embodied activity, materializes the object.  Here is a product, unlike a thought (object), cannot be ideal, it always materializes.  A text or statement is a pure product of speech activity, where the totality of the psychological characteristics of the subject is objectified. </p>
