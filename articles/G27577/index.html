  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The root system of various plants</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When modeling compositions from plants, it is necessary to take into account their possible maximum sizes.  So, shrubs and trees tend to grow, grow in size and gain mass.  Moreover, knowledge of the main types of plant rhizomes is of no small importance.  So, the root system is a kind of crown underground.  In some plants, it is of a pyramidal shape, while in others it is spherical. </p><p>  The roots of various plants should not overlap, grow together or intertwine.  It is unacceptable that they compete for food and water, and with their growth they could stumble upon various obstacles represented by communications or the foundation. </p><p>  The root system in shape is not always a <span>mirror image of the</span> shape of the crown.  So, the erroneous opinion is that a plant with a balanced and even crown has the same roots.  Sometimes they cannot go beyond the projection of the upper part of the plant ( <span>felt cherry</span> is an example <span>),</span> and sometimes with spreading branches the plant has a root root.  There are plant species in which the crown has a columnar shape, and the root system of plants is superficial. </p><p>  In addition, the root system of some plants tends to change with their age.  For example, robinia pseudo-acacia at a young age has a <span>fibrous root system,</span> and in adulthood - a superficial.  Soil and environmental conditions are of no small importance: for example, the root system <span>of ordinary pine</span> has a deep rod shape, and when it grows in moist heavy soils, it is fibrous. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The formation of the rhizome of plants is carried out similarly to the formation of their terrestrial part.  Basically, such operations are carried out in nurseries.  The procedure is as follows: every 5 years, depending on the species, the plants are subject to ‚Äútransshipment‚Äù.  In other words, they are dug up and formed at the same time as the ground and underground parts.  Cropped roots begin to branch and, thus, a fibrous shape is obtained.  It is she who is quite convenient when landing or transporting.  It is easy to place with good expansion in the landing pit.  But in the case of the rod shape, such a root can neither be bent nor twisted. </p><p>  The latter type is characteristic of those species that grow on sandy soils, where <span>groundwater</span> is very deep.  Also, such plants are highly resistant to wind.  That is why we can observe how the mast pines stand ‚Äúlike soldiers‚Äù on sandy mounds, and the forest spruce, which has a sailing crown and surface roots, winds down quite easily. </p><p>  The root system also works as a <span>water pump.</span>  However, this does not mean at all that it should be deep in the earth and reach to the very aquifers.  In the case of close proximity of water, the shape of the rhizome can be either fibrous or superficial.  An example is a birch in adulthood, which has a medium-sized root system (between the surface and fibrous), and with its underground system up to 200 liters of water are pumped out of the ground.  However, for all its "gluttony" this plant is of no small importance for marshland. </p><p>  It is necessary to carefully approach the issue of the planting site of the plant.  The rule is quite simple: plants with a stem system are intolerant of high water levels, and with a fibrous and superficial one, they are relatively tolerant to water. </p><p>  Another problem may be planting plants near structures and structures.  In the case of the presence of a surface system, there is a chance of a plant stumbling onto the foundation, and a rod and budish one - on communications located in the ground.  It is for this that certain norms serve that help to avoid the occurrence of such situations. </p>
