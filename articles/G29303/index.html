It largely depends on the selection of accessories and trinkets.  This article will be useful to those who are interested in needlework for the home with their own hands.  Mats can be made from almost any material at hand and in various ways.  Any room is transformed and becomes more pleasant, you just have to lay a rug on the floor. </p><h2>  Knitting rugs with knitting needles.  The foundation </h2><p>  A big plus of needlework is the creation of unique and original products.  What you have done with your own hands will not be anywhere else but your home.  So, how to knit a rug?  It will be round, oval or rectangular - it depends on your desire and the chosen pattern.  Although you can do without it. </p><p>  For example, if you have a lot of different yarn left, you can knit a very beautiful spiral rug from it.  For this you will also need a needle and knitting needles.  In which case you can buy inexpensive acrylic yarn.  The mat will turn out multi-colored, so it will not be difficult to knit it. </p><p>  You should start with the middle base, it can be quickly crocheted.  Separately, you will knit a spiral row by row.  Agree, there is nothing complicated.  Let your base in diameter be approximately fifteen to twenty centimeters.  Color does not matter.  If this is your first time picking up knitting needles, be prepared for the rows to be tied.  To keep your rug flat and not puffing, it is important to learn how to make shortened rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We pick up a spiral </h2><p>  So your foundation is ready.  Now let's talk about how to tie a rug with a spiral.  You need to dial about fifteen loops with knitting needles and knit with an ordinary scarf, viscous, about a half to two centimeters thick.  Next row - knit ten loops.  Be careful.  Turn your rug and now again make a row of ten loops.  Further, the principle will alternate.  Again, knit a row of plain, viscous, of the same thickness.  Do not skip loops.  Now make shortened rows again.  The main thing is to remember the algorithm.  Loops that do not knit should always remain on one side of your rug. </p><p>  The proposed method is good because you do not need to think about the color of knitting, let it alternate with you, as you like.  The end result will be interesting anyway. </p><p>  More often, attach the resulting spiral to the finished center, so it will be easier for you to control the knitting so that it does not puff.  The further you advance, the more you will have untied ranks.  Just turn the loops down gradually. </p>

There are different ways to do this.  You can pick up interesting patterns of rugs crocheted. </p><p>  The simplest option is a square canvas without a pattern with a pattern.  You will need yarn in two different colors.  Edging and drawing, for example, are blue, the background is white.  One loop according to the scheme corresponds to one square.  Framing should be knitted at the very least when the mat itself is ready.  If you want, you can make it a third color, for example, blue. </p>

If you have finished the first one and you need to go to the next, lower the twenty-ninth air loop and knit a single crochet through two of the same loops.  Etc.  Carefully count the loops where the pattern fits.  In fact, there is nothing complicated.  When proceeding to the edging, knit one single crochet on each loop.  And so on around the row.  Edging fits more loosely.  You should have three single crochet posts in each corner of the frame.

Having mastered the simple crochet technique, feel free to move on to the next stage, to more complex options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Crocheted Patchwork Rug </h2><p>  Surely everyone has ever seen very beautiful rustic <span>striped rugs.</span>  The craftsmanship of their manufacture was perfectly owned by our grandmothers and great-grandmothers.  That which used to decorate the floors in the huts, and in the modern interior will look very stylish, at home.  In addition, they are easy to wash and are suitable for both the bedroom and the hallway. </p><p>  To knit a round patchwork rug, you will need: a thick hook and a long piece of cloth about three centimeters wide.  Make it more authentic, because the size of the finished product depends on this. </p>

Take the very first flap and make a loop.  Pull the hook through it and pry the strip that lies on your finger.  Well, it's the same with yarn.  When you knit a pigtail in about six to seven loops, connect it in a circular through two loops.  So the basis is ready.  The principle is similar to how a rug knits in a spiral with knitting needles.  The second row will need to be knitted, alternating through an air loop, otherwise you will get not a plane, but a tube.  Then the step size will only increase.  Optionally, you can sew a fringe of flaps to the edge of the mat.  And you can even knit fabric rugs with a cloth so that they are square or rectangular.  It will be very important for a long corridor.

    <h2>  Needlework for the house with their own hands.  Pompom mats </h2><p>  Can you imagine how nice it is to stand barefoot on such a puss?  But to make it is <span>not</span> at <span>all difficult.</span>  Necessary materials: sharpened scissors, any woolen thread, a woven rug as a basis (you can weave it yourself) and two rolls of toilet paper. </p><p>  On flattened cartons, you will need to wind yarn.  It‚Äôs okay if your pom poms come in different sizes - it‚Äôs completely unimportant, on the contrary, it will turn out very original and unusual.  Do not spare the thread, wrap it properly to make the balls fluffier.  Now connect the workpieces together and tightly tie the thread, threading it in the middle.  Do not forget to leave ponytails, they will be needed to attach the pompom to the main mat. </p>

Now you need to carefully remove the cartons from your double coil.  In your hands you will have a ball of thread.  Take the scissors and cut them from the outer edge.  Now fluff the pompom and, if necessary, trim the length of the tails.  Make them different colors.  Each pompom just needs to be tied to the mat with a very dense layer.  That's all!  This is a great baby mat that can be put near your baby‚Äôs crib.  However, this is not the only option.

For example, to sew a soft base from two pieces of fabric and a thin layer of syntepon.  Attach the drawings to it, let it be an application that resembles a children's drawing.  Your baby can help you by choosing what exactly he would like to see on his rug.  Sew or stitch details of the picture on a typewriter.  You can make it in the shape of a flower, as in the picture.  Or additionally sew flat smooth buttons on its surface.  Then the mat will have a light massage effect, just what you need.

    <h2>  We decorate the bathroom with a rug </h2><p>  A great option for the bathroom is a rug made of pebbles.  Take for the base a smooth mat or just a piece of rubber of the desired shape, as well as glue.  It must be versatile and flexible.  Be sure to check if the rubber slides on the floor in your bathroom, if so, then you need to choose another material.  However, you can use such rugs for the room where you like to relax, because it has excellent massage properties. </p><p>  Before using the base, it must be thoroughly washed and dried.  The more even pebbles you took, the more comfortable the mat will turn out.  Lay them on the base in any order you like, observing only one rule - as tightly as possible and without gaps.  If you have a sufficient number of stones of two or three colors, you can lay out a pattern. </p>

The process of laying out pebbles is very similar to a mosaic.  Each time, getting up after a shower on such a rug, you will warmly recall your vacation at sea.  Well, the use of natural materials is always a merit of any interior accessory.

    <h2>  Towels are used </h2><p>  You will need scissors and a trellised plastic rug.  Cut the old towels into flaps and simply tie them onto the base as tightly as possible.  The fluffier the material, the softer the mat will turn out.  Here it is better to do either a monophonic option, or patterned, using towels of two or three colors.  It will turn out more beautiful. </p><h2>  Ropes are also suitable </h2><p>  The main thing is to choose the material more carefully.  Ropes made of nylon, cotton or hemp are best. </p><p>  The length of the rope for the rug ninety centimeters by sixty will be approximately seventy meters.  First, practice on a small segment, and then proceed to the work itself.  You can take a sheet of A1 or A2 format and draw a rectangle with two diagonals on it to avoid roughness on the finished product.  Next, follow the diagram shown in the picture. </p>

    <h2>  DIY massage mat </h2><p>  It can be made from caps from plastic bottles.  Surely in every house there is a need for the number of such dummies.  Put them in business! </p><p>  If you do not want such a rug to be constantly in sight, make it small, just the size of your legs.  Use it at the end of the working day for relaxation, and after that just put it in the closet.  Or put in the bathroom instead of rubber. </p><p>  In addition to the covers, you will need an awl and a fishing line.  Here the riot of colors will be inappropriate, so it is better to lay out the pattern that you want in the final version in advance.  The location and number of holes in which you will thread the line depends on the shape of the future rug.  If it is a hexagon, six holes need to be pierced at an equal distance.  Bonding should begin not from the middle, but from one of the inner rows around. </p><h2>  Rug from old clothes </h2><p>  It happens that a lot of old T-shirts have accumulated in the house, which are a pity to throw away.  But they have a chance for a new life.  Make a cozy and soft bedroom rug out of them.  To do this, they need to be cut into flaps.  At the store, get a canvas for the basics.  Now you just need to thread pieces of t-shirts into the slots and tie it tightly.  Of course, denser.  In principle, instead of a canvas, you can use an old whole t-shirt, after cutting through the cells in it.  Then your mat will be much more convenient to wash. </p><p>  For everyone who loves needlework for the home with their own hands, do-it-yourself rugs will be another great addition to the creative piggy bank. </p>
