    <p>  The camera of this device is seven megapixels; unfortunately, it shoots at 5 MP.  The front camera is two megapixels.  The battery power is very good - 5000 mAh.  I would also like to note that the designers of the model managed to create a minimum thickness of the case - one centimeter.  In standalone mode, the smartphone will last about five days without recharging, in working time - for two days. </p><h2>  Senseit Model </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows Senseit as a manufacturer of secure smartphones.  But the domestic company has long since expanded the range of manufactured devices with <span>Russian smartphones</span> with powerful batteries. </p><h2>  Phone Features </h2><p>  The device is built on the mid-budget platform MediaTek - the most popular chipset, but not the fastest.  Based on the characteristics, the Senseit e400 can be attributed to inexpensive smartphones with a powerful battery.  On the other hand, the manufacturers equipped the product with the Android platform of the fifth version, the phone itself is well assembled, I would like to mention separately the metal case that will protect your phone during falls and, as already noted, a powerful battery.  This brand of smartphone will cost about 10 thousand rubles, which against the background of Western and Chinese competitors looks pretty good. </p><p>  The positive aspects of the Senseit e400 include: </p><ul><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  a good camera for its performance; </li><li>  metal back case; </li><li>  official Android of the fifth version; </li><li>  Perfectly keeps battery power offline; </li><li>  price-quality ratio. </li></ul>

The battery capacity is 6500 mAh, with such a capacity the phone functions about 6 days in stand-alone mode and about 3 days in working hours. </p><h2>  HOMTOM HT5 </h2><p>  Last winter, this representative of the budget version of smartphones with a <span>good battery</span> appeared on the market <span>.</span>  Today, the Homtom HT5 can be purchased for $ 110.  This phone has gained popularity due to its wooden side panel and, of course, a powerful battery. </p><p>  The screen of this model is five-inch with a resolution of 1280 by 720, which is covered with 2.7 D glass. The processor of the phone is 64-bit, which is a non-standard indicator of budget options for smartphones with a frequency of 1 GHz.  But the performance of the RAM is quite similar to the economical option - 1 GB, and the built-in - 16 GB.  There is also an additional slot for a microSD memory card.  Due to the new integrated chipset, this model supports all known networks at the moment, including LTE. </p><p>  The smartphone‚Äôs camera performance is not flashy - the rear camera is 8 megapixels, the front - 2 megapixels.  But the battery is good - 4500 mAh, which is enough for 2 working days and 4 days of autonomous mode, in which the phone will not require additional recharging.  A full battery charge is achieved in 3 hours. </p>

    <h2>  What about Powerbank? </h2><p>  Power Banks are very common now, so maybe a powerful battery is not needed at all?  It is enough to take a small device and a cord with you to be able to recharge your smartphone anytime, anywhere.  A good model can be purchased for just $ 39 - this is RAVPower, which provides several full charges.  A small gadget holds 176 750 mAh.  This is a great compromise between size, quality, cost, power and charging speed.  And the device has a stylish appearance. </p><p>  But for Chinese Xiaomi smartphones, it is better to purchase branded portable chargers.  There is also an EasyAcc Monster for 26 thousand mAh, Yokkao starting at eleven dollars or Giant + Power Bank, which allows you to simultaneously charge both a smartphone and a tablet.  You can find something suitable for every taste and budget.  Most portable chargers are designed for 500 or more charge cycles, they are distinguished by a sufficiently large capacity, small dimensions and stylish appearance.  Some models are equipped with additional "chips" in the form of control of the safety of the device when recharging. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, the first thing that should be determined when choosing a cheap but not bad phone is what you need it for: make calls, send and receive SMS, play audio files and do something at least from a distance that looks like professional photos, almost any smartphone , the cost of which will vary from $ 40 in foreign online stores, or from 5000 rubles in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  If you need a phone for frequent calls and you need to have two SIM cards (or two active SIM cards), take high-quality photos on the main camera, take good selfies on the front camera, play modern games or watch a movie on a long journey, listen to high-quality music on the way to work or for you it is necessary that the phone can work without recharging for more than 4 days, you should pay attention to such characteristics: brand, operating system, screen resolution, screen size, phone processor, camera (for  NJ and frontal) and, of course, the power of the battery. </p>
