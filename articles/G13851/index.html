In 1983, a regional museum was opened in Ulan-Ude, which is the only environmental and educational museum of nature throughout Siberia and the Far East. </p><p>  The main mission of the Museum of Nature of Buryatia in the city of Ulan-Ude is to educate the population in terms of ecology. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.83087399999999" data-lng="107.5845845" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/4/8/5/18485.png"></div><h2>  General information about Buryatia </h2><p>  The republic occupies the southern part of Eastern Siberia.  It is located along the eastern coast of Lake.  Baikal also has an elongated shape in the direction from the northeast to the southwest.  In the south it borders with Mongolia, and in the east and west, respectively, with the Chita and Irkutsk regions. </p><p>  For comparison, it should be noted that the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBuryatia (351 thousand sq. Km) is almost the same as that of Germany.  The native inhabitants are Buryats, but the largest numbers are Russians. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not just that it was in this corner of Siberia that the Museum of Nature of Buryatia was created (photo further in the article).  One of the most beautiful regions of Eastern Siberia is a delightful land of steppes and mountains.  The nature of these places is very diverse.  The beauty of the magnificent Lake Baikal wonderfully combines with the snowy peaks of the majestic Sayan mountain ranges, with wide rivers and with the vast expanses of taiga forests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="travel.kurumkan.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of Buryatia" class="if uuid-3262324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3262324.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to note that the territory of this republic accounts for the bulk (approximately 60%) of the shoreline of Lake Baikal - the largest freshwater lake on Earth with the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
