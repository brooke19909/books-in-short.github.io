Every year, many tourists come here to swim in them and improve their health.  A unique natural phenomenon is a manifestation of natural volcanic regions.  There are about 150 outlets of very large thermal waters on the peninsula.  The most popular among travelers and equipped will be described in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Kamchatka" class="if uuid-3222477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222477.jpg"></div><h2>  Zelenovsky Lakes </h2><p>  Near the Pinachevsky outlet of hydrogen sulfide waters is one of the most popular resorts in Kamchatka.  Hot springs here are literally saturated with minerals, due to which a powerful healing effect occurs.  Hydrogen sulfide and radon are present in large quantities in water. </p><p>  For tourists in Zelenovsky Ozertsy specially equipped bathtubs are provided.  You can plunge first into cool water, and then into hot water, or vice versa.  Travelers love to bask in fonts, and then dive into the lake located in the immediate vicinity.  The water in it is quite cold because ice keys get into it. </p><p>  Everything is provided for a comfortable stay.  Near the fonts are changing rooms and showers.  There is also a small cafe.  Tourists are always warned to remove silver jewelry before entering the font.  Due to the presence of a large amount of hydrogen sulfide in water, the metal simply darkens.  As for children, it is recommended to take baths when they reach three years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.russiarocks.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamchatka hot springs in winter" class="if uuid-3222478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222478.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Getting to the famous resort is easy.  You need to catch a shuttle bus in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and drive about 50 km. </p><h2>  Paratunka River Valley </h2><p>  Kamchatka is rich in hot springs.  Paratunka is a river in the valley of which there are three groups of natural hot water bodies.  They are located 70 km from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.  There is also a village of the same name, which has long turned into an extensive balneological resort.  Most of the thermal springs are concentrated in it. </p><p>  Nearby are a variety of hotels, recreation centers and guest houses.  The local hot springs of Kamchatka also function in winter.  Water temperature does not fall below 38 degrees Celsius.  The terms are slightly mineralized, but are characterized by a high concentration of silicon.  Among tourists, the Central Pool, which has the familiar name "Paratunka", is especially in demand. </p><p>  If you go deeper up the valley, then about six kilometers further you can find the Sredne-Paratunsky keys.  The water here is very hot and reaches a temperature of 80 degrees.  A small amount of arsenic is already concentrated in it.  And also on the left bank of the river, 12 kilometers from the center of the village of Paratunka, are the Upper Paratunka springs.  Their location can already be guessed from afar by the extensive clubs of the couple.  Water here reaches a temperature of 40-70 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot Springs &quot;Paratunka&quot;" class="if uuid-3222479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222479.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Getting to Paratunka is also easy.  There are regular taxis from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.  However, if there is a desire to see the Upper Paratunsky springs, then you should rent a motor vehicle with good traffic, or go on foot. </p><h2>  Thermal keys on the Vilyuchi river </h2><p>  Numerous organized tours to Kamchatka rarely do without visiting the Vilyuchi river valley.  Here hot springs come to the surface in two places located not far from each other, and near the Vilyuchinsky volcano.  Travelers often call these sources Verkhne-Vilyuchinsky or Rodnikov.  Here tourists are attracted by a small lake, the water temperature in which reaches 40-50 degrees.  In addition, there you can admire the picturesque waterfall on the Spokoynoy stream.  Water falls from a height of 16 meters, the width of the water flow reaches 6 meters. </p><p>  Vilyuchinsky hot springs are very popular.  Kamchatka generally pampers its visitors with natural phenomena.  The baths come to the surface and form natural pools, where the temperature can reach 62 degrees.  In addition to bathing, a ski base called Rodnikovaya offers its services to tourists.  There are several comfortable houses for relaxation, as well as a private pool.  There are thermal baths that are fully equipped and designed for five people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="puteshvmeste.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vilyuchinsky hot springs" class="if uuid-3222480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222480.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get here, you need to go from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on a cross-country vehicle.  Travel time is 11-12 hours and passes through the village of Thermal.  In addition, the sight of tourists appears Viklyuchensky Pass.  In Kamchatka, it is the highest provided for the movement of vehicles. </p><h2>  Sources of the Nalychevo basin </h2><p>  Nalychevo hot springs in Kamchatka are seven types of hot terms.  They are located 60 kilometers from the capital of the peninsula, in the valley of the Goryachaya Nalychevo basin. </p><p>  The uniqueness of the place lies in the fact that more than 50 thermal springs are found on a rather limited land plot.  The maximum temperature of these terms can reach 75 degrees.  However, they differ in that a large amount of boric acid is concentrated in water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nalychevo hot springs" class="if uuid-3222481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222481.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the place, you need to fly by helicopter from the Pinachevo cordon.  Sources are located in a nature park of the same name.  Air transport delivers tourists in 25 minutes.  Some tourists even went hiking.  A one-way trip takes two days and the distance is 44 kilometers. </p><h2>  Valley of the river Right Walk </h2><p>  Khodutkinsky hot springs in Kamchatka are very popular among tourists.  They are located in the southeast of the peninsula, in the valley of the Right Hodutka River.  There is an abundance of terminal key outputs, which gradually form one large hot river.  The depth reaches one and a half meters, and the width is 20 meters. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that in the coastal area the temperature can reach 77 degrees.  Thermophilic vegetation is widespread here, which, due to the characteristics of the water, has a bright orange color. </p><p>  The hot river gradually cools down to a comfortable temperature of 45-37 degrees as it moves.  Tourists head here to swim along the stream of an unusual river.  But due to the high mineralization and too hot water, swimming is not easy. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the place, you must use the services of a helicopter, which leaves from Yelizovo.  Itochniki are located at the foot of the volcano "Priemysh" and "Khodutka".  Air transport takes travelers to their destination in 50 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kamchatka.name" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamchatka Resorts" class="if uuid-3222484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3222484.jpg"></div><h2>  Sources in the Malki settlement </h2><p>  Tours to Kamchatka often involve a visit to the Malka thermal springs.  They are located on the left coast of the Klyuchevka River.  The picturesque nature of these places attracts travelers.  Along the banks of the river lies a forest of unusual Kamchatka birch.  The thermal platform is covered with a layer of pebbles.  Thermal springs quickly make their way through it.  The temperature reaches 84 degrees, but due to the fact that the water is mixed with cold streams, swimming is comfortable for people. </p><p>  There are also several artificially dug ponds.  For tourists, a recreation center with comfortable houses and a fully equipped pool is offered. </p><p>  The place is in demand not only among travelers from other cities.  Locals come to Malkinsky terms on weekends and holidays. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the recreation center, you must use the services of a shuttle bus departing from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.  Transport takes about 2.5 hours on the way, but it should be noted that 5 km will have to be overcome on foot from the highway. </p><h2>  Big Bath Sources </h2><p>  Kamchatka is famous for its hot springs.  In the Bannaya river valley, there are many terms that have been visited by people known in the past.  Among them is a geographer, researcher of Kamchatka and traveler Stepan Krasheninnikov. </p><p>  Large Bath Springs - this is a fairly large output of more than 500 hot keys.  Water just escapes from them with a fountain.  A particularly fascinating sight is presented to tourists in the winter, when hoarfrost settling from the steam spangles over the entire fauna around. </p><h2>  Small Bath Springs </h2><p>  It is worth visiting Kamchatka at least once.  The hot springs located here are a unique natural phenomenon.  So, 5 km from the valley of the Maly Klyuch River there are Small Bath Springs, where a large number of terms are concentrated.  The water temperature in them reaches 77 degrees. </p><p>  If we talk about the chemical composition of water, then a large number of sodium sulfate minerals prevail.  For the convenience of tourists there is a campsite and hotels.  Fully equipped swimming pools offer swimming. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get here, you need to drive about 40 kilometers on an SUV from the village of Sokoch.  It does not take a lot of time. </p><h2>  Talovskie terms </h2><p>  In Kamchatka, hot springs are rather unusual.  But the most exotic are Talovskie terms.  They are located in the valley of the river Porozhistaya. </p><p>  Travelers are attracted by thermal springs that come to the surface in groups, beat with a fountain from under the ground and accumulate in small funnels that form natural fonts.  Water is rich in iron.  A small amount of arsenic is also present.  At the same time, the nearby volcanic rocks are colored in orange and bright brown due to the high iron content.  The contrast is especially noticeable compared to spring emerald grass. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to Talovskie springs, you need to use the services of a helicopter, which takes tourists from the village of Yelizovo in half an hour.  In addition, it is possible to arrange a walk that passes through the Pinachevsky Pass. </p><p>  Travelers can be offered to rent horses.  The walk will be quite interesting, because on the way there is also the Kid Pass, whose height is 500 meters.  Sources are located on the territory of the Nalychevo Natural Park. </p><h2>  Hot Springs in Kamchatka </h2><p>  In Kamchatka, quite a lot of recreation centers are equipped near hot thermal springs.  Among them, the following are especially popular: </p><ol><li>  "Malka."  Located on the Malkinsky Hot Springs.  The place is picturesque and affordable prices for tourists.
