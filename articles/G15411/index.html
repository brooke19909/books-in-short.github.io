The products of the Korean giant can be called folk, because the manufacturer primarily focuses on creating convenient, reliable and balanced models in terms of "price / quality". </p><p>  As for Samsung vacuum cleaners, brand engineers have at their disposal both proprietary and patented technologies, as well as vast experience of past years.  The manufacturer carefully monitors the market and takes on a pencil all the achievements of competitors.  Yes, plagiarism is not the noblest thing, but for the most part, the simple consumer doesn‚Äôt care where, who and who stole from whom, because the main thing for him is to acquire reliable and high-quality equipment. </p><h2>  Market situation </h2><p>  The characteristics of Samsung vacuum cleaners, as well as the model range, are constantly updated and competently optimized.  Buyers are offered universal, interesting and pretty (mostly) solutions for any pocket.  The last moment is especially important for the domestic consumer, therefore the company's products have taken root in Russian realities. </p><p>  Unlike other brands, Samsung is trying to avoid excessive structural complications.  This primarily affects cost, and secondly, performance.  Some kind of ‚Äútalking‚Äù model with a navigator is expensive, and the service is far from cheap, and it does not differ in its long service life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will try to identify a list of the most intelligent devices of the brand, which pleased domestic consumers.  The lineup turned out to be motley in technical, structural and cost terms, but then everyone will be able to roughly navigate in this segment and look for the best option for themselves. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of Samsung vacuum cleaners.  Consider the main characteristics of the models, the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the appropriateness of the purchase.  We take into account the opinions of experts in this field and the reviews of ordinary consumers. </p><h2>  Samsung F600G </h2><p>  If we take even the approximate sales statistics of this Samsung vacuum cleaner, we will see that the model has become absolute champions in its segment.  Moreover, consumers fell in love with the device not only for a more or less affordable price tag, but also for its practically industrial suction power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="can.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung" class="if uuid-2320212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320212.jpg"></div><p>  The instructions for the Samsung F600G vacuum cleaner say that the model can cope with any surface.  In fact, in fact it turned out that way.  The device really ‚Äúdigests‚Äù practically everything, starting with a simple carpet and ending with some exotic long-nap coatings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This versatility is also achieved due to the abundance of nozzles.  In addition to the usual Samsung vacuum cleaner bags, the kit includes numerous tools for working with any coating.  If even such a choice seems small or you have some specific surface, then you can buy the necessary nozzles separately, since they are inexpensive. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the branded replacement bags for the Samsung vacuum cleaner, made using Micro-Dust Bag technology.  In addition to simply collecting dust, the sensitive filter element traps the smallest bacterial particles.  Such a filter for the Samsung vacuum cleaner was appreciated by allergy sufferers, for whom cleaning is a living hell. </p><p>  Users respond very warmly about the model and its capabilities.  The device received a soft bumper, which is not scary to hit with a foot, and the case protects the vacuum cleaner properly from damage.  The only drawback that consumers sometimes complain about is the cumbersome design.  It is not heavy, but carrying it along with itself, as well as storing it, is not very convenient.  Also, some users note the high cost of hoses for Samsung vacuum cleaners of this series, but in view of the extremely rare outbursts, this point can hardly be called critical. </p><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 11,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung VS60K6030K </h2><p>  This Samsung vacuum cleaner can be called the best solution for daily and quick cleaning.  In addition, the model received a record for its form factor suction power - 30 watts.  Consumers in their numerous reviews note not only enviable comfort indicators while working with a vertical apparatus, but also ease of maintenance.  Filters for the Samsung vacuum cleaner, as well as brushes, are cleaned with just one movement of the hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="technogolik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vertical vacuum cleaner" class="if uuid-2320210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320210.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the noise of the model, or rather, its absence.  The battery pack, along with the classic vertical design, virtually eliminates noise, in contrast to the usual horizontal devices.  By the way, the battery life of 20-30 minutes is enough to process the apartment, and if you clean every day, you can stretch a couple of cleanings. </p><p>  The model is compact and requires a minimum of storage space.  If transportation is required, then you can easily disassemble the Samsung vacuum cleaner and just as quickly assemble it in another place.  Some owners in their reviews complain about the mediocre suction power, but the battery models have never been high in this area, and this model has characteristics clearly above the average for the segment.  So the designers of Samsung have squeezed the maximum out of this form factor, and you can‚Äôt record this moment in minuses. </p><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 14,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung VC5100 </h2><p>  This is a Samsung cyclone vacuum cleaner with a container, which provides enviable traction, which is not inferior in power to the usual models with bags.  The proprietary Anti-Tangle turbine produces an output of all 440 watts, which is enough for most domestic needs.  Moreover, the specific design allows you to keep a constant power throughout the cleaning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laukar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top vacuum cleaners" class="if uuid-2320209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320209.jpg"></div><p>  Garbage itself accumulates in a rather large tank, which is easily cleaned with proper dexterity.  Before disassembling the Samsung vacuum cleaner, it will be useful to familiarize yourself with the instructions so as not to break anything or damage it.  This design is brand-specific and differs from similar devices from other manufacturers.  Many users, judging by the reviews, did not immediately figure out what was happening, so looking through the manual will clearly be out of place. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the weight of the Samsung vacuum cleaner with a container.  The manufacturer uses innovative solutions in this area and ultralight materials, which allowed to significantly reduce the number of kilograms in comparison with analogues.  And if the classic horizontal models do not fall below the 5-6 kg mark, and the same Samsung vacuum cleaners with an aquafilter do reach 8 kg at all, then this unit weighs only 4 kilograms with a little.  Judging by the reviews, the fragile housewives, who are tired of carrying large-sized devices, especially liked the moment. </p><p>  In addition, the model received a fine filter of the HEPA 13 class, which ensures that all dirt and dust collected during the cleaning process will remain in the container, and will not be again in the room.  Noise acts here as a fly in the ointment.  The Samsung vacuum cleaners in this series are really noisy, and if you set the maximum power, it is not possible to hear what they say to you at a distance of a couple of meters. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 14,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung SD9480 </h2><p>  This is a universal washing vacuum cleaner ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù with a water filter in the kit.  The suction power is not the largest - only 200 watts, but this is enough for cleaning small and medium-sized apartments.  In addition, this modest indicator is more than compensated by the presence of an aquafilter and more than democratic cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvideo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best samsung vacuum cleaners" class="if uuid-2320214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320214.jpg"></div><p>  The design of the model can be called quite reliable due to the soft bumper and rubberized wheels.  In addition, the Samsung washing vacuum cleaner received good protection against overheating and a smooth engine start.  The latter, although it is noisy, but the level even at maximum load does not exceed 85 dB, therefore, during cleaning, you can easily talk with the interlocutor at a distance of two to three meters. </p><p>  The Samsung washing vacuum cleaner is equipped with an excellent HEPA 13 class water filter that can trap the smallest particles (0.3 microns).  Judging by user reviews, in addition to excellent technical specifications and a low price, the delivery set was also pleased, which included brushes for literally all occasions, ranging from nozzles for carpet to finicky and exotic wall-mounted rugs.  It is also worth noting that the volume of an aquafilter of 2 liters and a dust container of 0.5 l is enough for several serious cleanings. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 7500 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung VR7070 </h2><p>  A robot vacuum cleaner with a very good intelligence for this kind of technology is adapted not only for efficient cleaning of carpets and paths, but also corners.  Small growth helps him to penetrate the most insecure places - only 9.7 cm and, in fact, artificial intelligence itself.  Any hoses for Samsung vacuum cleaners of this series, of course, are not provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart vacuum cleaners" class="if uuid-2320211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320211.jpg"></div><p>  As for the suction power, it is at a very decent level for its segment - 20 watts.  A set of chipsets and sensors regulate this indicator, and the suction force changes depending on the surface.  The brush is cleaned completely automatically, so you don‚Äôt have to run after it and somehow help. </p><p>  The device is perfectly oriented, even when the whole house is full of furniture, protruding legs and children's toys.  The innovative and well-proven FullView Sensor ‚Ñ¢ 2.0 helps him with this.  The vacuum cleaner pays special attention to corners and squares near the walls.  In this case, the Edge Clean Master retractable brush mechanism is used to collect dust and dirt. </p><p>  Owners leave completely positive reviews about this model.  Yes, a technique of such a plan is expensive, but the vacuum cleaner really knows what it‚Äôs doing, and it‚Äôs not dumb, like a good half of competing analogues.  Some users sometimes note that the model does not work correctly on fleecy carpets, but without any critical flaws.  So the device will be an excellent solution for those who want to have an ‚Äúon and off‚Äù type assistant. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 37,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung VC20M25 </h2><p>  Almost all models with a bag as a dust collector are more productive than similar devices of the cyclone type.  But the latter are more convenient and economical.  The VC20M25 model combines the advantages of one or the other type of vacuum cleaner: the full use of containers along with high performance of 460 watts.  Some devices in the series are equipped with a small cyclone tank mounted at the peak of the handle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.1000v1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="range of vacuum cleaners" class="if uuid-2320215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320215.jpg"></div><p>  The design itself, given its form factor, turned out to be surprisingly compact and ergonomic.  The plastic used is resistant to scratches and other physical damage.  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of protection "from a fool", where the compartment lid will never close if the container is installed incorrectly or is missing.  So for those who often forget to put the dust collector in place or install it anyhow, this solution will surely appeal to you. </p><p>  Users mostly respond positively about the model.  The device has sufficient performance for any household needs, is not as noisy as most similar devices, is well protected from mechanical damage by a reliable case and has a more than affordable price tag for the available characteristics.  Overheating of the apparatus during prolonged use acts as a fly in the ointment.  So it‚Äôs not worth delaying the cleaning for more than half an hour, well, or taking a break of 10-15 minutes if you are working with an impressive area. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 6000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung SC8836 </h2><p>  This model is from the very wide SC88 series, where each device has attractive design colors and no less interesting ‚Äúspace‚Äù design.  The device enjoys enviable popularity among domestic consumers due to its good technical characteristics, bagless design and low cost.  This also includes ease of use arising from the form factor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cherepanovo.rbt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="choose a vacuum cleaner samsung" class="if uuid-2320213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2320213.jpg"></div><p>  The model received a well-designed dust collector for 2 liters.  The proprietary Super Twin Chamber technology involves dividing the container into two zones, which provides additional stability and a good level of suction.  Even if you include a minimum or medium level of performance, the vacuum cleaner shows a very good efficiency. </p><p>  Features of the form factor could not but affect the appearance and ergonomics of the device.  Judging by user reviews, they are delighted with the visual component, but the model‚Äôs mobility is far from the best.  The owners also note another point related to the design of the device.  In some modifications, the control is located on the handle, which forced designers to significantly reduce the number of modes, while models with functionality on the case have a complete set.  So it is definitely worth paying special attention at this time at the time of purchase. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 7000 rubles. </p>
