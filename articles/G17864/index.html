Perhaps their prototype was the dinosaurs that lived on our planet before the fall of a giant meteorite, plus a rich imagination played a role.  Be that as it may, the dragon became part of eastern culture, and then the mythological fire-breathing creature spread throughout the world.  And origami, by the way, is also from there.  How to make a dragon out of paper?  Easy! </p><p>  At first it may seem that making a dragon out of paper is difficult and time consuming.  But now hundreds of step-by-step schemes and methods are available, both easy and very complex, thanks to which any shape made of paper can be made without confusion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": Folded Wilderness, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper dragons" class="if uuid-2916486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107317/2916486.jpg"></div><p>  The most important thing is to follow the instructions and carefully repeat step-by-step lessons.  Usually, double-sided colored paper is used for assembly.  Each line or bend must be done very carefully, without rushing, so as not to get confused in the actions. </p><h2>  Paper Dragon Making Materials </h2><div class="photo" data-original="jonakashima.com.br" data-author=": Jo Nakashima, "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami dragon" class="if uuid-2916479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107317/2916479.jpg"></div><p>  To create a dragon, not only color paper is suitable, but any other: office, newspaper, corrugated, etc. You can also find special origami paper, which is usually sold in needlework stores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A brighter figure will look from double-sided or metallized colored paper.  And if you have only an office and a printer at hand, you can print a picture of dragon skin, which will make the future dragon more realistic. </p><p>  Even an ordinary sheet of white paper can be an occasion for the development of fantasy, because your own dragon with painted eyes sometimes becomes even more beloved by a printed cartoon character. </p><p>  Different models of dragons will need different tools: </p><ul><li>  for a simple origami, scissors, a sheet of paper and a ruler are enough (to clearly smooth the folds, but many do without it); </li><li>  more complex folding figures will require much more paper (to create modules you can buy square stickers and fold the modules inside with the sticky side), glue to fix small details (eyes, nose, ears) and a huge reserve of patience. </li></ul><p>  A big plus of origami is that this art does not require the obligatory purchase of expensive materials and special tools.  Most options do not need glue.  The main thing in modeling paper figures is paper and fingers. </p><p>  Before making a dragon out of paper, it is recommended to clear the table from all that is superfluous and, without rushing, get down to business. </p><p>  For the first time, assembling a dragon, even the lightest of figures, can take a lot of time - from 30 minutes to an hour, but each time and with each new model it will be easier to fold. </p><h2>  Simple dragon made of colored paper </h2><p>  At first, many people want to learn how to make a dragon out of paper, just light, just to try their hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Everyone can make a beautiful and simple dragon.  It‚Äôs very convenient to complete the task by watching a video or photo tutorial: the lesson is shown clearly, at any time you can stop (pause the video), return to the previous step and review again.  This allows you to repeat the work of the expert who created this lesson. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="_hohcleoTEU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hohcleoTEU" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/7/7/0/10770.jpg"></div><p>  For a simple dragon, you need to take a sheet of paper (or several), make a square out of it (you need to cut off an extra strip from A4 sheet).  The most convenient for folding is a square blank with sides of 203 mm. </p><p>  Next you need: </p><ul><li>  bend in half the square at the sharp ends, forming a triangle; </li><li>  expand and repeat the bend with other corners, so that 2 cross folds appear on the expanded square; </li><li>  to form an elongated figure, similar to a rhombus, by bending corners on one side of the square; </li><li>  do the same with the remaining corners, making the rhombus symmetrical; </li><li>  bend the rhombus in half along the long side; </li><li>  bend the resulting figure in the middle, getting a fold line; </li><li>  bend along the inside of the side; </li><li>  knead each fold line to shape the future dragon; </li><li>  wrap the long ends of the figure inward, pulling the short ends up, then they need to be folded in half and bent - these will be the paws; </li><li>  bend twice one of the long ends, thereby shortening the triangle; </li><li>  bend the remaining long end first along, then across; </li><li>  in front, turn the long tip and give shape along the fold lines, getting the dragon's head. </li></ul><p>  Many beginners get confused in phased entries, so it's best to start by watching video tutorials. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="kUsxMXwCW8A" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUsxMXwCW8A" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/7/6/9/10769.jpg"></div><p>  The main thing is to start, and then everything will go like clockwork.  For some, origami is not just a hobby, but a life-long affair. </p><h2>  What models can still be made </h2><p>  Origami dragons - a real work of art.  Right now, new paper dragon models are being ‚Äúborn‚Äù. </p><p>  You can "blind" a huge modular figure, as close as possible to a cartoon character.  Or make it from several sheets.  There are even options for moving models.  For the smallest, there are also creative options for creating dragons, for example, cut out a finished template and bend or glue them in the right places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy.org" data-author=": Sausage Cat, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toothless paper" class="if uuid-2916318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107317/2916318.jpg"></div><p>  Easy and simple dragon patterns for schoolchildren and beginner adults will be clear even to those who have never folded origami. </p><p>  You can make a legendary dragon in 10 minutes from one sheet, and it will be more patient to be interested in how to make a Chinese dragon out of paper from 1000 small parts (modules). </p><h2>  How to make toothless from modules </h2><p>  Many children will remember the cute Toothless - the character of the cartoon "How to Train Your Dragon."  It can also be made of paper.  A dragonfly assembled from modules looks more attractive. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="rtiqXcdLWYc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtiqXcdLWYc" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/7/7/1/10771.jpg"></div><p>  And if someone didn‚Äôt watch the cartoon, there was a reason to do it.  The child will be delighted that a real cartoon hero has settled in his house. </p><p>  You can use ready-made templates from the Web (there is also a detailed instruction on how to make a dragon craft out of paper): print 3D images, cut out templates, bend along the specified lines and glue them.  As a result, you can quickly assemble a wonderful character and decorate the nursery with another beautiful craft. </p><h2>  How to make paper dragon modules </h2><p>  For a modular model, you will need to spend a lot of time on the manufacture of parts.  Their number depends on the figure: it will be large or small.  But even for a small dragon you need at least 500 parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a module" class="if uuid-2942706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107317/2942706.jpg"></div><p>  Making a module is easy.  Sheet A4 is cut into small rectangles with dimensions of 53 x 74 mm or 37 x 53 mm, that is, 16 or 32 rectangles will come out of one sheet.  You don‚Äôt need to measure anything, to get equal-sized rectangles, you should fold the sheet in half many times and cut along the folds.  And you can take rectangular stickers and fold the adhesive side inward. </p><p>  The resulting rectangle must be folded in half in width.  Then again fold in half in length and deploy it in its original form.  This is useful for clarity of the folds to get an even module. </p><p>  Then the rectangle is folded like an airplane, but not in length, but in width, so that protruding segments remain.  They are bent up.  It remains to bend the structure in half, connecting both sides, and that's it - the module is ready. </p><h2>  Paper dragon: option for the smallest </h2><p>  Well, kids who have neither the origami nor the modules yet (and patience is not enough) will also be able to create a beautiful dragon, armed with colored paper, a rope and an adult assistant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artwithmrsnguyen.com" data-author=": MRS. NGUYEN, "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper dragon for babies" class="if uuid-2916459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107317/2916459.jpg"></div><p>  All kids love tearing papers, this activity is very fun for them.  This means that this option will also be of great benefit: both the children will laugh, and fine motor skills have been worked out, and the crafts will remain as a keepsake. </p><p>  And then, when the child grows up, you can see more complex options, how to make a big dragon out of paper, from modules, etc. </p>
