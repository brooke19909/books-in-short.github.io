Kaverzinsky waterfalls are not so easy to find.  Very often, tourists traveling to them for the first time do not immediately get to the right place. </p><h2>  Why are the Kaverzinsky? </h2><p>  Caversee is the left tributary of the Psekuls River.  On all topographic maps it appears as Kavjarze.  There are several opinions regarding the origin of the name of the waterfalls.  Some believe that it came from the Russian word "tricky."  However, this opinion is not entirely true, since the river has several more names: Huarze and Kobza. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaverzinsky waterfalls" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1769025.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, for example, Kobza in translation means "boar river."  And Khuarze, most likely, is a distorted version of Kavarze, which has two meanings in translation - a swan and a wave.  The boiling river waters have a characteristic white color, which is comparable to the color of a beautiful bird.  The river is widely known for its waterfalls located on the right tributary, which flows in the Tambov gap. </p><h2>  Where are the waterfalls? </h2><p>  Kaverzinsky waterfalls and a cave are one of the most famous Krasnodar attractions.  They are located 5.5 kilometers from the Krasnodar-Dzhugba highway (the village of Khrebtovoye), on the no less famous Tambov Slit stream.  This area belongs to the resort town of Goryachy Klyuch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Excursion objects </h2><p>  Interesting objects for excursions are not only Kaverzinsky waterfalls, but also the village of Khrebtovoye, founded in 1874, as well as the mass grave of Soviet soldiers, a memorial complex, and unique vegetation of the Tambov crevice.  During a walking trip you can admire <span>Caucasian fir,</span> yew berry, many varieties of mosses and ferns.  It is worth knowing that there is not only Big Kaverzinsky Falls, whose height is ten meters, but also four more waterfalls, as well as the University Cave. </p><h2>  How to get there by car? </h2><p>  Many guests of the resort tend to see Kaverzinsky waterfalls.  "How to get there by car?"  - This is the main question that arises among tourists.  Locals will certainly warn you that the road is not quite easy, and you can‚Äôt get to the waterfall by car.  Therefore, you should first prepare for a walk through the forest, wearing suitable shoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaverzinsky waterfalls how to get" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1769026.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By car, you need to move along the highway to Dzhubga, and after Goryachiy Klyuch pass the Pyatigorsk gas station and go to the stop near which there is a monument to soldiers.  Here you will see a <span>dirt road</span> going into the forest.  It is on it that you need to move on.  After two hundred meters you will reach the stream.  In principle, a water barrier can be passed by car if you have an SUV, because the water level on the road reaches the ankles.  And you can leave the car and then move on foot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kaverzinsky waterfalls: how to get on foot? </h2><p>  You must cross the stream and then move along the road.  After about a kilometer and a half, the river again crosses the path, which you can bypass or bypass along a log.  Not far from this place, the road bifurcates.  We need to move to the left side and go to the place where the brook crosses our path again.  Here the main road will go up, and we need to go right along the path to the gorge.  According to experienced tourists, it is precisely this section of the road that can still be overcome with a UAZ or other SUV.  But is it worth it to deprive yourself of such an adventure as a walk through a beautiful forest? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaverzinsky waterfalls how to get there by car" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1769032.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rest of the path runs along a path along the stream.  Periodically, water flows have to be crossed, jumping over stones.  An interesting fact is that the forest brook looks incredibly transparent and clean. </p><h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  You will see the first small waterfall at the beginning of the gorge.  It is a small water stream flowing down the left wall of the gorge.  Perhaps he even dries out in the summer heat.  After another twenty minutes, you can reach the small waterfalls.  And a little further finally the largest waterfall appears, the height of which, according to various sources, is 10-12 meters.  Some tourists at the end of an exciting trip even swim in the creek.  However, the water in it is incredibly cold even in the warm season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large kaverzinsky waterfall" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1769054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kaverzinsky waterfalls are worthy of attention.  Perhaps they are not so big, but to get to them and enjoy the pristine beauty is a real adventure and pleasure. </p><h2>  University Cave </h2><p>  Kaverzinsky waterfalls (the route of movement is given by us in the article) is not the only attraction of the region.  If you climb from the foot of the main waterfall up a specially constructed staircase, you can not only admire the water flows from above, but also get to the University Cave.  It was discovered not so long ago, in 1973, by students of the Kuban University.  It is for this reason that she received such a name.  A creek originates in the cave, the waters of which flow out of it.  The cave looks more likely to resemble a crevice, and a water stream constantly flows along its bottom, which, leaving it, forms a small waterfall. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The enthusiastic reviews of tourists visiting the waterfalls speak for themselves.  According to vacationers, this stunningly beautiful place is definitely worth seeing.  Since the waterfalls are located in a fairly remote area, it is naturally not crowded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaverzinsky waterfalls route" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1769055.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It's nice that all the tourists who get here, keep clean without throwing garbage along the road.  Having decided to see the waterfalls, expect that the trip will take you all day.  You need to have food and water with you, since you will have to travel through the forest, provided there is a complete lack of infrastructure.  The scenic spots are so beautiful that they are worth it to overcome all the way on foot. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Traveling to the Kverzinsky Falls is an amazing adventure.  The one-way road is at least six kilometers, respectively, and you will only have to go back.  The route itself is a bit confusing, but not complicated, there are no differences in elevation along the road.  However, it is difficult for unprepared inhabitants who are accustomed to sit out all day in the office to make such lengthy movements.  Therefore, when going on a campaign, measure your strength. </p>
