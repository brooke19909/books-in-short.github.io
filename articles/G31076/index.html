  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pyongyang Metro: stations, lines, fare</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although the Korean economy is still complex, the modern Pyogyang subway system, built in 1966, is the pride of the Korean people and still amazes people.  Pyongyang Metro is underground at a depth of about 100 meters and is considered one of the deepest metro systems in the world.  It was built to serve the townspeople and traveling people, to become a bomb shelter in emergency situations. </p><h2>  Subway construction </h2><p>  In 1968, a decade and a half after the war that divided the Korean Peninsula, the North Korean People‚Äôs Army, with the assistance of China and the USSR, began work on the Pyongyang Metro.  Pyongyang Metro is modeled on the Moscow metro and is deeper than the Moscow metro.  It is known as the deepest underground system in the world.  The first phase of the project was opened for movement in 1973 and was completed in 1987. </p><p>  The capital of the DPRK is one of the places with the deepest metro system in the world.  The maximum depth is 200 meters underground.  Stations are located at different depths, on average it is 100-150 meters.  At such depths, the average temperature always stably stays at about 18 degrees Celsius all year round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dantri.com.vn" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Korean subway station" class="if uuid-3225900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3225900.jpg"></div><p>  This depth of the Pyongyang subway, in addition to transport functions, is intended to be used as a bomb shelter in case of war.  The corridors above and below the escalator are protected by thick steel doors from explosives.  Using the elevator from the station to the ground takes about 4 minutes.  The speaker system at the stations often plays revolutionary songs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the new stations, a modern escalator system helps Koreans to enter and exit the metro station. </p><h2>  Metro lines </h2><p>  The subway line system located in Pyongyang, located deep underground, is about 35 km, being a convenient public transport that meets the needs of people in modern life.  Initially, North Korea opened only two stations in the metro system for visitors, and only at the end of 2015, visitors had the opportunity to access all 17 stations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="golovko.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subway map" class="if uuid-3225912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3225912.jpg"></div><p>  The first in the DPRK metro were two lines that were cross-shaped and pass through the entire city from north to south and from west to east.  The first metro station opened in 1973 was the Chollima line.  Hexin's second line opened the movement to mark Korea's National Day in 1975.  Near the entrance to the metro station there is a bus, tram and trolleybus stops.  People can easily pick a vehicle to their next destination. </p><p>  Metro stations, like many other public facilities in North Korea, in Pyongyang, are associated with the history of the Korean revolution, such as "Comrade", "Red Star", "Glory", "Victory of Toan."  In station design, this theme is also reflected in images that promote patriotism and the Korean revolution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Station Architecture </h2><p>  The unique architecture of the metro stations arouses the curiosity of visitors.  And, as statistics show, about 5,000 western tourists visit the capital of Korea annually.  Despite the fact that the Korean subway was built a long time ago, it is quite modern, thanks to restoration work.  Statistics published by North Korea show that the average daily passenger flow is 400,000 passengers.  On average, the train runs from 3 to 5 minutes. </p><p>  Pyongyang Metro stations are decorated in different styles.  Pyogyang is considered the most beautiful metro system in the world.  At Yonggwang Station, the walls are decorated with inlaid frescoes up to 80 meters long with unique themes from scenes from working life, building and protecting the country of the Korean people with a common goal - to show the achievements of the country to visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vietnamnet.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poohung Station, located on the Chollima Line" class="if uuid-3225908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3225908.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the traditional painting of the frescoes, the ceiling lighting system is rather complicated.  At the same time, it is highly esthetic and solemn.  This is the light inside the stops, and the bizarre interior design structure with chandeliers on the ceiling and marble columns.  All Korean metro stations are proclaimed museum galleries. </p><p>  The terminal station of the Chollima-Pukhyn line was opened in 1987.  It is one of the most richly decorated stations in the metro system.  The main emphasis is placed on a large mural entitled "The Great Leader Kim Nhat Thanh, Workers and Officials."  In addition, it houses impressive giant chandeliers, each weighing up to 4 tons. </p><h2>  Fare </h2><p>  Each passenger must pay 5 won for the metro ride, which is equivalent to GBP 0.004 for each trip.  But foreign tourists cannot use the local currency, but must pay foreign, for example, the yuan, the US dollar or the euro at the exchange rate.  The ratio to the Russian ruble: 1 North Korean won (KPW) = 0.072 RUB.  Thus, a metro ticket for a Russian will cost 35 kopecks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cafef.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyongyang subway car" class="if uuid-3225898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3225898.jpg"></div><h2>  Metro rolling stock </h2><p>  Korean subway trains were bought in Germany in the late 1990s and transported to Korea.  North Korea repainted all the wagons, but some of Germany‚Äôs ancient iconic drawings on the wagons reveal their origin.  However, on excursions, the guide says that the trains are of North Korean production.  Currently, trains are purchased in China if necessary. </p><p>  Each carriage has images of two late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.  Koreans should not forget about them for a minute! </p><p>  People rarely talk to each other when traveling on the subway.  Some people use cell phones, but they are few. </p><p>  At rush hour, the train runs every 2 minutes.  Tourists coming to Korea will have to follow the group and do not have to stay at some stations of their own free will. </p><p>  When traveling in North Korea, you cannot freely go shopping to avoid close contact and communication with ordinary people.  But the subway in Pyongyang is an exception.  Because in the eyes of North Korea, the luxurious Pyongyang Metro is one of the achievements in construction worthy of praise and propaganda of tourists from all over the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elconfidencial.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reading the newspaper in the subway" class="if uuid-3225903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3225903.jpg"></div><h2>  Information for citizens </h2><p>  Unlike most metro stations in the world where there are billboards, the North Korean metro station has a distinctive counter for reading national newspapers.  Passengers waiting for the train can easily follow the news in the official Korean newspaper, and many can read daily news while waiting for the train.  At the same time, commercial advertising at the metro station is prohibited, so there are only murals on the walls of the subway. </p><p>  The North Korean subway is a huge museum demonstrating all the ideals of North Korea - that is how foreigners see it. </p>
