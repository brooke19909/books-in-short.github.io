Moscow metro map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Moscow metro is not only a quick, convenient and safest way to get from one end of the metropolis to the other, it is also a great architectural monument and a huge layer of our history, showing how attitudes and values ‚Äã‚Äãhave changed over almost a hundred years.  The first metro line began operating in 1935.  The underground railway line stretched at that time from the Sokolniki station to the Park Kultury station.  Branching diverted part of the trains to the Smolenskaya station.  Nobody even thought about the Bratislavskaya metro station at that time. </p><h2>  Capital of slovakia </h2><p>  The Slovak Republic is a small state on the territory of the European Union, the lands of which the Slavs settled in the fifth century AD, during the Great Migration of Peoples.  The country gained independence on the first of January 1993, again leaving Czechoslovakia.  The capital of the state, the city of Bratislava, was founded in the same fifth century.  For a hundred and forty-three years, starting in 1541, it is the <span>capital of Hungary.</span>  The population of the city is less than half a million.  From a geopolitical point of view, Bratislava is the only city in the world that directly borders two other states: Hungary and Austria.  Moscow, as well as Saratov, as well as Ukrainian Kiev, are twin cities of Slovak Bratislava. </p>

    <h2>  Light green branch </h2><p>  The Lublin-Dmitrovskaya line of the Moscow Metro became the first metro line to be fully launched after the fall of the Soviet Union.  Seventeen stations are part of it, and they began to design it back in 1978.  The metro map of Moscow denotes its <span>light green color.</span>  Two traction units serve this area with <span>rolling stock:</span> the Pechatniki electric depot and (from 2005) the Brateevo reverse electric depot.  To date, this line is the most promising in terms of development.  The designed Dmitrovsky radius will add about eight to nine stations to the branch and bring its final stop with reverse dead ends almost to the city border, at the intersection of Dmitrovsky highway and the Moscow Ring Road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Metro Bratislava </h2><p>  At the junction of three young districts of the city of <span>Moscow: Lyublino,</span> Kuzminki and Maryino - at the end of December 1996 a new metro station was opened.  This was a pleasant New Year's gift for the residents of these and nearby districts, since earlier they could get to the city center only by public transport until it intersects with adjacent branches of the metro subway.  The metro station "Bratislavskaya" got its name in honor of the Russian-Slovak friendship of peoples and the warm relations between the two capitals.  Initially, at the project stage, it was planned to assign the name Krasnodonskaya to the station, by the name of a nearby street. </p>

    <h2>  Station decoration </h2><p>  Soviet architects A. V. Orlov and A. Yu. Nekrasov gave the station an unforgettable surroundings, different from all other stops.  Bratislavskaya is a shallow-laying station.  The two-span column structure is decorated with hand-molded medallions of the Bratislava castle and Devin fortress, a friendly republic of Russia.  At the ends of the station there are also panels depicting the Moscow City Hall and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  The floor of the station is laid out in a chess style with black and white marble.  The seemingly weightless walls of light light marble with a subtle shade of blue gently reflect the light from the ceiling light guides.  The center of the hall of the metro station ‚ÄúBratislavskaya‚Äù is deprived of the pillar supports of the ceiling of the station, since it was planned to leave this place for a transplant for the hypothetically possible second ring line of the underground.  At present, it was decided to launch the second ring branch through the Pechatniki metro station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Underground faster </h2><p>  Public high-speed transit transport of the city plays a huge role in the life of modern megacities.  It allows you to save time on working days, moving from one end of the capital to the other, bypassing traffic difficulties on roads loaded with cars.  Metro development is a top priority for city managers.  For free movement and the resolution of traffic collapse on the streets, each microdistrict of a big city must be connected to a system of movement on underground electric trains.  And this rule is mandatory for every metropolis with a population of more than a million, especially for such large residential areas as the capital of our country, the city of Moscow.  The Bratislava metro plays an important role in the structure of the capital's subway. </p>

    <h2>  To everyone - by metro! </h2><p>  If you look at the map of the capital, you can not only be amazed at the diversity of its residential and social structure, the presence of green spaces and ponds, but also notice how its multi-colored networks of lines spread out widely throughout the metropolitan area.  Almost every district of the city is covered by a stopping point, and those places that do not yet have such an advantage will soon find it.  Just look at the promising maps of the development of urban transport.  What is there just: new metro lines and lines, a second underground ring, a wide- <span>speed</span> light rail ring line, a light metro line and a <span>monorail transport system, the Moscow</span> ring railway and suburban electric trains with interchange stops to metro stations integrated into one transport and passenger network.  The Moscow Metro is recognized as one of the best in the world, has won several awards, including during the Soviet era, and in terms of intensity of use it is in fifth place in the world, after the Chinese Beijing and Shanghai, Korean Seoul and Japanese Tokyo. </p><h2>  Close and comfortable </h2><p>  The metro station "Bratislavskaya" is located conveniently and conveniently in terms of passenger traffic.  Despite the fact that another station, Maryino, was built nearby, many residents of the Lublino district use Bratislavskaya, as it is closer and more conveniently located.  Most public transport routes take passengers to this station.  Not far from it is the Pererva platform of the Kursk railway direction.  The railway branch itself separates the Maryino district from the southern part of Pechatniki located behind it and the separate Kuryanovo district.  Residents of these territories often use public transport in order to get to the metro station "Bratislavskaya" or "Maryino". </p>

    <h2>  Everything is nearby </h2><p>  Bratislavskaya stopping point is a metro station located on Pererva Street and allowing passengers to get to Bratislavskaya Street and Myachkovsky Boulevard.  Many residents and guests of the capital use it to get to the shopping center L153, ‚Äã‚Äãin which the Auchan hypermarket is located.  Children and their parents prefer to spend the weekend at the Maryino water park, which is next to the metro.  Myachkovsky Boulevard will lead everyone to the Ice Palace and the amusement park.  A stone's throw from the lobby awaits its guests a cozy park named after Artem Borovik with green spaces and comfortable benches.  Around the metro station ‚ÄúBratislavskaya‚Äù many catering enterprises were built, for example, Yakitoriya, Il Patio and Chaykhona, where you can have a tasty meal and spend time in the company of friends. </p><h2>  In the end </h2><p>  Each metro station that opens its doors to passengers is very important in a complex system of urban transport.  The Bratislava station was no exception.  It organically fits into the surrounding infrastructure and not only carries the function of a transport hub, but is also a historical monument of architecture and friendship between the two Slavic peoples. </p>
