    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Now there is a lot of controversy regarding the date of the first settlements on the territory of Syktyvkar.  So, according to one version, nomadic tribes were founded here in the Neolithic era.  On the other hand, the first references date back only to the 16th century, when a church and several peasant households were built here.  As for the official data, it is believed that the city was founded on February 5, 1780 by decree of Catherine II and received the name Ust-Sysolsk.  The convenient location allowed him to develop rapidly, especially because the city was a large river port.  The influx of merchants and landlords accelerated the development of infrastructure, and soon the population of Ust-Sysolsk began to grow rapidly.  In 1921, it became the <span>capital of the Komi Republic,</span> and another nine years later received its current name Syktyvkar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syktyvkar theaters" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/398920.jpg" width="491"></div>

Most of the buildings are single-story buildings, which gives the city some pristine.  Passing the streets of Syktyvkar, you can see the houses of merchants and landowners, which have been preserved in good condition to this day.  Parks and squares with their colors perfectly complement the picture of the capital of the region as a whole.  What are the most interesting sights of Syktyvkar?  Speaking about the best places in the city, we should first of all mention the area called Paris.  He owes this name to the French captives, for whom a settlement had been made in this place before.  And although the Eiffel Tower is not here, you can still feel certain notes of France. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syktyvkar Komi Republic" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/396972.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Art </h2><p>  A special role is played by art, which is very much interwoven with the life of the capital of the region.  Theaters of Syktyvkar every day give representations of various genres.  In addition, there are three of them, and each is an example of true talent and professionalism.  <span>The Syktyvkar Opera and Ballet Theater</span> began its activity on August 26, 1958. Then the performance ‚ÄúEugene Onegin‚Äù of the legendary P. Tchaikovsky was first played on its stage.  It was the participants of the first performance that gave birth to those acting traditions that are still being taught within the theater.  Throughout his history, he managed to stage a large number of opera works.  Many of them have repeatedly received state awards.  The Academic Drama Theater named after V. Savin was the first theater to be opened on the territory of the Komi Republic.  The earliest productions here were made by amateur actors back in 1930.  The troupe was organized by <span>Victor Savin.</span>  He subsequently became the first head of the institution.  Having passed the difficult path from beginners to professionals, theater participants managed to bring performances to the world level.  Now this place is considered the heart of the entire cultural life of the region.  The theater has in its repertoire plays from both local playwrights and world classics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syktyvkar Opera and Ballet Theater" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/396973.jpg" width="500"></div>  The National Music and Drama Theater was founded in 1992.  Its main task was the preservation and development of national culture.  A wide variety of performances and productions will help viewers understand the full depth of the traditions of the indigenous people of the republic.

However, among them at all times stands out a number of amazing structures.  St. Stephen's Cathedral is a unique place.  It is impossible not to notice it against the background of all the other buildings of the city.  It seems that the time around him froze and can not disturb his greatness.  The height of the cathedral is 56 meters.  This allows you to see it even at the entrance to the city, and the snow-white color of the cathedral seems to indicate purity and holiness. </p><h2>  Architectural monuments of the city </h2>

    <p>  The house of the merchant Sukhanov bears the title of ‚Äúthe old building in the city.  This two-story mansion was built in the 19th century for the landowner Elisey Sukhanov, very influential at that time.  Although the house was burned down in 1729, after 70 years of restoration, the descendant of the merchant Stepan Sukhanov got it.  He had to invest a very large amount in the building, but the result exceeded all expectations.  Even after so many years, the building has not lost its grandeur and atmosphere of a merchant's house.  Now it houses a branch of the National Museum of the Territory.  Describing the sights of Syktyvkar, it is impossible not to mention the "Fire Tower".  It was built in 1907 and was a two-story building with a viewing tower in the middle.  At the base of the tower is a metal tip in the shape of a rooster sitting on the coat of arms of the city.  The main feature was the clock with chimes, which played a melody composed by a local composer twice a day. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  You can describe this city for a very long time, but it‚Äôs best to just go there and see for yourself.  After all, everyone who visited him at least once in a lifetime will forever fall in love with him.  The reason for this, of course, is the warm atmosphere and attractions of Syktyvkar, photos of which are presented in the article. </p>
