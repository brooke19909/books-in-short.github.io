    <h2>  Michael Ironside: a biography.  Childhood </h2><p>  Michael was born in Ontario (Toronto, Canada) on February 12, 1950.  The family was large and consisted of 16 people.  Patricia June's mom was a housekeeper, and father Robert Walter was a street lighting technician.  In Toronto, the future actor attended Ontario College of Art. </p><p>  At the age of 15, his first play “Asylum” left the pen, winning first place at a university competition.  Also at a young age, Michael was seriously interested in arm wrestling. </p><h2>  Calling - Cinema </h2><p>  After college, he worked for a short time as a roofer at a construction company, while studying at the Canadian National University of Cinematography.  Initial attempts to become an actor turned out to be a failure, but Michael Ironside (photo in the article) was not disappointed and got a job on Canadian television. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michael ironside photo" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1146711.jpg" width="304"></div>

He became famous and received recognition from the audience.  This is a picture of normal-looking people - scanners who have incredible abilities.  They know how to send bioenergetic impulses that help to scan other people's thoughts.  With an increase in the strength of these signals, the victim’s head simply falls apart.  Such unusual properties give enormous power with a simultaneous loss of moral character.  But among the scanners come across good personalities that do not allow negative characters to take over the world. </p><h2>  Michael Ironside: filmography </h2><p>  Michael's roles were made popular as negative characters (police and military), although he also got good roles.  The actor himself believes that playing villains, most of which are people physically and morally unbalanced, is more advantageous and interesting in terms of the fact that positive guys throughout the film are often at risk, and villains only once in the final. </p>
