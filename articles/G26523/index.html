    <p>  2. The famous Red Square is located near the Kremlin.  Walking along it, you can visit the <span>mausoleum of Lenin,</span> and you can go to the <span>eternal flame</span> and watch the changing of the guard.  Also on Red Square you can visit St. Basil's Cathedral. </p><p>  3. The Tretyakov Gallery - the largest collection of unique original paintings by different artists.  There you can stroll through the spacious halls and plunge into the world of painting.  The gallery often hosts various exhibitions. </p><p>  4. Vorobyovy Gory - this is what you need to see in Moscow, because it offers an excellent view of most of the city.  The observation deck is one of the favorite places of many visitors and residents of the city.  From here you can also see the building of Moscow State University, which is known for its unique architecture.  Moscow University has a high 12-ton calm, and the total height of the building is 240 m. </p><p>  5. Kolomenskoye is a historical museum-reserve, which is known for its architecture and ancient history.  Once it was the king‚Äôs estate - back in the 14th century.  Then, in the 17th century, they built a large wooden palace and planted a garden.  And now you can get into the estate through the gates with a tower clock and enjoy the historical architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is not all that is considered necessary in Moscow to see.  In the capital you can visit the <span>Novodevichy Convent,</span> which was built in the 16th century and is still operating.  It is also worth going to the Kuskovo estate, which is also called the Moscow Versailles.  You will be amazed by the architecture of the residence, but most of all you will admire the collection of glass and ceramics from different countries from antiquity to modernity. </p><p>  But, if you are going on a family trip, then you probably thought about what to see for children in Moscow.  Regular museum excursions may seem boring to them.  Therefore, you should go on a voyage along the river on a yacht.  Such a trip will surely cause delight among children, and at the same time, it will be possible to see the capital from the other side - from the side of the river.  It offers a completely different, no less impressive view of the city.  To ensure that children are not bored, special events for children are held on the yacht, in addition, you can have excellent lunch there with excellent dishes. </p>
