  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Should I choose OTP Bank? Reviews about his work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 2006, OTP Bank acquired Raiffeisen Bank Ukraine, which at that time was the leader in the financial sector of Ukraine and was founded as a bank with foreign capital.  After the fall of 2006, it was renamed OTP <span>Bank, reviews</span> of which today are very different. </p><p>  Raiffeisen Bank at the time of the sale was one of the largest Ukrainian banks and served more than one hundred thousand customers, provided basic banking services to corporate as well as private clients, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses.  He ranked sixth among the country's banks in terms of assets and capital, and fifth in lending.  The branch network of this bank consisted of approximately 40 institutions located throughout Ukraine, and the number of employees was more than 1,500 people. </p><p>  Since its inception, this bank has been a leader in corporate business.  OTP Bank, whose reviews are both positive and negative, proved to be an innovative bank, as it was one of the first to offer services such as project financing, structured trade financing, and many others. </p><p>  The head office of the bank is located in Kiev and has 92 branches, which are located in 50 cities of the country.  All branches are equipped with ATMs.  In addition, this bank has a signed agreement with Prominvestbank PJSC.  This allows you to receive cash at Prominvestbank ATMs, paying the same commission as when using OTP Bank ATMs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we evaluate the functioning of this banking structure, then OTP Bank (reviews confirm this) provides qualified services, taking into account the specifics of the business of its customers.  Particular attention is paid to structured trade finance, as well as <span>project finance</span> involving <span>syndicated loans.</span> </p><p>  To develop small business, this bank is actively expanding its network of branches, as well as increasing the range of banking services to individuals.  This bank practices the use of modern technologies for optimal <span>customer service,</span> offers telephone and mobile, as well as Internet banking. </p><p>  What else can be said about the establishment of OTP Bank?  Reviews define it as a universal bank, which is the leading structure of the Hungarian financial group, consisting of many large <span>subsidiaries.</span>  They provide insurance, real estate and factoring services, as well as leasing and management of pension and investment funds.  OTP Bank owns subsidiary financial institutions in Bulgaria, Russia, Slovakia, Montenegro, Croatia and Romania, and the total number of banking institutions that are part of OTP Group and provide high-quality customer service is more than 1000. </p><p>  At the same time, reviews about the establishment of OTP Bank often contain information about the poor quality of SMS information, which reduces its reputation among customers.  It is worth noting that you can control the status of your accounts, receive all the necessary statements and specify the details for payment using the free OTP-Direct service. </p><p>  In addition, the frequent complaints of customers is that they are credited with a credit debt that has already been paid off.  As regards this situation, only one thing can be said: after the last amount of the debt has been paid in, it is necessary to make sure that the <span>loan agreement has</span> really been canceled.  To do this, it is better to contact the specialized department of the bank, which is able to provide comprehensive information about the debt. </p><p>  Despite the excellent characteristics of OTP Bank, it does not always receive a high rating among its customers, which is why many try to find other banks that are reviewed in a more positive light. </p>
