  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give yourself a vacation in Antalya</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is a vacation period during which everyone is preoccupied with the choice of vacation location.  Today, Turkey, a state with an extremely developed tourist infrastructure, high level of service and a wonderful climate, has received extraordinary popularity among the residents of our country as a place of vacation.  And all this for little money - you must agree, an important factor in the realities of our state. </p><p>  The main <span>resort of Turkey</span> is Antalya.  Holidays in Antalya - a place that is considered the capital of the country - is a pastime in the eponymous bay of extraordinary beauty.  It is worth noting that the rest in Antalya has received the commitment of European tourists due to the presence of a beautiful harbor, beautiful old streets and a warm sustainable climate.  Today, last-minute <span>tours to Antalya</span> and last-minute trips to Antalya are incredibly popular and are the bestsellers of tour operators. </p><p>  The resort owes its name to its founder, King Bergama Attalos (the city was founded in the middle of the 2nd century BC). </p><p>  The city throughout its history has been subordinate to various states: from Byzantium, and the Ottoman Empire, to Italy in 1919.  Antalya gained independence not so long ago - in 1921. </p><p>  Today, Antalya is an interesting place for tourists, attracting their rich historical heritage, as well as unique nature. </p><p>  Since the modern city is built on the remains of its predecessors, very little remains of historical Antalya.  For example, there are virtually no fortifications that previously surrounded the city.  An exception may be the Hydyrlyk Tower. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the rest in Antalya makes other resort features unforgettable, represented by a colorful port, impressive architecture of the old city center (here you can see firsthand the monumentality of the Adrian Gate and the Ribbed Minaret), mild climate, opportunities for practicing various sports, as well as cultural events.  All this attracts a huge number of guests from around the world annually. </p><p>  The city of Antalya itself boasts a skillful combination of the legacy of ancient civilizations, as well as the unique architecture of the East.  First of all, rest in Antalya makes it possible to see the ancient Roman gates of Hadrian, to feel the special atmosphere that towers and fortress walls give, as well as mosques and minarets built by the Seljuks and Ottomans.  And Karpuzkaldyran - a waterfall that flows into the sea, with the adjacent "youth park" does not leave a single visitor to Turkey indifferent.  This is where you can enjoy a glass of <span>Turkish tea</span> or a cup of coffee made in Turkish. </p><p>  Of particular note are the <span>hotels of Antalya</span> - places with first-class service, often providing their guests with additional services, including gyms, massages and a jacuzzi. </p><p>  Many who have visited Antalya note that the city is very rich in flowers - living roses are everywhere, since their cultivation is a real historical heritage.  This flower, revered by Islam, grows everywhere in Antalya - in parks, on the streets, even in shops and souvenir shops.  A wonderful fragrance reigns everywhere.  To bring a piece of Antalya home, you just need to buy perfume, soap, or an elixir based on rose flowers in one of the many shops. </p><p>  The uniqueness of the city of Antalya is created by numerous boulevards that are carefully decorated with palm trees and other plants from the subropics, as well as their beautifully maintained parks, picturesque views of the yacht harbor and the adjacent territory of the old city. </p><p>  Give yourself a vacation in Antalya - this place will forever remain in your memory! </p>
