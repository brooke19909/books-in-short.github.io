LCD "Michurinsky" is almost completely completed and populated.  The complex meets the requirements of the capital and fits into the surrounding landscape.  Residential buildings of varying number of storeys look very modern and beautiful, like the whole of modern Moscow.  Construction organizations are fully focused on compliance with the master plan for development.  A variety of commercial enterprises are already located on the ground floors of the complex.

    <p>  Another <span>residential complex</span> , Chertanovsky, is being built at the intersection of Akademik Yangel Street and Warsaw Highway.  This is in the area where Moscow once ended.  Construction organizations have deployed a huge scope of work here.  The Chertanovsky residential complex consists of three buildings of various storeys - from eighteen to twenty-five floors.  The yards are landscaped and landscaped, recreation areas and playgrounds are provided, there will be parking lots for residents and their guests.  Apartments are offered with or without decoration. </p><h2>  Morton </h2><p>  Among the main specializations of Morton Group of Companies are construction.  There are extremely many organizations in Moscow and the Moscow Region, but this one is distinguished by the unconditional trust of customers.  Reviews about the final product are overwhelmingly grateful.  This is the activity of the developer of entire housing estates along with infrastructure.  For example, such is the Lyubertsky residential complex built in the Krasnaya Gorka microdistrict. </p><p>  These are ten monolithic buildings from nine to seventeen floors with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree hundred and fifty thousand square meters; there is a microdistrict on more than forty hectares.  Seventeen of them are a park area with bike paths and places for recreation.  Planned construction of the school and kindergarten.

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Construction and design organizations in Moscow often sell apartments with a free layout, and buyers independently think about the location of sleeping and guest rooms.  In this case, Morton Group of Companies is no exception.  LCD "Lyubertsy" also has excellent transport accessibility. </p><p>  Construction is being carried out two kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, and very soon, a new Moscow metro station, Lyubertskaya, will open next to the housing complex, as well as two more, on the other line, Kozhukhovskaya.  These are Nekrasovka and Kosino-Ukhtomskaya. </p><h2>  "Absolute Real Estate" </h2><p>  IC "Absolute Real Estate" most often receives feedback from equity holders, which, in principle, determine the bulk of information about the activities of this company.  All construction organizations in Moscow are very active in conducting an advertising campaign for profitable and quick sales of real estate, but in this case, information about Absolute Real Estate has completely different sources. </p><p>  The most interesting work of this construction company is the city park "First Moscow".  This is a new, ecologically clean microdistrict located in the city of Moscow - seven kilometers from the capital.  This is a kind of city in the city - an absolutely independent district with the level of comfort and the degree of infrastructure development comparing favorably with the rest of the housing estate.  <span>Ulyanovsk</span> and Bakovsky <span>forest</span> parks are surrounded on both sides by a city-park.  Nine seventeen-story houses - the first phase of construction, and a total of sixty-two houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "The city where childhood lives!" </h2><p>  Another object is the city-park between Borovsky and <span>Minsk Highways,</span> eight kilometers from the capital, here the apartments have already been practically sold by Absolute Real Estate.  This is "Peredelkino Middle", where eighty-seven houses of various floors are being built - from four to twenty-five.  Infrastructure is also engaged in "Absolute Real Estate".  Six schools, six kindergartens, sports facilities and medical, parking lots and garages, commercial structures on the ground floors - all this is in the plans and is being implemented. </p><p>  Accessibility of transport is not bad.  It soon opens near the Novo-Peredelkino metro residential complex, now there are dedicated lanes for public transport, which allows residents of this microdistrict to quickly get to Prospekt Vernadskogo, Yugo-Zapadnaya, Teply Stan stations by buses and minibuses .  You can also use electric trains - to the Kiev station only half an hour by rail. </p>

    <h2>  "Monarch" </h2><p>  Numerous construction and installation organizations in Moscow provide services to both organizations and private clients.  Almost any of them can serve as a contractor, including the general, and the builder, and the operation service.  In this regard, the capital has accumulated vast experience, since the sphere of housing construction in Moscow and the region is much more developed than elsewhere in the country.  "Monolithic Architecture", as the MonArch concern stands for, has become a leading construction company precisely in connection with its versatility.  The results are high, since the employees are conscientious, the quality of work goes through a multi-level system of checks, the market needs are carefully studied, and therefore the ability to respond flexibly to all changes in its development is developed. </p><p>  MonArch is building the Bogorodsky residential complex (Eastern District).  Not far from the square and the boulevard of Marshal Rokossovsky, where this residential complex is located, there is an extensive park "Elk Island".  From the metro station <span>"Ulitsa Podbelskogo"</span> exactly five minutes on foot and leisurely.  The Bogorodsky residential complex itself consists of eleven multi-storey monolithic houses, in each building there is an underground parking (for a total of 1890 places). The entire infrastructure is already there, since the developed district, the MonArch concern has prepared only one hundred kindergarten for its buyers of apartments twenty places. </p><h2>  Urban group </h2><p>  A large construction holding Urban Group specializes in the construction of affordable housing in the Moscow region.  Despite the relatively low prices, these are comfortable and <span>beautiful buildings</span> for living.  For example, the Novoshodnensky residential complex - ten houses and thirty-six townhouses with a developed infrastructure, a kindergarten with a pool, a school, a supermarket, restaurants and pharmacies. </p><p>  This residential complex is located in the neighborhood Skhodnya, in the city of Khimki.  Residents who purchased apartments in Novozhnodnensky wrote a lot of reviews listing all the strengths and weaknesses of this construction.  And I must say that positive reviews are not an example anymore. </p>

    <h2>  "Region service" </h2><p>  This is a relatively young organization, which has been operating in the construction market of Moscow and the region since 2010, but during this short period managed to establish itself very well, having gone quickly at a fast pace from, frankly, a small, highly specialized company on asphalting roads to a multidisciplinary serious company, which they look like road construction organizations.  Moscow and the Moscow Region acquired new roads and improved existing ones thanks in large part to such companies. </p><p>  "Region Service" has a powerful fleet of special equipment for construction, the most advanced equipment.  Almost everything appeared in the ownership of the company in order to conduct absolutely any construction work at the largest facilities.  In addition to the construction of roads, the company offers all kinds of services that are usually associated with the construction of housing: rental and special machinery services, garbage, construction materials, soil, cleaning services, laying of communications, any electrical work, as well as landscaping - from design to completion of landscaping, repair and construction of cottages, private houses, apartments.  And all this - with excellent quality. </p>
