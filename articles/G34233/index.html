According to experts, the device with the declared capacity has not yet been produced by any well-known brand and should look different.  How to avoid becoming a victim of fraud will be discussed in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sportgps.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar power bank 50000 mah reviews 1" class="if uuid-3058213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3058213.jpg"></div><h2>  About the gadget </h2><p>  Power Bank, better known as the ‚Äúbank," has become popular as a convenient portable device that can help out when the smartphone is exhausted on the road or in a public place. </p><p>  Used when it is not possible to charge the mobile device from the network.  An external battery connects to the phone and charges the battery.  The charging time depends on the power of the can. </p><h2>  Purchase </h2><p>  According to reviews, <span>the Power Bank</span> 50000 mAh <span>external battery is</span> not easy to choose.  First of all, you should pay attention to the brand.  If you find products on the Internet, they will not have the name of the manufacturer or labeling. </p><p>  This indicates the absence of a quality certificate for the product, therefore, the seller is not responsible for the gadget. </p><p>  On the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù of official manufacturers, the name of the brand is always inscribed on the case and information about the company is indicated: address, website and information about international certification.  Each product is marked with an identification number - this is how the originals are distinguished from fakes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Weight plays an important role.  According to <span>reviews, Power Bank</span> 50,000 mAh, presented in online stores, weighs 200-400 grams.  Thoroughly understanding the device, you should pay attention that there are additional batteries and power microcircuits inside.  All this together should provide the declared power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar power bank" class="if uuid-3058216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3058216.jpg"></div><p>  A 2000 mAh battery from Samsung, for example, weighs about 30 grams.  Therefore, to achieve this figure requires 700 - 800 grams.  This is the weight of the product without chips and case.  The assembly leaves more than 1 kg.  In addition, the size of the gadget will be such that it cannot fit in a pocket, and this does not correspond to the concept of a portable device. </p><p>  According to reviews, Power Bank 50000 mAh weighing 300-400 grams at best will give a capacity of 9-10 thousand mAh.  In addition, the handicraft assembly does not guarantee the high quality of the installed batteries: they may fail in a week or even explode, causing harm to the consumer. </p><h2>  Solar panels </h2><p>  Another variant of the "bank" with the declared capacity is the Solar Power Bank 50,000 mAh.  Reviews say that initially the product hit the domestic market with Aliexpress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the description, there is a panel along the case that converts solar energy into precious amperes for further recharging the phone. </p><p>  Reviews of the Power Bank 50,000 mAh Solar indicate that the product does not meet the stated specifications.  Buyers write about a broken solar panel and a capacity of only 5 thousand mAh, indicate that the control panel is defective, it quickly fails. </p><p>  Originally conceived as a means of charging the phone anywhere, in fact, it itself is constantly discharged.  Accordingly, the money spent is not worth it. </p><h2>  General reviews </h2><p>  <span>An external Power</span> Bank 50000 mAh <span>battery</span> without a solar panel is also not credible.  Users believe that this is a frank deception, because a product of such power should be bulky (as in the photo below). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="external battery power bank 50000 mah" class="if uuid-3058211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3058211.jpg"></div><p>  Other consumers indicate that the model stopped working after about a week or two, and the power turned out to be about 10 thousand mAh, but not wilted 50 thousand. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be said that an external battery with such power is designed to charge laptops and is not portable at all.  If there is an urgent need for such production capacity, it is better to purchase two ‚Äúbanks‚Äù from well-known world manufacturers and use them simultaneously. </p><p>  A poor-quality Power Bank can ‚Äúburn‚Äù a mobile device and harm the consumer.  Therefore, you should take into account the available reviews.  Power Bank 50,000 mAh as an external battery has not taken root in the domestic market. </p>
