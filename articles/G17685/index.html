It is for them that mothers and grandmothers try to make the most original clothes, using all their imagination.  Every mother wants her child to look original and beautiful, but at the same time to make him comfortable and warm.  Some people buy expensive branded things, while others recall the basics of needlework to create original models with their own hands.  Nowadays, knitted baby clothes are at the peak of fashion.  The most popular can be considered models created using knitting needles.  Dresses, hats, vests, tunics, sundresses - all this can be done with your own hands.  <span>Knitted things</span> allow you to emphasize the individuality of the child, in addition, they are very practical.  And when your child grows up, products can be redone.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting patterns for children can be found in needlework magazines, to find out from familiar craftswomen, or to come up with yourself.  But before you get down to business, you need to familiarize yourself with some points in needlework, on which the quality and duration of use of the finished product will depend. </p><h2>  Some important rules for yarn selection </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth deciding on the style - winter or summer will be a thing, dress, cardigan or something else.  It is important to choose the right yarn.  The main thing is to take into account its quality, so special attention should be paid to the composition of the threads.  Often, a certain percentage of synthetic threads is added to the yarn so that the clothes do not stretch and wear longer.  For babies who constantly pull things in their mouths, chew them or lick them, threads made of viscose, silk or cotton are ideal.  The best winter thread for young children is alpaca or <span>merino wool.</span>  To check the yarn for the content of synthetics in it, you need to cut a piece of thread and set it on fire.  A thread containing natural fibers, after burning leaves only ashes, and a synthetic one turns into a solid ball.  If the main composition is synthetics, you should not use such yarn for knitting clothes for the baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for children 3 years old" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/349423.jpg?1394220253305" width="375"></div>

Natural material, consisting of 90% cellulose, allows the skin to breathe.  Clothes from it are not stretched and are easily washed.  Cotton is ideal for any season of the year, but keep in mind that it has a low level of warming effect.  Therefore, cotton products are best worn in hot weather to keep you feeling cool.  They can be beautifully combined with beads or other jewelry.  From this thread knitting patterns for children are easily obtained. </li><li>  <em>Acrylic</em>  Synthetic yarn, which is sometimes used as a substitute for six, because it retains heat very well.  But unlike wool, acrylic has several advantages: ease of care, high strength and wear resistance, lends itself well to dyeing.  The finished product from this yarn will give the child warmth and comfort. </li><li>  <em>Viscose</em> .  “Rayon”, knitted synthetic yarn.  Very soft, creates a feeling of coolness, pleasant to the touch.  It has a number of positive qualities: it does not accumulate static electricity, absorbs sweat well, and has good hygienic characteristics.  And also pleasant to the body.  From this yarn, knitting with knitting needles for children with patterns found in needlework magazines will not be difficult. </li><li>  <em>Silk</em> .  Exquisite natural thread, used for elegant clothes.  Silk products hold heat well, absorb moisture, do not lend themselves to deformation and are perfectly dyed. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  Thick threads ideal for children </h2><ul><li>  <em>Alpaca wool</em> .  Perfectly retains heat, more elastic than cotton.  Used for knitting products that are worn in cold weather.  Dyed threads do not fade.  Knitting hats for children with knitting needles from such yarn will be interesting not only to mothers, but also to grandmothers. </li><li>  <em>Cashmere</em> .  The softest and warmest material, perfect for kids.  The yarn holds its shape well, but it needs a gentle and delicate wash. </li><li>  <em>Merino wool</em> .  Products are very light, warm and soft.  Such wool is hypoallergenic and does not prick, therefore it is used in knitting products for babies and babies up to three years.  Knitting a tunic for children with knitting needles from merino wool will bring a lot of pleasure to the needlewoman.  It is worth paying attention that products from this material can only be washed by hand. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  What threads are forbidden to use for children? </h2><ul><li>  Polyamide is a synthetic material. </li><li>  Mohair is the wool of angora goat.  Products from this yarn are warm, but spiky, which causes inconvenience to the child. </li><li>  Threads with Lurex. </li><li>  Fleecy Angora.  This is rabbit hair, because of the hairiness it gives inconvenience to the baby.  In addition, things from the Angora molt. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  The Importance of Choosing the Right Knitting Needles </h2><p>  Before knitting, it is important to choose the right knitting needles.  The right choice of them and a suitable yarn is the key to a quality knitted product.  Knitting needles vary in thickness (the density of the product depends on it), in the material from which they are made, and in type (depending on the choice of the product that you plan to knit).  Their sizes vary in thickness - from 1.5 mm in diameter to 25 mm.  The thickness of the spokes is selected depending on the thickness of the thread.  The knitting needle should usually be slightly thicker than the yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a wide selection of knitting needles from various materials.  Most often, metal spokes are used.  Steel, for example, do not bend and do not stain the canvas.  They are best used for the manufacture of products from natural fibers, such as six.  Aluminum knitting needles are very light, the hand does not get tired of them.  But they can be used only for dark yarn, since the thread can get dirty due to friction. </p><p>  Bamboo knitting needles are ideal for thick or sliding types of yarn.  Bamboo itself is a lightweight and resilient material.  The thickness of such spokes should be no thinner than 3.5 mm, since thinner ones break quickly. </p><p>  Rosewood knitting needles are expensive, but knitting with them is a pleasure.  They are durable in storage and do not bend after prolonged use. </p><p>  Depending on the chosen model, the needles are distinguished by type: </p><ul><li>  Ordinary knitting needles.  Their standard length is 35-40 cm. In a set of two, they are used for knitting large things.  They have one working end and a ball on the other end, so that the product does not slip off the hinges.  Knitting for children dresses will not be difficult if there is at least a little experience.  Ordinary knitting needles are ideal for this.  It is they who are chosen to exercise and knitting tank tops for children.  With ordinary knitting needles, you can still knit a lot of interesting products, not only for kids, but also for adults. </li><li>  Five pieces of stocking needles.  They are 15 to 25 cm long. They are mainly used for knitting small things in a circle, for example, knitting mittens for children with knitting needles or socks. </li><li>  Circular or flexible knitting needles, connected by a fishing line, make it possible to knit large items in a circle and change directions.  The length of the spokes should be slightly less than the width of the product. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  Additional devices </h2><ul><li>  Needle for yarn.  Used for stitching knitted parts.  Her ear should be wide enough so that a woolen thread passes easily. </li><li>  Auxiliary knitting needles.  Mainly used for loops or for braiding.  Usually they should be slightly thinner than workers. </li><li>  Pins for knitting are used to remove the loops of that part of the fabric that is not used. </li></ul><h2></h2><h2>  Some rules of needlework </h2><p>  The knitting technique consists of loops, which, in turn, are divided into seamy and facial.  The hinges in the scheme for the front rows must be read from right to left, and for the wrong ones - from left to right.  To draw up and read the diagrams, the legend of the loops is used. </p><ul><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting vests for children with knitting needles" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/348945.jpg?1394220339105" width="260"></div>  The cross means the front loop. </li><li>  A rhombus or dot is the wrong loop. </li><li>  A circle is a crochet. </li><li>  The shaded triangle means 2 loops, together knitted with the wrong loop.  Knitting ornaments for children with knitting needles can easily be shown with a hatched triangle. </li><li>  An open triangle with a right angle to the right is 2 loops knitted together with a front loop. </li><li>  The same triangle, but with a right angle to the left, means that you should remove the first loop, knit the second and third loops, and stretch the loop through the removed one. </li><li>  An isosceles unfilled triangle tells the craftswomen to remove one loop, then sew the next two with the front loop and stretch the loop through the removed one. </li><li>  Empty square - handkerchief loops (purl loops on the front and back rows). </li></ul><p>  Adhering to these simple rules, you can create your own cute and delicate clothes for babies, fashionable and comfortable little things for older children, exclusive and original outfits for teens. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting caps for children with knitting needles" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/348948.jpg?1394136081025" width="310"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to tie a vest? </h2><p>  You can use either two or five spokes in your work.  Better to start with a simple pattern.  This is the most suitable option for beginner needlewomen - knitting vests for children 3 years old.  Before you begin, you need to make a pattern of the model.  Decide on the size of the front and back.  This will greatly facilitate the work process.  The front and back of the vest can be knitted separately, and then both parts are sewn.  And you can work on knitting needles in a circular.  In this case, only the shoulders will have to be stitched. </p><p>  We start knitting with a set of the required number of loops.  Next, we knit a few centimeters with an elastic band.  If desired, it can not be done.  Then we go to the level of the armhole in any way known to you.  To do this, you can use special knitting patterns for children.  When knocking out the armholes, the easiest option is to close several side loops on the right and left at once.  Then continue to knit straight.  And you can complicate the task and gradually remove the loop, thereby making a smooth transition. </p><p>  From the armhole we continue to knit further to the neck.  Here it is necessary to take into account the difference in size of the neck front and back.  On the back we knit almost to the end, leaving a small distance, as on a pattern.  The main work on the neck is on the front of the vest.  The neckline can be V-shaped, semicircular or straight. </p><p>  After making the neck, we sew the parts.  Everything - the product is ready.  Now you understand that <span>knitting a vest</span> for children with knitting needles can be a very interesting activity.  In this outfit, the child will be warm and comfortable in any weather. <br>  But in order to send a child outside in the cold season, one vest or sweater is not enough.  Still need a hat and mittens. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting mittens for children with knitting needles" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/348949.jpg?1394136106322" width="337"></div>

    <h2>  We knit a hat and mittens for a child </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting types of work.  Knitting hats for children with knitting needles does not require much time and effort.  Such a headdress can be with pompons, with ears, in the form of animal faces or simply knitted from multi-colored threads. </p><p>  Basically, knitting hats for children with knitting needles is reduced to circular knitting and the gradual reduction of loops to the end of knitting.  But there are models that fit in a slightly different way.  For example, a helmet or cap.  It is best in this case that you have a pattern for <span>knitting hats with knitting needles for</span> children. </p><p>  Having knitted a hat, we will do mittens.  We pick up the required number of loops and evenly distribute on four knitting needles.  We start knitting mittens for children with knitting needles with elastic.  Its length depends on the size of the children's handle, but it is better to make it longer so that the mitten does not come off.  Next, go to the front surface of the thumb.  We leave a hole for the thumb and knit to the little finger.  Having reached him, we begin to remove the loops.  As a result, there should be very few loops, but so that the hand in the mitt is comfortable.  After the whole base is tied, we loop in a circle in the hole for the thumb.  We knit the front surface for the length of the finger, gradually removing the loop to the end.  Everything, the mittens are ready.  The second fits in the same way. </p><p>  By connecting mittens and a hat, you can safely send the child to the street.  Now he certainly will not freeze, as things related to love and care will warm him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for children with raglan knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/349444.jpg?1394222282881" width="430"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Knitting for children with raglan knitting needles </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of this style is a minimum of seams.  Raglan is the cut of a sleeve of clothing when the sleeve is tied to the shoulder of the front and back of the product. </p><p>  Knotting starts from the top.  In order for raglan to work out well, you need to accurately calculate the neck.  The product can be with or without a collar.  If with a collar, then first we will connect the elastic with a collar.  A seamless coquette is knitted from the collar with an addition in every second row until it covers the whole body from the neck to the armpits.  Then the back and front parts are connected into a single canvas.  The whole process goes on circular knitting needles.  Then, if provided in the product, we knit the sleeves.  That they were without seams, they need to be knitted on stocking knitting needles. </p><p>  With this technique, you can knit a vest, tunic, sundress, sweater or dress.  Due to the fact that knitting for children with raglan knitting needles starts from the top, you can easily update the previous models: change the pattern, add some additional details, remove or add an elastic band.  You can even turn a vest into a sundress by dismissing the entire row and manufacturing to the required length.  And if your child’s favorite blouse suddenly becomes short, it can be knitted without any difficulty, opening only a row.  This will allow the child to continue to wear his favorite thing. </p><h2></h2><h2>  DIY tunic </h2><p>  Now let's take care of models for our fashionistas.  One of the things that must be present in the wardrobe of any girl is a long knitted blouse without sleeves.  Knitting a tunic for children with knitting needles begins, like any other product, with patterns.  First we knit the back.  We collect the desired number of loops and knit the fabric.  When working on this product, you can use a wide variety of knitting patterns for children.  At the desired length, gradually remove the loop for the armhole.  Having knitted several rows, we cut the neckline in half and finish each separately.  Next, close the loop in every second row from the side of the cutout.  We tie to the end of the shoulder according to the pattern and close the loops. </p><p>  We knit the front of the tunic in the same way as the back.  Only the V-neck is made deeper.  We sew the received details.  If desired, the slot for the hands and neck can be crocheted.  Our tunic is ready. </p><h2>  Sundress and dress for babies </h2><p>  The main and, of course, the most beloved outfits of little fashionistas are precisely these products.  Knitting for children dresses or sundresses begin with a set of loops.  Their number depends on whether you want to make the product straight or flared.  If the first, then everything is simple, we knit a direct fabric - and that’s it.  And if a wider bottom, then it will be necessary to gradually reduce the loop.  In the work you will be helped by the selected knitting patterns for children.  We work on the pattern we like before the armhole begins.  Then we knit the neck.  Remember: the neck at the front is always larger than at the back.  After closing the loops on the shoulder, we sew the front and back parts.  We take up the sleeve.  It can be short or long, solid or stitched.  And you can generally leave the product sleeveless.  At a sundress, for example, sleeves do not fit.  Knitting for children a dress or other similar product is not limited to any framework.  You can add shuttlecocks, sew on bows, buttons.  Knit them long, short, narrow, wide.  <span>Knitting a sarafan with</span> knitting needles for children will not be difficult for you if you give free rein to the imagination.  Then you can create such wonderful models in which your baby will look charming. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  We make shoes </h2><p>  When knitting baby slippers, work must begin with the sole.  We knit a scarf in the shape of a trace.  Its size depends on the size of the foot of the child.  Then we collect along the contour of the loop and knit the front surface.  We do a hem, picking up the loops in the first row.  To work, it is necessary to divide the existing hinges into the front and back.      ,      . </p><p>        .  .       ,       .          .         .  -   .      .   ,  ,     . </p><h2> <span> </span>   :   </h2><p> Hand-slippers will be a wonderful gift for any occasion.  But in order to tie the <span>slippers with your own hands,</span> you need to know some points: which threads are ideal, which of the parts should be knitted first, how much yarn will be needed, how many loops will need to be gathered to get the required size.  And these are not all the issues that may arise in the process of work.  Therefore, if this is your first time doing this, take a simpler model to begin with.  When deciding on a suitable yarn, you need to consider that the appearance of slippers will mainly depend on the composition of the threads and their thickness.  Therefore, it is better to buy that yarn that will contain a large proportion of wool in the composition.  This will make the product more comfortable due to its excellent elasticity.  But slippers should not be completely woolen, as they will quickly wear out.  The presence of an artificial thread will extend the life of the product. </p>
