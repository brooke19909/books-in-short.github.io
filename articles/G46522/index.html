    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first fortification on the site of the present palace was built by the ruler of Mazovia - Prince Boleslav II as far back as 1294-1313.  At that time, this building served as the residence for the princes.  Until 1526, royal princes lived here, and later the castle became the residence of Polish kings. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVII century, this architectural object acquired its current form.  Then, by decree of the <span>Polish king</span> - Sigismund Vazy, Italian architects built a pentagonal palace, consisting of two floors, in the early Baroque style.  Later, Vladislav IV attached to the castle a gallery-loggia from the side of the garden and the Vladislav tower. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the palace was heavily looted during the Swedish invasion in the 17th century and the Northern War.  Renovation of a dilapidated building is associated with the name of the king - Stanislav Augustus Ponyatovsky.  Under him, the south wing (completed in 1765-1771) was attached to the castle, creating also interiors designed in the style of late Baroque and classicism.  Stanislav Augustus, being a great lover of art, established an atelier led by the artist Baccarelli.  The famous Royal Library was also built at this time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the interval between the First and Second World War, the palace was completely restored, and the president of that time, Ignacy Moscitsky, was settled here.  But all the restoration work was in vain.  With the outbreak of World War II, the palace was mined by Nazi troops and mercilessly destroyed.  Only thanks to the bold work of art critics, most of the exhibits were removed from the palace before the bombing, and also doors, fireplaces, stucco moldings, sculptures were dismantled. </p><p>  After the war, the place where the castle used to be was empty until 1971, when the Sejm finally decided to rebuild the palace, using the surviving fragments, paintings and photographs, if possible giving it the form that it had at the beginning of the 17th century.  Restoration work continued until 1988. </p><p>  As a result, priceless centuries-old treasures of the castle were able to find a second life in the newly erected dwelling.  In 1984, the Royal Castle was already opened as a museum, which houses expositions from different periods <span>of Polish history.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  The modern reconstructed palace houses a museum complex.  Here you can see the unique and priceless canvases of Rembrandt and Matejko, the old views and landscapes of Warsaw painted by Bellotto, as well as an urn with the ashes of Tadeusz Kosciuszko. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The castle is a national cultural monument of Poland, a place of exposition of permanent and temporary exhibitions of art treasures, as well as official meetings, concerts, symposia and other important events. </p><p>  The Royal Palace in Warsaw has really interesting expositions, for example, you can visit the palace rooms, the Senate Hall, the Sejm Hall, the royal chambers.  It is especially recommended to visit the Marble Office, where portraits of Polish kings are painted by Marcello Bocharelli, as well as in the Knight's Room.  Taking pictures in the museum is possible, but by disabling the flash. <br>  Periodically, concerts and theatrical performances and performances in the style of the 18th ‚Äì 19th centuries are held in the Royal Palace - the spectacle is truly amazing.  You can find out whether such events will be during a visit to the capital of Poland on the official website of the Royal Palace. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Royal Palace in Warsaw is located in the very center of the capital city, on its main square, called Zamkova, near <span>the Vistula River.</span>  The area where the castle is located is called the Old Town.  A more accurate location where you can find the Royal Palace in Warsaw (address) - Castle Square, 4. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  The interior of many halls of the castle managed to remain the same as with their true owners.  This is possible solely thanks to the invaluable work of restorers and art historians.  Preserved exhibits such as antique furniture, watches, tapestries, ceramics - all this at one time adorned the authentic Royal Palace in Warsaw.  The photos of the castle‚Äôs internal halls, posted in the article, cannot fully convey all the beauty and sophistication of these objects and interiors. </p><h2>  Royal Palace in Warsaw: reviews </h2>
