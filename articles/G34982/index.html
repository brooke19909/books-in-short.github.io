Manufacturers are trying to release the most convenient device.  However, not every person is comfortable with a "shovel."  There is a category of buyers who prefers compact gadgets.  In 2017, devices with a small diagonal began to appear on sale again.  One of such representatives is the Fly 5S smartphone, a description, reviews and characteristics of which will be discussed in the article. </p><p>  As the manufacturer assures, the novelty meets all modern requirements.  Technologies were adhered to, allowing to get a high-quality picture with HD resolution displayed on the screen, work with networks of 4 generations, enjoy the new version of the OS.  This model is definitely a ‚Äústate employee‚Äù.  On average, its cost varies within 4,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 5s reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075609.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Fly 5S: design description </h2><p>  We will say right away that this model of smartphone is not particularly noticeable.  The usual body shape with rounded side edges and corners.  The front panel is glossy.  At the bottom are touch navigation buttons.  A speaker and a ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù of the front camera are displayed above the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The back panel is corrugated.  In the upper part closer to the right lateral side is the camera lens and flash.  There is also a company logo.  At the bottom there is a hole in the main speaker. </p><p>  As you can see, nothing original has been used in this model.  The only advantage is the compact dimensions - 127 √ó 65.6 √ó 9.65 mm.  The phone lies perfectly in the hand.  Due to its small size, the operation is very easy. </p><p>  The manufacturer introduced a wide range of color solutions.  For youth, Fly 5S Red is suitable.  Owner reviews indicate that this option looks bright and attractive.  For those who like rigor and classics, it is better to choose a model with a black case.  But for the female half, the gadget in gold design is ideal, which looks very gentle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone fly 5s reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075610.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the display </h2><p>  The "chip" of this model is a 4.2-inch display.  At first glance, it may seem that the information on it will not be clearly displayed, because of which you will have to face certain difficulties.  However, after interacting with the device, these doubts disappear completely.  IPS-matrix provides a detailed image with good color reproduction.  Decent resolution (HD) allows you to clearly display the image on the screen of the smartphone Fly 5S. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Display reviews are only positive.  All owners drew attention to the fact that multimedia files are displayed with high quality.  Also, the small screen allows you to save battery power, which accordingly extends the battery life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 5s red reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075611.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory shots </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this smartphone model cannot boast of good optics.  The manufacturer used 8- and 5-megapixel modules.  In order to get a bright and juicy picture, it is necessary to provide good lighting.  The most detailed objects are obtained only at close range.  In reviews of Fly 5S, owners often say that it is almost impossible to remove a legible landscape.  In such shots, the small details turn out to be rather blurry, because of which the color seems completely unnatural. </p><p>  Using cameras, you can record videos.  The maximum speed is <span>25 frames.</span>  Video quality is HD. </p><h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  Presenting this model, the manufacturer assured customers that the device will work quickly without any system freezes.  However, according to reviews of Fly 5S, this information has not been confirmed.  Unfortunately, the characteristics of the processor are completely insufficient to provide multitasking.  Any team makes the device think for a long time.  You will have to come to terms with expectations even while scrolling through the service menu.  Advanced users in the comments spoke extremely negatively about the hardware of this model. </p><p>  The lack of smooth operation and responsiveness is explained not only by a weak central processor, but also by the small amount of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù.  Given that the device is running the seventh Android, one gigabyte is already extremely insufficient. </p><p>  The owners noticed that during a telephone conversation the device may freeze for a long time.  Only reboot helps to bring it to life.  Other problems may also occur, such as poor network performance.  Often users notice that for a long time there are no phone calls.  This problem can be repeated several times a day.  To fix the failure, you need to restart the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone fly 5s description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075613.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Battery life is another criterion by which Fly 5S reviews get negative.  It is unclear what the manufacturer was guided by creating a functional gadget, equipping it with just a 1600 mAh battery.  Even taking into account undemanding iron and a small screen on a single charge, the phone is not able to last even one day.  When you turn on Wi-Fi, the battery discharges to zero in literally 3-4 hours. </p><p>  The device has an energy-saving mode, but in practice it turned out to be completely useless.  Users say that during its activation, the brightness of the display decreases, the vibration is turned off, but in this state the device will still not be able to last long. </p><p>  Some owners conducted a kind of small test.  Disconnecting the phone from the network, going into the browser for just a few minutes, we found that the battery had already consumed 8% of the charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone fly 5s description reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075614.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Even with a stretch, the Fly 5S smartphone cannot be called successful.  The reviews that are presented on the forums highlight only two significant advantages.  We are talking about a screen that is able to clearly display information, and compact size, making using the phone quite convenient.  But, unfortunately, all the advantages end there.  Many users already felt annoyed after the first hours of operation.  The reason for this was a weak hardware.  Optimization is completely absent, so the gadget is very slow. </p>
