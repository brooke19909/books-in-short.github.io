Collecting silver rubles in pre-revolutionary Russia allows not only to plunge into the fascinating world of past centuries, but also to become the owner of an object of historical significance.  In some cases, a successfully acquired copy is a successful way of investing.  The cost and demand for rare samples of monetary units of the period of the Russian Empire are increasing every year.  For a profitable investment in collectibles, it is necessary not only to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe peculiarities of the <span>antique money</span> market <span>,</span> but also to understand numismatics, be interested in history and distinguish rare silver rubles from simple and common coins. </p><h2>  Coins in the era from Peter I to Paul I </h2><p>  Under Peter I, the mass production of money from silver began, while their appearance was significantly changed.  During the reign of <span>Peter II</span> and Paul I, coins were minted with a cross-shaped monogram, consisting of the first letters of the name of the emperor. </p><p>  The beginning of the reign of Peter I‚Äôs niece, Anna Ioannovna, is marked by the minting of new silver rubles, popularly called ‚ÄúAnna with a chain‚Äù.  Currently, it is one of the most valuable and expensive Russian silver coins. </p><p>  Silver coins of Tsarist Russia during the reign of Catherine II were minted in large numbers at various denominations.  The price of 1 ruble of 1762, depending on the degree of preservation, may exceed 100,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Silver coins of Tsarist Russia: from Alexander I to Alexander III </h2><p>  During the reign of Alexander I, the appearance of silver money changed significantly.  Now there is no indication of the identity of the sovereign, but the inscription ‚ÄúState Russian coin‚Äù appears.  The cost of an instance with a face value of 1 ruble in 1802, depending on its condition, exceeds 200,000 rubles at auctions.  Due to the large volume of issue, the money was minted in different stamps.  Because of this, rubles from one yard, but issued at different times, are significantly different, some of them are very rare and valuable now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the death of Nicholas I, the heir to the throne was not immediately determined, due to which the ‚ÄúKonstantinovsky ruble‚Äù appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Silver coins during the reign of Nicholas II </h2><p>  During the monetary reform, the silver ruble became a means of payment attached to the gold ruble.  At the same time, silver coins of Tsarist Russia during this period were objects of real art.  On one side was depicted the profile of the king, executed at the highest level of skill.  On the other side is the double-headed eagle, the year in which the currency was issued, and its face value.  After the revolution, stamps for minting were stolen, which led to a large flow of fake rubles. </p>

    <p>  Investments in coins not only generate income, sometimes exceeding the profit from other types of investments, but also are stable.  According to experts, the attractiveness of the numismatics market for investors will only grow.  In order to invest money profitably, it is necessary not only to understand numismatics, but also to know the features of this type of investment: </p><ul><li>  the period for which the coin is purchased must not be less than 2 years; </li><li>  to obtain income, you need to look for rare and valuable specimens; </li><li>  collected collections on a particular topic bring higher income, since their cost is much more than the price of a set of coins individually. </li></ul><h2>  Cost estimate </h2><p>  The cost of the tsar ruble is determined by its rarity and level of preservation.  There are also specimens, the demand for which significantly exceeds the supply on the market, which also increases the price.  Therefore, when evaluating, it is necessary to pay attention to precisely these parameters. </p><p>  In order to determine the value of an existing coin, you can contact specialized companies by sending them a photo of the silver ruble or by visiting the office of the company.  In addition, you can determine the value yourself on auction sites and forums, which usually houses a catalog indicating the cost. </p><h2>  How to sell coins profitably </h2>
