Choosing a birthday present for six months is not an option.  In a matter of days, everything can change and a new flagship will appear on the market, which will conquer the audience.  In the same way, it happened with Meizu Pro 7. The model has not yet had time to collect reviews, but you can make a general impression. </p><h2>  Market </h2><p>  If you were asked to describe the top-end Android phone of 2017, most likely you would not forget to mention the latest version Qualcomm Snapdragon, a high-resolution display, a dual camera and a metal case. </p><p>  Last year we see the same type of models that appear in almost every price segment.  Even budget models skillfully copied the flagship design, hid metal textures behind plastic and placed a double camera module in the cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096196.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, during the presentation of the Chinese smartphone, you do not expect something supernova, because everything that could have already been invented.  But with the hero of the review, everything went a little differently.  Reviews Meizu Pro 7 M792H 64Gb got good already at the presentation.  What is so unusual in the new phone and will such a solution turn out to be successful in practice? </p><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  Meizu has accustomed customers to annually launch at least one flagship per market.  Sometimes there are several modifications, sometimes several top solutions.  2017 was no exception.  On July 26, two smartphones were presented - Pro 7 / Pro 7 Plus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Apparently, the Chinese manufacturer continues to dream of being able to stand in line with the now popular iPhone and Samsung.  Hence the name of the models.  Unlike the concept that market leaders have chosen, Meizu launches models that differ not only in display sizes. </p><p>  Meizu Pro 7 Plus 64Gb reviews collected even more than its younger modification.  This is due to the increased display, resolution.  The inside of the smartphone has also changed.  In the older model, an improved processor and graphics controller, more RAM.  All this led to an increase in value by 15 thousand rubles on average. </p><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  Well, to begin the review of our "hero" is with the packaging.  Here, finally, there is something to talk about and something to praise.  The company made sure to present the new product in a new light and gently hint to the buyer about one feature of the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m792h pro 7 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096197.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, the box has been redesigned and is completely different from previous design decisions.  All models will now be presented in black plastic boxes.  They open diagonally.  One half is made of gloss, the second is made of matte plastic.  The name of the smartphone flaunts on the glossy panel, and a protective film is stuck on top. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Inside we notice another matte cardboard box.  It was divided in half, and a slot is visible inside, from where the end of the device peeks.  A clip is visible on the front panel to remove the tray. </p><p>  Such a presentation Meizu Pro 7 M792H 64Gb reviews will undoubtedly be collected for a long time.  In addition, all this was complemented by high-quality, but modest equipment.  Inside there is a special tray in which the power supply with quick charge, a USB-C cable and documentation are placed.  In some packages, there was a plastic bumper. </p><p>  In the top-end modification, a VIP card was discovered.  It looks beautiful and presentable, but it is not yet clear why.  Perhaps this is due to the fan clubs of the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Reviews <span>smartphone Meizu</span> Pro 7 has collected mainly positive precisely because of the design.  But let's start in order.  The model is presented in several colors: black, red, pink. </p><p>  In fact, before us is dark gray and beige, instead of black and pink.  But the red case really turned out to be very bright and attractive.  In the older version, there is a black option, despite its beauty, it is easily soiled. </p><p>  But this, as you know, is not the main thing.  The novelty was able to stand out with an additional display on the rear panel.  Naturally, it is several times less than the main one.  Such a solution will seem original to someone, someone has already expressed their discontent and misunderstanding. </p><p>  Most likely, such a refinement should be called a marketing image solution.  But despite the fact that this display looks beautiful, it carries with it a functional load.  In addition to the already well-known Always on Display technology, reviews of Meizu Pro 7 say that here you can make a couple more interesting and useful settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096195.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Changes </h2><p>  In general, you can notice the changes that have affected the new items, thanks to a new element on the back cover.  If it weren‚Äôt, it would be possible to associate the flagships with previously released ones.  It's still a metal rounded case with plastic inserts.  In front, it is similar to all previous models: a small frame on the sides of the screen, large panels at the top and bottom, a familiar sensor button at the bottom. </p><p>  A small screen is placed right next to the left edge of the rear panel and a couple of centimeters remains to the upper end.  You can immediately notice two eyes of the camera, which fit above the display, a small flash.  We decided to transfer the logo to the lower right corner and place it vertically. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  Meizu Pro 7 M792H reviews put together good ones regarding details and arrangements of familiar elements.  Everything remained practically in their places.  The front panel has a protective glass with an oleophobic coating. </p><p>  The younger model has a 5.2-inch display, the oldest - 5.7 inches.  The resolutions of the two screens differ.  Above the display is a front camera, earpiece, sensors and indicators.  Under it is the Home button, which acts as a fingerprint scanner. </p><p>  The bottom end is occupied by the headphone jack and charging.  There is also a perforated grille, under which an external speaker is hidden, and a small microphone hole.  An additional noise reduction microphone is still located on the upper end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m792h pro 7 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096194.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the right side there is a volume rocker and a lock button.  On the upper left there was a tray for two SIM cards. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  As it turned out, users did not like the Meizu Pro 7 Plus smartphone.  Reviews tipped the scales in favor of the younger model.  In use, it is much more convenient in size.  The older model is not easy to hold with one hand, and even more so manage it. </p><p>  However, both cases received non-slip ends and grasping sidewalls.  In the hands of the model lies securely, even a large version. </p><p>  Placing all the connectors in the usual place, especially for those who have previously used models from Meizu.  All in all, in their places, is quick and free.  The universal button below the screen works quickly, without interruptions.  The scanner responds quickly, does not give out random errors. </p><p>  The screen has <span>an oleophobic coating, the</span> fingers glide well, and the prints are easily erased.  There are no greasy spots and dust on it.  The multitouch responds quickly, without giving out phantom clicks. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Nothing outstanding can be said about the screen.  Since we have flagship models, the worst decisions were not to be expected.  The younger model works with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels with a diagonal of 5.2 inches.  The eldest acquired indicators of 2560 x 1440 pixels with dimensions of 5.7 inches. </p><p>  On both models there is an AMOLED matrix, which is now rarely seen in Chinese smartphones.  Most manufacturers prefer IPS.  It is impossible to say which matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbetter.  Some people like bright, rich and rich colors of AMOLED, and someone is in love with the naturalness and realism of IPS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu pro 7 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096192.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The brightness of the displays is good.  The viewing angles turned out to be wide.  Even with extreme inclinations, the picture remains visible, the contrast is level, and the colors are practically not distorted.  If it seems to the user that the color settings are incorrect, you can fix them by self-tuning. </p><h2>  Smaller version </h2><p>  You can not forget about the small screen Meizu Pro 7. He received good reviews regarding his quality.  In both models, it has a size of 1.9 inches with a resolution of 240 x 536 pixels.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãagain AMOLED. </p><p>  It has a sensor that works correctly.  Although in the initial versions there were problems with it.  This screen is also covered with a protective glass.  Moreover, for the display and flash it is a separate panel.  For lenses, another module is used. </p><h2>  Screen Functions </h2><p>  Since the reviews of the Meizu Pro 7 phone are associated with a small screen on the rear panel, it is worth explaining what functions it performs and, in general, what can be useful. </p><p>  It is important to understand that if you are not comfortable with this display, but for some reason you still bought this model, you can deactivate it in the menu.  It‚Äôs easy to set up screen activation with a double tap, change wallpapers, widgets, etc. </p><p>  Notifications or weather information may be displayed on this screen.  It is possible to set up a pedometer or just set the clock.  Of course, in practice, this was previously implemented as Always on Display technology, and for some, such a solution may be useless.  But here, the manufacturer was able to get out.  He showed another opportunity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone reviews meizu pro 7" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096193.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to this screen, you can take selfies on the main camera.  Of course, you will not consider any details in it, but at least it is real to get into the lens. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  For both models, the same lens modules were used.  Smartphone Meizu Pro 7 64Gb reviews in this regard received good.  The cameras were not bad, although there weren‚Äôt enough stars from the sky. </p><p>  Traditionally, two sensors from Sony IMX386 have been used.  Both received 12 megapixels, one of them is monochrome, the second is color.  Both are well implemented, work with 2.0 aperture lenses.  The result is excellent portrait shots with a nice blurry background.  Bokeh visually looks natural. </p><p>  But still, this is not a camera phone, so cool photos can be taken only in good daylight.  At night, the situation is bad, noises are noticeable, undetailed images. </p><h2>  "Filling" </h2><p>  Well, we must not forget about the most important thing.  Despite its new feature, the phone remains a good device.  This is evidenced by its technical component, and its cost.  The younger version costs up to 35 thousand rubles, the price tag of the older one can reach 50 thousand rubles with a 128 GB drive. </p><p>  Meizu Pro 7 64Gb received good reviews thanks to the Mediatek Helio P25 processor.  The chip works on 8 cores with a frequency of 2600 MHz.  Graphics provided by Mali-T880 MP2.  RAM in the younger version of 4 GB, internal - up to 64 GB. </p><p>  Interestingly, there is no space for a memory card in the SIM card tray.  Therefore, you will have to be content with the 64 GB version.  But in the older model, in addition to this amount of memory, there is a version with 128 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096191.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Meizu Pro 7 Plus is powered by the Mediatek Helio X30.  This is a ten-core processor with a frequency of 2.5 GHz.  Responsible for the graphics is IMG PowerVR.  RAM in this case is 6 GB. </p><p>  If you can not decide which option to choose, the battery capacity will probably help you.  In the younger model, it is 3000 mAh, in the older - 3500 mAh.  Although taking into account the difference in screen sizes, then, most likely, the operating time will be the same. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not easy to find Meizu Pro 7 reviews from real buyers.  Since the phone was recently presented, not many people managed to buy it yet.  Professional reviewers help make up the overall impression. </p><p>  Of the advantages, you can definitely distinguish a good build and quality materials.  The display was also not bad in both versions.  Autonomy may not be enough for everyone, although the phone can easily "live" a working day. </p><p>  Technical specifications were also not bad.  The smartphone copes with all daily tasks, surfing the Internet.  Supports all newfangled games on high graphics settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu pro 7 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2096190.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of the shortcomings noted the high cost, which is caused by a new chip.  Some did not like the lack of the ability to install a memory card.  You can also name the quality of photography in the dark.  Perhaps someone noticed the lack of NFC. </p><p>  Otherwise, we have two cool smartphones, with an interesting design solution.  Even if you close your eyes to the marketing move, the technical component of both phones is at a high level.  Productive smartphones quickly cope with the tasks and requirements of the modern user. </p>
