As practice shows, during rest, unpleasant situations associated with poor health can occur, and also a tourist can get a banal injury.  In this situation, the tourist must take advantage of pre-arranged insurance.  Next, we consider the main features of the policy and the nuances that should be taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.propertyturkey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance to Turkey" class="if uuid-2869528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869528.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to buy insurance? </h2><p>  Many tourists who plan their trip to Turkey are worried about the need to buy insurance.  Practice shows that novice travelers prefer to abandon this opportunity, and experienced tourists make it mandatory.  What is the reason for this?  As they themselves note in their reviews, primarily with the fact that insurance provides a whole range of opportunities and additional guarantees of assistance in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  Persons who plan to stay within the country for more than a year need to draw up this document without fail - this requirement has been established since 2012. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lesfurets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Get insurance in Turkey" class="if uuid-2869541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869541.jpg"></div><h2>  What is insurance for? </h2><p>  The main importance of health insurance in Turkey is that the availability of this document for citizens and persons staying in the country for a long period allows you to eliminate possible unrest in the state healthcare system.  Also, this document provides free access to medical services of various fields, the provision of which may be required by guests of the country during their entire stay on its territory.  Other owls, Russians who have taken care of arranging insurance in Turkey in advance, can afford to contact the country's medical institution at any time in order to undergo an examination and get the necessary help.  Medical services are provided to such citizens absolutely free of charge, since the cost of the policy fully covers them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.turizmtatilseyahat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Health Insurance in Turkey" class="if uuid-2869530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869530.jpg"></div><h2>  For whom insurance is required </h2><p>  Who needs insurance in Turkey?  Among those persons, except citizens of the country, are those who plan to stay in the state for 12 months or more, as well as migrants who have arrived in the country for the purpose of employment.  Persons who are on a business trip or with the goal of developing their own business also require an insurance policy. </p><p>  Special attention in the country is drawn to those who came to marry a Turkish citizen, as well as those who applied for a residence permit in the country - insurance is also compulsory for them, allowing you to use the full range of medical services. </p><h2>  What does </h2><p>  It should be noted that the effect of insurance in Turkey extends to a rather wide range of cases, but by no means to all situations requiring medical intervention. </p><p>  The insurance issued by tourists before <span>traveling to Turkey is</span> able to cover all types of services that are provided in state hospitals in cities of the country.  So, tourists can even treat her for the treatment of diseases of a chronic nature.  Moreover, all medicines prescribed by a doctor are included in its price.  However, all of the listed rules apply only to those tourists who draw up state insurance.  In the event that the traveler purchases a policy in a private company, as Russians often do before leaving for the country, you should first consult with an agent regarding the conditions of the document.  As practice shows, such documents do not cover the costs associated with the treatment of chronic, sexually transmitted diseases, as well as injuries that were received as a result of participation in public events.  So, if the disease belongs to these categories, then for its treatment, most likely, you will have to pay on your own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best insurance companies </h2><p>  Currently, there are a large number of insurance companies operating in the market that can offer tourists to take out insurance in Turkey.  The reviews about their work left by tourists highlight a certain list of companies that can offer the most reliable guarantees, and also exist for quite some time on the market.  Of these, the most popular is Ankara Sigorta, which has been operating since 1936.  The reviews of this company say that its biggest advantage is the possibility of providing insurance covering almost all pharmaceutical waste within the country.  This is due to the fact that Ankara Sigorta is actively cooperating with most of the companies that exist in the Turkish market. </p><p>  Acƒ±badem Sigorta, according to tourists from Russia, is a company that allows you to cover all medical expenses to people staying in Turkey.  But that is not all.  It turns out that the policy can be monitored online, which is very convenient.  Acƒ±badem Sigorta is not the largest company, however, according to Russians, it is very reliable. </p><p>  When choosing an organization where you can buy insurance for traveling to Turkey, many travelers recommend paying attention to the Reliable Company company.  This organization inspires confidence in the fact that it has been operating in the market for a long time (since 1960) and fully fulfills all its obligations to customers.  It has more than 1000 branches throughout the state, which in itself speaks of the level of organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The advantage of all the listed companies also lies in the fact that they all have a fairly wide coverage area, which means that there is a wide range of services, the cost of which is covered by the policy, both in state and private clinics in Turkey. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.compassbenefits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance to turkey reviews" class="if uuid-2869536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869536.jpg"></div><h2>  About package insurance </h2><p>  Considering the topic of insurance in Turkey, you need to pay attention to their separate group - package offers.  These offers are usually included in the price of the tour and are offered to travelers under the guise of its obligatory element. </p><p>  Reviews of this type of insurance say that they are far from the best option, as they provide for the coverage of a minimum number of insurance cases.  So, in the number of insurance events provided for them, injuries sustained during outdoor activities are never included.  In other words, if a tourist unsuccessfully slides down the hill at the water park and gets injured as a result, payment for his treatment will not be covered by insurance - the traveler will have to pay from personal funds. </p><p>  Packaged insurance medical services, according to tourists, are of poor quality.  In the comments left by tourists, it is often said that the provision of necessary assistance to its owners is rather slow, and for the implementation of any actions by doctors, confirmation from the insurance company is required, which usually comes after a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbn.org.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which insurance to choose in Turkey" class="if uuid-2869538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869538.jpg"></div><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Do I need insurance in Turkey for a child?  It should be noted that its registration is not required, however, if you wish, tourists can take care of the safety of their baby‚Äôs health in this exotic country in advance.  In the reviews of tourists about different types of policies, it is said that the best insurance option in Turkey for a child can be purchased at Euro-Center Holding (ERV).  It should be noted that the policy from this company specifically offers its customers the greatest number of options useful to tourists in this country.  By the way, among its main elements there is no deductible.  Tourists consider its cost to be a big plus of this insurance - it does not exceed that which is set for an adult, which cannot be found in offers of other companies. </p><p>  This insurance is also suitable for pregnant women, since the list of insurance events covered by it includes complications that may accompany this condition. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  Insurance of the most reliable companies includes not only coverage of cases related to health problems, but also some other options that you should pay attention to.  These may include cases of loss of luggage, as well as travel restrictions.  In addition, when studying the conditions of the insurance policy, you should definitely clarify whether it covers the costs associated with accidents that occurred during active sports - in decent companies this item is automatically included in the policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.studenthealthusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel Insurance for Turkey" class="if uuid-2869534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869534.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of the insurance policy may vary depending on various factors.  So, among them, we must first highlight the breadth of the list of insurance claims covered by it, as well as the validity of the policy.  Moreover, the gender and age of the tourist affect the price of insurance in Turkey. </p><p>  As practice shows, the average cost of a policy for young men is about 7000, and for women - 6200 rubles.  If we consider travelers of a more mature age, then the cost of their health insurance is about 15,000 rubles for men and the same for women. </p><h2>  Insurance Nuances </h2><p>  It should be noted that there are certain nuances that must be taken into account during the acquisition of the policy and its use.  So, experienced tourists do not recommend concluding an agreement with an insurance company if the total amount of coverage for it is less than $ 50,000.  Practice shows that most prestigious companies do not enter into transactions with a smaller amount. </p><p>  In the event that a blood alcohol is detected in a tourist upon the occurrence of an insured event, there is no provision for repaying expenses at the expense of the policy - these are the rules. </p><p>  What insurance in Turkey to choose?  Experienced tourists do not recommend using those offers, the terms of which provide for reimbursement of expenses after the traveler returns to Russia - only scammers work this way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.memphistours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need insurance in Turkey" class="if uuid-2869532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2869532.jpg"></div><h2>  How to deal with an insured event </h2><p>  If insurance is issued for a trip to Turkey, the tourist should clarify the conditions for its use and the procedure for covering costs.  So, with the onset of the case covered by the insurance company, the vacationer must contact the assistance company and report what happened.  After that, the company should send a response indicating the hospital to which you should go.  Next, the tourist should go to the specified clinic for treatment.  Payment for services provided by doctors should not be charged.  In the event of any disputes, the tourist needs to contact the staff of the UK to clarify issues of interest. </p>
