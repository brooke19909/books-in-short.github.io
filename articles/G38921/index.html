This is due to the huge number of model lines of devices from this manufacturer, as well as different costs. </p><p>  The smartphones of this company have always been popular due to their quality and reliability.  However, due to the fact that Apple also cares about the safety and originality of its software products, there are some difficulties with the use of iTunes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Delete music on iPhone via iTunes" class="if uuid-2992136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992136.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth spending some free time to understand this utility.

In the article we will consider different ways and all the features. </p><h2>  How to delete music through the iTunes app?  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How to remove music from iPhone in "iTunes"?  To do this, do the following steps: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove music from iPhone in ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù" class="if uuid-2992134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992134.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Go to ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù through a computer (if you don‚Äôt have ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù on your PC yet, install it from the official Apple website). </li><li>  Select the Music section. </li><li>  Click the "My Music" tab. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúSongs‚Äù tab, in the ‚ÄúMedia Library‚Äù block (it is on the left side of the ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù program window). </li><li>  Among the musical compositions that appeared, find the right one and call the context menu (right-click on this music track). </li><li>  In the context menu, find and click on the "Delete" operation. </li><li>  In the pop-up window confirming the completion of the delete operation, click "Confirm". </li><li>  At this point, the song was deleted from the library, but not from the memory of your iPhone.

Just do not forget to do synchronization with the iPhone after making any changes to the PC. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to delete music via iPhone" class="if uuid-2992138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992138.jpg"></div><h2>  Delete songs on your device </h2><p>  How to delete music via iPhone?  You can delete music on your gadget without using the iTunes program on your computer.  To do this, just do the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Find and open the Music application built into the iPhone (located in the iPhone‚Äôs main menu). </li><li>  You will see the whole list of music files that are in the gadget's memory. </li><li>  Find in this list of music that you want to delete. </li><li>  At the level of the desired music track, swipe your finger across the screen from right to left (swipe). </li><li>  You will see a red button with the word "Delete."  Click on it.  All is ready.  The deleted music track is no longer on your iPhone.  However, it should be borne in mind that this option is effective in removing one or more compositions.  In order to delete music files on your device, you must resort to another method. </li></ol><h2>  Tip </h2><p>  Remember that with this method, music is deleted only from the memory of your gadget.  If this track was in the Isilad data warehouse, then it will remain there, taking the storage place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ikream.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove music from iPhone via iTunes" class="if uuid-2992127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992127.jpg"></div><h2>  Delete all music from your iPhone.  User Recommendations </h2><p>  If you suddenly needed to clear a place on your iPhone and delete all the music on it, then this can be done using the built-in function in the settings. </p><p>  Instructions for removing all music from the device: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Open the "Settings" menu in the iPhone itself, select the "Basic" section there and click on the "Statistics" tab. </li><li>  Then you need to wait a bit until the iPhone downloads all the data on it. </li><li>  At the end of the download, you will see all the data on the iPhone‚Äôs memory (which application and how much memory it takes on your device).  Click on "Music". </li><li>  After that, a kind of context menu with the line "All music" will open.  Swipe right-left on this line.  Next, click on the red button that appears with the word "Delete."  All is ready.  Now on your iPhone, the entire music collection has been deleted.  All music tracks downloaded from Aiklad were also deleted.  Be careful when using the above method.  It will be possible to restore music on an iPhone only through the "iTunes" program installed on the computer (by the last synchronization with the gadget). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove old music from iPhone" class="if uuid-2992163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992163.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remove old music from an iPhone through ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù, leaving it in the media library? </h2><p>  Suppose you don‚Äôt want to delete tracks from your device at all.

Click on the "Sync" button, which is located at the bottom of the iTunes program window.  Here's how to remove music from an iPhone through iTunes.  Now only the selected tracks will remain on the iPhone, while none of the other tracks will be deleted.  All tracks will be saved to your iTunes library on your computer. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.energizeshanti.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove track from iPhone via iTunes" class="if uuid-2992151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2992151.jpg"></div><h2>  What is better to use to delete iTunes tracks or the Music program on the gadget? </h2><p>  We‚Äôve already figured out how to remove music from an iPhone through iTunes and the Music menu.  Now let's talk about when and which method is better to apply.  The simplest method of removal can be done through the program "Music" in the smartphone itself.  However, this application is convenient for deleting one or more musical compositions.  At the same time, music downloaded using iCloud will also be deleted only from the device, but not from the storage of this service.  That is why the most reliable way is to delete music from an iPhone via a computer by synchronizing the device with the iTunes program. </p><p>  In this case, you can delete the music on the iPhone (via iTunes) selectively, saving all other songs in the memory of the library.  Another plus is the ability to return deleted music tracks through the latest sync in iTunes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to delete music from iPhone via iTunes.  The article examined in detail the main ways to delete tracks from the device using this utility.  We hope that the tips in this article will help you. </p>
