    <h2>  Tourists in Finland </h2><p>  The city of Helsinki, whose attractions do not leave anyone indifferent, is an ideal place for tourists coming to the capital of Finland from all over the world.  Architectural masterpieces, historical monuments, rarities, as an integral part of world culture - all this attracts travelers. </p><p>  Helsinki sights with a description of their history are included in numerous sightseeing tours.  Guides that can be purchased at any kiosk will help you plan visits.  The city of Helsinki, the sights of which can be seen again and again, is a welcoming and hospitable place.  Impressions after the excursions will remain for a long time.  And since it is impossible to visit all exhibitions, museums, fairs and attend many other events in Helsinki in one visit, a second visit to Suomi is quite possible as part of a tourist trip. </p><p>  Helsinki sights with a description of their history, architectural masterpieces and much more have made the capital of Finland a kind of mecca of tourism.  Most cultural sites are located in the very center of the city; getting to know them does not present difficulties associated with movement, as is the case in other <span>European cities.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you need to visit tourist sites in districts distant from the center, then public transport is at your disposal, perfectly organized service for quick movement.  Trams in the capital of Finland and in other cities of the country are subject to a per-minute schedule for following a route that is never violated.  Comfortable wagons will deliver you to your destination, quickly and comfortably.  Traveling by public transport is quite expensive, but if you purchase a ticket for several landings, then the fare is significantly reduced.  In addition, the transport system in Helsinki has a group travel system, when several people travel on the same general ticket, and this method also costs relatively cheap. </p>

    <p>  Helsinki's architectural masterpieces, attractions that have been appreciated by grateful tourists for many decades, occupy first positions in the ranking of world architecture.  Many buildings in the cities of Finland combine several styles at once, but the combination of neoclassicism and, for example, modernism is so organic that it creates the impression of some kind of new architecture.  Later areas of architecture are represented by the Hi-Tech Center in the Ruoholahti area, the Sanomatalo building and the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art. </p><h2>  Finland, Helsinki sights in winter </h2><p>  The countries of Scandinavia have a number of northern mainland characteristics.  Sweden, Norway and Denmark are three Scandinavian countries (geographically).  When Scandinavia is mentioned together with Finland, it is already called Fennoscandia. </p><p>  Helsinki sights in winter are special tourist trips around the country.  Dog sledding, a light sleigh running a musher, deer racing - all this makes up an interesting range of winter pastimes.  What is the residence of Santa Claus in Lapland, the northernmost province of Finland, which is open to everyone who wants to visit the magical Santa Park.  And after riding in the rides, you can go to Mrs. Klaus‚Äôs Gingerbread Kitchen and try some fragrant cookies. </p><p>  In Helsinki, the sights in winter (the reviews of tourists are exceptionally positive) look special, the snow-white plains around, the dazzling purity of snow is fascinating.  Even architectural masterpieces look unusual under the snow. </p>
