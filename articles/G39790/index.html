His <span>life path</span> several times abruptly changed direction.  A tough, strong-willed person who does not admit difficulties is what Joseph Stalin was.  His biography was described by a variety of people.  I.V. <span>Dzhugashvili</span> was accused of having ties with the tsarist secret police and of betrayal.  But, in spite of everything, the USSR was at the peak of its economic and military power at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, and it was Stalin who made a considerable contribution to this.  A brief biography, presented below, is unlikely to fully describe the talent of this person.

    <p>  On December 18, 1878, Joseph Stalin was born in the small Georgian village of Gori.  At ten years old he entered the theological seminary, where he showed himself from the best side, and on the advice of teachers at the age of 16 he went to study at the theological seminary in the city of Tiflis. </p><p>  In 1897, young Dzhugashvili learned about Marxism.  From that moment on, his fate began to change dramatically.  A year later, in August 1898, he became a member of Mesame Dasi, a small social democratic organization, and already in the fall of 1901, I.V. Dzhugashvili became a member of the committee of the RSDLP of the city of Tiflis.  There he took the name of Kob in honor of one of the heroes of the novel by Alexander Kazbegi.  After the second congress of the RSDLP, there was a split in the organization, the party was divided into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.  Koba took the side of the former, their principles and norms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Party comrades characterized Stalin as an unprincipled revolutionary: the matter was much more important for him, and people were only a means to an end.  His acquaintance with Lenin in 1905 made an unpleasant impression on him: Stalin was disappointed in the Leader as a man.  By 1917, a significant part of the population of Russia was already inclined to the Bolshevik movement.  At this time, Stalin, along with Kamenev, headed the newspaper Pravda. </p><p>  During the <span>Civil War,</span> Stalin was appointed head of the food department in the south.  The confusion of the civil war allowed Kobe to intervene in virtually any military decision.  Stalin had the largest number of acquaintances - both with local party and <span>Soviet leaders.</span> </p><p>  Dzhugashvili entered the Soviet government as the People‚Äôs Commissar for Nationalities.  His desire to centralize power led to numerous conflicts with the leaders of Georgia and Ukraine. </p>

After the death of V.I. Lenin, Koba appeared before the people as his successor.  In his farewell speech, he spoke on behalf of the party and people.  He was supported by friends whom Koba appointed to high posts in the apparatus of governing the country.

People, as he understood it, were pawns.  They had to either die or complete the task.  His collectivization program sparked a wave of protests.  The dispossessed peasants gathered in gangs and went into the woods. </p><p>  In the same way, Stalin led the political struggle.  All the increasing talk of his removal from office was voiced at the XVII Congress of the CPSU (B.).  The surname of Kirov was also pronounced on it.  The shot sounded on the first day of winter 1931 interrupted the life of a man who could replace Stalin at his post.  Koba accused his long-standing opponents of Zinoviev and Kamenev of the murder. </p><p>  The so-called purge that began after this process affected about four to five million people, of which about 10 percent were shot.  The "population" of the Gulag Archipelago at that time was about 13 million people.  Against the backdrop of such events, the name of Stalin was praised.  He was extolled as a true savior of the people: the so-called <span>cult of personality appeared.</span> </p><p>  By 1939, the purge was completed, Stalin turned his eyes to foreign policy.  The USSR was faced with a choice: to go closer to Britain and France, who did not at all seek to get closer, to remain alone or to agree with Hitler.  The last option turned out to be the most profitable.  The war was postponed for two whole years.  The training of military personnel began, then the first consequences of the purge, which manifested itself in a shortage of senior command personnel, were revealed.  The rearmament of the army was carried out slowly, the factories only mastered new production. </p><p>  The outbreak of the war completely drove I.V. Dzhugashvili out of a rut, for a month the army was virtually without leadership.  At this time, Stalin was depressed, he was in severe psychological shock.  He had to work 18 hours a day, his face was haggard, his character became angry and irritable.  Not being a good strategist, he studied the basics of military art under Zhukov, Shaposhnikov and other military leaders.  After the victory of the USSR over Nazi Germany, the Leader of the Peoples, as they called Stalin, had several more striking epithets: ‚Äúthe greatest commander‚Äù, ‚Äúwise strategist‚Äù. </p>

His pressure increased, and the fear of conspiracy turned into a mania.  He did not admit doctors to him, because he did not trust them and was afraid of them.  Shaky nerves and a weak heart caused the death of Joseph Stalin at the age of 75.

    <p>  Joseph Stalin - his biography will be completely rewritten, his name will be doused with dirt and a lot of myths will be invented that expose this person in an unattractive light.  But be that as it may, the people already lived not in a poor, ruined country, but in a superpower, dictating its conditions to dozens of countries around the world.  In the XX century there was no more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù leader of the country than Stalin.  His biography, written by <span>Arsen Martirosyan,</span> dispels most of the myths about the life and actions of this person.  He ruled the country harshly, but cruel times required it.  There were many mistakes in Koba‚Äôs life, and most of them were paid for with the blood of ordinary people.  But from a devastated country, he built a great superpower that triumphed in World War II and prepared for spacewalks. </p>
