  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a whale lens, or answers to the most frequently asked questions when choosing the first SLR camera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sooner or later, a novice photographer or an advanced amateur photographer decides to take such a crucial and important step as acquiring the first SLR camera.  But at the same moment several questions arise before him at once.  Which manufacturer should I prefer?  To get a "carcass", and then separately purchase a lens or buy a "kit"?  Is it worth it to overpay for lenses with built-in stabilization?  In this article, you will learn what a whale lens is and find answers to other questions that interest you. </p><p>  First, each photographer needs to decide what he needs a SLR camera for.  If you plan to professionally engage in photography and make money for it, then you should not spare money for the first ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù - it will quickly return the funds spent on its purchase with interest.  If photography is nothing more than a hobby for you, then it makes sense to purchase an entry-level (amateur) camera - for shooting home holidays, trips and traveling on vacation and other significant events for you, technology of this class is enough.  And when you feel the need for a more advanced camera, you can go to the next level and get a professional kit for shooting. </p><p>  Next, decide on the manufacturer of your first SLR camera.  Much depends on individual preferences here, but first of all it is worth paying attention to the products of two Japanese companies - Nikon and Canon.  Next come the no less eminent brands ‚ÄúSony‚Äù and ‚ÄúPentax‚Äù, also well-established in the professional photography market.  At a cost of a set of approximately one level (the camera itself and the whale lens are included in it) from these manufacturers will cost almost the same amount.  But it‚Äôs worth considering that if you choose a particular brand, accessories from other companies (primarily lenses and flashes) will not work for it, since cameras from different companies have their own specific connectors and mounts.  Therefore <span>, when</span> purchasing a <span>Canon</span> camera <span>,</span> which comes with a <span>lens</span> kit, do not expect your friend with a Nikon camera to use it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let's figure out what a body is and what a whale is.  Body, also often called ‚Äúcarcass‚Äù among amateur photographers, is a digital camera that is sold without a lens.  This purchase option is ideal for professionals who buy several lenses at their discretion with the camera, as well as for those amateurs who already had a ‚Äúmirror‚Äù of this manufacturer and lenses remained from it. </p><p>  But for those amateur photographers who buy their first camera, the ideal option is to buy a ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù with the suffix Kit.  This inscription in the name means that, choosing this option, you get not only a ‚Äúcarcass‚Äù, but also a whale lens, which comes with the camera.  Such a lens, as a rule, is an inexpensive entry-level version that copes well with all the most popular subjects - you can shoot portraits or reports from everyday life with equal success, as well as landscapes or close-ups.  For example, any Canon whale lens is most often a device with a <span>focal length of</span> 18-55 mm, which is ideal for solving many problems during any shooting. </p><p>  When choosing the first SLR camera, you should also pay attention to some details.  Firstly, even with the same ‚Äúcarcass‚Äù in the kit there can be different ‚Äústaffers‚Äù.  At the same time, the same whale lens can meet with different cameras.  Therefore, if there are professional photographers among your friends, it makes sense to ask if any of them are selling their old ‚Äúkit‚Äù and thereby save a little on the purchase of the first SLR camera. </p>
