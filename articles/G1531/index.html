The device is also equipped with warmers with cartridges and protective caps.  To identify hazardous compounds, air is pumped through the indicator tubes using a <span>piston pump</span> .  There is an insertion slot and a corundum disk in the pump head.  The latter is used to file the ends of the tube.  Along the edges of the disc are two holes marked.  It corresponds to the parameters of the tubes.  In the holes are metal pins.  They provide the opening of the ampoules inside the tubes.  The indicator elements also contain silica gel filler.  It is impregnated with a chemical reagent.  Under the influence of the analyte, the reagent acquires a color, the intensity of which depends on the content of the substance in the air.  Fillers for tubes used to determine hydrocyanic acid and distilled mustard gas are pre-impregnated.  This explains the absence of ampoules inside these elements.  When working with the device, you must adhere to certain rules.  In particular, an ampoule with a reagent for detecting phosgene and diphosgene must be broken in advance.  They must be opened before pumping the analyzed air.  In the tubes used to determine the FOV, there are two ampoules.  One of them is opened before pumping, the other after. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chemical reconnaissance device" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1575737.jpg" width="600"></div>

Upon detection of OM and radioactive substances in the gas detector, light and sound alarms are triggered.  GSP-1 - photocolorimetric devices.  In the process of pumping contaminated air through a tape soaked in reagents, a colored spot appears in it.  This phenomenon is recorded by a photocell, which is associated with sound and light alarms.  Detection of a radioactive compound is carried out using an autonomous gas-discharge meter with an electric amplifier.  Automatic gas analyzers are installed at command posts, observation posts.  They are also used in military units. </p><h2>  Indicator films </h2><p>  They are used to determine the presence of V-gas type compounds at the time they are deposited on equipment, equipment, weapons, and other surfaces.  Indicator films are fixed on clearly visible planes.  For example, it is placed on the uniform sleeve, helmet, windshield, structure wall, turret or other tank armor, etc. To increase the reliability of detection of hazardous compounds, fastening to moving equipment is carried out on four sides.  In the event of blue-green spots on the films, it is necessary to immediately report this to the commander, giving a warning signal.  After that, a special treatment of open areas on the face, hands and PPE are applied.  Films must be replaced 2 days after gluing and immediately after exposure to precipitation and degassing compounding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vkhp military chemical reconnaissance device" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1575738.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <h2>  PHR-MV </h2><p>  These <span>chemical reconnaissance devices</span> are used to detect hazardous substances in feed, water, food, in the air and at various sites.  Such devices can detect metal salts of <span>hydrocyanic acid,</span> alkaloids.  Phosgene and diphosgene are found in air and feed with their help.  PHR-MV chemical reconnaissance and control devices allow you to take samples of soil, water, and other materials to send them to the laboratory for subsequent determination of the type of pathogen.  In the case of the device in a special compartment is a manual collector pump.  Inside, there are also paper cassettes and indicator tubes with ampouled reagents.  In the kit, in addition to this, there are: </p><ol><li>  Jars for dry-air extraction of compounds of substances from bulk products and for sampling (with test tubes). </li><li>  Forms of reports. </li><li>  Waxed paper. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  Plastic bags (for samples). </li><li>  Adhesive plaster. </li><li>  Tweezers and scissors. </li><li>  Metal spatula. </li><li>  Passport and instructions for the device. </li></ol><p>  The fabric cassette is used to place Drexel bottles, test tubes, reagents, flammable tablets, pipettes, silica gel (activated) in tubes, protective cartridges, needle files to open ampoules, toluene. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chemical dosimetry reconnaissance devices" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1575739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  In PHR-MV, in contrast to the military chemical reconnaissance device, there are: </p><ol><li>  Two additional indicator tubes.  One is designed to detect lewisite and nitrogen mustard.  There are two yellow rings on one end of the tube, and three on the other.  The second is used for arsenic hydrogen.  There are 2 black rings on this tube. </li><li>  Reagents for indicating hazardous compounds and poisons in water. </li><li>  Jars for detecting substances in food using the dry-air extraction method. </li></ol><h2>  Indicator tubes </h2><p>  They are considered an essential element of PCR-MV.  The indicator tube is a glass vessel sealed on both sides.  Inside it there is a porous filler with the ability to sorb gases of hazardous compounds.  There is also a fairing in the tube.  Due to it, the air pumped through it goes only along the periphery of the filler.  In addition, a reagent is present in the tube.  It can be used on a specific compound or on a group of substances.  The reagent can be applied to the filler or contained in one or more miniature ampoules.  At the right time during the work, they are destroyed.  At one end of the tube there is ring marking.  It shows the type of substance whose contents can be detected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dosimetric monitoring chemical intelligence devices" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1575740.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Work process </h2><p>  Indication of compounds begins with the most dangerous of them - nerve gases.  First, life-threatening concentrations are established.  To do this, remove the tubes with red rings and dots (of the same color).  With the help of a carver, they are filed, the ends break off.  Next, an ampoule with an acetylcholinesterase opener having the same marking is opened.  The pump must be held upright.  The tube is inserted into the opening of the opener from below.  After opening the ampoule, its contents moisturize the filler.  The first tube is considered a control.  Pumping air through it does not occur.  The second tube is inserted into the central hole with the unmarked end.  Next is 5-6 swings.  An opener opens with an ampoule with butyrylcholine iodide and phenolroth.  To moisten the filler, the tubes are shaken.  The result is taken into account when comparing the color changes of the filler in the tubes.  In the absence of FOV in the air, cholinesterase breaks down butyrylcholine iodide into an acid residue and choline.  If there are compounds in the air during pumping, acetylcholinesterase will be phospholated.  In this case, in the control tube, the color change of the filler will be rapid.  This is due to the cleavage of butyrylcholine iodide and the formation of acidic products.  The color of the filler will turn yellow (from bright pink).  In the experimental tube, acetylcholinesterase will lose its enzymatic properties.  Accordingly, splitting will not occur or will be very slow.  The filler will either retain a bright pink color, or it will change after 5-10 minutes (compared to the control tube). </p>
