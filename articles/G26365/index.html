A frivolous question with a serious answer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When people are more or less known, all the attention of the population and the press is riveted to them.  They are spoken about at every corner: how do they dress, what do they eat, who do they communicate with.  People have always been interested in learning about the life of their idols.  What can we say about the main authorities of the whole globe - presidents and their assistants.  Sometimes a commoner really wants to compare how the head of his state lives, whether the life of the first person in the country differs in something supernatural.  Or is he the same person as everyone else.  Many are interested in the question of what kind of telephone Putin has.  Fortunately, now there are social networks with which you can follow every step of your idol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone model" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1816255.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <h2>  What phone models do heads of countries of the world prefer? </h2><p>  Despite the increased risk of being listened to by spies, presidents and prime ministers also cannot refuse worldly goods.  Social network users have long been accustomed to see Dmitry Medvedev with an ‚Äúapple‚Äù phone in their hands.  Or watch as Ramzan Kadyrov takes another selfie during an interview.  As for the rest of the influential people of the world level, then they are not far gone: </p><ol><li>  Angela Merkel uses two phones at once: Nokia and BlackBerry.  She needs the first for personal purposes, and the second - exclusively for political negotiations. </li><li>  Barack Obama, the former president of the United States, except BlackBerry does not perceive a single brand.  It is believed that the phones of this particular brand are the most reliable in terms of listening. </li><li>  <span>Kim Jong-un was</span> recently captured at one of the meetings with a smartphone on the table, strongly reminiscent of one of the models from HTC. </li><li>  Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, uses three smartphones at once: Samsung, Apple and BlackBerry. </li><li>  <span>Francois Hollande</span> cannot refuse Apple's gadgets. </li></ol><p>  These were the main people of other countries, but our person is more interested in what is happening in his homeland.  In particular, it is curious to find out which phone Putin has - the most important person in Russia? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What phones did they see Vladimir Vladimirovich </h2><p>  According to Forbes, <span>President of the Russian Federation</span> Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has been the most influential person in the world for the past 4 years.  Naturally, the media, and ordinary citizens, have always been interested in additional information about the world leader, in particular, everyone is interested in what kind of telephone Putin has. </p><p>  The head of state was seen with a mobile phone in his hands only once.  This happened in the Nizhny Novgorod region during mass fires.  Vladimir Vladimirovich urgently needed to call Dmitry Medvedev.  The phone model is Nokia E 90. But later it turned out that it was the phone of one of the companions.  No one else ever managed to capture our president with a personal mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Putin's phone" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1816253.jpg" width="572"></div>

    <h2>  Vladimir Putin's telephone hotline </h2><p>  For all citizens of the Russian Federation, the President‚Äôs hotline is periodically provided.  A call throughout Russia is absolutely free, while everyone has the opportunity to leave a wish or complaint regarding the work of authorities in specific regions.  Naturally, this is not a direct telephone number of Vladimir Putin and a person will not succeed in talking to him personally.  But the population is assured that all applications are considered, and the most serious and important will certainly reach the president. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The basic rule is no anonymous calls.  When contacting the hotline, a citizen must give his full name, surname and patronymic, as well as the address of residence.  In addition to the call, anyone can write SMS to a free short number or an entire letter to an email address.  All contacts can be found on the Kremlin‚Äôs special website. </p><h2>  Putin‚Äôs mobile phone, which he currently uses </h2><p>  Using mobile communications is actually very risky for the president, especially since there is no closed connection in Russia.  When Vladimir Vladimirovich needs to call, he uses telephones with a wired network from the Kremlin and cell phones from a car with a satellite connection.  Of course, these phones are not at all similar to the usual smartphones with a bunch of applications. </p>

    <p>  As the president himself likes to joke about this: ‚ÄúIf I had a personal phone, he would have called without stopping.‚Äù  He never hid his fear and persecution mania.  Honestly, there are good reasons. </p><p>  "So what is Putin's phone?"  - you ask.  Most likely, he does not have a phone at all.  It bothers him more than benefits.  And the president himself admits that he does not have sympathy for various gadgets. </p>
