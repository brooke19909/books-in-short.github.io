    <p>  The canyon near the river gives a lot of fossils: <span>Cambrian clay,</span> marcasite with pyrite, considered gold for fools.  Tolstoy even chose this place to indicate the Country of Fools, since there were quite a lot of pyrite at that time.  But it is not completely known whether the writer lived here, since after the war there was practically no information about him. </p><h2>  Small waterfall </h2><p>  In Tosno there is a waterfall in Sablino, it is considered the largest in Europe.  It is noted that the waterfall changes its pressure and can reach from 2 to 4 meters.  Despite its size, the waterfall was called mini-Niagara, for its magnificent appearance.  When the time comes for floods, it is better not to get close to the waterfall. </p><p>  Visiting this place is allowed independently, without additional excursions.  People take wellness baths in this place, so everyone can try the power of the Tosno waterfall on themselves.  This place was also chosen by the inhabitants of nearby villages. </p><h2>  Temple in the village of Lisino-Korpus </h2><p>  About a hundred years ago, the Tosno church was expanded according to the plan of the architect Nikolai Nikitich Nikonov from the diocese.  Part of this church is <span>the Transfiguration Church, the</span> Tosnensky orphanage, as well as three chapels: all located in a small village, it is considered a cultural monument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
