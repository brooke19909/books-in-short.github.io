I must say that to this day the device is in certain demand. </p><p>  A little later, after a certain period of time, the company decides to release a remake and issues the public the Nokia 6700 and Nokia 6303. And if the first modification is more expensive and updated, then the second, we can say, is not much different from the original version. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The Nokia 6303 appeared largely due to the fact that its predecessor, the Nokia 6300, was a huge success.  That is why the creators had the idea to release a new product that could become as popular and sold. </p><p>  Nokia, releasing this model, officially presents it on the market, offering the device at the same cost as its predecessor.  However, over time, the new modification completely replaced the previous version.  It was something new in the technical world, so you should find out what is the reason for such a breakthrough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6303" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048221.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Brief characteristics: design, size, management </h2><p>  Compared to its predecessor, the Nokia 6303 has a not so strict design, calm and measured tones dominate.  In phones with different color schemes, the tint range changes on the back cover, on the border near the display and on the buttons themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Nokia 6303 case can be steel or black (these are the options that enter the electronics market).  Over time, the list of colors has expanded greatly, since after the sale on the phone was at the peak of popularity.  The back panel is made of metal, and even so, the device lies pleasantly in the hand, without slipping or jumping.  The interface of this device is somewhat reminiscent of the Nokia 3600. This is logical, because the design should not be too strict or, conversely, fun.  Rather, it is more classic with modern inserts. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs dimensions: height - 10.88, width - 4.62 and thickness - 1.17 cm. Weight is small, only 96 g. In fact, given that some parts of the panel are made of metal, then for such an option, such characteristics almost perfect. </p><p>  Themes for Nokia 6303 are installed by the creator, but you can download additional ones from the Internet if you wish.  However, you need to be careful, because with a large number of topics the phone starts to behave inappropriately: turn itself off and constantly show malfunctions.  Therefore, it‚Äôs better not to waste your nerves downloading new options, because you will have to spend more money on repairing the device.  This is most likely due to the phone software, because the Nokia 6303 firmware is the most common. </p><p>  Not only the back is made of resistant material.  Ahead there is a fringing.  Externally, the phone seems a little thicker than it actually is.  Although this can easily be explained by the black color of the case. </p><p>  On the right is the volume rocker.  Below you can find the charging connector (2 mm) and nearby, there, for headphones (3.5 mm).  The developers initially planned to install a light indicator in that place, but at the last moment it was decided to abandon it.  There is also a slot for a memory card (under the housing cover).  The power button is traditionally located at the top. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, the design of the device is calm, cold-blooded, causing neutral emotions.  Shine, too bright accents, striking, are absent. </p><p>  Phone Package: </p><ul><li>  the device itself; </li><li>  Charger; </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  headset </li><li>  1 GB memory card; </li><li>  user's manual. </li></ul><p>  It is noticeable that the kit does not include as many as we would like, but there is nothing more to add here.  Some will consider the lack of a cover a drawback, others, on the contrary, do not see anything good in such a must-have accessory. </p><p>  The headset is rather weak, but this is entirely due to the fact that the model is non-musical, which means you should not wait for something unprecedented. </p><p>  <span>An adapter is</span> not provided <span>for a memory card</span> , and it is not particularly needed.  Unless, of course, there is a need to reconnect it to a laptop.  There is no rag to wipe the phone.  There is no adapter to the charger.  Perhaps this is the right move on the part of the company, because expensive accessories affect the formation of prices. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The resolution of the display in Nokia 6303, the games on which are displayed normally, is 240x320 pixels.  The screen size is 2.2 inches, which is quite normal for a push-button telephone of this type. </p><p>  The display supports 16 million colors, among them there is a range of rich and bright colors.  The screen is capable of holding 9 text lines, 3 service lines.  Depending on the font, the first option may increase to 16. </p><p>  When exposed to sunlight, the display loses brightness, but everything is perfectly visible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6303 classic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048215.jpg" width="263"></div>

It is clear that there is no particularly large space between them, but no discomfort appears. </p><p>  The buttons light up when the device is in active mode.  The backlight is blue on a black phone, and white on a light one.  In principle, these colors combine quite well with the design of the device, the key designations are clearly visible from any viewing angle. </p><p>  The keys are rounded for a softer touch.  Their thickness, when compared with the predecessor, decreased by several millimeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone nokia 6303 classic" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Accumulator battery </h2><p>  210 minutes during video playback, 140 minutes - recording video, 23 hours - playing tunes, 7 hours - in talk mode.  That is how much Nokia 6303 works. The battery, the more detailed technical properties of which will be described below, judging by the characteristics from the manufacturer, is quite powerful. </p><p>  The phone is charged for no more than 2 hours, in any case, while a new one. </p><p>  After testing the phone, you can highlight the following characteristics of the battery: </p><ul><li>  when watching a video - 192 minutes; </li><li>  when viewing pages on the Internet - 192 minutes; </li><li>  when listening to melodies through headphones - 1900 min .; </li><li>  while listening to the radio - 1900 min. </li></ul><p>  That is, it can immediately be noted that the manufacturer did not lie about the continuous operation of the phone without recharging. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The Nokia 6303 Classic, whose firmware is easily updated, has 64 MB of internal memory at the user's disposal. </p><p>  The device supports memory cards (4 GB or less).  In order to install microSD, you need to remove the back cover, and on the right side face, install it in the corresponding slot.  In the kit for the phone, the seller provides a 1 GB card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6303 classic firmware" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Radio and music </h2><p>  The Nokia 6303 Classic has a built-in radio, which easily accepts all available radio waves.  The sound is transmitted quite well, the design is good, easy to operate.  After the first power-up, the phone itself will offer to find stations whose list can be edited at will.  The list includes no more than 20 radio stations. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the device‚Äôs player: the sound is transmitted perfectly, the player‚Äôs interface is intuitive.  There is a simple equalizer. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Bluetooth on the Nokia 6303 Classic is installed in version 2.0.  Data is transmitted at approximately 100 Kb / s. </p><p>  Music is transferred to the bluetooth headset without a glitch, song management takes place without brakes or any other problems. </p><p>  When connecting a USB cable, you can choose one of 3 modes of synchronization with a computer: </p><ul><li>  Data Storage.  Allows access to phone memory and memory card;  in this case, drivers will not be needed, since the operating system itself recognizes the device. </li><li>  PC Suite.  Here, you will already need to install the application of the same name on a computer in order to access more personal data: contacts, messages, etc. </li><li>  Printing  This mode allows you to immediately print all the photos you want. </li></ul><p>  Data is sent at a speed of 1 Mb / s.  When connected to a computer via a USB cable, the battery does not charge. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera of the Nokia 6303 is 3 megapixels.  She has autofocus.  The video finder supports basic, normal, and high image compression.  Among the functions there are such as ZUM, saving photos on a memory card or in the phone‚Äôs memory, turning off sound effects, changing the brightness, white balance, contrast, etc. Some banal effects are installed, which you can use at your discretion.  It is possible to create several pictures at once (up to 3).  The self-timer is 10 seconds.  As a rule, it is used to take pictures of oneself. </p><p>  The camera is designed in such a way that the most successful position of the phone when shooting will be horizontal. </p><p>  Video is recorded in 3GP quality.  Duration is chosen by the user.  Video can be minimum or maximum (until the media is full).  For clips, the same effects as for images are available.  When watching a video, it has normal quality, there is little noise, pixelation does not occur.  On a computer, the video, of course, does not differ in quality, but you can watch it.  Given that most people need a phone just to call someone, the camera function is implemented quite well and is unlikely to live up to someone's expectations. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  The Nokia 6303 Classic has standard games installed.  In each country, a couple more applications are added to them, inaccessible abroad.  In Russia, they are presented to the public: ‚ÄúConverter‚Äù, ‚ÄúDimensions‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpera Mini‚Äù, Yahoo search engine, etc. It is possible to add other Java applications, both from the Internet and via a USB cable from a PC.  A limit on their number is not introduced. </p><p>  There is an application "Maps 1.2", which, in fact, is a simple navigator.  The cards themselves can be downloaded from the Internet yourself, some are already downloaded by the manufacturer.  However, as practice shows, the application can do little to help, and there is simply no point in using it on the Nokia 6303. </p><p>  "Maps 1.2" work using Bluetooth GPS, they are able to determine the location of a person via the Internet.  Along with this, the application paves the way for traffic jams by car or public transport.  The same program uses new browser technologies. </p><p>  The phone platform has been updated, as close as possible to that used on Nokia smartphones.  Background modes are not supported here, although music through the player still works as a task, which does not require the presence of the player itself. </p><p>  Change of themes is a feature of Nokia 6303. Each of them differs in its colors, pattern, and all of them are completely different from each other.  Themes are based on Flash, therefore they support animated pictures that can be put on the desktop, widgets, battery and signal indicators. </p><p>  Standby mode can be customized as desired.  The main window may contain additional information in the form of application shortcuts, notes, reminders, radio and player. </p><p>  There is a function "Speech Analysis", it is she who will help make her speech and her interlocutor more clear.  The same function will remove unnecessary noise and interference.  Voice dialing is not uncommon in phones, and Nokia 6303 is no exception.  The device perfectly "understands" the words after going through the procedure for parsing voice and pronunciation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6303 price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048203.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Phone offline </h2><p>  With the announcement of the Nokia 6303 phone, the manufacturer said that it will become the most powerful in terms of battery life among the same type of phones in the same series.  Battery - Li-In;  Its capacity is 1050 mAh.  In the book on the operation of the phone it is written that the device is able to work 7 hours in call mode and 450 hours while in sleep mode. </p><p>  If you listen to the radio every day, often talk with someone, then he calmly works 3-4 days without recharging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6303 games" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048199.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  Only one device appeared on the market, which is, in fact, an analogue of the Nokia 6303. This is the Soni Ericsson C510, which has the same technical specifications.  It is released a little earlier than announced by Nokia, which allows you to get a sales advantage.  Soni executives decide to start selling their device six months earlier only because their competitor with the same features costs several times less.  It was this criterion that could become decisive in direct competition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="housing nokia 6303" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1048197.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that the Nokia 6303 model is very interesting among other devices at the same price.  For music lovers, a 3.5 mm headphone jack will be a tangible plus.  The price of the device in Russia for 2007 was about 7 thousand rubles.  Now it can be bought at half the price.  The phone has no competitors, with the exception of the Sony Erricsson C510.  The filling of the latter is not much different from Nokia, but at a cost it comes out somewhat more expensive. </p><p>  The communication quality is good, there are no problems during the conversation.  The call is quiet, the sound is quieter compared to other models of the same company.  In noisy places you can hardly hear him.  Vibration alert is a plus, it is quite powerful. </p><p>  Still, the Nokia 6303, whose price was decisive in its sales, did not become as bought as the Nokia 6300. But this does not mean that the device is bad, on the contrary. </p><p>  The strength of this device can hardly be called a design, but, as they say, in taste and color.  Even if the appearance is repulsive, do not immediately throw it into the background when choosing a phone.  He sits comfortably enough in his hand;  having a light weight and a comfortable shape of the case, it fits well into a pocket without falling out of it. </p><p>  All applications and games work without failures, in this regard, the phone has earned a solid five.  That is why he had every chance to oust his predecessor from the market and become the best in its price category. </p>
