  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did the Pegasus constellation appear and where to look for it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Endless space has always been of particular interest to people of different ages.  The main object of study and observation was and remains the stars.  Billions of small planets, forming entire systems, and attract the eyes of the inquisitive.  Looking at the night sky and fantasizing, even thousands of years ago, people saw the outlines of animals in the stars and gave them names.  They believed that the sun and planets are gods who, with the help of the luminaries, give signs to earthly inhabitants.  And it was undeniable that there was a connection between the stars, the Universe and the Earth.  Since ancient times, people have learned to guess and predict from the stars.  Then such sciences as astrology (prediction by stars) and astronomy (the study of stars) were born. </p><h2>  Constellations </h2><p>  Studying stars for people has become an exciting experience.  In order to navigate in this vast outer space, the celestial sphere was divided into sections that are constellations.  Each has its own name.  In antiquity, star clusters were given the names of gods and the names of animals that they resembled.  To date, 88 constellations are officially recognized by the international astronomical union.  The most famous groups of stars in the southern hemisphere are Libra, the Southern Cross, and the Centaur.  Famous clusters of stars in the northern hemisphere: Cassiopeia, Ursa Major and the constellation Pegasus.  A photo of the latter, mesmerizing with its beauty, can be seen in the article. </p><h2>  Winged horse in the night sky </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pegasus constellation" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28078/626609.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  In the northern hemisphere of the night sky, you can see with the naked eye the 166 stars that make up the constellation Pegasus.  Next to it are Aquarius, Dolphin, Andromeda, Chanterelles, Pisces, Lizard, Little Horse and Swan.  The area occupied by this cluster of stars is 1120 square degrees.  This puts the Pegasus constellation in 7th place among all existing ones.  For residents of the Northern Hemisphere, the winged horse looks upside down.  And therefore, this is how the Pegasus scheme was depicted in ancient atlases.  In order to be able to see the image of a horse from the stars, you need to have an extremely developed imagination.  Many people try to trick by photographing the constellation Pegasus, whose photo for a person with a small imagination will still show nothing but a cluster of stars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find the constellation? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pegasus constellation photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28078/626608.jpg" width="540"></div></h2><p>  If you have knowledge of astronomy and experience in observing stars, then you should know about the <span>constellation Andromeda</span> and how it looks.  Focusing on the chain of stars of this constellation, move your gaze to the west.  Take a close look.  And beyond the stars of Andromeda you will see the constellation Pegasus.  Another way to find a winged horse is to focus on the Northern Cross, whose stars border it. </p><p>  The most favorable time for observing Pegasus is autumn and the end of summer.  For people with little experience and knowledge, it will not be difficult to find it in the Great Pegasus Square. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the constellation of the winged horse </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pegasus constellation stars" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28078/626606.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  All the <span>stars in the</span> Pegasus <span>constellation</span> are related to the horse.  Their names come from Arabic.  So Enif means ‚Äúnose‚Äù, Sheat means ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù, Markab means ‚Äúsaddle‚Äù or ‚Äúwagon‚Äù, Algenib means ‚Äúhorse navel‚Äù.  The brightest luminaries (Enif, Sheat and Markab) form the Great Pegasus Square.  Actually, this constellation can be found by everyone. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Pegasus constellation has a distinctive characteristic: it does not have the star Delta Pegasus.  Until 1928, this star, located between Andromeda and Pegasus, belonged to the winged horse.  By later it began to be attributed to Andromeda, so the Pegasus Delta became the Andromeda Alpha. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that in the constellation there is a source of the Pegasid meteor shower, as well as several galaxies, including NGC 73331. This is a Seyfert spiral galaxy, the image of which is most often used to represent the appearance of our Galaxy. </p><h2>  Myths and legends about Pegasus </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="legend of the constellation Pegasus" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28078/626607.jpg" width="457"></div></h2><p>  There is more than one legend about the constellation Pegasus.  In Greek mythology, Pegasus is a snow-white winged horse born from Poseidon and the Medusa of the Gorgon.  After his birth, he began to faithfully serve Zeus, constantly bringing him lightning and thunder.  Also, winged horses were used by mere mortals, whom the gods gifted.  These beautiful and strong animals served their masters until their death. </p><p>  According to another version, Pegasus appeared from the blood of Medusa, killed by Perseus. </p><p>  Another legend about the Pegasus constellation tells that while walking along Helikon, a winged horse hit a claw with a hoof.  And from this rock came the source of Hippocrenus (in translation - "source of the horse").  Those who drank water from such a source received inspiration.  For this, Pegasus was nicknamed the Horse of Muses. </p><p>  According to another myth, the gods gave the winged horse to the Greek hero Bellerophon.  He, having managed to saddle Pegasus, took off on it and with arrows defeated the chimera - a terrible monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a dragon. </p><p>  Because Pegasus served faithfully, the gods elevated him to the constellations, forever leaving the image of a winged horse in heaven. </p>
