The task is complicated by the fact that most educational games are not at all interesting for children.  Decoupage will help you with this difficult matter.  Choosing the right technique, you can show the child how to make the whole product out of individual elements. </p><h2>  What is decoupage? </h2><p>  This type of decorative and applied art is a way of decorating objects with paints, napkins, beads, feathers.  Decoupage for children can include many different techniques.  Their choice depends on the abilities and interests of the child. </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftingbydominique.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antique style box" class="if uuid-3005392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005392.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits for children </h2><p>  It is difficult to overestimate the positive effect that decoupage has on children.  The fine motor skills of the hands are developing, because in the process of manufacturing products, children have to work with small parts, glue and cut them.  Decoupage also helps children understand the taste values ‚Äã‚Äãand guidelines, what they like to work with, what colors to use.  Another positive effect can be called the fact that the child will engage in self-development instead of wasting time.  Decoupage, as a means of developing creative abilities in children, is very often used in kindergartens, rehabilitation centers and in private practice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Various techniques </h2><p>  What are they like?  Decoupage techniques for children - this is not the type of product chosen, but the way it is decorated.  You can decorate a bottle, casket or cutting board, but this will not be considered a decoration method.  Among the most basic and common options for decoupage techniques are: </p><ul><li>  Creating the effect of antiquity or scuffs.  In this technique, using a special varnish, products are given an older age.  This technique is used by those who want to get crafts in vintage or European style. </li><li>  Squirting.  This decoupage technique for children uses paints.  The brush is dipped in a specific color, after which it is sprayed onto the craft. </li><li>  3D technique.  With the help of paints, the image on the craft gives a three-dimensional effect. </li><li>  Lacy technique.  In it, lace fabric is glued to crafts to give lightness and tenderness. </li></ul><p>  When working with children for decoupage, you should choose the simplest techniques and options for creating products.  If a young needlewoman or needlewoman will be good at doing simple things, then we can move on to more complex ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="busymomhelp.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage items" class="if uuid-3005352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005352.jpg"></div><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Consider several options for creating decoupage for children.  As a first way, get acquainted with the decoration of a wooden casket.  For this we need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Wooden blank box.  It can be purchased at the needlework store or made independently.  You can choose any shape, but for children it is advisable to use square or rectangular blanks. </li><li>  Napkin with your chosen image. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Brush </li><li>  Varnish to coat the product with it.  This type of processing gives the crafts a more presentable appearance, and also allows them to be stored for a longer time. </li></ul><p>  As a second product, consider decorating a bottle.  To do this, prepare: </p><ul><li>  An empty, pre-cleaned bottle of a beautiful shape. </li><li>  Acrylic paints. </li><li>  Tassels. </li><li>  Sponge. </li><li>  Decor Elements. </li></ul><p>  The third option would be a watch.  For a child, such a product is as interesting as possible, since it is of practical importance, but at the same time it is the most difficult of these.  We will need: </p><ul><li>  Wooden base for watches. </li><li>  Arrows </li><li>  The mechanism for the watch. </li><li>  Batteries </li><li>  Acrylic paints. </li><li>  Tassels. </li><li>  Sponge. </li><li>  Napkin for decoupage. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ul><p>  After all the materials have been prepared, you can begin the basic process of creating crafts in decoupage technique for children. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  Consider the manufacture of three crafts in the order in which we prepared materials for them.  And let's start with the simplest option - a wooden box. </p><ol><li>  Pick up a piece of sandpaper.  With it, we clean the workpiece from bumps that could hurt your hands.  It is better for the child to carry out this process with gloves. </li><li>  Next, you need to take a white paint or special white primer.  They should cover the entire box. </li><li>  Let it dry. </li><li>  Next, take a napkin, attach it to the lid of the casket, cut it off to the required size.  It is better not to use scissors, as we need to give the product the effect of antiquity. </li><li>  Glue the napkin to the box cover with PVA glue.  Let it dry.  We take acrylic paints, color the casket and put a little on the torn edges of the glued napkin.  So we will be able to hide its borders.  You can use not a brush, but a sponge for applying paint. </li><li>  After complete drying, the product can be varnished. </li></ol><p>  Done! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work on the box" class="if uuid-3005338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005338.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate the bottle you need: </p><ul><li>  Clean the base with alcohol. </li><li>  Then paint the bottle with paint.  It is acceptable to use brushes or a sponge.  The latter will work easier and faster. </li><li>  When the bottle dries, you can tie a beautiful ribbon on its neck or attach a feather.  As a more complex option, you can also stick a decoupage napkin to the bottle, only before that the bottle needs to be primed with white paint. </li><li>  After complete drying, the product can be varnished. </li></ul><p>  The work is completed! </p><div class="photo" data-original="busymomhelp.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage Bottle" class="if uuid-3005343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005343.jpg"></div><p>  Now let's move on to the most complex product: </p><ol><li>  Take a wooden base for a watch.  We will clean it with sandpaper from irregularities. </li><li>  We will cover with white paint or soil of the same color. </li><li>  Let the product dry. </li><li>  Next, in the center to the place of the dial, glue a napkin. </li><li>  After that, color the numbers and contours of the napkin. </li><li>  After the watch has dried, it will be possible to cover it with varnish. </li><li>  Next, attach the hands and attach the mechanism on the back of the watch. </li><li>  Insert the batteries into it. </li></ol><p>  The product is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorated clock" class="if uuid-3005371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005371.jpg"></div><p>  If you strictly follow the instructions, then all the products will be neat and will delight you and your child. </p><h2>  Interesting ideas </h2><p>  There are so many product options from decoupage.  Their choice depends on your taste preferences and capabilities.  Here are some original options that your children will definitely love: </p><ul><li>  Any kid will like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecorating eggs.  You don‚Äôt have to do this on Easter.  You can just take <span>food felt-tip pens</span> and start making masterpieces on your kitchen table with your child. </li><li>  For children, the option of decorating a compact disc will be interesting.  To do this, you can use a variety of paints, colored paper. </li><li>  You can consider another type of decoupage.  To create crafts with children is much more interesting if you show them that their product will be useful in everyday life and will be used.  Buy a flower pot and decorate it with decoupage napkins or paints. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sewforsoul.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://sewforsoul.blogspot.com/2014/02/oh-so-shabby-french-chic.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorated eggs" class="if uuid-3005385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005385.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing an option, build on what the child is interested in. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  To make the craft beautiful and neat, you need to avoid the most common mistakes.  Here are some of the tips: </p><ol><li>  Do not start varnishing the product until the paint has dried on it. </li><li>  Do not stick the cloth on the product without a white primer base. </li><li>  Do not varnish the product with light napkins; they may turn yellow from varnish. </li><li>  Do not use gouache or oil paints for decoupage. </li><li>  All wooden workpieces must be cleaned with sandpaper. </li><li>  Before you start working with the blank for the box, unscrew all the fasteners and fasteners from it.  They need to be painted separately. </li><li>  So that decoupage for preschool children does not turn into a painful task, it is better to choose napkins with vivid images from fairy tales and cartoons. </li></ol><p>  Following these tips and doing everything carefully, you can achieve an excellent result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manualidades.facilisimo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage bucket" class="if uuid-3005399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3005399.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Many people consider decoupage costly for children.  A set of acrylic paints will cost from 150 rubles.  Wooden blanks can be purchased at various prices.  It all depends on the quality of the tree.  It is better to take cheap blanks and putty them on your own.  Varnish is quite expensive - from 250 rubles.  But one jar is enough for a large number of different products.  The same applies to paints. </p>
