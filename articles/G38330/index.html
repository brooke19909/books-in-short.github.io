How did the daughter of Heinrich Himmler live her life and what does the once-most famous girl of Nazi Germany do in her declining years? </p><h2>  Biography Gudrun Burwitz </h2><p>  Born on August 8, 1929 in the family of the SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler and Margaret Zegot.  The family later adopted a boy named Gerhard.  He was only a year older than his own daughter, and the girl was incredibly happy about his appearance.  At this time, the Reichsfuhrer‚Äôs feelings for his wife cooled, and he made an affair with his secretary, who bore him two children.  Gudrun passed the rite of baptism and communion in the Protestant church.  She lived with her mother in Munich, while her father spent most of his time in Berlin.  Outwardly, she was ideally suited to the image of a purebred Aryan girl: pale skin, blond hair and regular features.  Beautiful dresses and braids made her a real doll, for which she received the nickname Puppy from her father.  So he called her in letters and at meetings at which she received the attention of Adolf Hitler himself. </p>

    <h2>  Fairytale childhood </h2><p>  Gudrun Burwitz boasts his cloudless and happy childhood.  Caressed by the attention of the press and her own father, she was a role model for all the children of the Third Reich.  Solemn performances of the Fuhrer ended with the offering of flowers, and it was this girl who most often received attention from Hitler.  Relations between parents, as already mentioned, quickly became formal, and the Reichsfuhrer had connections on the side.  However, this did not affect young Gudrun.  She was still the closest and beloved person to her father.  Every day he called his daughter to inquire about her well-being and learn about the events of the past day.  Once a week he wrote her long touching letters.  This became a ritual, and the girl was looking forward to the treasured envelope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to love and care, she received a huge number of gifts.  Among the many toys, outfits and other pleasant things were even jewelry.  To this day, she wears one of these jewelry - a large silver brooch with the image of horse heads.  Four animal faces together made up a swastika.  This jewel was especially proud of the young daughter of the fascist. </p><h2>  Father's daughter </h2><p>  Heinrich Himmler was very upset by his separation from his daughter and did everything to see his Puppy as often as possible.  He regularly sent a military plane to Munich, which delivered his daughter to him for several days in Berlin.  There, the girl attended important events with him and spent time with benefit.  She liked the meetings and speeches of her father.  Despite her young age, she already understood a lot and fully supported the views of the Reichsf√ºhrer.  The girl started an album where she carefully pasted all the photos of her father, cutting them out of the newspapers.  Over time, their joint pictures began to be added there. </p>

    <p>  She colorfully described one of her trips with her father in a diary.  It was a tour of the concentration camp in Dachau.  With all her childish directness, she described what kind of trees grow there and how wonderful the prisoners draw pictures.  There is not a word about the inhuman living conditions and the terrible maintenance of people on the pages of her diary.  But she could not see the crematorium pipes and gas chambers.  Moreover, the father did not just show her the life of prisoners - he conducted an inspection.  Gudrun Burwitz still does not see anything reprehensible in the actions of his father. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Father's death </h2><p>  What was in the head of the Reichsf√ºhrer when he drove his young daughter to concentration camps?  The fragile psyche could break after visiting such places.  But apparently, he well rooted in her head all the important dogmas of the Third Reich, since the child was not impressed by the torment of the prisoners.  When a turning point occurred during the war, Himmler did not perceive this as the end of Nazi Germany and defeat.  He hoped to take Hitler's place and rule the country in accordance with his ideological views.  Even after he was kicked out of a leadership position on April 29, 1945 for treason, he still believed in his integrity. </p><p>  In an attempt to avoid being captured by the British, he radically changes his appearance and tries to escape from the country.  Fake documents did not help him, and then he takes a desperate step - he bites the ampoule with poison and dies.  The fascist perfectly understood what awaited him, and followed the example of his Fuhrer.  So the author of the ‚Äúfinal solution of the Jewish question‚Äù ended his days. </p>

    <h2>  Faithful daughter </h2><p>  In early May 1945, Margaret and Gudrun were arrested by the British.  She learned about the death of her father in prison.  This news had so much effect on young Puppy that for three weeks she fell into unconsciousness and lay in a fever.  She managed to escape from the clutches of death, and endless wanderings in the camps began.  They were constantly being transferred with their mother, and she did not have time to properly mourn her father.  She categorically denied his suicide and is still convinced that the British killed him.  She fiercely hates all representatives of this nation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In November 1945, mother and daughter appeared before the tribunal at the trial in Nuremberg.  Gudrun did not renounce his father and considered all his actions justified by wartime.  She was not impressed by the many hours of reports about her dad's atrocities and his contribution to the destruction of innocent people.  At that time she was already 15 years old, and she was well aware of what the Holocaust was and how millions of Jews ended their lives thanks to the efforts of her father.  The girl confirmed that she supports the views and decisions of the Reichsfuhrer and considers him unfairly accused, while he worked for the good of his country.  She still believes that the time will come when her father will be found not guilty and completely rehabilitated. </p>

    <h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  In 1946, they were released with their mother, but completely deprived of all their property.  They had to live in a Protestant church, where all unreliable representatives of society were received.  Himmler's wife and daughter were forced to live with prostitutes, the disabled, and other Nazi relatives.  In 1947, Gudrun submits documents to the Higher School of Arts.  Seeing that in the column ‚ÄúParents‚Äù she wrote ‚ÄúReichsf√ºhrer SS‚Äù, she was first refused.  Later she was enrolled, but Himmler‚Äôs daughter was considered an immoral act to pay a scholarship and deprived her of state student payments. </p>

    <p>  In 1951, she graduated from high school and received a diploma as an assistant tailor.  At the same time, she is awarded a certificate of denazification.  This document stated that she was not responsible for the crimes of her father.  Gudrun began hard times.  Not a single studio wanted to hire Himmler's daughter.  She was strongly advised to change her last name, but she refused to betray the memory of her parent.  With difficulty, she managed to get a job in a small atelier, but she did not last long there. </p><h2>  Silent help </h2><p>  In the same year she went to Britain, where she was invited by the English Nazis.  The girl willingly poses on the background of posters with the image of Hitler.  By that time, she was already in Quiet Aid, which was engaged in supporting the Nazis who escaped punishment.  It was rumored that it was thanks to this fund that Dr. Mengele was able to leave Germany.  Upon returning home, she finds out that she will have to leave her job.  Settling a telephone operator, she also failed.  One of the clients accidentally finds out her last name and writes a complaint.  This man lost his entire family at Auschwitz.  Gudrun is again without work.  This did not break the devoted daughter, and a year later she founded the Viking-Jugend.  With a detailed study of this organization, it is difficult not to notice that this is an exact copy of the Hitler Youth. </p>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  She nevertheless had to change her last name.  In the early 1960s she got married.  The chosen one was Wulf-Dieter Burwitz.  The neo-Nazi writer approached Himmler's daughter in all respects.  They work together in the organization Quiet Aid, and Gudrun Burvits continues to dream about his father‚Äôs rehabilitation.  She gave birth to two children and now lives in a remote place near Munich.  In her house, a special place is occupied by a large portrait of her father in a silver frame.  At 88, the old woman is actively involved in the development of the fund and even dreams of creating a party.  Photos of Gudrun Burwitz often appear in newspapers, but she does not like to give interviews.  It is worth noting that more than 1000 wealthy people support her cause and regularly transfer money for funerals, payment of hospital bills and other expenses of former Nazi criminals.  It is not known what position the children of Gudrun Burwitz take and whether she was able to instill in them the ideology of the Third Reich. </p><h2>  Now </h2><p>  Periodically, messages about her death appear on the network and even the date is reported.  Gudrun Burwitz looks good for his 88 years and is not going to retire.  She has many plans: to create a National Democratic Party, to whitewash her father‚Äôs name and help children and grandchildren.  The ‚Äúgrandmother of neo-Nazism‚Äù has no close friends, and those who are, speak of her as a taciturn and strict woman.  Judging by the fact that she periodically visits former criminals, takes care of their decent living and generally behaves quite actively, it's too early to talk about the date of death of Gudrun Burwitz. </p>
