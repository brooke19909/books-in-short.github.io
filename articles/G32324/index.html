    <h2>  A little about Voronezh </h2><p>  The "cradle" of the navy, the birthplace of the airborne troops, a large transport hub - all this can be said about Voronezh.  In addition, the city has many industrial enterprises that create the basis of its economic activity.  Voronezh is an active producer of food products, which is well known and liked not only by the residents of the city, but also famous far beyond its borders. </p><p>  The population of the city has exceeded one million people and has been growing steadily for almost ten years.  This is reflected not only in the natural population growth, but also in the active relocation to the city of residents of other, especially northern, regions.  G. Voronezh (LCD "Tsvetnoy Boulevard") provides such resettled housing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
