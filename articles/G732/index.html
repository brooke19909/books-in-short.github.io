    <p>  Boris Spassky was born in 1937, on January 30, in Leningrad.  At an early age during the war, the future chess player was taken out of the city and settled in an orphanage with many other children who were saved from the siege.  During this period of life, five-year-old Boris got acquainted with the game and became interested in it. </p><p>  After the war, all evacuated returned home, the normal course of life was restored.  In 1946, Spassky's mother brought the pioneers to the chess circle in the Leningrad Palace of Pioneers.  Every day for two years after returning home, a young chess player played the game and invited all his relatives to play a game with him. </p><p>  In this organization, the still inexperienced Boris Spassky attracted general attention with his skill and mastery, and at the same time, modesty and shyness.  But even in that period of his life, he decided to become one of the most outstanding chess players in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First victories </h2><p>  One of the first achievements that Boris Spassky wrote in his biography is that at a young age he became an international master.  Then he was only 16 years old.  Two more years of training led him to a new world youth title.  After graduating from school, Spassky entered the Institute at the Department of Journalism.  But he continued to train constantly. </p><p>  At the age of 18, he took third place in the USSR championship, and this gave him the opportunity to participate in the applicants tournament, which was to be held next year.  Thus, Boris Spassky became the youngest participant in such a championship at that time. </p><h2>  Championship </h2>

    <p>  Speaking for the first time at the Candidates Tournament, the future champion shared places 3 to 7 with eminent chess players of that time.  All experts called it a big breakthrough and predicted a successful future. </p><p>  After several years and a large number of defeats and victories Spassky in 1969 met at the tournament with Tigran Petrosyan and won the champion title.  The chess player wore the honorary title for 3 years.  Bob Fisher and Boris Spassky held a match in 1972, as a result of which the title was transferred to the new owner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Famous matches </h2>

    <p>  The strongest and most famous matches include those that took place at the contests of the applicants.  The first of these was a game with <span>Tigran Petrosyan</span> in 1966, in which Spassky was defeated.  Critics said the newly-made grandmaster was too presumptuous and young.  After 3 years in the fight against the same opponent, the champion title was won by our hero with a score of 12.5: 10.5. </p><p>  <span>Bobby Fisher</span> and Boris Spassky met at the Candidates Tournament in 1972.  On the appointed date, the American did not arrive, and the match could not take place, which was what the Soviet side demanded.  Nevertheless, the reigning champion acted with his characteristic gentleness, and, by decision of President Max Euwe, the day of the match was postponed.  The whole game was difficult, and despite the fact that Spassky won the first and second games, he lost the fight, and the title went to Fischer. </p><p>  Many said that the behavior of the American was specially played out to disorient the opponent.  The refusal of the stage due to the wrong place and the use of new game techniques in the next game made the results of the tournament memorable, as did the names of the players - Bobby Fisher and Boris Spassky.  Who won and who should have won, many are still arguing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Trainer </h2>

    <p>  The first serious coach for Boris Spassky was Igor Bondarevsky.  It was thanks to his persistent instructions and long training that significant results began to appear with which one could go to the championship.  The team also included Nikolai Krogius, who helped prepare for the game with Tigran Petrosyan. </p><p>  Having won and the championship, Spassky Boris, a chess player who by that time was known and invited to interviews and sporting events, began to devote little time to the game itself.  After 3 years, it was necessary to confirm the title, and this should have been preceded by a strong and hard training. </p><p>  A new person appears in the team - Grandmaster Efim Geller.  With the old champion coach, the latter had strong disagreements, and quarrels and disputes arose constantly in the company.  Bobby Fisher and Boris Spassky were supposed to converge on the championship game.  During preparation for it, the chess player and his coach Igor Bondarevsky had a very strong dispute, as a result of which the latter resigned. </p><p>  As a result, the preparation of the current champion for the game was weak, and despite a decent game, Boris Spassky was defeated and lost his title. </p><h2>  France </h2>

    <p>  After several defeats and new and strong players entering the stage, Boris Spassky left sports, but did not give up his favorite pastime.  In 1976, he married Marina Shcherbacheva.  Since the wife of the chess player worked at the French embassy, ​​the family moved to France.  Despite living far from his homeland, Spassky continued to play at international championships for the USSR. </p><p>  Gradually, chess began to fade into the background, and by the 90s the grandmaster appeared less and less at large tournaments.  Boris Spassky, whose biography is filled with the strongest games, still nonetheless remains an example for many.  He does not cease to observe the activities of the association, sometimes gives interviews and consultations. </p><p>  In France, a son was born to Spassky, who was also called Boris, and later a daughter was born. </p><p>  The family lives in the south of the country. </p><p>  In 2010, the former champion suffered a stroke, as a result of which he was bedridden for a long time. </p><h2>  Homecoming </h2>

    <p>  In 2012, Boris Spassky came to Russia, where he continued to treat the effects of a stroke.  This event has stirred up the public.  Many media outlets wrote that the chess player escaped because he was not given decent treatment, and his family isolated him from society.  Others described the escape process in which Spassky was helped by an old friend.  He took him out of the house and sent him to the Russian embassy. </p><p>  The grandmaster himself tries to circumvent this topic and gives meager and streamlined comments.  His son flew to Russia, but Boris was going to divorce his wife Marina.  Recently, he lives in his homeland.  Boris Jr., who entered the French Institute, is now studying in St. Petersburg as a lawyer. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In the 90s, Boris Spassky played rarely and did not go to big events.  In 1992, the International Chess Association held a memorable and exhibition match between Fisher and Spassky with a prize pool of $ 5 million.  As a result, the winner received most of the money, but the loser left with a prize. </p><p>  The game was long, but friendly, as a result of which the American again became the first.  Many observers claimed that the match was not inferior to modern tournaments, but still the old school was clearly visible.  And in the world of chess with the advent of computers, much has changed. </p><p>  With the money won, Boris Spassky bought apartments for his relatives and friends.  This man has always been distinguished by kindness, perseverance and an open heart. </p><p>  Over the years, he has been friends with eminent grandmasters, even those with whom he has repeatedly lost. </p>
