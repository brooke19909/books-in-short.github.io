    <h2>  Crafts from a dropper: a workshop on the manufacture of a devil </h2><p>  You can get a naughty little devil by strictly following the step-by-step recommendations: </p><ul><li>  The first step is to make pens and legs.  To do this, cut off two pieces of a dropper of the required length.  After that, using small scissors, the plastic tubes are cut in a spiral, moving in a circle.  This work should begin, stepping back from the beginning about two cm, the tip is excised with scissors, imitating fingers.  Indentation is first needed in order to attach parts to the body. </li><li>  The torso and the head of the little devil are woven the same in the form of a <span>Chinese knot.</span>  Two tubes are laid crosswise, four working tips are obtained.  The first tube is placed on the second from above, the second on the third from above, the third on the first down and into the loop.  The tips are laid in a square, they all need to be pulled a little into the knot.  Similar manipulations are repeated until the details are of the required length.  Creating such crafts from droppers, the main thing is to remember to insert the pens and legs in the right places. </li><li>  The head is attached to the body with a needle from a dropper, removing its tip.  The part can be planted right in the center or slightly pushed forward. </li><li>  Finishing work, the remaining ends on the body are cut, and on the head two ends are cut to the root, and horns are made from the others, cutting them diagonally. </li></ul><h2>  DIY do-it-yourself dropper crafts: goldfish </h2><p>  About twenty years ago, fish from droppers could be found everywhere.  But, unfortunately, time passed, and the goldfish sailed away.  However, you can nostalgic and recall these <span>simple crafts,</span> in addition, a similar master class can be used for classes with children, they will be delighted with funny figures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from a dropper instruction" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1517818.jpg" width="504"></div>

First of all, you need to make a foundation for which two tubes of 35 cm long are used. </li><li>  One of the tubes is cut on both sides.  On the one hand - into eight strips of 10 cm long, on the other - into four strips of fifteen cm. The second tube is similarly cut. </li><li>  Next, you need to make an eye, in the future, when weaving, you need to consider its size.  For this, a wheel is used that adjusts the frequency of the drops, as well as two tubes five and three cm long. </li><li>  Tubes are cut along the entire length, a fringe is made on a small one - it will serve as eyelashes. </li><li>  Cilia are placed on the ringlet, after which a long tube is wound around the resulting base.  It should be borne in mind that the cut part will be twisted, so it must be wound in such a way that the strip does not bend toward the eye, but out. </li><li>  After that, you should start making the base of the fish.  The long tube from the second dropper needs to be cut along the entire length, in addition two tubes that were previously prepared will be needed.  They are wrapped in the resulting strip several times, thereby fixing together.  After that, both tubes are wrapped in turn, using weaving in the form of a figure eight. </li><li>  After that, the two base tubes are twisted together, creating the shape of a fish, taking into account the place in the eye.  The remaining ponytails need to be fixed, for this they are sent along the sides towards the tail and capture the strip when weaving the figure eight. </li><li>  It remains to insert the eye and fix it with the help of additional eights. </li></ol><p>  Creating such crafts from droppers, you should think about additional decorative elements.  You can make a crown by also cutting a part from a dropper.  The tail and fins are curled with scissors, and the goldfish is ready. </p>
