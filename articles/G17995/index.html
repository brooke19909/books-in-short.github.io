The company actively produces various electronics from mobile phones to televisions.  Moreover, the products of this company is always famous for its high quality.  In this article, we will talk about the recently released headphones, which made a rustle during its release.  We will discuss the Sony SBH80.  What is special about this headset?  How is the <span>Sony SBH80</span> different from similar devices?  The answers to these and many other questions lie here. </p><h2>  Headphones BlueTooth Sony SBH80 Black </h2><p>  The audio market is oversaturated.  There are many companies that are improving their products, trying to push new technologies.  But, despite the large number of worthy competitors, Sony guys always manage to surprise with their products.  The technique that goes under the Sony brand, if not revolutionary, at least makes a splash, it always creates a lot of hype.  New stereo headphones were no exception to the rule.  Sony SBH80 is a rather peculiar device.  Want to know more about this gadget?  In this case, read this article! </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the design of the gadget.  The appearance of the device gives notes from the past of a Japanese company, but at the same time, you can notice modern elements.  The headset itself looks pretty stylish.  Strict contours emphasize the presentability of the device.  It is also worth noting that in addition to the standard Black color, you can also purchase the Sony SBH80 White version.  This means that you can pick up a headset for a smartphone.  Perhaps in the future, "Sony" will make the color range of the gadget more diverse, adding pink, blue and other shades. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the main requirement for any headset is ergonomics.  And specialists from Sony have completely coped with this task.  They took a whole range of measures in order to make the device as compact as possible.  For example, all technological delights (aptX codec, NFC, support for HD Voice and battery) were placed in a special unit.  In accordance with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSony, during operation, this unit should be located behind the user's neck, which is pretty convenient.  There is also a vibrating alert.  In case a message or call arrives on the phone, the headset gives out a slight but noticeable buzz.  Thanks to this, the user will not miss a call, even if the smartphone is in a bag or jacket.  The charging connector is located under the plug.  Thanks to this assembly, it was possible to assemble an incredibly compact device.  Sony SBH80 weighs only 16 grams.  It is unlikely that they will be able to find a more ergonomic and comfortable headset. </p>

    <p>  Among the interesting features of the gadget, you can notice the relative waterproofness.  Of course, the Sony SBH80 will not survive a complete immersion in water, because the case is not sealed.  However, while running, sweat cannot get on the contacts, which is pretty good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Perhaps the main advantage of the brainchild of "Sony" - a powerful and capacious battery.

And with measured use, the headset can work for two or even three days. </p>

    <p>  Sony SBH80 uses the so-called dynamic microheads.  They provide clearer sound, increase the accuracy of frequency transmission, which, in turn, has a positive effect on the playback quality of audio files.  A special two-layer speaker housing, which is made of high-strength magnesium, provides a richer sound. </p><p>  The shape of the ears and the material from which they are made suppress ambient noise to the maximum.  Thanks to this, sound insulation is at a fairly high level.  Even being in a crowded place or in public transport, you will not hear anything but music. </p><p>  A technology called HD Voice (you can read about it below) and high-quality hardware significantly improve call quality.  The Sony SBH80 is equipped with two microphones at once.  Thanks to this, no matter how the user rotates his head, the voice for the subscriber will always be even and clear.  High-quality headphones, in turn, provide comfortable and pleasant communication. </p>

    <p>  As for the musical component, then everything is at the highest level.  Headphones perform well both at high and low frequencies.  The sound is clear and quite deep.  Perhaps the headset lacks a little bass.  Nevertheless, for everyday use (listening to music while walking, long trips, etc.) Sony SBH80 suitable. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The new Sony SBH80 involved a lot of interesting and innovative technologies.  The aptX audio codec is one such.  Its essence is to compress the audio stream, so the device is able to transmit it without the slightest loss in terms of quality.  This ensures crystal clear sound even at high frequencies at maximum volume level. </p>

    <p>  According to user reviews, there are obvious advantages of the headset, such as excellent volume (you never have to use the maximum);  good sound quality;  ergonomics;  Long battery life and style.  But there were some cons.  Unfortunately, very thin wiring requires an extremely careful attitude to yourself.  There is also the inconvenience of wearing with some styles of clothing (for example, with a high collar).  In general, users are satisfied with their purchase. </p><p>  However, there were some shortcomings.  Perhaps the main disadvantage of this device is the price.  A headset costs about 6,000 rubles (about 2,000 hryvnias).  And it's pretty expensive.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the declared price is fully consistent with the quality of the product.  Therefore, if you need high-quality compact headphones, then the new Sony SBH80 is the best choice. </p>
