    <p>  The Crimean conference took place on <span>February 4-11,</span> 1945 in the resort city of Yalta in the Livadia Palace.  This was a historic meeting of the leaders of the countries of the <span>anti-Hitler coalition, the</span> joint efforts of which victoriously ended the Second World War.  It included the following states: USSR, USA and Great Britain.  The Crimean conference took place at a time when hostilities were already taking place in Germany, and the merciless fight against the Nazi <span>war machine</span> was won. </p><p>  The whole world followed these negotiations, as the Crimean Conference resolved topical issues about the future development of post-war society.  Anti-Hitler countries raised important questions, primarily about the unconditional surrender of Germany, and then about the new borders of states and spheres of influence.  The Crimean conference and its decisions will be studied by historians for a long time to come.  It was on it that the fate of warlike Germany was decided - a country that unleashed two bloody wars in a short period of time by historical standards. </p><p>  The conference in Yalta made a historic decision to divide Germany into two separate and independent states, which implied radical changes in its political life, which was already based on democratic principles. </p><p>  The pre-war territories occupied by the <span>Third Reich,</span> it was necessary to streamline and map the new borders between states involved in the World War, as well as to determine the <span>demarcation lines</span> between the allies. </p><p>  This was an agreement as far back as Tehran, in particular, it was about the complete transfer of all territories of <span>East Prussia</span> to the USSR <span>,</span> as well as the definition of zones of subordination in France.  A decision was made on the complete occupation of Germany by the troops of the USSR, Great Britain and the USA, in addition, the borders of the zones of influence of each of the coalition members were determined, in particular, the borders between Poland and Germany.  Before <span>the Second World War</span> , Poland was one of the largest countries in Central Europe.  After she lost part of the territory and moved to the west and north, significantly changing the pre-war shape.  The time has come to revise this issue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It has become urgent to create special procedures that would guarantee a new territorial order, especially regarding the updated dividing lines on the world map.  The question of possible reparations was also raised, but in the absence of a common opinion among the allies, it was decided that Great Britain and the USA would return 50 percent of the reparations to the USSR.  For the participation of the Soviet armed forces in the war against Japan, with the consent of the coalition of the USSR, the Kuril Islands and, in addition, South Sakhalin were added to it.  Discussion of all these issues included a conference in Yalta.  Its participants declared their main goal - the destruction of German militarism and especially Nazism. </p><p>  The anti-Hitler community was faced with the task of disarming the German armed forces, as well as the strictest control over its military and industrial potential.  A separate issue was the retaliation of war criminals, they had to suffer deserved and fair punishment.  So decided the Yalta Conference.  The decisions to destroy the Nazi party forever, their inhuman laws, ideology and symbolism from the new life of the German people were supported by all coalition members. </p><p>  For the first time in Yalta, the advanced ideas of the League of Nations were actually realized.  These were the results of an important historical event called the Yalta Conference.  Her decisions were fair and undeniable.  The world progressive community was tasked with creating such an interstate body that would prevent any attempts to change the new, just established world.  Thus, the modern United Nations ideology, built on the humanity and equal rights of all people living on Earth, was realized and started. </p>
