    <p>  <span>In the end, Prince Dmitry Golitsin managed to convince the members of the Council to put on the vacant throne, Anna Ioannovna, the widow of the Duke of Courland, who was suitable in all respects.</span>  <span>True, in exchange for the kingdom, she was required to sign certain conditions, or, as they said then, conditions.</span>  <span>In fact, it was about restricting autocratic power.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The Duchess of Courland accepted the conditions of the supreme leaders and on February 15 solemnly entered Moscow.</span>  <span>Very soon, those who wanted to limit the power of the empress regretted their choice.</span>  <span>We can say that the reforms of Anna Ioannovna began with the liquidation of the Supreme Privy Council, which made up the aforementioned standards.</span> </p><h2>  One of the Romanovs </h2><p>  <span>The new empress of Russia was the niece of Peter the Great.</span>  <span>She was the middle daughter of his half-brother Ivan (John).</span>  <span>Like all Russian princesses, she was taught reading, arithmetic, writing, geography, dancing and foreign languages.</span> </p><p>  <span>Her life went on in the Kremlin, and then in the royal residence in Izmailovo, until Peter I decided to consolidate his success in the Northern War by arranging the marriage of one of his nieces with the Duke of Courland.</span>  <span>The choice fell on Anna.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, her marriage was short-lived: two months later, the duke died.</span>  <span>Anna was only 17 years old, but the political interests of Russia ordered her to preserve widowhood, leading a bleak life in Courland.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>The bureaucratic apparatus created under Peter the Great by the time of the reign of Anna Ioannovna had grown so much that the central government was practically unable to control it.</span>  <span>To establish a clear work of the state mechanism, they issued new, more stringent decrees, but nothing changed.</span> </p><h2>  Noble Reforms of Anna Ioannovna </h2><p>  <span>The list of them, undoubtedly, is headed by a decree of 1730, repealing the Petrine law of uniform inheritance, which all the nobles asked for.</span>  <span>Going towards them, the government of the new empress thoroughly strengthened its social base.</span>  <span>Now the landowners were free to dispose of the main property - the estate, and their younger sons, provided with an inheritance, did not need government service.</span> </p><p>  Another decisive landmark for the nobility was adopted in 1736. If Peter I ordered the gentry to carry out public service for life, Anna Ioannovna reduced this period to 25 years.  Moreover, due to injuries or illnesses, it was allowed to resign earlier.  After the war with the Turks ended in 1739, thousands of nobles, using this decree, left the service for the good of the state and returned to their estates. </p><h2>  Army and Navy </h2><p>  <span>It is well known that Peter the Great attached great importance to gaining access to the sea and the fleet itself.</span>  <span>Nevertheless, after his death, not a single ship was built in Russia.</span>  <span>In order to save money, military vessels did not go to sea, which affected the combat training of their crews.</span> </p><p>  <span>The military reform of Anna Ioannovna began with the restoration of the navy.</span>  <span>In the very first year of her reign, the 66-gun ship Glory of Russia was laid down, and in the next two more.</span>  <span>By her decree, the Military Maritime Commission was established, proposing to reopen the <span>port</span> and shipyards in <span>Arkhangelsk</span> .</span>  <span>Since 1731, regular military exercises that have not been held in the Baltic Sea resumed long ago.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>The serf system in the years of her reign did not in the least weaken its grip.</span>  <span>In conditions of backward production, this, of course, brought good income.</span>  <span>In 1736, by decree of the Empress, the class of civilian workers was actually eliminated.</span>  <span>From that moment on, all of them, together with their families, were attached to manufactories.</span> </p><p>  <span>It may seem that the reforms of Anna Ioannovna regarding industrial production were progressive.</span>  <span>In reality, they suppressed capitalist initiative.</span>  <span>The government tightly controlled the entire production process and, with the slightest violation of the law, confiscated plants in favor of the treasury.</span> </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  <span>Thus, the reforms of Anna Ioannovna can be briefly described as aimed at strengthening the autocratic power, the satisfaction of the noble petitions and the strengthening of serfdom.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Her reign lasted only ten years.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In historical literature, it has not received flattering assessments.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">On the one hand, Anna Ivanovna is blamed for the dominance of the Germans in the state apparatus, on the other hand, for the brutal persecution of political opponents.</span> </p><p>  <span>Be that as it may, but, having examined the reforms of its rule, it cannot be denied that some of them nevertheless served for the good of the future development of Russia.</span> </p>
