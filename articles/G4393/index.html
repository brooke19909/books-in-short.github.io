The main architectural monument of the center is the Cathedral of St. Mary, which was erected 800 years ago.  The building was laid in 1230. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.layoverguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Palma de" class="if uuid-2971344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2971344.jpg"></div><p>  But the decoration of the interior and facades was completed only in the twentieth century.  The cathedral is made in the Gothic style.  The special structure of the windows gives the room an unusual look.  It seems that the temple is filled with light.  The exterior lighting and the interiors of the building were designed by Antonio Gaudi himself. </p><h2>  Almudine Palace </h2><p>  Another interesting place of Palma (Spain), the photo of which is given below, is the Almudain Palace, which is the oldest in the country.  During the reign of the Arabs on the island, the palazio was a real fortress that protected the whole city.  The architecture of the building is very characteristic of the Middle Ages.  The rectangular structure has two paved towers.  One of them is called the "Tower of the Angel", on it is a statue of the archangel Gabriel, who is considered the patron saint of Palma. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.northsouthguides.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palma Spain photo" class="if uuid-2971442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2971442.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the Almudine Palace is the official residence of the royal family.  Here is the commandant of the Balearic Islands.  In addition, the building houses the National Museum.  On the territory of the palace you can see a small courtyard called the Royal, which houses a fourteenth-century chapel, made in the Gothic style.  At its foot there is a garden. </p><h2>  La lonja </h2><p>  Another building of the city, made in the Gothic style, is La Lonja.  It was built in 1456.  In those distant times, it housed the Trade Exchange, which was considered the center of the economic life of the city.  The building is often called the symbol of the prosperity of Spanish commerce. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.masmallorca.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palma city in Spain" class="if uuid-2971400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2971400.jpg"></div><p>  In the fifteenth century, it lost its meaning, and therefore they kept grain in it.  Now the building is considered one of the most luxurious in the city.  Within its walls, exhibitions, meetings, receptions and other official events are held.  On the facade of the building is a statue of an angel, and the interior is notable for unusual spiral columns that look like palm trees. </p><h2>  Belver Castle </h2><p>  Another fortification of the city is <span>Belver Castle,</span> located on a 140-meter hill in the western part of the city.

The architectural structure was erected in the fourteenth century, and at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there was a prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sealandvillas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Palma de Mallorca Spain" class="if uuid-2971379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2971379.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the building houses the Palma Museum.  It‚Äôs worth a visit to the castle even in order to enjoy the beautiful view from the observation deck.  From here you can see the bay and the whole city.  And in clear weather you can even see the outlines of a neighboring island. </p><h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  Another place that tourists will enjoy is the zoo.  It was created in 1998.  On its territory, adults and children can admire birds, primates, predators and other representatives of the animal world.  But the pride of the institution is the lemurs.  The zoo has playgrounds for children, and for adults - recreational facilities. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  No beach resort can be imagined without a water park.

For a family visit it is difficult to find a more interesting place. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  What else attracts tourists to Palma (Spain)?  Whatever the sights in the city, the beaches of the resort are of most interest.  They have long been attracting thousands of tourists here annually.  The coast of Palma de Mallorca is a soft sand and a gentle beach.  The beaches of the resort are deservedly awarded with the Blue Flags.  The coast of the city has a very developed infrastructure.

True, they need to pay 10 euros for renting a sunbed and an umbrella.  But for 15 euros you can buy your own umbrella in the store.  Tourists note that almost all the beaches of the resort are free.  An exception can be considered small sections of the coast, which are considered club zones of some establishments.  Such VIP beaches are more secluded.  Additional services are available on their territory.  There are only three of these beaches on the coast of Palma de Mallorca. </p><p>  A few words must be said about Cala Major.  This small beach is located in the very center of the city.  Numerous tourists are attracted here by the clear water and sandy shore. </p><h2>  Hotels Palma Mallorca (Spain) </h2><p>  Any tourist will be interested in the question of where to stay in the city.  There are a lot of hotels in Palma de Mallorca (Spain), since the region is fully tourism oriented.  Among them, you can find not only expensive establishments, but also the cheapest hostels.
