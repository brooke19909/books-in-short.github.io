Home port - Kaliningrad.  It is one of the largest <span>sailing ships</span> in the world.  A similar sailing ship, existing today, is the four-masted Sedov bark. </p><p>  The ship was built in Germany in 1925-1926, at the Tecklenborg shipyard.  He was launched under the name "Padua".  After the end of the war of 1941-1945, in accordance with the reparation agreement, the vessel came under the jurisdiction of the USSR and was renamed in honor of the naval commander Kruzenshtern Ivan Fedorovich. </p>

    <h2>  Ship - "windjammer" </h2><p>  The four-masted Kruzenshtern (bark- windjammer) is a classic <span>sailing ship,</span> "squeezing the wind", with maximum efficiency (efficiency) of its own sailing system.  In 1933, the high-speed sailing ship set two cruising speed records: from the German <span>port of Hamburg</span> to the port city of Talcahuano, in Chile, the Kruzenshtern (then also Padua) reached in just 87 days, rounding the Cape Horn, the southern tip of the American mainland.  From Hamburg to the Australian Port Lincoln, through the Pacific Ocean, the ship reached in 67 days.  These two ocean transitions were the fastest in the history of the sailing fleet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1956, Kruzenshtern got a major overhaul that lasted five years.  Then the ship was included in the research group of the ships of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and since 1962 the ship became the base for practical training of cadets of the naval school. </p><h2>  Homepage in Kaliningrad </h2><p>  In the summer of 1967, the sailboat became part of the fleet of the USSR Ministry of <span>Fisheries</span> .  In 1991, Kruzenshtern, a bark with experience, was transferred to the Higher Engineering School of Marine Research, which was located in Kaliningrad.  Along with practical exercises for cadets of the school, the bark carried out the tasks of exploring the fish stocks of the <span>Baltic Sea,</span> and also went to the <span>Atlantic Ocean.</span> </p><p>  Sailing ship Kruzenshtern is a bark with significant potential, the speed characteristics of which allow the vessel to be used in various maritime competitions.  In the 1992 international regatta, Kruzenshtern defeated the other participants by a wide margin, showing 17.4 knots of speed at a distance of Boston-Liverpool, which is no less 34.5 km / h. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bark Kruzenshtern in Sevastopol" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10639/452544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Travel around the world </h2><p>  In 1995, Kruzenshtern made its first trip around the world, during which three oceans traveled, crossed the equator four times, went to 15 ports of thirteen countries and covered a total of 42,432 <span>nautical miles.</span>  The voyage was dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet, the 225th anniversary of the birth of IF Kruzenshtern, as well as the 190th anniversary of the first round-the-world Russian expedition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next trip of the Kruzenshtern barque around the globe took place in 2005.  This time the trip around the world was dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the Victory and the 200th anniversary of the circumnavigation of I.F. Kruzenshtern.  The sailboat left the Petersburg port on June 24, 2005, went down to the French port city of Cherbourg and took part in Tall Ships Race-2005, the annual regatta.  Then the Kruzenshtern continued the journey. </p>

    <h2>  Transatlantic swimming </h2><p>  The next trip of Kruzenshtern was the transatlantic expedition, which began in 2009.  Bark participated in the Atlantic Challenge 2009, a regatta of ships with direct sails, which took place in the city of <span>Vigo (Spain).</span>  However, this time the legendary ship was unlucky - during a night flurry, sails on the main mast were seriously damaged by a gust of wind.  After the repair, Kruzenshtern continued sailing. </p><h2>  Olympic Games </h2><p>  During the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, this year, the Kruzenshtern barque has become one of the main attractions for tourists.  The ship came to Sochi from Kaliningrad through the Black Sea.  Within a month, the Kruzenshtern's deck was open to all comers, and the large team of cadets of the training vessel all this time fulfilled the honorary duties of Olympic volunteers. </p>

    <h2>  Bark "Kruzenshtern" in Sevastopol </h2><p>  In early May 2014, the ship left the hospitable Sochi port and went to Sevastopol.  Bark "Kruzenshtern" in Sevastopol <strong>is</strong> a real event for the hero city.  From May 8 until the end of the holiday in honor of Victory Day, the ship was open for visits.  Neither the captain, nor the boatswain, nor the crew will recall such a number of people who want to get acquainted with the legendary sailboat. </p><h2>  Where is the Kruzenshtern barque now </h2><p>  Currently, the Kruzenshtern bark is anchored on the beam of the Norwegian port city of Bergen.  This is the answer to the question, where is the Kruzenshtern bark now.  On July 20 of this year, competitions were held between cadets.  The four teams that are currently undergoing practical training on board the ship, the Jung team from Nizhny Novgorod and the sailors' team are competitors.  Only six close-knit teams, each of which must pass on a boat around the ship on oars and for a while.  The best time of the winner, the BGA SVF team (Baltic State Academy, the Faculty of Navigation), is 5 minutes 15 seconds. </p>
