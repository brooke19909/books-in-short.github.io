In other countries, communication devices from this manufacturer are in demand.  For example, on a Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini smartphone, the price is quite low with high quality.  They collect computer equipment and communication tools for the company's development in China, because it is this country that provides its services to lesser-known manufacturers.  Smartphone Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 is of interest due to its high-quality filling and relatively small dimensions.  We will talk about him further. </p><h2>  Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini: delivery overview </h2>

The design is designed without any frills, it is quite simple and consists of a small rectangular box with a transparent lid, behind which you can see the Micromax Mini itself.  On the product cover there is a company logo and the name of the model of the communication device.  In this package, you can safely transport your smartphone, because the materials for it were used high-quality and strong.

On the back surface of the package there is information about the smartphone model and its release date. </p><p>  After opening the seal, a communicator opens in front of us, packed in a shipping film and located on a plastic stand.  Under the telephone, manufacturers placed all the necessary information about the mobile product and documents.  You can also see additional accessories that come with the smartphone.  Each accessory is packaged in a separate Micromax logo package.  A set of add-ons for a mobile phone is very standard: a power adapter, a stereo headset, a USB cable, a clip for a SIM card, user instructions and product documents. </p><h2>  Device dimensions </h2>

Some users, taking the phone out of the box, suggest that the battery is not inserted in it, and therefore it is so light.  In fact, manufacturers took care of the weight of the mobile device, despite all its configuration.

    <p>  Micromax is confident that the phone should not have an impressive volume, since it is constantly transported in the pockets of clothes, because the inappropriate dimensions of the device will cause discomfort for its owner.  The thickness of the smartphone is also small, it is only 7.8 mm.  This size, of course, is not a record, but it is quite acceptable for communicators from this price category. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini: build reviews </h2><p>  In the design of the device, only the back cover is removable.  Having removed it from the product, we can see the SIM card slot and the connector for the storage medium.  The back cover is slightly behind the case, but in appearance this slight flaw is not at all noticeable. </p><p>  The assembly of the smartphone is high-quality, no creaks and backlashes were noted.  The front of the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini is made without the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, there is a slot for the speaker above the screen, and to the left of it is the front camera window.  On the front panel there are also light sensors and proximity when photographing or filming.  Near the speaker is an LED event indicator.  In the upper part of the case we can see a universal port for data transfer and a charger, in the right corner there is a headset jack.  Only the microphone hole is located below. </p>

    <p>  On the right side of the smartphone, you can find several buttons that are responsible for locking the screen, turning on the device and adjusting the volume.  On the left is the connector for the second SIM card, which can be changed using a special paperclip that comes with the device.  Under the display, three buttons are standardly located to control the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini.  They are fully sensory and even when locked are highlighted in white.  The design of the mobile phone is mainly made of metal, plastic inserts are present only from below and above the body of the product.  On the back you can see a large camera window (8 megapixels), it is coated with chrome to protect the lens from rubbing and various damage.  A little lower is the camcorder flash and the manufacturer's logo.  The back of the smartphone has smoothed corners, this helps to avoid the external bulkiness of the device and is used for comfortable grip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Platform </h2>

The communicator works on Android 4.2.2.  There has not yet been an official update to this program.  It is not known whether it will be at all.

    <p>  The interface of the mobile phone is standard, as with all devices on the Android.  The icons are simply redrawn, they are large enough and are perceived perfectly.  The interface has a special shutter that allows you to quickly switch from information tabs to settings. </p><p>  The transition button at the bottom of the device is very well placed, because it is usually at the top of a mobile device, so it‚Äôs not always convenient to reach it in competing devices.  This key is signed, it can be pressed even while holding the phone with your left hand.  The Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini has gesture support for controlling the device, there are even more of them than any flagship.  There are no special differences from the standard interface for this model, it is very convenient for the average user, because you don‚Äôt have to spend extra time studying the instructions in order to learn how to use the phone.  The system is designed simply, without special design ideas and works smoothly. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

RAM in a mobile device is about a gigabyte, but you can use only half of the total.  In order not to waste resources, always close unnecessary applications, this is enough for the smooth operation of the device and to maintain a certain margin.  The interface as a whole works smoothly, there were no delays during use.  3D games are supported by the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini smartphone, reviews, however, tell us that brakes are possible during the game itself.  Some complex applications do not open at all.  A plus is the complete absence of throttling and heating of the device during heavy load.

Like all modern smartphones, there is no air gap between the matrix and the glass of the screen.  And this is not all surprises.  The matrix in the phone is installed quite powerful and high quality.  The responsiveness of the touch screen does not cause any complaints, it supports up to ten clicks at a time.  When using the device, fingerprints may remain on the screen, which are very difficult to remove from it.  The surface of the palm slides on the surface of the display without any problems.  Viewing angles are large, when you turn the screen, the colors do not fade and practically do not change.  White in the smartphone has a slightly grayish tint, and black may be mixed with blue.  In general, using the phone does not cause discomfort and problems.

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Management of the video player is simple, no additional features are provided in the device.  The sound quality during file playback is average.  At maximum volume, a ringing is heard, but in general, the perception is quite pleasant.  The special headset provided in the kit, together with the smartphone, does not satisfy with its quality.  It‚Äôs easier to connect headphones from another mobile phone, then the communicator can be used as a player. </p><h2>  Pair of rooms </h2><p>  Simultaneous operation of SIM cards occurs using the antenna module, which must be used in series.  When talking from one SIM card, the second is automatically turned off.  To install an additional number you do not have to disconnect the phone, on the side panel there is a special connector for these purposes.  The signal level in the mobile device is stable, only sometimes a few divisions of the indicator disappear.  No problems with access to the Internet were found, the pages are actively loaded both through the mobile network and through a wireless connection. </p><h2>  Carriers </h2><p>  Built-in memory is divided into 2 parts: 1.6 GB and 1 GB.  As already noted, you can use only half the amount of internal memory.  This memory is not enough for a modern smartphone, because only one movie with HD resolution will take just 1.6 GB.  The way out of this situation is to connect a microCD card.  The device can support up to 32 GB extra. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  The developers tried to make the Micromax smartphone as light as possible, but at the same time sacrificed a battery.  It is non-removable, and charging comes from a network adapter or computer.  The battery reserve is enough only for half-hour communication on mobile communications and correspondence on the Internet.  If you take a smartphone on the road, prefer to watch movies on it, it is recommended to worry about charging in advance.  With such a mass of the mobile phone, the corresponding battery is supplied. </p><p>  Among all smartphones with an average budget, this model takes an intermediate place and will undoubtedly be able to find its customers.  In conclusion, it should be said that Micromax was among the ten largest mobile phone manufacturers worldwide.  At the same time, this brand takes first place in his native India.  In the assortment of the manufacturer, you can find memory cards, 3G smartphones and much more. </p>
