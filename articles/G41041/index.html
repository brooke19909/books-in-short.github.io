A smartphone, unlike most of its counterparts, is more likely to fall into a budget niche, as the price tag says.  There is nothing special about the specifications, but support for two SIM-cards and a good camera.  Well, let‚Äôs take a closer look at the specifications of the Sony T2 Ultra.  The price of the device at the time of writing was 15,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Well, to begin, of course, it is worth starting with the configuration of the device.  The Sony T2 Ultra Dual comes in a small box that is made of plain cardboard.  Everything looks inexpensive, comparable to what many Chinese companies demonstrate.  The delivery set is also not generous: </p><ul><li>  Smartphone. </li><li>  Manuals. </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  Charger. </li></ul><p>  To use this is enough, but I would like to see a protective glass so as not to buy it separately.  Yes, and the headphones would not hurt. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Sony T2 is made in the best traditions of the company.  At first glance, you can fall in love with this inexpensive phablet.  In addition to its attractive appearance, the device is quite compact.  Easy to use with one hand, fits in a small pocket or purse.  Presented in the market in the following color variations: black, white and purple.  In general, a typical representative of Sony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The case is made of plastic.  The ends received a thin silver insert, which gives solidity to the device.  On the right side of the Sony T2 Ultra Dual are the main controls: the power button, volume rocker, and a separate button for the camera.  Here, just above, there is a 3.5 mm input for headphones and a memory card tray.  The lower and upper ends are empty.  On the left edge is a slot for two SIM-cards.  In the upper corner there is a microUSB port. </p><p>  On the front side of the Sony <span>Xperia T2 Ultra Dual,</span> everything is standard: a screen, a speaker, sensors, a front camera.  On-screen keys are available for user control.  At the bottom is a metal grill of the external speaker.  The back cover of Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual is occupied by the camera eye with an LED flash, an external speaker and several manufacturer logos. </p><p>  Did not adopt the model from older brothers protection against moisture.  This is immediately hinted at by the open charging port.  The flagship Sony T2 Dual is a long way off, but in the budget niche it feels confident. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  In this regard, the device is a real giant.  A 6-inch screen is installed, which many seem to be very large.  Yes, in everyday work it may not be very convenient, but it‚Äôs comfortable to watch movies and surf the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Sony <span>Xperia T2 Dual display is</span> based on the TFT matrix, which is slightly inferior to IPS.  HD resolution, that is, 1280x720 pixels.  In general, the screen is not bad, but you can find fault.  White with a touch of yellow, sometimes not enough brightness.  Viewing angles are pretty good, but not perfect. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Sony devices could always please the user with good quality photos.  The Sony T2 Dual was no exception.  The main 13-megapixel Exmor RS module.  There is an LED flash and autofocus.  There are various effects for processing photos.  Convenience from using the camera adds a separate control key.  There are several shooting modes, even manual.  It is able to recognize faces and blur the background. </p><p>  The camera is decent, but it is far from flagship solutions.  Pictures are obtained quite natural, saturated and detailed.  Under normal lighting behaves pretty well.  True, one can often notice that sharpness falls on the edges.  The automatic shooting mode completely handles the tasks, so you can not switch to manual mode.  But at night the photos are of very low quality.  The focusing speed decreases, the system tries to get rid of noise, but the detail suffers.  The camera can record video, but only in HD quality.  The videos are good, but nothing more. </p><p>  For the needs of the user there is also a front camera.  It is installed more likely for ordinary video calls.  The module is only 1.1 megapixels.  Various modes and effects correct the situation a little. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The hardware of the smartphone is represented by typical components for a budget class.  The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is the Qualcomm MSM8228 quad-core processor.  Average in power, but supports working with LTE, which is its main advantage.  All four Cortex-A7 cores operate at a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The advantages of Qualcomm MSM8228 include low power consumption, which older models cannot boast of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The budget <span>Adreno 305</span> acts as a graphics adapter <span>.</span> In AnTuTu, the device scores about 19,000 points.  For modern processor tasks, end-to-end, given the screen size. </p><p>  RAM in the smartphone is only 1 GB, which today is not enough for every user.  The operating system and standard applications consume quite a lot, for the needs of the owner there is a scanty amount.  Good multitasking can be forgotten.  You constantly have to clean up open programs and games.  Sometimes you may notice slight slowdowns on the desktop, but this can also be caused by a ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù system.  The amount of RAM is one of the significant flaws of the phablet. </p>

    <p>  Not happy and the capacity of the internal drive - only 8 GB.  Given the "appetite" of the operating system and modern programs, this is very small, even for the most undemanding users.  The ability to install memory cards corrects the situation, but they will have to be purchased separately. </p><p>  In general, the processor is sufficient for the stable operation of the phablet (not the highest screen resolution affects).  Not enough internal memory, but memory cards save.  But there is nothing to be done with the operational one; you have to limit the use of certain programs. </p><p>  The system copes with work on the Web without any problems.  High-resolution movies play smoothly, but the standard player does not support some formats.  In this case, third-party players come to the rescue, which are available for free download. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The phablet is running the Android operating system.  Initially, versions were released with Android 4.1, but received an update to 5.1.  In some aspects, the interface differs from other models, due to the large screen.  Icons were enlarged and the grid expanded.  The result is huge badges, which for some will be a plus, and for others - a serious minus. </p>

    <p>  Sony T2 did not remain without proprietary firmware.  In this regard, everything is similar to what is in other devices of the company.  There is a set of themes that will make the interface more convenient and attractive.  There was no phablet without "chips."  It is enough to make a double tap on the Home button, so that <span>the status bar</span> appears <span>.</span>  This is done for a more comfortable use of the large screen.  There is support for working with gloves, which can be appreciated in the cold seasons. </p><p>  For the rest, here is a typical Android interface with interspersed Sony branded "chips".  Using it is quite convenient, and does not bother. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The phablet received a non-removable 3000 mAh battery.  Capacity is not the best on the market, but for a 6-inch device is acceptable.  The manufacturer said that the device can work up to 16 hours in standby mode, up to 11 hours of video playback.  Melomanov was encouraged by the fact that the smartphone will be able to play music for more than 80 hours.  Given the diagonal of the screen, these statements looked overpriced. </p><p>  In fact, in terms of autonomy, the Sony T2 proved to be the best.  About 10 hours plays HD-video at almost maximum brightness.  In modern games, everything is not so rosy - 5-6 hours.  With medium loads, you can count on a whole day without recharging.  If you reduce the intensity of use, the smartphone will last several days. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Sony T2 Ultra, the price of which looks reasonable even today, simply could not help attracting the attention of users.  Reviews about the smartphone are usually positive, but some owners do not forget about the shortcomings.  The main one is the amount of RAM.  Selfie lovers were unhappy with the front camera.  The minor disadvantages include the rear panel, which is scratched very quickly. </p>
