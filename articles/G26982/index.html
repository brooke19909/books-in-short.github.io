Ierapetra, Crete</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the many islands surrounding Crete is the island of Chrysi, or Gaiduronisi.  One name means "golden", the second - "donkey".  This uninhabited piece of land is very popular among tourists because of the beautiful beaches with golden sand, landscapes and sea landscapes.  The unique nature is capable of captivating the heart and touching the tender strings of the soul of every tourist, filling it with dreams. </p><h2>  Geographical Information </h2><p>  The name "Golden" was given to the island of Chrysi for the color of the sand on the beaches.  It consists of a seashell milled by the sea and time. </p><p>  Chrysi is located in the <span>Libyan Sea</span> south of the island of Crete, at a distance of 8 nautical miles from the city of Ierapetra, from where all the tourists come here.  The shape of the island is long (5 km) and narrow (1 km).  Its relief is flat, which is why from afar it looks like a thin strip of earth, slightly protruding from the depths of the sea. </p><p>  At 700 meters from Chrysi there is another islet of Mikronisi. Its name is translated - "small island".  Almost the entire territory is covered with cliffs inhabited by colonies of snow-white gulls.  Some tourists and bird lovers also come there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chrysi Island" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1999816.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Ierapetra </h2><p>  All tourists who want to get to Chrysi come to the port of Ierapetra in Crete.  It is located on the shores of the Libyan Sea, you can get into it from the nearest airport in Heraklion.  This is a small fishing village located on the south coast of Crete and is not very popular among tourists, so it will be interesting for those who prefer a holiday in silence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ierapetra is surrounded by very picturesque mountains and gorges, which do not allow strong winds to enter here, which favorably affects its climate.  It is especially popular in the velvet season.  Tourists who come here in September-October will enjoy the warm sea and good weather. </p><p>  One of the old districts of this village - Kato Mera - consists of narrow streets and ancient buildings.  Among the attractions here is Napoleon's house, in which he stopped on his way to Egypt, the old mosque and the small church of Agios Georgios, decorated with unusual wooden domes for Crete.  Ierapetra's calling card is the Kules fortress, founded by the Venetians and rebuilt by the Turks.  Festivals and other events are held here. </p><p>  Near the village there are many interesting and beautiful caves, which makes it extremely popular.  Another natural attraction is the Orino Gorge, where thousands of bright butterflies flock.  In this region of the island there are many scenic routes, including a road to the gorges of Milon and Sarakin, you can meet beautiful waterfalls and streams with crystal clear water. </p><h2>  How to get to Chrysi Island </h2><p>  The best time to visit the island is from May to the end of October.  Small ships or ferries go to Chrysi, departing from the pier of Ierapetra (Crete).  Tickets can be bought in advance or directly at the port, daily flights. </p><p>  Round-trip tickets for one boat are purchased.  Usually, 6 hours is enough for tourists, during which they manage to walk along the beaches, enjoy the turquoise color of the sea, and visit local attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Standard departure times for boats: from 10.30 to 12.00 every 30 minutes, return flights end at 18.00.  Travel time: 40-60 minutes, ticket price: 12 euros (children under 13 years old) and 25 euros (adult).  There is no drinking water on the island, so it is better to stock up on it in advance. </p>

    <p>  On board the boat you can buy food (salads, sandwiches, pizza, pastries, ice cream, coffee and other drinks) and drinking water, as well as beach accessories. </p><h2>  Historic buildings in Chrysi </h2><p>  During Byzantium, there were settlements on the island of Chrysi in Greece, whose locals were fishermen and traders.  The remains of the old port and the Minoan settlement, wells and graves dating back to the times of the Roman Empire were preserved on the territory. </p><p>  The main occupations of the inhabitants were the extraction of salt and the production of purple, a dye used to color the cloaks of noblemen.  Evidence of this activity was the old salt lake, from which salt was mined, and the lighthouse, which showed the way for ships arriving at the port.  Also on the island is the church of Agios Nicholas (St. Nicholas), dating from the 13th century. </p>

    <p>  In a later period, the island of Chrysi was chosen by Mediterranean pirates, who arranged a shelter here.  Thanks to their activities, flooded pirate and merchant ships lie in coastal waters.  It was because of the pirates that this island later became uninhabited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the records of the traveler Stasiasmus, who visited here in the 19th century, you can find out that there was a harbor for ships, sources of drinking water.  But already more recent data characterize it as an uninhabited island, planted only with bushes and cedar forests. </p><h2>  Reserve island </h2><p>  Chrysi is considered a conservation area, as  70% of its area (3.5 sq. Km) is covered by cedar forest.  It is famous for a rare Lebanese cedar over 200 years old.  <span>The density of trees</span> averages 14 per 1 sq. Km.  km, there are also many species of Crete flora, of which 13 grow only here. </p><p>  Rare plants were threatened with extinction, as a result of which a reserve was created here, the territory of which is protected by international agreements and laws.  The forest is surrounded by a fence for which tourists are forbidden to enter.  Allowed to walk here only on paved paths. </p>

    <p>  The unique ecosystem of Chrysi Island is included in the European nature conservation program Natura-2000, so the collection <span>of seashells</span> and stones is prohibited here. </p><p>  Scientists who conducted excavations on the northern coast of the island, discovered among the volcanic rocks ancient fossils dating to the age of 350 thousand years, when the island was still under water. </p><h2>  Lebanese cedar </h2><p>  The main value of the island of Chrysi is the forest, consisting of a rare variety of <span>Lebanese cedar.</span>  This forest is the only and unique in southern Europe. </p><p>  Lebanese cedar is an evergreen coniferous tree, reaching a height of up to 50 m and having a trunk diameter of up to 2.5 m. Trees are found on Chrysi a little less - their trunk is usually no more than 1 m at a height of 5-10 m. The wood has a red color, very light and soft, trees and needles give a strong ethereal aroma.  In ancient times, ships in Phenicia and Egypt were made from cedar wood. </p><p>  Cedar has a highly developed root system, the radius of which exceeds the height of the tree by 2 times.  It is thanks to such a large number and length of roots that trees find moisture for themselves.  Indeed, there is no fresh water on the island itself. </p><h2>  Beaches and the sea </h2><p>  The boat drops passengers in the only port of the island.  In order to get to the nearest beach, you need to follow the road passing through the cedar forest.  This beach is not without reason called Chrysi Ammos (Golden Sand), because it is strewn with thousands of small shells, forming the golden and pink sand, which is so famous for Chrysi. </p>

    <p>  The sea is shallow and has an unusually beautiful turquoise color.  Its depth around the island is less than 10 m, the bottom is dotted with shells of different sizes, which attracts divers and lovers of underwater sports. </p><p>  The color of the soil on the island varies from gray-green and red-brown to black.  The base layer of the earth is volcanic hardened lava, which spilled from the vent of the volcano several million years ago. </p><p>  In addition to the Golden, there are other beaches on Chrysi: in the western direction from Chrysi Ammos is Hatzivolakas.  This is a more secluded place overlooking the cliffs and surrounded by tall cedars.  A little to the west are the ruins of the Minoan settlement. </p><p>  Another beautiful Kataposopo beach is located opposite the islet of Mikronisi.  Both beaches are strewn with pleasant golden and pink sand, consisting of crushed shell rock of all shapes and types. </p>
