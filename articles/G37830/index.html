    <p>  A slow cooker can be safely called a modern analogue of the <span>Russian stove.</span>  This is a very good option, since such an electric pan can do almost everything - fry, cook, steam, stew and bake.  In this case, the owner only has to lay down the necessary ingredients from time to time, and the multicooker will cook herself, she only needs to appoint a suitable program. </p><p>  Among the advantages of the unit, it can be noted that in such a pan the food does not cool for a very long time, because after cooking is complete, the appliance does not turn off, it starts its work in the heating mode.  However, do not expect miracles; you will still take part in cooking.  For example, you will think up how else to surprise your loved ones.  She cannot peel or cut products on her own, rinse cereals and more.  However, if you decide to purchase it, then know that it will give you a lot of joy from cooking delicious dishes.  Choosing a multicooker can be a daunting task, and this will be discussed later.  It is important to pay attention to a number of nuances. </p><p>  Choosing a multicooker: what you should know? </p><p>  This device is a pan having an integrated microprocessor.  Inside it is a bowl with <span>non-stick coating,</span> it is there that all the products are laid.  Modern models have a special steam valve that prevents the products from ‚Äúescaping‚Äù, as well as a container for drops, in which condensate will accumulate.  A slow cooker, the choice of which may not be easy at all, also has drawbacks, among which slow cooking is considered the main one.  You can wait until the usual milk porridge is cooked for more than an hour, and if it comes to meat, you can forget about it for 6 hours. However, given that you will be completely free at this time, you can discard this drawback.  You just have to lay the products earlier than you do with traditional cooking, and then go about your business, because there is no need to stand at the stove. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Multi-cooker selection: what is it for? </p><p>  This device has a lot of different functions that allow you to cook certain dishes, showing your imagination.  Let's look at its most useful features. </p><p>  The "pilaf" mode.  Naturally, you can cook the above dish, but not only it.  This mode works according to the following principle: first, the liquid evaporates, and then (about 10 minutes) the food is roasted in a pan.  This can be navy pasta, meat with vegetables, dumplings with a crust. </p><p>  Buckwheat mode.  In this mode, you have the opportunity to cook various friable cereals or some complex side dishes.  It is based on the evaporation of moisture. </p><p>  The "milk porridge" mode.  So you can prepare a <span>delicious breakfast</span> while all your homeworkers are still sleeping.  You can lay all the necessary ingredients in the evening, and then turn on the timer at the right time.  In the morning everything will be ready, and you just have to serve breakfast to the table. </p><p>  Multi cooker selection: a few nuances </p><p>  There are not many varieties of multicookers on the market.  However, there are several secrets to their choice.  First of all, the volume of the bowl is important.  The most popular option now are crock-pots with a 4-5 liter bowl.  When choosing, it is worth remembering the automatic heating function.  As mentioned earlier, it should automatically go into such a mode when the food is ready.  This will allow you not to be afraid to be late for dinner, as in any case a warm dish will be waiting for you.  And the delay timer is another very important and useful feature.  In the morning you can always wake up knowing that your slow cooker will already delight you with a hot ready-made dish. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that the most popular brands of multicookers can be called Redmond and Brand, which are in the average price range.  But it's up to you to decide which multicooker to buy. </p>
