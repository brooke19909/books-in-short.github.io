This trend is also characteristic of the Japanese company Sony.  In particular, a few months ago, another new product from this manufacturer appeared on the domestic market.  She became the smartphone <span>Sony Xperia C</span> C2305.  Being not a very complicated device from a technical point of view, it fully meets the requirements of modern consumers and at the same time has a relatively low cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son c2305" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  Durable plastic is used to produce the model.  Only the on / off button and the rim of the camera are made of metal.  The choice of the user offers phones in black, white and purple, which has already become a characteristic feature for the line called Xperia C. The developers have covered the front panel with protective glass.  On it is a five-inch touch screen, <span>light sensor,</span> microphone, speaker and <span>front camera.</span>  The manufacturer equipped the Sony C2305 left side face with a convenient <span>volume control,</span> as well as buttons designed to activate the camera and power.  At the opposite end there is only a microUSB port.  The hole for connecting the lace is located below.  The back of the device is slightly concave in shape.  Here is the speaker, the main camera and the auto focus backlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, in the design of the novelty there are no extra elements.  The size of the model is 141.5x74.15 mm in height and width, respectively.  At the same time, its thickness is only 8.88 mm, which is a pretty good indicator, which many users pay attention to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son c2305 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546113.jpg" width="531"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Stylish and at the same time elegant appearance provides great appeal Sony C2305.  The reviews of the owners of the device indicate that it is very convenient in the hand.  Moreover, thanks to the matte surface of the back cover and rounded corners, the phone does not slip out of your hands even during a long conversation.  Quite an interesting design solution that gives the device accuracy and elegance, many users call the execution of the side faces of glossy plastic.  It should be noted that the case of the model has a new design, thanks to which there is no back cover.  Because of this, opening a smartphone is not so simple. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The <span>Sony Xperia C</span> C2305 phone supports two SIM cards, switching between which is convenient and quick.  In addition, when talking on one of them, the second is automatically turned off.  The device supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, and navigation is carried out due to the A-GPS system.  As practice shows, reliable communication and fast exchange with paired devices occurs without the failure of wireless technology.  Among the basic modification programs includes the Google Talk application, with which you can send messages to chat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son c2305 reviews" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As noted above, the model has a five-inch touchscreen monitor.  Its resolution is 960x540.  It is impossible to call such an indicator impressive, therefore, there can be no question of the ideal image quality - small details and fonts do not look exactly even.  Additional glass of the second generation Schott provides good protection of the device from various external influences.  The sensor is capable of recognizing up to five touches at the same time, and its sensors quickly respond even to light clicks.  The transition between applications, menu options, scaling and scrolling are performed smoothly and efficiently. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The eight-megapixel camera located on the back side can be safely called one of the main advantages of the Sony C2305 model.  Its review is quite extensive.  At the same time, thanks to the use of the Exmor RS high-sensitivity sensor, excellent image quality is ensured even in poor lighting conditions.  The camera has a number of various settings and modes, which allows you to get photos with amazing detail, brightness, color reproduction and clarity.  A rather interesting and unique feature was Self-Portrait.  Its essence lies in the fact that you just need to point the camera lens at yourself, after which the device itself will take an excellent picture using voice prompts.  Among other things, the presence of several modes boasts a focus system.  A separate button on the case will allow you to photograph objects even in the locked state of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone sony xperia c c2305" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Model Sony C2305 has a processor with four cores, the clock frequency of each of which is 1.2 GHz.  In addition, a good operating speed of the device is provided by 1 GB of RAM.  All programs, regardless of their size, run and work without delay.  As for the stationary memory, its size is only 4 GB, however, if necessary, you can install an additional microSD card.  The device is just perfect for web surfing. </p><h2>  Menu and controls </h2><p>  Like many other modern modifications, the smartphone Sony C2305 operates on the operating system Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.  It should be noted that its interface is quite successfully adapted specifically for this device.  The user can configure the screen settings independently.  The menu allows access to the phone book, applications (standard and installed optionally), a list of messages, an Internet browser and, of course, the Google Play application.  Touch control buttons for switching between programs and returning to the home page are located at the bottom of the monitor.  As for information regarding the current state of the phone, including signal quality of networks, wireless, current time, battery charge, and message notifications, it is displayed on top. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia c c2305" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Sony C2305 is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery with a capacity of 2390 mAh.  Taking into account the modest indicators of the screen, which were discussed earlier, such a volume is more than enough.  A vivid confirmation of this can be called the fact that even under intensive use, the smartphone will be discharged only after a day.  Moreover, the device has a special energy-saving mode, when activated, all unnecessary applications that consume a lot of energy are automatically turned off.  This allows you to increase the operating time of the device by two to three times.  In continuous talk mode, a full battery charge is enough for about 10 hours, while on standby - for 588 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony c2305" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/546111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  To summarize, the main advantages and disadvantages of the Sony C2305 should be mentioned.  The main advantages of the model, experts include a stylish look, a unique body design, a camera with eight megapixels, a processor and support for two SIM cards.  As for the weaknesses of the device, this is a small resolution of the display and the frequent appearance of glare on a glossy surface under bright lighting.  In general, for its price segment (in domestic stores you need to pay about 10 thousand rubles per phone), the device can be safely called a fairly good choice.  It is able to provide excellent communication quality and easily copes with a wide variety of tasks.  Moreover, despite its relatively low cost, the phone has quite powerful features that meet modern requirements for devices of this kind. </p>
