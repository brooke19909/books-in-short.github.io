And such a trifle as beautiful and warm slippers in winter is simply necessary.  How to crochet slippers?  We will get acquainted with the description and diagram a little further. </p><h2>  How to tie the sole </h2><p>  This diagram and description of the process of knitting the soles are universal.  It can be used for each model you choose.  First, let's figure out how to determine the right size.  It can be adjusted and knitted all according to the same description, it does not matter if you knit for yourself or for a child. </p><ul><li>  Outline your foot on paper. </li><li>  Take a centimeter tape (if not at hand, you can use a piece of thread). </li><li>  At the top and bottom of our sole, step back three centimeters. </li><li>  This segment is the length we need to get started. </li></ul>

    <p>  We turn to knitting the sole itself. </p><ol><li>  Type a chain of loops of the length we need (for example, this is 17 centimeters, in this segment I got 15 loops).  It all depends on the chosen yarn and the thickness of the hook. </li><li>  Having typed our chain of the required length, knit 2 more lifting loops.  In our 15th loop we knit a single crochet column.  We knit with such columns before the beginning of the chain. </li><li>  In the first loop we knit seven single crochet posts.  This is our sock.  Next, we knit round to our 15th loop.  We knit six single crochet stitches into it.  This will be our heel.  Connect the row.  One row is considered to be knitted around our chain around. </li><li>  Next, we knit the second row.  We make two lifting loops.  Before starting the sock, we knit one <span>crochet column.</span>  Where we knitted 7 columns in one loop, we now knit two.  At this point, you should get already 14 double crochet. </li><li>  We continue to knit to the heels of one column.  Where 6 columns are knitted, we make two columns in one loop.  It should exit 12. Close the row with a connecting loop. </li><li>  Third row.  We divide the sole from the beginning of the toe to the beginning of the heel (a straight row, not counting the beginning of the curves) visually into three parts.  We make two loops for lifting.  We knit the first part one column with one crochet.  The second is a half-column.  The third is a single crochet. </li><li>  We knit the heel and toe as follows.  The first loop is one double crochet, the second loop is 2 double crochets.  So until the end of the curves.  We knit the direct part in a mirror.  First, a single crochet, then a half-column and a double crochet. </li><li>  Fourth row.  We knit the whole row with a single crochet. </li><li>  Our sole is ready. </li></ol><h2>  Knit slippers </h2><p>  Crochet slippers with a description and diagram is quite simple.  First option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Having finished our sole, we knit the first row of slippers with convex columns. </li><li>  The second row is knitted one through one.  Convex column, concave column. </li><li>  The third row also alternates one through one.  We continue to knit convex columns over the convex ones.  Concave above - concave. </li><li>  We knit the fourth and subsequent rows with the reduction of loops.  Where our sock is, visually define the central loop.  And from it we only knit convex on the sides together (grab the convex, concave skip, grab the central convex, concave skip, grab the convex and knit all together).  We knit the rest in the same way. </li><li>  We continue to make reductions to the required boot height. </li><li>  If desired, you can decorate with a lapel (knitting it with the same pattern) or leave it just like that. </li></ol><p>  As a result, we got nice embossed boots. </p>

    <h2>  Slippers on the sole </h2><p>  For longer-term use of slippers, you can knit them on the sole.  <span>Crocheted slippers</span> on felt sole will perfectly warm and will last longer.  There are several options for creating such shoes. </p><p>  <em>First.</em> </p><p>  You can cheat a little.  For example, by tying the boots according to the example above, you can just sew a felt sole to our insole.  So they get warmer and more resistant to wear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Second.</em> </p><p>  Start knitting a slipper directly from the sole.  You will need an awl and yarn.  How to do: </p><ul><li>  To begin with, it is worth noting the places of punctures.  Make holes at a distance of about 2 centimeters from each other. </li><li>  After carefully piercing our sole with an awl.  Try to make bigger holes so that the yarn can pass.  But do not overdo it, otherwise you risk that slippers will quickly rub in these places. </li><li>  We knit one air loop.  Gently pull it through the first hole.  Next, we knit in a way convenient for you.  For example, in each hole we knit three double crochet, so it will turn out a very beautiful pattern.  The number of columns is regulated by yourself.  Look at the thickness of the yarn.  Ready loops for the next row should not overlap each other.  The row should turn out to be smooth and slightly stretched. </li></ul>

Crocheted slippers on felt sole are ready. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Crochet slippers with a description and a scheme can be connected any, to your taste.  For example, for a child, in the form of bunnies. </p><ul><li>  We knit the sole as described at the beginning or in any convenient way that you know. </li><li>  We knit the first two rows with single crochet. </li><li>  Next, we knit all the same in a circle, starting to gradually reduce the side loops. </li><li>  The third row - two loops on one side and two loops in parallel with the other. </li><li>  We knit in this way to the required length slipper. </li><li>  We knit the last row without decreasing with SC. </li></ul><p>  We turn to the decor of our bunnies.  From the same yarn, make two small pompons.  These will be our ponytails.  Sew them to the heel with a blind stitch or attach with a hook. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We knit the ears in the following way.  Draw a chain of 10 loops and knit it around with single crochet posts.  In the first loop, knit three columns.  So knit another row.  After making four ears, sew them. </p><p>  Make eyes with a black thread and a needle, and make the nose pink. </p><p>  Crochet baby slippers are ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet baby slippers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1516996.jpg" width="281"></div>

    <h2>  For home </h2><p>  Simple slippers can be knitted for the warm season.  To do this, you need to choose the right yarn, for example, cotton.  Knitting slippers for everyday use and not for warmth is very simple. </p><p>  We knit the sole.  All in the same universal way.  You can pick up any other that you are used to.  For more practical use, you can take a ready-made sole. </p><p>  The top slipper is made very simply.  We knit a chain about 7 centimeters long. </p><p>  Then we knit a certain length of fabric in single crochet columns.  We knit in straight and reverse rows.  Do not forget to make a lifting loop.  You can tie around the edges with the same columns, but with a different color.  In this case, you determine the length yourself. </p><p>  After the fabric is ready, sew it to our sole.  <span>Crocheted home slippers</span> are ready. </p><p>  You got slippers, or rather, flip flops with an open nose.  They are very easy to decorate for every taste.  It can be a flower in the center or on the side, made of yarn or fabric.  Buttons and beads can serve as decoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted slippers" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1516999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For beginners </h2><p>  For someone who first picked up the hook and wants to knit slippers for themselves, there is a very simple way that does not require studying schemes and obscure abbreviations.  How to crochet slippers for beginners? <em> </em></p><ul><li>  Get six air loops and close in a circle.  We make three lifting air loops. </li><li>  Knit the first row with double crochet.  We make three lifting air loops. </li><li>  Second row.  In each loop we knit two double crochet posts.  We make three lifting air loops. </li><li>  Third row.  The first loop is one column, the second is two.  So alternate to the end of the row.  In each row, do not forget to make lifting loops. </li><li>  From the fourth to the tenth row, we knit one column in each loop.  It turns out something like a glass. </li><li>  Next, we knit the sole in straight and reverse rows.  We measure the length on the heel.  As soon as our sole is ready, we fold it in half and sew it.  It turns out a seam on the heel. </li><li>  From above we knit a hole for the leg with a crochet. </li></ul><p>  We decorate our slippers with flowers or any pattern. </p><h2>  For men </h2><p>  Since the strong half are not used to wearing plush slippers, we suggest making more familiar slaps with a closed nose for them.  Crochet flip flops slippers quickly knit, so in one evening you can cook your beloved warm gift. </p><ol><li>  We knit the sole.  We collect the required number of loops, about 19. We knit the chain in a circular columns with crochets.  Do not forget to make lifting loops.  We knit 6 columns in our first and last loop. </li><li>  We knit the second row in the same way. </li><li>  From the third row, we divide our sole in half and knit in the same way only one half.  We do this until the width of the insole is equal to the width of the foot.  As soon as we have achieved this result, we knit the entire insole completely with one more row. </li><li>  For durability, you can sew a felt sole or, having tied two identical insoles, sew them together. </li><li>  We turn to the sock.  Dial 8 loops.  We knit in single crochet in straight rows.  In each row we add one loop in the middle. </li><li>  We knit to the length we need. </li><li>  We attach the upper part and the sole and knit together with crochets.  You can just stitch the parts neatly. </li></ol><h2>  Easy way </h2><p>  Now consider the simplest crochet slippers <em>.</em> </p><ul><li>  We knit the sole.  You can use the method at the beginning of the article or another option. </li><li>  Next, we knit the first row of our slipper with double crochet columns. </li><li>  We knit so three more rows. </li><li>  From the fourth row we begin to make reductions.  To do this, we knit the central three loops together. </li><li>  We knit further in the same columns, while in each row we make reductions. </li><li>  Continue to the desired height.  It can be boots or slippers. </li><li>  If for a slipper it turns out to be broad, then along with the central loops on the toe it is worth reducing two loops on the sides. </li><li>  We knit the edge of the hole with two rows of single crochet. </li></ul><p>  For this model, you can use the rest of the yarn and alternate them in rows.  You will get a rainbow and beautiful pattern with such a simple knitting.  If you add some decor in the form of a flower, then your slippers will become elegant and bright.  The main thing here is to try and give free rein to imagination. </p>

    <h2>  Of the motives </h2><p>  For more experienced needlewomen we suggest making very original crocheted slippers.  There will be no problems with the description and diagram; they fit in with the grandmother's square.  To do this, you can choose absolutely any square motive or use the proposed one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet slippers from squares" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1520181.jpg" width="256"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  For one slipper we need six squares.  Four for the top and two for the sole. </p><p>  Having connected all the motives, we proceed to the assembly.  To get started, take two squares and place them vertically, so that they touch the corners (not the sides). </p><p>  We also apply two more elements, but horizontally.  We need to collect a large square so that in the center they are connected by corners. </p><p>  Next, take the thread and hook and connect the inside of the single crochet. </p><p>  Place the remaining two squares on top of our sole.  We connect the outer sides with the same columns. </p><p>  We connect our two horizontal squares with one of those that are on top of the sole.  Alternately connect the outer sides of one and the other square with columns. </p><p>  Crocheting slippers from squares only seems difficult, in fact, everything is very simple. </p><p>  Warm you this winter! </p>
