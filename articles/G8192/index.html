The main task of this thing is to protect clothes from stains, dirt and heat.  It is worth noting that in some peoples an apron is considered a very important decorative element.  Despite the fact that at a certain point in time this attribute went out of fashion, it does not lose its relevance and today it is again gaining its former popularity. </p><p>  Housewives who want to combine business with pleasure are interested in how to sew an apron.  Experienced representatives of the sewing industry claim that it is worth learning to sew with just such a kitchen attribute as an apron.  And this is not surprising, because it is very simple to sew an apron for the kitchen.  This process is the stitching of several parts in the correct sequence with subsequent processing of the edges. </p><h2>  What is kitchen clothes? </h2><p>  To date, two types of kitchen clothes are known - an apron and an apron.  The apron is a rectangle with a belt.  In most cases, it does not have an upper part - a bib, so it is somewhat easier to sew it than an apron.  We recommend mastering sewing aprons with simple options, but if you are confident in your abilities and imagination, you can try to make an unusual product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adriprints.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finished apron" class="if uuid-2348434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348434.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a material for sewing? </h2><p>  If you want to not only sew a beautiful apron, but also get practical kitchen clothes, for these purposes it is necessary to choose the optimal material.  To choose the right fabric, follow these rules: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The kitchen is a place with an increased risk of getting dirty, so the apron you sew should protect you from grease and dirt.  You will often have to wash this attribute, so we recommend that you choose durable materials that are easy to clean.  It is advisable that the fabric of your choice be resistant to cleaning agents. </li><li>  Choose the color for individual requirements and preferences.  However, if you want to sew the apron as best as possible, then qualified craftsmen recommend selecting material for the general style of the room in which it will be used. </li><li>  On a multi-colored fabric, spots from grease and dirt will be less noticeable than on a plain one.  However, this does not mean that an apron made of multi-colored fabric should be washed less often than a plain one. </li><li>  Long ago, psychologists have proved that different colors act differently on a person‚Äôs subconscious.  So, shades of red can improve appetite and cheer up.  Therefore, aprons and aprons made of red fabrics are very popular among many housewives. </li></ul><p>  Ideally, the kitchen in each house should have three aprons - for a woman, a man and an apron for a child, so you can sew an apron with your own hands for all households.  This will allow you to cook with the whole family without fear of getting dirty.  Using a self-made apron can even positively affect a person‚Äôs psychological health.  Also, this product can be used as a beautiful, practical and unusual gift, and if you make it yourself, then its value will be only higher. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green apron with flowers" class="if uuid-2348430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348430.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a style? </h2><p>  Today, there are several of the most common apron styles.  You can choose the best option for yourself from the list: </p><ul><li>  A simple apron with a dedicated bodice area.  This style is somewhat similar to a sundress, because its harnesses go down under the bodice area. </li><li>  Classic apron.  This style involves the use of whole fabric.  Both parts - upper and lower - are cut according to one drawing, and not separately. </li><li>  Style in the form of a Russian scarf.  It has a diamond shape. </li><li>  Apron without top. </li><li>  An apron style called "Merelin."  Its distinctive features are a low neck area and a lush hem. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="adriprints.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apron fabric pattern" class="if uuid-2348433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348433.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing for an apron pattern </h2><p>  If you decide to sew an apron with your own hands, the pattern should be one of the first processes before direct manufacturing.  Cutting takes place as follows: </p><ul><li>  Initially, the size of the person who will use the apron for the intended purpose is determined. </li><li>  Then a schematic drawing of the future kitchen attribute is compiled. </li><li>  After this, a drawing of the pattern is created with the obligatory size taken into account.  You can use a ready-made model taken from the Internet or thematic magazines. </li><li>  Before stitching the apron, you must transfer the drawing to the fabric.  Do not forget about allowances for seams so that the material consumption is rational. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="crazylittleprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Material for sewing an apron" class="if uuid-2348439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348439.jpg"></div><p>  If all of the above steps are completed, you can proceed to the pattern of fabric. </p><h2>  Fabric pattern </h2><p>  Before you sew an apron for the kitchen, the pattern must be performed as accurately and correctly as possible.  Carefully check the accuracy of transferring the drawing to the fabric.  If you need to carve out versatile parts (left and right), you can make two mirror patterns or flip one part so that you get two correct elements. </p><p>  If the cutting of the material is successful, we can assume that the most difficult stage has already been completed.  After it, you need to collect all the elements, sew them using a sewing machine or manually, and you can admire the apron, sewn with your own hands. </p><p>  Use threads matching fabric color.  If you use the machine for sewing, check the tension of the threads before starting work.  Also, do not forget to put the brackets at the beginning and end of the line, using the reverse stroke of the machine. </p><p>  After you can proceed to sewing pockets.  To do this, we initially outline the location of the pockets on the fabric, attach them to the apron and fasten them with pins and hand stitches.  After that, we sew the pocket on the left, right and bottom.  Be sure to put the machine braces! </p><p>  Many experts argue that the shape of the apron can be absolutely any, this parameter depends only on the personal preferences of each housewife.  And pockets must be present on any kitchen clothes.  This detail will only give the apron practicality, and its appearance is attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crazylittleprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful apron in blue" class="if uuid-2348436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348436.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew an apron for the kitchen with your own hands from jeans? </h2><p>  Many housewives have old jeans lying around, which can be great material for an apron or apron.  From jeans you can make children's kitchen clothes, and an accessory for a schoolgirl who is learning to cook, and an unusual gift for a close friend.  To make an apron out of jeans, you need: </p><ul><li>  Cut the front of jeans trousers or skirts.  It is advisable to leave all the elements (pockets, zippers, etc.). </li><li>  Bright, beautiful fabric to make the edging of the future apron.  Try to sew the fabric in such a way that you get small wrinkles. </li><li>  From the fabric used to create the edging, we make a belt.  This sewing the apron can be considered complete! </li></ul><h2>  How can I add a finished apron? </h2><p>  If you want to make several apron options for yourself and your family, or give it to a loved one, you should learn how to make unique products that are different from each other.  To "warm up" the fantasy, you can use the list of possible variations: </p><ul><li>  Aprons decorated with appliqu√©s.  These are products that are decorated with appliqu√©s from various materials.  It can be pockets in the form of fruits, cartoon people looking out of pockets, kitchen appliances made of fabric and much more. </li><li>  Shebby Chic aprons.  This is a very unusual style, the main detail of which is flowers and various plants. </li><li>  Themed aprons.  They are mainly used for holidays, for which they are sewn.  Before the New Year, you can sew an apron with an image of an elf, if this is a children's holiday - an apron in the form of a minion, etc. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.topinspired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mannequin apron" class="if uuid-2348444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79958/2348444.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Using unusual ideas for sewing aprons, various fabrics, decorations and changing the style, you can create very unusual products.
