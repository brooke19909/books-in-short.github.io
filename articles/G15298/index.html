Of course, the prices of this product also increased rapidly.  Therefore, most beautiful ladies thought about making this headdress with their own hands.  You can bring the idea to life.  This article will help you on how to crochet a hood. </p><h2>  Yarn Selection Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hood crochet patterns" class="if uuid-3003651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003651.jpg"></div><p>  First, you need to give a few recommendations regarding knitting threads.  Because it is precisely the material that largely determines the beauty and quality of the finished product. </p><p>  If you ask experienced needlewomen about which knitting threads are best used to complete the studied product, everyone will answer that the most preferable is woolen yarn.  Because the bonnet is worn in the cold season.  Therefore, first of all, it should protect the head from the negative effects of the environment. </p><p>  However, if a beautiful person has a tendency to allergic rashes, it is worth paying attention to children's yarn.  It is ideal for delicate and sensitive skin.  Or you can fork out for more expensive wool.  Best for crocheting bonnets, alpaca wool, merino wool, angora are suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To knit the studied product with simple columns, you can use melange yarn.  It consists of many multi-colored threads, so that the product looks impressive and original.  But for knitting a patterned hood, it is better not to buy this yarn.  Experts say that a complex pattern is best designed with a monochrome thread. </p><h2>  Tool Selection Guidelines </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hook crochet" class="if uuid-3003654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003654.jpg"></div><p>  Professional needlewomen are convinced that it is much easier to knit a hood with a crochet made of metal.  It provides a good glide of the thread, which means it has a positive effect on the creative process.  The product turns out more accurate and beautiful.  In addition, it fits much faster.  However, the tool must be selected taking into account the knitting threads and the selected pattern.  For the studied product, rather dense patterns are most often chosen.  And they will succeed in fulfilling if you work with a hook equal to the thickness of the thread in diameter. </p><h2>  Features of taking measurements </h2><p>  Before you start crocheting a hood, you need to measure the head of the person for whom the accessory will be created.  Many novice masters prefer to use the standard options.  But professional knitters are convinced that they do not always help out.  The thing is that people differ from each other in body structure.  Therefore, very often a product made according to the template is small or, conversely, large.  In order not to have to dissolve and bandage your idea, it is better to take measurements yourself: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We take a measuring tape, paper and pen. </li><li>  We measure the distance from the top of the head to the seventh vertebra (base of the neck) and mark the parameter on paper. </li><li>  We determine the neck circumference and also record. </li><li>  And after we fix the girth of the head (above the eyebrows through the most convex point of the nape) and also point to the paper. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hood crochet step by step" class="if uuid-3003659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003659.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology for converting centimeters to loops and rows </h2><p>  A crocheted hood will turn out to be very beautiful and original only if you first calculate the number of units needed for knitting.  Of course, we are talking about loops and rows. </p><p>  To make simple calculations, you need to prepare a sample of the selected pattern: </p><ol><li>  To do this, we knit a chain 10 cm long. </li><li>  Then we raise it in height so that in the end the length of the sample is 10 cm. </li><li>  In the resulting square, we consider loops and rows. </li><li>  After that, divide the neck circumference and head circumference by 10. </li><li>  The two obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãare multiplied by the number of loops in the sample.  We fix new numbers on paper.  On them we will carry out knitting. </li><li>  Similarly, we calculate the series.  Divide the distance from the top of the head to the seventh vertebra by 10 and multiply by the number of rows in the sample. </li></ol><p>  After completing the calculations, we proceed to creativity - crocheting a hood. </p><h2>  Model No. 1 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hook crochet with ears" class="if uuid-3003607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003607.jpg"></div><p>  To implement the first option, it is necessary to prepare a yarn of a light brown shade and a suitable size hook. </p><ul><li>  We collect the number of loops equal to the circumference of the neck.  Then add another 10 - 15. </li><li>  We close the chain in a circle and then knit, moving in a spiral.  We do not make additions or decreases.  Our task is to knit a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù 10 to 12 rows long. </li><li>  Then you need to consider how the addition of loops will be carried out.  To do this, we subtract the current ones from the loops necessary for grasping the head.  We distribute them evenly on one row.  That is, at the same distance from each other. </li><li>  We add loops, knitting two columns from one loop of the previous row. </li><li>  Next, we knit the bonnet with a crochet with an even cloth, moving back and forth. </li><li>  When it is possible to tie a hood whose length is equal to the distance from the crown to the base of the neck, we turn the product inside out, fold it in half and use the hook or sewing needle to connect the upper part of the resulting hood. </li><li>  Then, if desired, we knit the ears and sew them to the headdress. </li></ul><h2>  Model No. 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cap crochet with neck" class="if uuid-3003636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003636.jpg"></div><p>  The next option of the studied accessory is suitable for those who want to protect not only the head, but also the neck.  Moreover, this hood is knitted from top to bottom.  But it also looks impressive. </p><ol><li>  To do this, you should make a chain whose length is equal to the circumference of the head. </li><li>  Then we knit a flat cloth, reaching a distance from the top of the head to the seventh vertebra.  We do not make any increases or decreases. </li><li>  Having reached the desired size, we reduce the loops to the width of the neck and begin to knit in a spiral. </li><li>  If desired, make the neck with knitting needles, knitting a single elastic band.  Or we continue to work with a crochet and knit crochet posts.  Collar length is adjustable independently.  But traditionally it does not exceed two neck lengths. </li><li>  When, focusing on the description, the hood can be crocheted, we bend the part of the hood located near the face and carefully tie it to fix it. </li></ol><h2>  Model No. 3 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hood crochet snood" class="if uuid-3003649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3003649.jpg"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to too long and hard work on the implementation of the idea, you can make a lightweight version of the product.  It is a wide snood that can be used as a bonnet.  Performing it is really easy, so even inexperienced masters can take up work. </p><ul><li>  Work begins with a set of loops, the number of which is equal to the circumference of the head. </li><li>  Next, close the chain in a ring and knit the product, moving in a circle.  In this case, you do not have to reduce or add loops, as well as knit individual parts or sew the finished product. </li><li>  You just need to tie the pipe.  Its minimum length is 1.5 distances from the top of the head to the seventh vertebra. </li><li>  If you want to make a volume hood, you should knit a few more rows. </li></ul><p>  This product is convenient in that it can be tried on to evaluate the result, and if necessary to finish it. </p><p>  We hope that after reading the article, you can make sure that crocheting a hood is not difficult at all.  The main thing is to set a goal and not quit work if something suddenly fails. </p>
