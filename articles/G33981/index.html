  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rent arrears: check and liquidate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, many residents of the periphery can recognize <span>rent arrears in the</span> traditional way.  That is, by personally visiting a company that accepts payments.  Of course, the program of such a “tour” necessarily includes standing in a giant line.  It’s good that you don’t need to write a number in the palm of your hand and participate in roll calls, too.  You can, of course, not go anywhere, but use the wonderful invention of mankind called the telephone.  True, it is not a fact that you will be able to solve all the problems through it.  In the best case scenario, company representatives will still invite you to their place to find out the rent arrears.  In the worst case, the caller will play football from one specialist to another for a long time.  And it is not a fact that at the end of the conversation one does not have to visit the mentioned company. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rent arrears" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/18075.jpg" width="522"></div>  For those who have no idea <span>how to find out the</span> rent arrears, a list of sources should be given from where to get this interesting information. <br><br>  Firstly, the managing housing and communal organization (most often it is the EIRC) sends out receipts to homeowners every month, which reflect the existing debt on the rent.  If, of course, it exists at all.  In addition to these data, you can find a lot of useful information in the sent receipt.  For example, the personal account of the owner of the apartment, to which the deposited amount of money is received.  If suddenly in one of the months the receipt did not fall into your hands, you should immediately call the “hot” line of the service provider to clarify the situation.  Finding the appropriate phone number is easy: often the public utilities themselves paste them on the porches and in the front doors. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out rent arrears" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/18073.jpg" width="326"></div>  Thanks to scientific and technological progress, many citizens have access to the Internet.  Today, almost every housing and communal company has its own website, where without any doubt your rent arrears can be found.  In addition, there is comprehensive information on its repayment, as well as telephones through which you can contact the operator to ask your questions. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rent arrears find out" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/18074.jpg" width="370"></div>  With possible options, so to speak, inquiries were decided.  Now let's see what terrible rent arrears are for owners of urban apartments and private houses.  According to the provisions of domestic law, if the amount of the existing debt exceeds the amount of six-month payments, the company providing a certain service can go to court.  It is clear that before filing a lawsuit, moral measures, for example, preventive conversations, are first applied to debtors.  If you do not make contact with <span>utilities,</span> then very soon you will find in your home court bailiffs who are engaged in <span>collecting debts</span> in a forced manner.  Therefore, it is better not to joke with the rent for an apartment.  By the way, if you still managed to get into debt, then repayment is better to start not with the principal amount of the debt, but with accrued interest and fines.  Otherwise, the resulting debt can be dealt with very, very long time.
