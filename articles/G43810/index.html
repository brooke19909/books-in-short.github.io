Such a gift indicates special attention, the desire for originality.  An important role for such a gift is its packaging.  It is she who will create the first impression of the present.  So, it should be spectacular, but not overshadow the toy itself. </p><p>  Since factory packaging is monotonous, too elaborate, and often not suitable in size, it is best to make a gift box for the doll with your own hands.  How to do this, we will tell in our article. </p><h2>  Before starting work </h2><p>  Having decided to create a box for a doll with your own hands, you need to pay attention to some aspects.  Otherwise, everything may go down the drain. </p><p>  The first step is to decide on: </p><ul><li>  packaging design; </li><li>  its size; </li><li>  materials; </li><li>  items for decoration. </li></ul><p>  In addition, prepare the workplace and all the necessary tools: </p><ul><li>  scissors; </li><li>  a ruler; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  A lot of controversy is about the need for a cutting mat.  Without a doubt, working with him will be much easier.  On the other hand, if you do not need to use it constantly, for the sake of one or two boxes it is impractical to purchase it. </p><h2>  Packaging design for handmade dolls </h2><p>  Among the variety of design options, the following have proven themselves best: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift box for doll" class="if uuid-3097179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097179.jpg"></div><ol><li>  A box consisting of two parts.  The bottom, where the doll is, and the lid (with or without a window).  Both components are fastened with an elegant ribbon or eco-friendly twine with wax seal. </li><li>  One-piece packaging.  When closed, it is very similar to the previous one.  However, it consists of only one element, cut out, bent and closed on the side or top.  This model is easy to manufacture and practical to use. <div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Present box for doll" class="if uuid-3097312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097312.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  There are other varieties, however, the main advantage of the two mentioned models is their simplicity in execution.  Therefore, even a not very experienced craftswoman can easily make such a box for a doll with her own hands without any problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  For the manufacture of packaging, dense bookbinding or corrugated cardboard is best suited. </p><p>  Material is sold in almost every needlework store or construction supermarket. </p><p>  Some sellers for extra charge can cut or crease (outline fold lines) sheets according to the customer‚Äôs pattern.  But if there is no such service, all this is easily done independently. </p><p>  If you want to paste the finished packaging with cloth or paper, the parts can be cut out of the box from household appliances or a cardboard folder. </p><p>  The window is easiest to make from a file or from a transparent folder for papers (without embossing).  A film of mica for flowers is good. </p><p>  If the box size is small, you can use the transparent part from a plastic bottle.  It should be colorless, without a slight blue or green hues. </p><p>  As for the decor itself, here everyone is free to choose for themselves, deciding how to make packaging for the doll.  You can paste the box over with cloth or designer craft paper, use lace, ribbons, stickers with rhinestones, lettering-cuttings from cardboard, etc. </p><p>  Please note that eco style is in fashion today.  Therefore, you can simply leave the package without decor.  However, in this case, you should be very careful, as each flaw will be especially noticeable. </p><h2>  Instruments </h2><p>  In addition to conventional scissors, you can use a figured device (zigzag, wave) to decorate the doll box. </p><p>  If there is no specialized scoring tool, it is done under the ruler using a nail file or a disposable plastic knife. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make packing" class="if uuid-3097180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097180.jpg"></div><p>  As for adhesive materials, it is better to choose one that quickly dries and is neat in use.  The glue gun is rarely used to make DIY doll boxes.  Traces may remain from it.  And it‚Äôs not always possible to apply it with an even thin layer.  Most people prefer a combination of PVA or ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù and double-sided tape.  It is worth remembering that the latter can peel off over time.  Therefore, you should not use it to connect composite elements. </p><p>  If the box-box consists of several parts (with further pasting), it is better to use brown masking tape to fasten them. </p><p>  Indispensable in the manufacture of a box for a doll with your own hands will be ordinary linen clothespins.  They are used to fix parts during the drying of the glue.  They must be clean, dry and leave no residue. </p><h2>  Master class: two-piece doll box </h2><p>  The first thing that starts work on packaging is a pattern.  You can compose it yourself or use someone else's.  In any case, this scheme should adapt to the size of the toy.  The doll should not, like going into the box end to end, and dangling on it.  The ideal gap is 0.5 cm on all sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift box" class="if uuid-3097198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097198.jpg"></div><p>  If you are definitely not sure about the dimensions, it is better to make a box with a margin.  Then fill the empty space with decorative shavings or strips of corrugated paper.  And if you are not a fan of such a decor, put in the bottom of the box an additional decorated sheet of thick cardboard, to which the beauty will be attached.  This can be done either imperceptibly with the help of wire, or with the help of a ribbon, which will serve as an additional element of decor. </p><p>  This type of packaging consists of two parts.  Before you cut them out of cardboard, you should translate the pattern on thick paper (whatman, wallpaper).  It will turn out not only a pattern, but also a draft version, with which you can practice and check whether the lid fits well, as well as correct design errors if they are found. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY doll box" class="if uuid-3097182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097182.jpg"></div><p>  The next step is to cut out two details of the future box.  This must be done carefully, as well as the subsequent scoring.  When working with corrugated cardboard, you do not need to put much pressure on it, since only its inner layer should cut through. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make packing for a doll" class="if uuid-3097187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097187.jpg"></div><p>  After scoring, the box is glued in any convenient way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Master Class" class="if uuid-3097202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097202.jpg"></div><p>  Please note that the window should be cut before gluing the entire part.  But the film can be attached both before and after.  It must be glued from the inside, so when cutting, allowances on all sides should be 1 cm. Do not forget that the transparent part must be stretched. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll packaging" class="if uuid-3097219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097219.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as both parts are glued and dried, you can pack the doll or start decorating the box.  Here you can give vent to your own imagination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift box for doll" class="if uuid-3097230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097230.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make simple packaging </h2><p>  This type of box is less time consuming, but more expensive.  To cut one piece, which will then be folded, you need a sheet of cardboard in large format.  Otherwise, everything is done in the same way: </p><ol><li>  Tenderloin. </li><li>  Scoring. </li><li>  Gluing. </li><li>  Decoration. </li></ol><p>  Both types of doll boxes can also be made without a window display.  This is true when the content should remain a surprise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instagram.com" data-author=": Elif Kolhan Karaca, "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY box" class="if uuid-3097328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3097328.jpg"></div><p>  Whichever of the options for making festive packaging for the doll you decide to make, remember that your creation will always be unique.  Therefore, do not be afraid to experiment, because the main thing is to put your soul into what you do. </p>
