In the Chuvash Republic there are several dozens of recreation centers.  It is clear that they all differ from each other in the offer of services, their quality, geographical location (within the city or in the lap of nature in forests) and entertainment programs.  Among the most bases of Chuvashia, tourists are especially interested in the recreation center "Zaimka" in the Cheboksary district.  What is the reason for this increased interest in this particular base?  Let's try to find out in this article.  It is not advertising or recommendatory in nature, only informational and familiarization. </p><h2>  Zaimka: recreation center, Cheboksary </h2>

    <p>  You need to start with the fact that Zaimka is not just a recreation center.  As it turned out, this is a whole tourist complex that provides a wide range of services to its visitors, and not only entertaining, but also wellness.  In other words, Zaimka LLC created its project of the same name (in the form of construction and organization of the arrangement of the whole complex) Zaimka (recreation center, Cheboksary) with the aim of creating for its potential customers a useful and at the same time interesting, non-trivially entertaining pastime.  By the way, a few words about the name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  An interesting name, or a moment of educational program - we speak without errors </h2><p>  The word "capture" is unusual for the ears of many.  It is often used in conversation with errors when stating stress.  Most likely, this is because in our time this word is rarely used and its meaning is now incomprehensible to most.  Try to say the word out loud.  Which syllable of the three have you emphasized?  It will be correct on the second: "Zaimka."  It used to be called the free territory of the land, which was occupied by the right of first ownership, and this word also applied to a detached estate or an outbuilding. </p><p>  The name "Zaimka" is often used by tourists in the plural (especially in requests by type: "recreation center - Cheboksary - Zaimki").  This is permissible in colloquial speech and is not a gross mistake, if we take into account the fact that this base is several estates and buildings on the same territory (the second meaning of the word).  However, do not forget about the legal name of the complex in the singular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation recreation center Cheboksary" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1441213.jpg" width="453"></div>
