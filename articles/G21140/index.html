  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A difficult choice: which is better than a tablet or laptop?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Going to purchase a computer for work or other purposes, we are faced with a very difficult choice.  The computer equipment market offers a very wide range of products, and, literally, more sophisticated new products appear every day.  Having the opportunity to choose in stores, online sources, or simply in the markets, we often get lost in an abundance of information.  The main question that arises is: what is better than a <span>tablet or laptop?</span>  With laptops, we are already more or less familiar.  What is this device, what functions does the tablet perform, and how does it differ from a laptop? </p><p>  <strong>The tablet</strong> </p><p>  What is original in it, which is not found in any laptop?  Firstly, manual input of all information.  The tablet consists of one large screen that is not equipped with either a keyboard or a mouse.  By clicking on certain zones with our fingers, we select menu items, print text, etc. For a more accurate and accurate point input, there is an additional stylus, a special electronic accessory that touch screens of tablets react to sensitively.  Using styluses, it‚Äôs easy to draw and edit.  The stylus is the brainchild of graphic devices originally designed for professional artists and graphic artists working on digital images. </p><p>  In order to confidently determine what is better than a tablet or laptop, you need to know for what purposes you are acquiring the equipment, and in what conditions you intend to use it.  If you need a means of access to the Internet when traveling, or a way to pass the time, the tablet is undoubtedly better for such an application.  It is small and mobile.  You can, holding the device in one hand, give commands to the other, enter data, or select the files you need.  It‚Äôs convenient to watch movies and just play. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Compared to laptops and netbooks, tablets are very economical, they can work up to 12 hours without recharging.  To dial in a large amount of information, it is nevertheless advisable to connect a keyboard.  There are two ways: wired, via <span>USB</span> and wireless, via Bluetooth.  In addition to performing daily office tasks, access to email and surfing the web, the tablet is suitable for playing videos and music, reading electronic books, viewing photos, and, of course, for games. </p><p>  There are many free or very inexpensive compact applications for tablets with iOS and Android operating systems.  Programs that fall into various categories are easily installed: exchange, weather, news, finance, trip planning, puzzles, games, preparation for driving tests, educational programs in chemistry, physics, medicine, sports, health, dictionaries, astronomy and much more . </p><p>  Manufacturers offer a wide selection of tablet devices with a variety of pricing and features.  It is fair to say that the best budget tablet available on the market is the iPad from Apple, which appeared in early 2010 and gave an impetus to a kind of boom in the production of tablet computers.  Already in 2011, these electronic devices were released several times more than in the previous one, while their diversity is surprising. </p><p>  <strong>Disadvantages of Tablet PCs</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  When deciding what is better than a tablet or laptop for working in the office, the choice falls on the laptop.  Tablet PCs are not high-performance devices.  They are not suitable to edit images and videos and process large tables.  Entering text from the on-screen keyboard is also not very convenient. </p><p>  If the tablet is built on the basis of a standard computer platform running the Windows 7 operating system, it is equipped with a graphics processor that is not powerful enough for modern games.  Some sites that contain flash animations may not be available to iPad users because Apple considers Flash technology to be outdated and a potential threat. </p><p>  Choosing which is better than a tablet or laptop, you must first proceed from the goals of using a PC.  An important role can play and price.  But if you have enough money, get both.  A laptop is more convenient to use at home and in the office, and a tablet is very useful when traveling. </p>
