Pleasant Mediterranean climate, beautiful landscapes, hospitable, friendly people, quiet, pretty resorts, European service, interesting cultural heritage are significant, but not the most important reasons for such an authoritative status of Montenegrin resorts among Russian travelers.  The decisive factor in the popularization of this country among Russian tourists was the fact that Montenegro is one of the very few states in Europe, into the territory of which Russian citizens can enter without a Schengen visa for a period of no more than 30 days.  In addition, prices for accommodation, food and other tourist services in Montenegro are very affordable, especially in comparison with pan-European ones. </p><p>  In terms of tourism, Montenegro is interesting mainly as a beach and ski destination.  Medieval sights, breathtaking natural beauties, delicious local cuisine, quality and budget shopping opportunities are considered by visiting travelers as pleasant bonuses, but not as the main goals of the trip.  In the south, Montenegro has access to the Adriatic Sea.  The length of the beach line is 73 km.  The first place in the nomination "The best beaches of Europe" has already been awarded Montenegro several times. </p>

    <h2>  Adriatic coast </h2><p>  The beaches in the south are mostly small-pebble or sand-pebble.  Montenegro is rightly considered one of the main directions of ecological tourism on the whole continent.  The transparency of sea water in some resorts reaches 35 meters.  Weather features of the Adriatic create a clear framework for the high holiday season on this coast.  It lasts from May to September.  At this time, the water temperature reaches 20-26 ¬∞ C. Naturally, tour operators adjust the organization of charter flights for these periods.  Budget tours to Montenegro from Moscow and large Russian cities with charter flights in the summer are bought up like hot cakes.  And most decent resort hotels stop booking by the end of June.  So you need to take care of booking a tour to the Budva Riviera in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are two airports in Montenegro: in Podgorica and Tivat.  The first airport is the capital, accepting mainly regular international flights.  You can get to Podgorica by direct flights of airlines such as Aeroflot, Ural Airlines and S7, but the easiest and cheapest way to use the services of the national carrier Montenegro Airlines. </p><p>  Tivat Airport is also called the gates of the Adriatic.  Tours to Montenegro from Moscow are mainly with flights to this airport.  It is located in the south of the country in a convenient proximity to the main resorts of the coast.  The distance from the airport to the city of Budva is only 20 km, Becici is 23, Kotor is 7. But given the small size of Montenegro (you can go round and round for a day), you can quickly get to the southern resorts both from Tivat airport and from Podgoritsy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Obala Plus 3 * Montenegro Budvanska Riviera" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1548713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Rooms are cleaned daily.
