  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank is not only the largest bank in the country, but also a leader in the number of transfers between customers.  Every day, millions of Russians send money to relatives and friends, make purchases, transferring money to cards of other users.  To be sure that the funds will be delivered to the recipient in full, it is important not only to carefully check the details, but also to know the commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank. </p><h2>  In what cases is the transfer fee charged </h2><p>  Many customers are perplexed when making transfers to Sberbank cards that a commission may be charged for this.  But the conditions for transferring funds within the bank are such that in some cases the sender will be required to pay the transfer. </p><p>  A commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank is charged if the client transfers funds to the card holder of another territorial bank.  It is required both when sending in terminals and to Sberbank Online, as well as through a bank operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank" class="if uuid-3017527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017527.jpg"></div><p>  The bank charges a fee if the client makes any foreign currency transfer abroad, sends an intra-bank Hummingbird or an international Money Gram. </p><p>  Transfers to cards of other banks are also always subject to a commission.  In addition, when transferring funds from the card account of another financial institution, a commission may also be charged by the recipient bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sberbank credit card transfers are always free. </p><h2>  Who pays the transfer fee? </h2><p>  In most cases, the commission is paid by the sender when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank.  But there are options in which it may be charged from the recipient of funds.  This is possible if the client sends: </p><ul><li>  Translation of "Hummingbird" abroad.  In this case, you can choose the option in which the commission will be required to pay the recipient of funds.  The amount will be deducted from its transfer.  The size of the commission is indicated in a separate bank order, which is also issued to the client upon receipt of the transfer. </li><li>  International transfer in currency.  In order for the recipient to receive the full amount of money, the client of Sberbank is obliged to pay the Full pay service, the amount of which is 20 US dollars (about 1300 rubles) for transfers in dollars and 10 for transfers in other foreign currencies. </li><li>  International Translation Money Gram. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer from Sberbank to Sberbank commission" class="if uuid-3017528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017528.jpg"></div><p>  The commission when transferring Sberbank to Sberbank when sending money from a plastic card is always charged to the sender.  The exception is cases when money was transferred from the account of a legal entity to an individual‚Äôs card, even if both of them are bank customers.  In this case, it is possible to charge a commission when withdrawing funds from a bank card by an individual recipient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Amount of commission for transactions with a bank card </h2><p>  More than 85% of transfers in Sberbank are made between holders of plastic cards.  This is one of the fastest and safest ways to transfer funds.  When transferring money from card to card, the recipient can see the cash in his account only a few seconds after sending. </p><p>  But in some cases, a commission is charged for performing this operation.  Its size depends on the method of transferring funds and on which territorial banks opened accounts with the sender and recipient of funds. </p><p>  The commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank of another region is 1% of the transaction amount if the cardholder transfers funds via Mobile Bank, Sberbank Online or in the company's terminals.  For the execution of the same operation with the help of the operator, the client must pay 1.5% to the bank for the transfer of funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank transfers from account to account commission" class="if uuid-3017529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017529.jpg"></div><p>  The size of the commission is not fixed.  It depends on the amount the recipient sends.  The number of transfers from one client per day is not limited.  For each of the operations that are performed between cardholders of different territorial banks, a separate fee is charged in the prescribed amount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to understand whether a commission will be charged when transferring funds? </h2><p>  Not always the sender is aware that Sberbank charges funds for transfers to cards opened in other regions.  And many customers would like to know how to determine what the commission will be charged when transferring Sberbank to Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer from Sberbank to Sberbank and Tinkoff commission" class="if uuid-3017530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017530.jpg"></div><p>  You can learn about the commission in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Ask the recipient in which region his plastic card is open.  If the bank in which his account is maintained is located within the same territorial entity with the sender card, then no commission will be charged.  The list of territorial banks and their affiliates is listed on the website of Sberbank. </li><li>  Call the support service and clarify which region the sender's city in which his card is open belongs to. </li><li>  Contact the bank office with a passport, your card and the card number of the recipient of funds.  The employee will check whether a fee will be charged when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank to another city. </li><li>  Start the operation in the terminal, through "Mobile Bank" or "Sberbank Online".  After entering the card number of the recipient and the amount of funds, data on the possible commission and its amount will appear on the screen.  It is not recommended to confirm the operation if the size and amount of obligations do not suit the sender. </li></ul><h2>  Fees for transfers via online banking </h2><p>  Sending money through remote service channels is more profitable than performing operations at the bank office.  And one of such ways of saving when making a transfer is to send funds through Sberbank Online. </p><p>  The commission for the transfer from Sberbank to Sberbank in the Internet bank is 1% of the amount, but not more than 1 thousand rubles.  That is, sending customers amounts in excess of 100 thousand rubles to another region, the cardholder will pay only 1 thousand rubles as a commission to Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verdict.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank of another region" class="if uuid-3017535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017535.jpg"></div><p>  When transferring funds via Internet banking, the client can verify the data in advance: after entering the mobile phone attached to the card or its number, information about the owner will appear - first and middle name + first letter of the last name.  This allows you to check whether the card number was indicated by the recipient, and to whom it actually belongs. </p><p>  Further, after entering the payment amount, the sender can familiarize himself with the exact amount of the transaction fee.  It is displayed accurate to the penny. </p><h2>  Features of the transfer of funds through Sberbank Online to a bank account </h2><p>  A transfer between customer cards will be executed if there is a transfer amount + a fee for the bank on the sender's card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinancialbrand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer from Sberbank to Sberbank and VTB Bank commission" class="if uuid-3017532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017532.jpg"></div><p>  When transferring from account to account, Sberbank's commission also amounts to 1% of the amount, but here you need to know all the recipient's data: account number, TIN, BIC of the bank, name of the owner, correspondent account, name of the issuing bank.  The sender fills in all the data manually.  The minimum commission is 30 rubles, the maximum - 1 thousand rubles. </p><p>  For transfers in excess of 100 thousand rubles, confirmation of the contact center is required.  To do this, the sender must call the bank support service, give his name, address, passport data, card number and code word.  After identification, it should be clarified that confirmation of information is required when transferring through Sberbank Online in the contact center of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Commission in bank terminals </h2><p>  Transfers through ATMs are just as profitable as in Sberbank Online.  Limits on operations correspond to the rates indicated earlier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank of another region" class="if uuid-3017536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017536.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike Internet banking, in the terminal you can receive a check for the operation immediately after the transfer.  For transfers to a Sberbank card in another region, the client must pay 1% of the amount. </p><h2>  The size of the commission at the bank office </h2><p>  Transferring funds using operators is unprofitable: the commission is charged 0.5% higher and there is a minimum limit.  When transferring funds to a Sberbank card of another city, the sender will be required to pay 1.5% of the amount, at least 30 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinancialbrand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commission when transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank" class="if uuid-3017531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3017531.jpg"></div><p>  All operations are performed upon presentation of a passport, sender card and card number of the recipient of funds.  The term of the transfer in this case is 24 hours.  Money comes in slower than online.  The recipient will be able to see the funds only after 4-8 hours from the date of departure. </p><h2>  Commission for transfers to cards of other banks </h2><p>  When transferring funds from Sberbank to card accounts opened with other banks, a commission is always charged.  When transferring from Sberbank to Sberbank and Tinkoff, the commission is 1% of the amount.  Sberbank customers can perform this operation in a mobile application by entering only the phone number of the card holder. </p><p>  If a client is interested in a transfer from Sberbank to Sberbank and VTB Bank, the commission will be higher - 1.5% in Internet banking, at least 30 rubles. </p>
