</h2><p>  <span>Often violations of the employee are really serious, so the decision is made by the head to combine several types of punishments.</span>  <span>Most often reprimand is applied and deprived of bonuses.</span>  <span>Such a decision is legal.</span> </p><p>  <span>Some features of the process are taken into account.</span>  <span>Combining punishments is possible only if the bonus is not prescribed in the employment contract, therefore it acts as a reward for overfulfillment of the plan or other significant actions of the employee.</span>  <span>Therefore, if he commits any violations, then he simply is not assigned a bonus payment that is not part of the main salary.</span>  <span>Under such conditions, the employee will not be able to file a lawsuit for the fact that he was deprived of the premium by 100 percent, since such a payment is only the prerogative of the employer, and not his duty.</span> </p><h2>  Do you need an explanatory? </h2><p>  <span>Many employees of the company are thinking about whether it is possible to deprive the bonus without providing an explanatory note to the employer.</span>  <span>Since the deprivation of such payments under the law is not a penalty, it is not required to carry out an audit in advance.</span>  <span>Therefore, it is not required from the employee to receive an explanatory statement or find out for what reasons a specific violation has occurred.</span> </p><p>  <span>The prize is only a consequence of the behavior and work of the employee.</span>  <span>Therefore, if the leader is disappointed with the results of cooperation, then he simply does not accrue bonus payments.</span>  <span>The heads of different departments at the end of each month draw up special proposals for the promotion of certain employees.</span>  <span>Workers usually do not know what kind of information is contained in these offers.</span> </p><p>  <span>If the specialist finds out that he was deprived of the prize, then he can draw up an explanatory note that will be handed over to the general director of the company.</span>  <span>In it, one can express disagreement with the decision of the authorities.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glamour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reprimand and strip bonus" class="if uuid-2716400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2716400.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do with the illegal actions of the leadership? </h2><p>  <span>Initially, the employee must understand whether they have the right to deprive bonuses for any misconduct.</span>  <span>If there is confidence that such actions on the part of management are unlawful, then it is advisable to try to challenge the deprivation.</span>  <span>For this, it is recommended to focus on the provisions of Art.</span>  <span>392 TC.</span>  <span>Therefore, the following actions are performed:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>initially it is recommended to ask the head of the company what are the reasons for such a decision;</span> </li><li>  if there are no significant grounds for applying such a punishment, a complaint to the labor inspectorate is drawn up; </li><li>  other documents are attached to this complaint, indicating that the citizen was illegally deprived of well-deserved encouragement, but this is possible only if the citizen was not really acquainted with the order or there is other evidence; </li><li>  based on such a complaint, labor inspectors will conduct an unscheduled audit of the company to establish the fact of illegal deprivation of bonus payments; </li><li>  during the inspection, all the grounds for depremization are studied; </li><li>  if it is really revealed that the actions of the employer were illegal, then the company is held liable, and also undertakes to pay the employee the required bonus. </li></ul><p>  <span>It is impossible to deprive the award without an order, therefore, if the employee was not acquainted with such a document, then he has the opportunity to challenge the punishment.</span> </p><h2>  The nuances of going to court </h2><p>  <span>If the penalty of depriving the bonus payment is really illegal, then the employee can go to court.</span>  <span>Claims may include not only the transfer of the amount due, but also the payment of compensation for the moral damage caused.</span>  <span>In order to win the trial, one must submit to the court evidence of the plaintiff.</span>  <span>Therefore, the following documents are collected and transmitted:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>a copy of the employment contract, which indicates information about the appointment of a pension for certain employee achievements;</span> </li><li>  provision on bonuses and salary assignment; </li><li>  an order on the basis of which the citizen was deprived of the prize, moreover, this document may be replaced by a memo; </li><li>  explanations compiled by the employee after identifying a specific violation; </li><li>  an act on the basis of which the employee was punished by any disciplinary action. </li></ul><p>  <span>All of the above documents must be transferred to the employee by the employer within three days after the first requirement.</span>  <span>The lawsuit indicates the name of the company, as well as F. I. O. and the position of citizen in the company.</span>  <span>Direct claims are presented, presented by the collection of a premium with reference to federal law or internal regulations of the company.</span>  <span>The claim with all other documents is submitted to the court.</span>  <span>If the court satisfies the requirements of the plaintiff, then the costs of the citizen for the hearing are covered by the employer.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.dice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to strip the prize" class="if uuid-2716396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2716396.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of appeal </h2><p>  <span>A lawsuit to appeal the deprivation of bonus payments can be filed within three months after the issuance of the relevant order by the head.</span>  <span>An application is submitted with other documents to the magistrates court.</span> </p><p>  <span>To win the case, the applicant must have a really impressive evidence base that confirms that he was deprived of his payments illegally.</span>  <span>Based on the court decision, the company, order and other documents are checked.</span> </p><p>  <span>If the outcome of the case is positive, the employee can count on reinstatement, receipt of the due amount, transfer of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and holding the employer accountable.</span>  <span>Therefore, hired employees should know whether employers can strip bonuses for any misconduct, as well as how such a punishment is drawn up.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Many workers think about whether they will be deprived of rewards for reprimand.</span>  <span>An employer may use several methods of punishment, represented by disciplinary action or deprivation of bonus payments.</span>  <span>The choice depends on the severity of the violation and the availability of evidence of guilt for a particular employee.</span> </p><p>  <span>If the employee is sure that he was deprived of payment illegally, then he can challenge such a punishment.</span>  <span>For this, a complaint is filed with the labor inspectorate or a lawsuit in court.</span> </p>
