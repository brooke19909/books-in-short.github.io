Recreation facilities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On Earth, there are thousands of amazing and wonderful places created for us by Mother Nature.  To see many of them, you need not to go to the unknown, but simply explore your homeland.  Do not hesitate, it contains a lot of fantastic beauties.  Yumaguzinsky reservoir is one of such places.  It was created by the human mind and the genius of nature.  Tourists are just starting to master this pond, but, no doubt, it has a great future. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Yumaguzinsky reservoir is located in the Southern Urals in the Republic of Bashkortostan on <span>the Belaya River</span> (in the local Agidel).  It is approximately 265 km from Ufa, 660 from Chelyabinsk, and 770 from Yekaterinburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yumaguzinsky reservoir" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/452707.jpg" width="338"></div>  Nearby is the very popular <span>Nugush reservoir</span> with well-established service and many recreation facilities.  In a straight line (through the forest and rocks) to it about 5 km.  The reservoir received its name from the village of Yumaguzino, also located on the Belaya River in the Kugarchinsky district.  18 km from the village towards the reservoir is the Yumaguzinskaya hydroelectric station, where tours are also arranged.  On the map you can see Akavaz, Akbut, Sakassk farms, but in reality there are no settlements along the reservoir.

It is very difficult to get there during the rainy season, as well as in winter.  Even in the summer, under wonderful weather conditions, access to the reservoir itself is difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yumaguzinskoe reservoir rest" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/452705.jpg" width="323"></div>  Therefore, many tourists get there on foot.  Driving on the highway is as follows:

Move towards the hydroelectric station. </p><p>  5. Without stopping at the village of Verkhnebikkuzino, get to the second bridge and cross it to the other side of the river. </p><p>  6. Pass the gate.  Everything, you are at the goal. </p><p>  Entrance and entry to the reservoir are paid.  Ticket offices open at 9 a.m. and close at 18 p.m.  At around 9 p.m. the <span>entrance gate</span> closes <span>.</span>  There is no guarded parking lot.  You can leave the car immediately outside the territory. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Yumaguzinsky reservoir was formed due to the construction of a dam on the Belaya River.  Curving between the cliffs with bizarre zigzags, it stretched 57 km to the village of Maksyutovo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yumaguzinsky reservoir of the recreation center" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/453163.jpg" width="332"></div>  The width of the reservoir in different places is not the same and on average reaches 300-400 meters.  The coastline is approximately 125 km long.  The depth of the reservoir is also uneven.  There are places where it is more than 60 meters.  The surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water surface reaches almost 36 square meters.  km  The cliffs surrounding the reservoir are very steep almost throughout.  There is nowhere to land on the first 15 km after the dam (coastal slope of 45 degrees and above).  Only further there are excellent points for the jetty and camping.  Park "Bashkiria", in which the reservoir is located, is famous for the variety of species of flora and fauna, some of which are listed in the Red Books of Bashkortostan and Russia.  In the immediate vicinity of the reservoir, one can meet foxes, ermines, martens, and larger predators.  Dozens of birds nest in the forest and on the rocks.  There are many kinds of fish in the water.

The project, as well as the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation, has been repeatedly criticized.  Despite this, in 2004 in the spring they began to gradually flood the future section of the reservoir.  In May, during the flood on the Belaya River, water arrived in the reservoir at a speed of 600 cubic meters per second.  The total mass has reached 140 million cubic meters.  This amount is enough for all planned household needs.  This is the provision of electricity and water to a large number of settlements, which is a huge plus.  However, there are also disadvantages.  So, a man-made reservoir flooded some villages, bird nesting places, a lake and an underground river.  The location of the dam on the site of karst voids and soft rocks still raises concerns among some experts, despite the large-scale strengthening of the platform with concrete.

    <h2>  Walking around the reservoir and the surrounding area </h2><p>  Rest on the Yumaguzinsky reservoir will seem paradise for those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of untwisted resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yumaguzinsky reservoir fishing" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/452719.jpg" width="304"></div>  Hiking enthusiasts can move along a pond along subtle forest paths.  But the most unforgettable experience leaves swimming on water.  To do this, you can rent a catamaran or a boat, as well as order a boat.  The cliffs surrounding the reservoir amaze the imagination with their formidable beauty.  In large areas, they are overgrown with forest.  In many rocks, caves cave with mysterious dark spots.  Some of them have names, for example, Teatralnaya Cave.  Rocks also have names: Cruiser, Chest-Tash, <span>Devil's finger.</span>  This amazing creation of nature is a narrow, rocky cliff of a very unusual shape sticking up.  There is also a rock of Leaders (proletariat).  In the 80s of the last century, the artists of Karimov depicted Lenin, Engels and Marx on it.  Today, for some reason, precisely the image of Lenin is well preserved.

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  The Yumaguzinsky reservoir gives many vivid impressions.  Fishing here is one of the best in Bashkortostan.  Some fishermen talk about the amazing catches of catfish and pikes weighing more than 10 kg.  True or not, every fisherman will see for himself, but there are really a lot of fish in the reservoir.  These are not only catfish with pikes, but also perches, perch, roach, chubs, rudd, grayling.  Winter fishing is also very popular here.  In addition to fishermen, cavers can have a wonderful time at the reservoir.  There is an island called Sakasska.  It used to be a mountain, the foot of which was flooded.  From the island you can proceed to the famous region of Sumgan-Kutuksky, where more than a dozen interesting <span>karst caves of</span> various depths are located.  Some of them are with unusually beautiful stalactite and stalagmitic formations.  In separate caves <span>underground rivers</span> flow <span>,</span> lakes splash.  The most famous of them is Sumgan-Kutuk, which is called the Devil's Abyss.  True, only experienced cavers can go down there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities on the Yumaguzinsky reservoir" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/453162.jpg" width="317"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Since the Yumaguzinsky reservoir recently began to exist, recreation centers on it are still in the project.  But management has solved this problem.  Everyone can rent a house for themselves.  They are located on the Akavaz River, in a convenient bay.  From the dam you can get to them by boat.  The houses are designed for 4, 6 or 8 people.  They have everything you need, including sleeping beds, a kitchen with a gas stove, a set of furniture.  Nearby there are sites for bonfires, barbecues, tables with benches are equipped, a spring with clean spring water beats.  The cost of such a house per day from 3500 rubles, depending on the type.  Important note: cellular communication on the reservoir does not work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yumaguzinsky reservoir" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/452708.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <h2>  Recreation facilities on the Yumaguzinsky reservoir </h2><p>  At a distance of about 1.5 km from the reservoir, near the village of Verkhnebikkuzino, there is a recreation center "Bashkir village."  It offers comfortable wooden houses, double or multi-bed.  There are rooms even with a Russian bath.  They are good to stay in a large company, family or arrange a romantic vacation for two.  On the territory of the "Bashkir village" there is a restaurant with two cozy banquet rooms.  Nearby, on a rock directly above the reservoir, the Swallow's Nest cafe was built, reminiscent of the Crimean landmark of the same name. </p>
