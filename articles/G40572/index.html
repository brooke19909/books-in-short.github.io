This issue has become particularly relevant in recent years, when abnormally high temperatures are observed.  We won‚Äôt be allowed to lie around for a day somewhere on the beach by the sea due to work or lack of money, and such a pastime bothers us quickly, so we suggest thinking about a very useful invention - an air conditioner that will make it easier to stay indoors in any heat. </p><h2>  Important Steps for Choosing the ‚ÄúRight‚Äù Air Conditioner </h2><p>  Before you run to the store and choose an air conditioner according to the popularity of the brand, it is worth additionally preparing.  What does this preparation consist of?  Of course, it‚Äôs not to memorize what is cooler: Daikin or Mitsubishi air conditioners are brands that are in high demand, although the manufacturer‚Äôs fame is also of no small importance, and products of more famous brands, as a rule, are better and more durable.  To make the right choice of climate control equipment that will serve your home for a long time and at the same time ensure the maintenance of a favorable climate, you need to know about several points before buying a cooling device. </p>

    <h2>  Air conditioner price </h2><p>  To begin with, soberly assess your financial situation and decide on a budget, that is, choose the maximum and minimum that you are willing to spend on climate technology.  This will help you narrow your search and choose an air conditioner that matches your capabilities.  At the same time, thinking about the budget, consider not only the purchase price of the air conditioner itself, but also the cost of installing it, which we will discuss below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The right power choice </h2><p>  When you have decided on this, proceed with the exact measurement of square meters that your new multi-split system will cool.  The power of the required product directly depends on this.  Correctly calculate the power of the air conditioner, which is suitable for you from A to Z, sellers in the store will help you.  If suddenly they can‚Äôt do this, do not be discouraged.  The simplest formula for <span>choosing an air conditioner:</span> if you multiply its power by 10, we get the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, the air conditioning of which the model you have chosen can easily cope with (for example, if the cooling capacity of the air conditioner is 3.5 kW, then 3.5 * 10 = 35 sq.m - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room in which he can easily cope with the task). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="air conditioning multi split system" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16469/768293.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Additional features of the air conditioner </h2><p>  Then you will need to understand exactly what tasks you will solve with the help of an air conditioner.  Should it have heating?  Should it have a system against ice?  How many rooms should your air conditioner cool?  How much space can you allocate to him (after all, some models occupy a fairly large space)?  To save it, a multi split system will help.  She has one external unit, but there can be several indoor units, which saves you money, reducing the cost of both purchasing additional external units and installing them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of multi split systems" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16469/768298.jpg" width="436"></div></h2><h2>  Air conditioner installation </h2><p>  Any multi-split system requires professional installation, which, of course, requires a specialist.  The cost of installing air conditioners in Moscow today varies from 5 thousand rubles of the Russian Federation, depending on the power of the device, the complexity of the connection, the number of external and internal units and the height of installation.  Of course, if you are not a professional in installing air conditioners, then you should immediately consider the amount of expenses for installing / installing a split system, which, as a rule, can help to calculate when buying, but the installation of a multi split system can be ordered both when buying, so and after her. </p><p>  Before you begin the installation, you need to solve several issues.  Where can I put the outdoor unit so that it does not spoil the facade of the building, does not interfere with the noise of the neighbors, and condensate discharge does not reach passersby?  How to fit indoor units into the interior?  Will there be interference with air flow to the air conditioning units?  How accessible is the possibility of mounting cables and piping connecting the external and internal units?  In this case, if the bed will be in the room, it should be taken into account that the air direction should not be in its direction. </p><p>  After solving these issues, the installation process itself, of course, with the necessary tools, will take a little time.  Holes for the pipeline will be drilled, communications laid, blocks fixed and connected.  After that, <span>commissioning</span> and test run are carried out.  Of course, the whole process looks so simple only if the services of a team of specialists with the professional tool kit and experience in carrying out such work are in the arsenal. </p>

    <h2>  Duct and <span>cassette air conditioners:</span> what are their advantages </h2><p>  If you are concerned about <span>the noise level,</span> it is better to choose a duct or cassette air conditioner, but this option is only suitable if there are false ceilings in your house.  Only such air conditioners are attached to this design.  The first block delivers cold through the ducts, the second redistributes it using a grill.  Thus, you can forget about the directed flow of cold air, as it happens when using an air conditioner, multi split system or window cooler.  The directed air flow from the air conditioner, as you know, can lead to at least frequent colds.  There are also such equipment installation options when it is possible to cool an entire apartment with one air conditioner.  This eliminates the need to install several multi split systems for cooling a large area.  In this case, more powerful or even industrial options are used. </p>

    <h2>  Reliable and economical - what kind of air conditioning? </h2><p>  No less important than the price of air conditioning, when choosing a model is the level of <span>energy consumption</span> and durability.  To ensure both, we recommend buying an <span>inverter air conditioner.</span>  The fact is that the compressor consumes most of the electricity at startup, and it also wears out faster if it constantly turns on and off.  In the case of an inverter air conditioner, it will not turn off permanently.  Just when you set the desired temperature, it will work at maximum speed, and then at a minimum, maintaining the specified temperature. </p><p>  Many manufacturers offer a variety of different types of <span>air conditioning equipment.</span>  Daikin air conditioners today meet all of the above requirements.  The range includes equipment for wall, ceiling, cassette, channel, floor types, as well as universal models. </p><h2>  Multi split system: issue price </h2><p>  Thus, it is important not only the manufacturer, which has established itself in the market as a high-quality and reliable supplier of HVAC equipment, but, first of all, the technical characteristics and indicators of the selected model. </p><p>  At the same time, if we consider air conditioners, for example, the Mitsubishi brand, multi-split systems from this manufacturer have proved themselves to be the best: as reliable, practical and versatile models that meet international quality requirements and have a wide variety of options in their line that can ensure long and uninterrupted operation of the air conditioning system both in a city apartment and in a country house.  To date, the average price for a reliable air conditioning system for a one-room apartment with installation in Moscow varies from 30 to 50 thousand rubles of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  So, we advise you to rely on all the data given in the article when choosing.  This will help you buy an air conditioner inexpensively, but with all the necessary features for your situation. </p>
