    <h2>  Why is a cottage village </h2><p>  The popularity of cottage villages is quite simple to explain.  This is a real opportunity to get rid of neighbors, to find comfort and independence.  You will receive your own housing with a set of necessary communications, and the most important thing is that the cost of a house in a cottage village is very different from the amount of money you spend if you start a large-scale construction project.  Yes, and cottage villages are being built quite quickly through the use of advanced technologies and the work of qualified experienced construction crews.  Are you still in doubt?  Start now to get acquainted with all the obvious advantages of cottages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  If you are knocked down in search of an ideal place for the life of your whole family, look for a fairy tale where real Siberian nature will become the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù for your everyday life, merging with the comfort of modern city life.  Come to the cottage village "Lucky Park" in Novosibirsk.  Feedback on the project will be the best confirmation of its impeccability and uniqueness in all respects. </p>

    <p>  The project is based on the concept of a harmonious combination of the charms of life in nature and the comfort of modern life in a metropolis. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  If in Novosibirsk there is an amazing, fabulous place, ideal for life, then it is already occupied by the cottage community "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk).  Photos clearly demonstrate the picturesque landscape among evergreen pines and curly birches.  A stunning view of the beauty of Siberian nature opens from the banks of a small but clean river. </p>

    <p>  If you, living in Novosibirsk, believe that such a heavenly and picturesque place can be found only far from civilization, then you are deeply mistaken.  Want to know where the cottage village "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk) is located?  Just 40 minutes drive from the Zaeltsovskaya metro station, and therefore it will be an excellent option not only for a country cottage, but also for a house in which you and all your loved ones will live all year round. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  There is a significant drawback in the cottage community "Lucky Park" in Novosibirsk - poorly organized transport links.  Yes, it is only 11 km from the city center, while at the moment you can get here only by private car.  Of course, public transport routes run in the direction of the village, but there are not so many, and they follow to the nearest settlements - it is unlikely that such a route will be convenient for those who are considering the village for a permanent life without having their own car. </p>

    <p>  All those who have purchased a cottage or a house for themselves here, strongly recommend that they carefully consider the appropriateness of the purchase and consider it only for those who do not have to use public transport.  At the same time, a smooth asphalt road leads to the village. </p><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  Description of the cottage village "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk) directly indicates that this is a comfort class project, where all the necessary conditions for a full life are created.  Buying a house here, you pay not only for a quality asphalt road, but also a set of necessary communications.  For each section, 11.5 kW is provided, a central water supply with already filtered water is supplied, and the uninterrupted operation of all the supplied communications is monitored by the management company.  The first residents say with confidence that they do not experience any inconvenience. </p><p>  Plots of the first and second stage are already connected to the power supply, which allows you to use all the necessary household appliances without any restrictions.  Currently, there is a gasification of the village, which will only increase the level of comfort provided on its territory.

    <p>  In addition, the removal of municipal solid waste has already been organized.  Construction waste is disposed of by the landowners on their own. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The cottage village "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk) is fenced on all sides.  Its territory is under round-the-clock protection and is equipped with a video surveillance system, which guarantees the highest level of security for every resident.  At the entrance, a checkpoint is organized, so strangers simply will not get into the village. </p><h2>  Cottages </h2><p>  If you decide to buy a house in the cottage community "Lucky Park", the reviews left by the first tenants will help you make the right choice.  The developer put the wishes and requirements of his tenants at the heart of the construction, so he did not limit them both in technology and in the size of the house.  You can choose a small plot in the middle of the pines with their own access to the river or a quieter, quieter, just the nook.  Cooperation with the largest construction companies has made it possible to realize all the dreams of buyers. </p><p>  The choice of buyers offered a house made of wood.  In the middle of a pine forest, they look impeccably and harmoniously merge with nature together.  But you can opt for a brick house with a plastered facade.  Housing is rented both without finishing, and with "turnkey" finishing.  The company's specialists will prepare, if desired, an individual project and translate it into reality using the best materials and technologies. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Many believe that it is difficult to feel as comfortable as in the city on the territory of the cottage village "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk).  Of course, breathing here is easy, but can he provide a developed urban infrastructure? </p><p>  Of course, there are no objects of social infrastructure in the village: kindergartens, schools and hospitals are located within the city.  But all residents will be able to use the mini-market to make the purchase of necessary food products, as well as a modern playground, where all the necessary conditions for organizing leisure activities for children of different ages are created. </p>

    <p>  Most recently, the developer gave the first tenants another great gift: a great beach area on the lake.  The shore was cleaned and strewn with river sand, two heated pools and a waterfall were built.  In addition, there will be a real summer cafe, which will operate throughout the beach season.  Such a gift has already found approval among the inhabitants of the village, now they can fully relax in nature, without leaving the territory of their home. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  It is difficult to find a better place to live than the cottage village "Lucky Park" (Novosibirsk).  A truly unique place was chosen for its construction, a picturesque river bank surrounded by a pine forest and a birch grove.  At the same time, it is only a 30-minute drive from the city, which will not limit access for residents from the developed infrastructure of the metropolis.  Be sure to pay attention to this village and personally visit it in order to make sure of all the described advantages. </p>
