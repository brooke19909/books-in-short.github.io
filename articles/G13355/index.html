The main attraction of its surroundings is the cleanest reservoir, which was praised by Rospotrebnadzor - this is Bezymyannoye Lake, Krasnoselsky District.  It was formed by a dam on the Duderhofka river in the distant 1709.  Its appearance was due to the paper mill, which was built on the orders of Peter I. A significant role was played by underwater springs and keys.  It should be noted that industrial waste was never discharged into this lake.  From its inception to today, it has been recognized by <span>international environmental organizations</span> as the cleanest reservoir located in the suburbs of St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nameless lake of Krasnoselsky district" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/197610.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lake Bezymyannoye, <span>Krasnoselsky District,</span> stretches from north to south.  Its length reaches two kilometers and a width of 400 meters.  The general characteristic of the climatic zone of this region practically does not differ from the <span>climate of St. Petersburg,</span> with the exception of one factor - this is remoteness from the immediate coastline of the Gulf of Finland.  This makes the air less humid, and winter cold is not felt as much as in the northern capital.  In winter, there are annual ice fishing competitions organized by local fishermen.  In the summer you can swim here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lake Bezymyannoye in Krasnoselsky District has a sandy beach, the size of which is small, about the size of a football field.
