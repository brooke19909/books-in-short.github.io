It may seem that it is not so important as a document of the basis for the ownership of real estate or a supporting document.  However, it is in the technical passport for the apartment that they reflect full information about the property.  Obtaining this document is a phased procedure.  In order to make sure of its necessity, it is worth studying it carefully.  Since when applying for a passport requires time and money. </p><h2>  What is a document, what does it consist of? </h2><p>  <span>A technical passport</span> for an apartment is a document containing detailed information about this apartment.  Its structure is as follows: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rentcafe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a technical passport for an apartment" class="if uuid-2362520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362520.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The title page, which indicates the exact address of the apartment, date of issue and seal, cadastral number and inventory number.  There is also information about the issuing authority. </li><li>  On the second page indicate information about the owners of the apartment and the documents on the basis of which they own the property.  In addition, the form of ownership is prescribed, whether it is shared, joint or personal. </li><li>  The third page of the passport contains a plan made on a scale that should fully correspond to the actual layout, indicating the parameters of each room. </li><li>  The explication is placed on the fourth page, which looks like a table in which numbered rooms are displayed with a breakdown of their purpose and area.  It also indicates the total and living area, with the seal and signatures of the persons who made up the technical passport. </li></ol><p>  The technical documentation contains data on the last date of the overhaul, if any, the date of construction of the facility, the materials of the walls and the foundation and the existing communications.  This means that, when making transactions with real estate, it is enough to have a document with you on the technical condition of the object in order to draw up the main contract for the transaction.  But first things first. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reasons for the need for a technical passport </h2><p>  The need for technical documentation is due to the fact that the information from it is important for: </p><ol><li>  Obtaining a cadastral passport, which is proof of the cadastral registration of the object. </li><li>  Making capital changes to the layout of the facility and overhaul.  Information from the technical passport will help to carry out work with maximum safety and achieve a long-lasting end result. </li><li>  Transferring an object from one category of real estate is simply not possible without a technical passport. </li><li>  <span>The inventory value is</span> also determined on the basis of information from this document. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="technical passport for an apartment in the MFC" class="if uuid-2362543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362543.jpg"></div><p>  The technical and cadastral passports are included in the list of necessary documents for the sale of an apartment or donation. </p><p>  Thus, a mandatory step in obtaining housing from scratch and during privatization is to obtain a technical passport.  Next, let's talk about where exactly this can be done. </p><h2>  Document for the apartment.  Where can I get it? </h2><p>  In order to get a document for an apartment, there are two possibilities, more precisely two bodies for applying for a document, namely: </p><ol><li>  You can apply for a technical passport at BTI for an apartment.  Then you need to go to <span>the technical inventory bureau</span> closest to the real estate <span>.</span> </li><li>  You can get a technical passport for an apartment in the MFC.  This company, in fact, will become an intermediary between the person and the body issuing the finished document. </li></ol><h2>  Necessary documents for obtaining a technical passport.  What needs to be provided? </h2><p>  Having figured out where to order this passport, it is necessary to clarify how to get a technical passport for the apartment.  That is, what package of documents a person needs to collect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.livelovely.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to order a technical passport for an apartment" class="if uuid-2362527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362527.jpg"></div><p>  It can be divided into a general list, or more individual.  The list of documents for registration of a technical passport for an apartment includes: </p><ul><li>  statement; </li><li>  proof of payment of the fee; </li><li>  title and supporting papers; </li><li>  identity document of the applicant. </li></ul><p>  If the technical plan is drawn up not by the owner, but by another person, then you must attach a copy of the power of attorney and the passport of the authorized person.  Other documents may be required during registration, depending on the situation, the list of which can be specified in the issuing authority. </p><h2>  The cost of obtaining a document.  What is the price made up of? </h2><p>  Obtaining a registration certificate for a property is associated with certain costs: </p><ol><li>  Payment of state duty, the amount of which each region sets independently.  Its average value is about a thousand rubles. </li><li>  Departure of a specialist to carry out measurements is a paid service, the cost of which must be specified in advance. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.livelovely.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="validity period of the technical passport for the apartment" class="if uuid-2362524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362524.jpg"></div><p>  You need to know that payment is usually made as follows: first of all, a fee is paid, without which the documents simply will not be accepted for registration.  The cost of the work done will already depend on several parameters: the remoteness of the facility, the complexity of the work and the size of the area.  The final amount can be found out when all the documents are ready.  And pay on the date of receipt of the technical passport. </p><p>  Like any document, obtaining a registration certificate for an apartment requires a certain amount of time and has its own validity period.  We will talk about him further. </p><h2>  Duration of the document and technical passport </h2><p>  When applying for a technical passport for an apartment, everyone who receives it should know that the procedure takes a certain amount of time.  Under normal conditions and rates, this lasts up to fourteen days.  However, if the customer wants to receive technical documentation in a short time, this problem can be solved by paying for services at a higher rate.  In this case, the whole process takes no more than a week. </p><p>  The completion of all stages of obtaining the technical plan is marked by the receipt of a ready-made package of documents for the receipt that was issued by the receiving authority. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weclipart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extract from the technical passport for the apartment" class="if uuid-2362564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362564.jpg"></div><p>  The validity of the technical passport for the apartment was previously determined for a period of five years.  After which the owner had to update it, especially when making transactions with real estate.  To date, the owner himself determines when he will receive a new document. </p><p>  Do not forget that when making capital transformations in the object, the validity period of the technical passport for the apartment no longer matters.  Since updating the data is the responsibility of the owner.  Indeed, with significant changes in the premises, the characteristics of the object change.  And areas often change by connecting balconies and other extensions.  That is, in the technical plan should be reflected any changes in the characteristics of the property. </p><h2>  The first type of statement and its characteristics </h2><p>  When making real estate transactions, very often an extract from the technical passport for the apartment is attached to the documents.  The fact is that it contains brief information about the object and can be of two types. </p><p>  The first type of statement is used when making the most common real estate transactions and contains the following information: </p><ul><li>  the address of the object and the year of its construction; </li><li>  the area is both total and residential; </li><li>  date of registration; </li><li>  information about the owner; </li><li>  date of inventory and overhaul; </li><li>  number of storeys and materials of walls and floors. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.sicherheitsforum.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I order a technical passport for an apartment" class="if uuid-2362539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362539.jpg"></div><h2>  The first type of statement, its characteristics.  What is needed to receive a document? </h2><p>  It can be seen that in such a document there are all the main characteristics of the object, that is, the list can be wider.  The cost of the statement also varies by region.  And it is valid for one year.  The second type of statement is extended; it contains information about the date and illegal changes.  Moreover, the validity period reaches five years. </p><p>  To get any of these statements, you must contact your local BTI with a statement.  The terms of issuance can be from ten to fourteen days, while it is mandatory to pay her the cost, which is set by local authorities independently.  Although you can pay for the urgent receipt of the document. </p><h2>  Firms that help in the design.  What to look for when choosing such an agency? </h2><p>  Regarding independent registration, we can say that today there are companies that provide such services.  In order to choose where to order a technical passport for an apartment, you need to carefully study the information about the company, it is worth paying attention to: </p><ul><li>  office availability; </li><li>  reputation; </li><li>  reviews from other users; </li><li>  legality of the services provided; </li><li>  cost of the offer. </li></ul><p>  The latter should be average in level.  Do not trust companies that offer especially low commissions for their services.  Such a close approach is needed for the reason that you will have to entrust not only money, but also documents, including a power of attorney.  It is worth remembering that all those that are transferred to third parties should be only copies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.acea.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for registration of a technical passport for an apartment" class="if uuid-2362553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2362553.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the cost of the technical passport for the apartment will be increased by the size of the commission for the mediation services provided.  One may wonder why pay more.  However, sometimes it happens that time constraints complicate the process of obtaining a technical passport.  Therefore, in this case, the best way would be to order such work.  This will ultimately reduce the time required to receive the document. </p><h2>  Useful tips and tricks </h2><p>  Finally, we note that the receipt of technical documentation for real estate in some cases becomes the very beginning in a long way of registering the property.  The value of the document is difficult to overestimate.  After all, when compiling it, all the data on the apartment and even the house is indicated.  It should be said that new buildings most often have only a technical plan for the house.  And its registration on a specific apartment is assigned to the owner. </p><p>  You must be careful when collecting a package of documents and, before proceeding with active actions, depending on the situation, specify the list of papers for obtaining a technical passport.  It is also important to know in what form the statement is made and what information is reflected in it.  These data can be clarified from open sources or directly at the BTI or MFC unit. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how and where to order a technical passport for an apartment, what is this document.  We hope you find this information useful. </p>
