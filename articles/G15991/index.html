    <h2>  Knitting beret </h2><p>  If you do not know exactly <span>how to knit a hat with</span> knitting needles for beginners, then knitting a beret will lead you out of the blind alley.  It‚Äôs easy to make.  The only thing you need to consider is that you need to knit a few sizes smaller, since in the process of wearing it will stretch very much. </p><p>  At the beginning, calculate the number of loops that need to be put on the knitting needles.  It depends on the size of the future beret.  To do this, it is necessary to measure the circumference of the head, after which two centimeters are subtracted from the obtained value.  Next, the radius of the circle is calculated: the circumference is divided by a constant number of 6.28. </p><p>  Now the obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãin centimeters need to be converted into loops.  Knitting a headdress requires dexterity and increased attention, so the information on how to knit a hat with knitting needles will be very useful for beginners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is most convenient to start knitting on two knitting needles, moving in a circle during work.  Loops are calculated on the first spoke, calculated taking into account the size of the head.  Next, an elastic band about three centimeters long is knitted.  Then the total number of rows must be divided into two equal parts.  You should also pre-calculate the number of loops per increase during knitting of the first part of the product.  Try to do this operation as carefully and carefully as possible, otherwise holes may appear. </p><p>  The second third of the beret is knitted without additions or decreases, but the third part requires special attention, making it the most difficult.  After reading an article on how to knit a hat with knitting needles for beginners, you can easily deal with this issue.  To begin, divide all the previously obtained knitting into six equal parts.  Suppose you have 60 loops, dividing them into 6 parts, it turns out that one part is 10. We knit together the first and second loops, the tenth and eleventh, and so on with an interval of ten loops.  You, of course, calculate your interval individually.  Having finished the first row of the third part, in the second you find yourself on the wrong side, it is knitted without reducing the loops.  In the third row, you need to knit together the loop obtained from the next one. </p><p>  As soon as exactly half is reduced from the initial number of loops, begin to double the number of knitted loops.  Due to such a decrease, the crown of the beret will be flat and neat.  Finally, connect the seam located in the middle of the headgear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Difficulties in knitting </h2><p>  Even if you read about how to knit a hat with knitting needles for beginners, it will be hard to do it the first time, but with time and practice experience will come, and you will be able to create wonderful hats.

And remember, you will succeed! </p><h2>  How to knit a baby hat with knitting needles on your own? </h2><p>  To knit a baby hat, you will need 100-150 grams of yarn and knitting needles.  She knits with the simplest viscous - an elastic band.  It is necessary to measure the girth of the head and the depth of the future cap.  Then dial the required number of loops, relying on the resulting size of the head circumference, and begin to knit (2 facial loops, 1 wrong loop).  In this way, you need to knit about 45 cm and sew the seam on top and back.  Due to this length, you can tie the cap with the ears with knitting needles, while it turns out the original rectangular shape.  Ears can be decorated with anything you want. </p><h2>  The second way to knit a baby hat </h2><p>  There is another way that will be useful to anyone who wants to learn how to knit a baby hat with knitting needles.  First you need to dial about 90 loops and knit with an elastic band, then, after knitting 25-30 cm, begin to reduce the loops, therefore, you get the bottom of the cap.  Decrease is done in the front row, for this 2 loops are knitted together every six loops, in subsequent rows after five, four and so on.  When the number of loops decreases to 17, they need to be gathered together and tightened.  Then you need to sew a hat.  The finished product can also be decorated to your taste.  If you want to knit a <span>hat for a girl with</span> knitting needles, you can attach special ropes to it that will securely hold it on the children's head. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hat for newborn </h2><p>  It is very important that the newborn has a quality hat.  Of course, you can buy it at any children's store, but some mothers prefer knitting a hat on a newborn‚Äôs knitting needles.  It is very simple to do this, plus in this way you can show all your love and care for your long-awaited child. </p><p>  The hat should be knitted from soft threads, because the delicate skin of a newborn is especially susceptible to all kinds of allergic reactions.  For knitting you will need knitting needles, a hook for a button from threads and about 100 g of yarn. </p><p>  First, you need to dial 74 loops on the knitting needles, then knit with an elastic band 1x1 about 6-8 rows.  Having finished knitting with an elastic band, knit the next row with purl loops and insert ruffles.  Then you should knit 22 rows with facial loops and distribute the loops on special stocking knitting needles. </p><p>  The first rows in a circle need to be tied with purl loops, since ruffs will also be here.  Next, start making loops.  When decreasing, knit every seventh and sixth loop together, then every fifth and sixth, and so on.  The decrease must be repeated through a row until 10 loops remain on the needles. </p><p>  The remaining loops must be pulled together and fixed on the outside of the headgear. </p><p>  Then, along the edge of the fabric, you should dial new loops, which knit with an elastic band 1x1 about three centimeters.  On the first side of this gum, you must not forget to leave a buttonhole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a women's hat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346347.jpg?1393778390996" width="585"></div>  To do this, at the end of the row you need to close 2 or 3 loops, while in the next dial them again.  It is better to make a button also of thread, in order to avoid rubbing the baby‚Äôs neck.

    <p>  For knitting buttons you need a hook, on which you need to dial 3 air loops and close them in a circle.  So, in a circle you need to knit about eight rows and pull the finished button with a thread. </p><p>  If you do not want to make a button, you can knit special small ties for this.  To do this, you need to crochet a chain of air loops and knit a row without crochet with columns.  Without breaking the thread at the same time, tie the edge of the cap with a special crayfish step. </p><h2>  Hat with ears </h2><p>  Hats with earflaps have become not only a fashionable element of a winter wardrobe, but also excellent protection from severe frosts and winds.  To figure out how to knit a women's hat with knitting needles of a similar model is even possible for a beginner needlewoman. </p><p>  First you need to take measurements for the future headgear.  It is recommended to use thick circular knitting needles, as well as yarn corresponding to them.  Wanting to make such a model, many needlewomen will learn about how to knit a double hat with knitting needles so that it turns out to be even more voluminous and unusual. </p><p>  It is better to write down the obtained measurements and the knitting density in a notebook so as not to get confused in the process of making the headgear.  For example, you knit a square fabric of size 10x10 stitch on knitting needles number 6 with yarn in two additions.  The density of such a square is fifteen loops in twenty rows.  Using this pattern, you can easily understand how many loops will be needed to knit the headband. </p><p>  When thinking about how to knit a cap with earflaps with knitting needles, keep in mind that it is made from the bottom up.  You should start with cords that will serve as ties. </p><p>  First loop on the knitting needles.  Their number depends on the width of the tie, for example, five loops.  Slide open loops to the opposite end of the knitting needle and drag the thread there.  Knit all with facial loops and move them again to the other end of the knitting needle. </p><p>  Repeat the above steps until you get the cord of the desired length.  During knitting, gently stretch the knitted strip, achieving uniform distribution of its elements. </p><p>  Now you can start knitting the ears of the product.  To do this, in each even row you need to make a uniform addition on both sides of the fabric and continue knitting with stocking. </p><p>  At the beginning of this row, double and double crochet seven times before 2 stitches.  The same thing needs to be done at the end of the row, that is, on the other side of the canvas, when there are two untied loops left there.  As a result, 19 loops should be on the knitting needles. </p><p>  Next, remove the loops on the other knitting needle and in the same way tie the second eye. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a double hat with knitting needles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346348.jpg?1393778410093" width="333"></div></h2><p>  Having finished the ears, tackle the edge of the headgear.  To do this, dial loops on circular knitting needles.  For our example, there will be 42 such loops. Distribute 80 loops on one knitting needle: an eye with an additional knitting needle, a second eye and 21 loops of the main product. </p><p>  Knit a piece of stocking in a circle.  Thus, you need to knit about 11-12 cm, depending on the <span>size of the headgear.</span>  Then proceed to the formation of the top of the cap with earflaps. </p><p>  Start getting loops out of work.  Reduce in each even circle 8 times.  Front and back of the product, in the middle, fold 4 times in a loop, make the same decrease over the ears.  When a ring of removed loops remains on the knitting needles, pull a thread of yarn through them and pull off the top of the finished hat. </p><h2>  Knitted hat with pompons </h2><p>  How to knit a <span>hat with a pompom</span> knitting needles?  This model is relevant not only for children, but also for adults.  Such a hat will complement any outfit, thanks to its playfulness and ease. </p><p>  To create such a product, you will need twisted yarn.  Yarn with the addition of acrylic is well suited, it is stronger and does not "roll", which is very important.  Especially if you want to knit a hat with knitting needles for a boy. </p><p>  First you need to tie the sample to determine the density of the knit.  Next, take a measure of the circumference of the head, and according to this size, calculate the number of loops necessary for knitting.  The total number of loops should be a multiple of eight.  Add 2 more edge loops to the resulting amount. </p><p>  Let's look at an example of how to knit a hat with knitting needles with a pompom, if you get 82 loops.  Type them on knitting needles and knit with stocking about 10 centimeters.  Next, go on the front side to regular knitting. </p><p>  Knit the canvas with the main viscous 12 centimeters, and then begin to reduce.  The first decrease is made in each rapport of the knitting pattern.  To do this, knit three front loops in the front row, together 2 wrong loops, 1 remove and again two loops together with the wrong. </p><p>  Then knit 2 centimeters, without reducing or adding anything.  The second decrease is also done in each rapport, but now in the wrong row you need to knit together three front loops with the wrong ones. </p><p>  Before the third decrease, also knit two centimeters of canvas in the drawing.  Third decrease: knit two faces, the third with the wrong side for the back walls of one. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a fashionable hat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346349.jpg?1393778443932" width="375"></div></h2><p>  Further, in all the front rows, it is necessary to knit all the loops in two, and the wrong rows in the figure. </p><p>  When there are about or exactly 10 loops on the knitting needles, pull the last through all the loops and fasten the thread.  Next, sew a hat, the edge can be turned away. </p><p>  Now you need to make pompons for the finished product.  You can make either one large pompom in the middle of the cap, or several small ones. </p><p>  To make a pompom, you need to cut out 2 circles from cardboard with a hole in the middle.  Then wind the yarn tightly around the circle.  The pomp's pomp will depend on how many threads you wind.  Therefore, wind as much as you need for your pompom. </p><p>  After winding the yarn, cut it along the edge of the template.  Next, you need to gently push the cardboard blank and carefully bandage the threads.  After removing the template, fluff the pompom and trim its ends with scissors.  Now it remains only to sew it on the finished product. </p><h2>  How to knit a hat with an elastic band on your own? </h2><p>  A hat knitted with an elastic band should fit snugly to the head, that is, be exactly the right size for you.  It should also be borne in mind that a dense elastic band has the ability to calmly stretch while wearing (especially at first).  To knit this headdress you need knitting needles and any yarn of your choice. </p><p>  Now we will consider in detail how to knit a fashionable hat with knitting needles using English rubber.  First you need to take a measure of the circumference of the head. </p>

    <p>  Next, you need to tie the sample.  To do this, dial twenty loops on the knitting needles and knit several rows.  Alternating the front and back loops, form a canvas pattern.  Further, during the operation of the loop, you need to knit as they look at you. </p><p>  After you knit 20 rows of fabric samples, you can determine the density of knitting and the number of loops needed to create your hat. </p><p>  Now put on the knitting needles of the number of loops.  The first row is knitted with front and back loops alternately.  The second row fits the way the loops look at you.  But the following rows have some features.  When tying the front loop, insert the needle into the nearby lower loop, and not in the row that you are knitting.  Do not stretch the loops.  Your task is to achieve the maximum density of the canvas, as during the work you will see that it turns out a little loose. </p><p>  If you want your product to have a lapel, knit 6-8 cm of fabric and continue to knit a hat.  Moving about 10 cm from the lapel, begin reducing the loops. </p><p>  Reduction should be done evenly until the moment that there are three loops left on the knitting needles.  Then the product must be fixed and sewn with a knitted seam. </p><p>  In order for the hat to sit as you need, moisten it with water and let it dry. Such a hat can be decorated with a pompom, this will give it even more relevance. </p><h2>  Hat with lapel </h2><p>  For several seasons in a row, a hat with a lapel has been an integral part of the winter wardrobe of many fashionistas.  This product is available in stores, but you can also connect a <span>hat with a lapel with knitting needles</span> .  When starting knitting, remember that the cap of such a style should be exactly in size, and also note that it can stretch during socks. </p><p>  First measure your head circumference.  Further, it is recommended to knit the sample by collecting 20 loops and knitting a bit of canvas. </p><p>  Then you need to form a sample in 20 rows, knitting alternately the front and back loops.  Then it is necessary to determine the number of loops per 1 cm of knitting and on this basis, knowing the circumference of the head, you will calculate the required number of loops. </p><p>  Having typed the loop, you can start knitting hats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit hat for girls" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346351.jpg?1393778508404" width="570"></div>  The first row is knitted with front and back loops alternately.  The loops in the second row fit in the way they look at you, but in the remaining rows - in a different pattern.  So, when knitting the front loop, the needle is inserted into the lower loop.

    <p>  In order to form the lapel of the product, you need to knit about 7 cm of the fabric, after which continue to knit the main part of the cap.  Moving away from the lapel by 10 cm, that is, 17-20 cm from the base of the cap, you should begin reducing the loops to form the bottom of the cap. </p><p>  The reduction of loops is done evenly on both sides of the fabric and continues until 3 loops remain on the knitting needles.  The remaining loops need to be fastened and stitching the seams of the cap.  After knitting, moisten the hat with water and allow it to dry.  This will give the new thing the necessary size. </p><p>  In order for the hat to fit exactly in size, you need to take a measure of the circumference of the head.  Tie a sample with a width of about 10 cm. Then calculate the number of loops per centimeter of knitting.             .  ,     ,   . </p><h2>     </h2><p>          .         10 .        13    .    ,     ,    . </p><p>      ,             .  4-5      .       ,      ,      . </p><p>   :  <span> ,</span>    , 10    .  10 ,   ,   .     5         .        .    - . </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346352.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>      ,        .    ,     ,       .        .      ,    .        ,      .          .           .     ,      10-15 .       . </p><p>       ,      .         ,   .           . </p>
