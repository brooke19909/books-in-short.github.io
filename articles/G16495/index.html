This is due to the fact that smartphone manufacturers create their products so versatile that it seems that laptops can soon be abandoned.  However, many users still remain true to the tablets.  Therefore, people often look for tablets with good sound or devices for work. </p><h2>  Tablets </h2><p>  Since tablets are not very popular right now, manufacturers have stopped working to ensure that each model can be attributed to a certain type.  They are increasingly trying to produce universal models, among which one can single out the budget segment and tablets for work. </p><p>  To find a gaming tablet, you will have to consider many options, studying their technical characteristics.  You will have to do the same in finding a tablet with good sound.  Although even now, some manufacturers may indicate this advantage in advertising or on the box. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmodo.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound quality tablet" class="if uuid-3052219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052219.jpg"></div><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  A tablet with good sound is an excellent replacement for a multimedia and working device.  Many people choose this type of tablet to watch cartoons and videos with the whole family.  Also, the option is suitable for those who want to show presentations or graphics with animation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  Of course, presenting a rating of tablets with good sound is not easy.  However, some models have truly established themselves as the best in sound: </p><ol><li>  Chuwi Hi9. </li><li>  Lenovo A7600. </li><li>  Lenovo Yoga Tablet 3 Pro. </li><li>  <span>Xiaomi MiPad</span> 2. </li><li>  Samsung Tab S3. </li></ol><p>  Among these models, there is not only a tablet with the best sound, but also just good working devices that are suitable for entertainment and business. </p><h2>  Chuwi hi9 </h2><p>  This is one of the latest models of the company.  The packaging is outwardly unremarkable.  It is yellow in color with a logo on the cover.  On the side there is a sticker with the technical characteristics of the model.  The kit includes a charging unit, a USB cable, a warranty card and instructions. </p><p>  Like the packaging, the device itself is also not particularly noteworthy.  This is a classic black case, which they tried to make as thin as possible.  Although he does not reach the same ‚Äúapple‚Äù models. </p><p>  It is convenient to hold the device because it has rounded edges.  There are few buttons on it: the power key and the volume button.  On top of the manufacturer has placed all the connectors for connecting a headset and charger. </p><h2>  Technical specifications Chuwi Hi9 </h2><p>  This is one of the simplest ‚Äúfilling‚Äù tablets.  Inside, the MediaTek MT8173 works.  Installed 4 GB is not the fastest RAM.  There is also 64 GB of internal storage.  This is a compact model with a diagonal of 8.4 inches and a resolution of 560 x 1600 pixels.  The main camera is 2 megapixels, the front camera is 5 megapixels.  The battery runs at 5,000 mAh.  It will cost 12-13 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mynexttablet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chuwi hi9 reviews" class="if uuid-3052221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052221.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about Chuwi Hi9 </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest tablets on the market.  Users spoke well of him, although he could not win ardent fans.  The sound is really good, since the device is equipped with a powerful speaker.  The volume of the tablet is not bad, but the sound is clear.  Users noted in the reviews is not the most powerful hardware.  Using a model for games is not the best option, but for surfing the Internet it is perfect. </p><h2>  Lenovo A7600 </h2><p>  Lenovo is famous for its good tablets.  Especially if you consider the more expensive segment.  But this is an even more or less inexpensive tablet with good sound.  Many users called it a musical tablet. </p><p>  It is delivered in a company box.  There is nothing unusual inside: a user manual, a charger and a short USB cable. </p><p>  Externally, this model is not very different from the previous one.  You need to understand that for 12-13 thousand rubles, manufacturers do not indulge buyers with sophisticated forms and bright cases.  This is a black tablet with thin edges, but very thick frames around the screen. </p><h2>  Technical specifications Lenovo A7600 </h2><p>  This device with a 10-inch display has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels.  Works with <span>MediaTek MT8382</span> and 1 GB of RAM.  I was pleased with the autonomy of the device - 6,340 mAh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="altaok.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo A7600 reviews" class="if uuid-3052223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052223.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, determining which tablet sounds better is not easy.  Most users are guided by the highest volume level.  But in this model, good quality sound provides Dolby Digital technology. </p><h2>  Lenovo A7600 Reviews </h2><p>  The model was not very impressive.  It has mediocre technical specifications, but excellent sound technology.  According to reviews, it is clear that both volume and sound quality are especially pleasing to users.  Although even autonomy does not always save bad hardware. </p><h2>  Lenovo Yoga Tablet 3 Pro </h2><p>  But this Lenovo model is much better.  You can buy it for 20-25 thousand rubles.  This is one of the top models of the company, which boasts not only parameters, but also a beautiful appearance.  A thin plastic case is held by a metal stand.  There is some kind of skin on the back.  Everything looks beautiful and expensive. </p><h2>  Technical specifications Lenovo Yoga Tablet 3 Pro </h2><p>  The model is running Intel Atom x5-Z8500.  It is a fairly fast processor with frequencies up to 2,400 MHz.  Inside only 2 GB of RAM.  Storage is available at 32 GB, although the user will be able to occupy only 22 GB.  The rest of the space is occupied by the system. </p><p>  This is one of the most autonomous tablets - 6,600 mAh.  It can work up to 18 hours, although it withstands full-fledged activity for 7-8 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.csmobiles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 Pro reviews" class="if uuid-3052224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052224.jpg"></div><p>  A review of tablets with good sound should include this particular model, since JBL speakers are built into it.  Thanks to them, the device seems the loudest on the market.  At the same time, it does not distort the sound, but helps to highlight high and medium frequencies.  There are problems with low ones. </p><h2>  Lenovo Yoga Tablet 3 Pro reviews </h2><p>  This is a great model that is suitable for both work and entertainment.  Users are satisfied with almost everything: excellent appearance, good system performance, as well as excellent sound.  Due to its high autonomy, you can not pick up a charger all day.  Although under high loads, the tablet can discharge quickly. </p><h2>  Samsung Tab S3 </h2><p>  This model retains its corporate identity.  It seems noticeably cumbersome, especially when compared to its direct rival iPad Pro 10.5.  Of course, the design here is an amateur.  I would like the frames around the screen to be smaller and remove additional touch buttons. </p><p>  However, this is one of the best Samsung tablets with good <span>sound (DAC).</span>  But for the quality will have to pay about 45-50 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Technical specifications Samsung Tab S3 </h2><p>  Not only sound, but also the screen turned out to be special in this model.  This is a 9.7-inch display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels and an AMOLED matrix.  It pleases the eye with its bright and rich colors. </p><p>  Inside, the Snapdragon 820 works, which easily copes with all gaming innovations and resource-intensive programs.  The device works with 4 GB of RAM, which is not always enough.  The internal storage is only 32 GB, so you may need a memory card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 reviews" class="if uuid-3052225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052225.jpg"></div><p>  The tablet works with four speakers.  The volume in the device is very high, and the sound quality is at an altitude.  The only thing is that low frequencies, as always, lose high and medium. </p><h2>  Samsung Tab S3 Reviews </h2><p>  This is a great tablet with good sound and screen.  Users noted powerful technical characteristics that turn the tablet into a working tool.  Of course, the look is already a little tired.  If you take into account the design, it is better to turn to products from Apple.  But if you are a fan of Android devices, then this is one of the best. </p><h2>  Xiaomi MiPad 2 </h2><p>  This is not the most expensive tablet on the market, since Xiaomi is still treated with caution.  Models are difficult to beat mastodons from Apple or Samsung.  But if you look at the cost, and then on the device parameters, the question arises: why pay more? </p><p>  Externally, the model looks very fashionable and stylish.  It may appeal to those who have long dreamed of an iPad, but cannot afford a tablet.  For only 12-13 thousand you can buy a copy of it.  Let it be inferior in some respects. </p><h2>  Specifications Xiaomi MiPad 2 </h2><p>  The device has a screen diagonal of 7.9 inches with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels, with a battery of 6,190 mAh.  Inside, the Intel Atom X5-Z8500 mobile processor operates at a frequency of 2,200 MHz.  RAM is only 2 GB, which may not be enough for demanding applications, and the internal storage is designed for 16 or 64 GB, depending on the configuration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.miui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi mi pad 2 reviews" class="if uuid-3052226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052226.jpg"></div><p>  Given that this is a fairly budget model, it can be considered an excellent tablet with good sound in the headphones.  True, for this you will also have to look for a good headset. </p><h2>  Xiaomi MiPad 2 reviews </h2><p>  This is a good inexpensive model.  She is hardly able to cope with work programs and complex tasks.  Ideal for surfing the Internet and the simplest arcades.  Thanks to the good resolution and high-quality matrix, the device can cope with watching movies, especially since the sound allows this. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  Of course, these are not the only models that have proven themselves well with their speakers.  For example, this year the announcement of a good Honor Pad 5 tablet took place. In the official teaser, the manufacturer pointed out two powerful Harman / Kardon speakers that could surprise with Histen 5.0 sound technology. </p><p>  Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet is also known for its good settings.  It is protected against dust and moisture.  The display received an oleophobic coating and a diagonal of 10 inches.  The resolution is 2560 x 1600 pixels.  Corporate sound is good enough, although it may not be worth the money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet reviews" class="if uuid-3052227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3052227.jpg"></div><p>  And, of course, you can not say about the iPad Pro 12.9.  When you introduce Apple devices in a review, you don‚Äôt immediately want to compare them with other gadgets.  It so happened that the manufacturer does everything to ensure that his products are always in the first place, and he does it very well. </p><p>  iPad Pro 12.9 has got four stereo speakers, excellent hardware and a nice design.  Everything is done very carefully and efficiently, and therefore you will have to pay about 130-140 thousand rubles for a tablet. </p>
