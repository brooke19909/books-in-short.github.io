    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  In ch.  25 of the Tax Code, the procedure for evaluating finished products and wipes has been established.  It differs significantly from accounting rules.  <span>The main accounting is</span> carried out in accordance with paragraphs 64 and 59 of the Rules, approved by order of the Ministry of Finance No. 34n of 07.29.1998. </p><p>  The company can choose the recognition of management and business expenses, in accordance with paragraph 9 of PBU 10/99.  In tax accounting (OU) there is no such possibility.  Article 319 of the Tax Code establishes 3 assessment methods for specific categories of organizations. </p><p>  Due to such a <span>difference between accounting and tax accounting, the</span> company has to revise the <span>costs of the current</span> period, reducing the positions for which differences are identified with OU.  The organization can vary the methods of assessment in accounting, trying to maximize its adjustment to the rules of the Tax Code. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Possible solutions to the problem </h2><p>  You can minimize the <span>difference between accounting and tax accounting by</span> writing off management and business expenses directly to the cost of goods sold in the current period.  The fact is that the composition of these costs is almost the same as the composition of other indirect costs in OU.  By choosing this cost accounting option, an enterprise can solve several problems at once. </p><p>  First of all, the organization will be able to eliminate temporary differences arising between indirect costs in <span>accounting and tax accounting.</span>  <span>At a manufacturing enterprise</span> at NU, the indirect costs of manufacturing and selling products are fully expensed for the current period.  The corresponding provision is fixed by Article 318 of the Tax Code in paragraph 2. </p><p>  If you do not use the above option, administrative and commercial expenses must be attributed to the costs involved in the formation of the cost of production and production facilities and finished products.  Most of them may not be included in the financial result for the current period.  The result would be temporary differences. </p><p>  Secondly, the organization will be able to isolate the area of ‚Äã‚Äãconstant differences in costs, which are included in the cost of goods sold in both <span>accounting and tax accounting.</span>  <span>In manufacturing enterprises,</span> most often constant differences arise when accounting for managerial and commercial costs, as well as non-production (non-operating, operating) costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting regulations" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1925185.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thirdly, the organization will be able to exclude from the costs involved in the assessment of the production process and finished products costs forming permanent differences.  In the list of direct costs will remain those that cause temporary differences.

Meanwhile, they are recognized in different ways in <span>accounting and tax accounting.</span>  <span>At a manufacturing facility,</span> these costs are included in direct costs.  In tax accounting, they are considered indirect costs.  Accordingly, in NU, the sums of these costs are not involved in the assessment of wipes and finished goods. </p><p>  The procedure for identifying temporary differences and recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective accounting accounts will depend on the structure of tax accounting at the enterprise.  As practice shows, some companies form special NU registers.  <span>Conducting accounting and tax accounting</span> in this case is carried out in parallel. </p><p>  Other firms allocate costs, the recognition procedure of which differs in the accounting and financial statements, directly on the accounts of accounting.  This procedure is used to exclude or add these costs for tax accounting purposes. </p><h2>  Parallel Reporting: An Example </h2><p>  Suppose an enterprise produces double-glazed windows.  The company carries out the assessment of production costs in accounting at the cost of materials and raw materials, and finished products - at the actual production rate. </p><p>  In accordance with <span>regulatory accounting documents</span> , management and business expenses are not taken <span>into account</span> when determining the cost of finished products.

    <h2>  General rules for depreciation </h2><p>  <span>Depreciation of equipment</span> and other operating systems in accounting begins on the 1st day of the month following the period of acceptance of the facilities.  The corresponding rule is fixed in paragraph 21 of PBU 6/01. </p><p>  Calculation, therefore, begins after the accountant makes a record: </p><p>  Db sc  01 cd  08 - acceptance of the OS for accounting. </p><p>  At NU, however, depreciation charges begin from the month that follows the period the asset is commissioned.  The corresponding rule is fixed by paragraph 2 259 of the article of the Tax Code. </p><p>  If the ownership of the object must be registered, depreciation should be accrued in a different manner. </p><p>  In <span>business accounting,</span> depreciation is calculated after putting the facility into operation.  This position was expressed by the Ministry of Finance in a letter No. 16-00-14 / 121 of April 8.  2003. In tax accounting, depreciation is calculated after the documents for state registration are submitted and the funds are put into operation.  This is indicated by the provisions of Article 258 of the Tax Code. </p><p>  Stop depreciation in both accounting and tax accounting at a manufacturing enterprise at the same time - from the 1st of the month that follows the period in which the asset is depreciated or disposed of (deducted from the balance sheet).  After that, the object is listed at zero cost. </p><h2>  Calculation Methods </h2><p>  Accounting provides 4 accrual methods: </p><ul><li>  linear; </li><li>  reduced balance; </li><li>  in proportion to the volume of manufactured products; </li><li>  write-off of st-sti by the sum of the numbers of years of the useful life. </li></ul><p>  In NU, only 2 methods are used: linear and non-linear. </p><p>  To approximate tax and accounting, it is advisable for enterprises to use the linear method. </p><p>  Meanwhile, if the company chooses a non-linear method, in the first years of using the OS, it can reduce the taxable profit by a large amount. </p><p>  In any case, the method chosen by the enterprise is fixed in the accounting policy and should be applied throughout the operational period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="core accounting" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1925190.jpg" width="390"></div>  The periods of service of the fixed asset is fixed in the Classifier of fixed assets included in depreciation groups.  It can also be used for accounting.

    <p>  If the period of operation of a product is not indicated in the classifier, the company can set it according to technical documentation.  If there is no period there, it is necessary to send a request to the OS manufacturer.  The company has no right to independently determine the period of use of the funds. </p><h2>  Depreciation reduction </h2><p>  In NU, the norm can be halved by: </p><ol><li>  Passenger transport, the cost of which is more than 300 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Passenger minibuses, the price of which is more than 400 thousand rubles. </li></ol><p>  The company's management, in addition, has the right, at its request, to reduce the rate of deductions for any operating system.  The corresponding decision should be enshrined in accounting policies. </p><p>  Consider an example: </p><ul><li>  LLC acquired a passenger car at a price of 600 thousand rubles.  (without VAT). </li><li>  The service life is 48 months.  (4 years). </li></ul><p>  The depreciation rate for the vehicle is equal to: </p><p>  (1/48 months) x 100% = 2.083%. </p><p>  Since the price of the car is more than 300 thousand rubles, the rate can be halved: </p><p>  2.083% / 2 = 1.042%. </p><p>  Monthly depreciation amount will be: </p><p>  600 thousand rubles  x 1.042% = 6252 rub. </p><h2>  Raising standards </h2><p>  It is provided only for those operating systems that are used in enterprises with multi-shift mode or in an aggressive environment.  In this case, the norms can be doubled. </p><p>  Depreciation rates may be increased three times.  This possibility applies to settlements on funds transferred to leasing.  However, there is an exception to the rule.  In particular, it is not allowed to increase the depreciation rate for fixed assets assigned to groups 1-3, according to which depreciation is carried out in a non-linear way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting accounts in 1s" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1925468.jpg" width="600"></div>  Consider an example:

The depreciation amount calculated by the previous owner is not taken into account. </p><p>  To calculate depreciation on a used product, you must first set the useful life.
