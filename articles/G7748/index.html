    <p>  If you do not know <span>how to choose a radar detector,</span> then this article will be useful to you.  First of all, you need to understand how the radar detector differs from the radar detector, because many people think that this is one and the same thing, while these are completely different devices designed for different purposes. </p><p>  So, the radar detector is a compact monoblock or separate electronic device that detects, processes and notifies others about the close presence of DPS radars in its field of action that emit laser beams or radio waves, the detection of which is due to its settings.  In other words, it is a passive receiver that receives a signal but does not drown it. </p><p>  Unlike a <span>radar detector, a car radar</span> is an active device capable of generating high-power interference at certain radio frequencies, or modulating a detected, more powerful response signal from a DPS radar at a detected frequency.  Thus, the direction-finding device will not give out anything, or will show the result modulated by the radar detector.  But if you have already begun to think which radar detector to buy, then you may not dream about it in the near future, because these devices are prohibited in many countries by law, the violation of which threatens with a large fine or criminal punishment. </p><p>  And yet, one type of radar detector is not yet banned in Russia - a laser, the so-called ‚Äúshifter‚Äù.  This device can modulate the response signal by shifting the frequency band down (in English ‚Äúshift‚Äù), as a result, distorted (an order of magnitude reduced) information about the speed of the car is transmitted to the traffic police radar.  However, such devices are very expensive, so not everyone will be able to purchase them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before choosing a radar detector, you should find out some information about the frequencies at which the traffic police devices work.  Now DPS radars use several of their types: K-band (24.15 GHz), X-band (10.525 GHz), the Ka-band (34.7 GHz) is in the process of implementation.  At the same time, devices are either constantly radiating or pulsed.  Now mainly the second type of radar is used.  This should be noted when choosing a radar detector. </p><p>  You also need to pay attention to the mode installed on the device.  There are several types: Ultra-X, Ultra-K, POP ‚Ñ¢, Instant-On.  The device with Ultra-X mode is configured for pulsed X-band mode.  Ultra-K detects <span>K-band waves.</span>  POP ‚Ñ¢ can recognize the signal of the Ka and K bands. The latest modification of Instant-On allows you to stably recognize the X-band in a pulsed mode. </p><p>  When you think about how to choose a radar detector, keep in mind that it is intended for early information, so consider these parameters: </p><p>  - Range of direction finding signals. </p><p>  - The ability to recognize all modes and ranges used on DPS radars. </p><p>  - The processing speed of incoming signals. </p><p>  - The ratio of the probability of false and real signals. </p><p>  - Reliability of the results of their processing. </p><p>  - Quality and reliability. </p><p>  - Additional functions. </p><p>  Based on these characteristics of the device, three categories are made: budget, medium and luxury. </p><p>  For the production of low-cost, inexpensive technological combinations are used, which affects the functionality of the devices, as well as their reliability and quality.  This category includes devices from Chinese (Star) and Korean (Crunch) manufacturers, and they cost up to $ 150.  Reliability and recognition quality are better with Star instruments.  And Crunch is famous for its good feature set and range. </p><p>  Mid-range radar detectors are produced only by well-established brands: Cobra, Whistler, Super Cat, Beltronics, PNI.  Naturally, they cost a little more - from $ 200 to $ 500, but their quality is much higher. </p><p>  There is nothing to talk about elite devices - their name speaks for itself.  These are expensive and very reliable high-quality models presented by such manufacturers as Escort, Valentine One, Beltronics. </p><p>  So, before choosing a radar detector, carefully study the devices presented at the points of sale and determine for yourself the best option, guided by the above characteristics. </p>
