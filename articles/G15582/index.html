    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Like any other hotel, Orchid has its drawbacks.  Travelers note the following significant errors in service: </p><ul><li>  Overpopulation of the hotel.  The beach by the pool is often crowded; restaurants and bars lack tables and chairs. </li><li>  Dirty dishes in the restaurant.  Oily traces remain on glasses and plates. </li><li>  Constant noise by the pool.  Families with children are not recommended to take rooms with balconies overlooking it. </li><li>  An animation program is provided only for young children. </li><li>  The staircase leading to the sea is not equipped with a descent for prams. </li><li>  The rooms are cold even in warm weather, drafts walk around the room. </li></ul><p>  The three-star hotel "Orchid" (Albena), reviews of which are highly controversial, is unlikely to surprise you with first-class quality of service.  Nevertheless, this is a good budget option for those families who want to spend a vacation on the sea.  The hotel will justify the cost of the trip, will delight its visitors with a variety of food and a good animation program.  It is worth noting that many families with small children have a rest here, so single people who want to have fun at the hotel will be bored. </p>
