The main source of information about the level of service at the Venera Resort Hotel (Anapa, Vityazevo) is reviews.  Tophotels compiled the following rating of services based on ratings made by tourists: </p><ul><li>  The hotel infrastructure was rated 4 out of 5.  The most complaints were caused by an inconvenient parking lot.  The hotel security service does not work in the best way. </li><li>  The quality of service, unfortunately, did not reach 4 and earned only a rating of 3.7.  The main problem is the very slow operation of the wireless Internet and the poor quality of the connection. </li><li>  Hotel rooms were rated 4.1.  Pleases with new furniture and powerful air conditioners.  As for the quality of cleaning, it is very mediocre.  In addition, there is strong audibility between the numbers. </li><li>  The beach earned a rating of 3.7.  Sunset at sea is convenient, the area is large, but there are no changing rooms, a shower, a toilet and other infrastructure.  In addition, there is a lot of garbage on the shore. </li><li>  This place is great for children, as evidenced by a high rating of 4.7.  There is plenty of entertainment for kids, as well as an excellent diet menu. </li><li>  As for the dislocation, then for it you can put 3 points.  Pleased with the proximity to the beach, but the road to entertainment and infrastructure facilities will take a lot of time. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-3230678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/3230678.jpg?1553604982"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many travelers prefer the Venus Resort (Vityazevo).  Reviews "Tophotels" about this hotel are quite few in number, because the institution is relatively new.  Nevertheless, a lot of positive comments can be distinguished from them, among which the following can be especially noted: </p><ul><li>  spacious rooms with a very beautiful and comfortable interior; </li><li>  the rooms have new and comfortable furniture, and the beds have an orthopedic mattress; </li><li>  a modern TV is equipped with a connector for a flash drive, and therefore you can download some interesting films at home in order to while away on vacation; </li><li>  daily cleaning and replacement of bath towels; </li><li>  large clean pool with a compartment for children; </li><li>  the territory is maintained in perfect cleanliness; </li><li>  in the evening, a very beautiful backlight turns on, which simply captivates the guests; </li><li>  there is a spacious porch with soft sofas, where guests can have a good time; </li><li>  tasty and varied food, which is very similar to homemade; </li><li>  a huge assortment of sweet pastries; </li><li>  restaurant employees constantly make sure that everyone has enough food in the distribution, and therefore it is not necessary to come in advance; </li><li>  dolphins can be seen at sea; </li><li>  there is a good playground in the territory; </li><li>  a good entertainment program for children was organized; </li><li>  The architecture of the buildings and the overall appearance of the hotel make a good impression. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1411162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1411162.jpg?1553580951"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Quite a popular destination for summer sea holidays is Anapa, Vityazevo.  "Venus Resort", reviews of which are few in view of the novelty of the hotel, is characterized by a number of disadvantages.  The most significant of the negative comments are as follows: </p><ul><li>  a rather sluggish animation, presented by just one person (but you should give him credit for his efforts); </li><li>  there is no infrastructure nearby, except for a small shop with overpriced prices; </li><li>  windows of most rooms face the wasteland or the end of a neighboring hotel located close to the building; </li><li>  next to the hotel there is a garbage dump on which something is constantly burning; </li><li>  you have the opportunity to specify when booking only the category of the room, and not the building or a specific room; </li><li>  Wi-Fi works only in those rooms with windows overlooking the pool; </li><li>  constant interruptions with water supply; </li><li>  a huge number of flies fly in the dining room; </li><li>  the buffet menu is repeated every day; </li><li>  a rather indifferent attitude to the hotel‚Äôs problems both on the part of the staff and the manager; </li><li>  if you want to post a negative review on the hotel‚Äôs website, then do not bother yourself - it will be deleted immediately; </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are engaged in personal affairs and chatter, and not cleaning dirty dishes from the tables; </li><li>  Until eleven in the evening loud music plays by the pool, which does not allow you to fall asleep; </li><li>  the car that transfers guests is very old, and it does not provide for a special child seat; </li><li>  if you intend to relax at the hotel for more than 14 days, it is worth considering that a free shuttle service is provided only from the airport, and in the opposite direction you will have to pay 500 rubles; </li><li>  in the place where the hotel is located, mobile communications practically do not work; </li><li>  there are no local fruits on the menu, but only imported oranges and bananas (even watermelons - even those imported); </li><li>  employees very carelessly wash the floor in the dining room, leaving a lot of water, which makes the floor slippery; </li><li>  the number of sunbeds by the pool, as well as places in the dining room are too few for the number of vacationers who are in the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your vacation in a place like the Venera Resort Hotel (Vityazevo), the reviews of experienced tourists will be an excellent guide for you.  First, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the positive aspects.  Given that the hotel is quite new, here you will not find shabby furniture and outdated equipment.  Outwardly, everything looks very beautiful and well-groomed.  As for nutrition, it is delicious and satisfying at home.  Here you will not find culinary masterpieces of a restaurant level, but even those simple dishes that are presented on the menu will leave you a good impression. </p><p>  If we talk about the negative aspects, then there are also quite a lot of them in the "Venus Resort" (Venera Resort).  The hotel in Vityazevo declares the availability of wireless Internet throughout the territory, and in particular in the rooms.  Nevertheless, on arrival you will find unpleasant disappointment.  The signal is very weak and works only in the lobby area and on the balconies of some rooms.  Even if you warn staff in advance that this option is necessary for you, no one will recognize you as having problems.  Another unpleasant moment is the constant interruptions in the water supply.  To swim, the guests of the upper floors have to wait until the other residents finish their water procedures. </p><p>  If you want to address any problem or claim to the administration, then you should not count on an early resolution of the problem.  Of course, they will carefully listen to you, but everything will remain in its place.  If, after repeated communication with the administration, you want to complain to the manager or owner, then most likely you will also not find understanding. </p>
