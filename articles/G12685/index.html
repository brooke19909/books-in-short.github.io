Such accommodation is suitable for families with children or for a small group of friends. </p><h2>  Description of the cottage </h2><p>  Villa Pinjatic (Cat.B) 2 * looks like a neat cottage in the country.  Around it is a small green lawn.  In Budva, you can often find houses with white facades, and <span>this cottage was</span> no exception.  Attention is drawn to the medium-sized balconies that are found in all rooms on the upper floors.  Here tourists can dry their clothes after washing or the beach. </p><p>  The rooms on the ground floor are attached with small open terraces, on which the shadow of the vineyards falls. </p><p>  For tourists who decide to rent a transport, there is a small parking lot near the villa. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the mini-hotel there are no separate arbors for rest and a barbecue area.  In the evening, you can relax in the fresh air only on your balconies and terraces. </p><p>  A comfortable life in the hotel is provided by the hostess, who lives nearby in a small country house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Meals at the hotel are not provided.  You can have lunch at the Zlatibor restaurant, which is quite close to the villa, but you need to be prepared for the high cost of dishes on the menu. </p><p>  Internet in the house does not work.  It can be used only at the cottage, where with a few attempts it will be possible to connect to WI-FI. </p><h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  Villa Pinjatic (Cat.B) 2 * is not distinguished by good service.  Trash from the rooms have to be taken out by guests on their own.  Bed linen is changed once every 7 days. </p><p>  On the territory there is a small playground.  On the terraces is plastic furniture.  Room cleaning is only at the request of hotel guests.  Towels are also changed after the guest comments. </p><p>  Check-in to the rooms is not strictly in time.  The hostess prepares the rooms approximately for the time of arrival of the guests, which is negotiated in advance.  There are no additional services in the villa, the service corresponds to the declared two stars. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  To the sea from the villa is approximately 10 minutes walk at an average pace.  On the way there are grocery and souvenir shops. </p>

    <p>  A small Slavic beach consists of pebbles and sand.  In terms of cleanliness, you can‚Äôt mark it ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, so often guests go a little further to Mogren Beach.  The road takes about half an hour.  You need to take special shoes with you, because there are no purely sandy beaches in Budva. </p>

    <p>  Mogren is open from 8.00 to 21.00.  Anyone can come here. </p><p>  Sightseeing tours are best booked through the Biblio Globus company.  A Russian-speaking guide works here, so a walk through beautiful places will also be informative. </p><p>  The price of excursions does not include lunch, so you need to worry about it in advance and prepare snacks with you. </p><p>  The villa is located near the city center, so all the available entertainment for tourists will be convenient.  No need to order a taxi to travel to the entertainment center or restaurant.  In the evening you can walk to the cottage. </p><p>  The city has a large water park and a mini zoo, so it‚Äôs easy to have fun.  For nightlife lovers, there are many clubs in the city center; anyone will find a place in a bar or in a disco. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of a ticket to Montenegro in a good hotel will cost two to three times more expensive than living in this villa.  In the pursuit of cheapness, remember that food is not provided here.  Guests often buy food at the supermarket and cook their own meals in the kitchenettes in their rooms. </p><p>  In restaurants, lunch costs an average of 20 euros.  A pretty impressive amount for those travelers who check into a two-star hotel.  Tourists with young children will have a little more difficult.  It is impossible to cook a full-fledged complex of several dishes in the room.  Therefore, pre-worry about the selection of a cafe or restaurant with affordable prices for a set lunch. </p><p>  Seasoned tourists share secrets: not far from the hotel there is a cafe "San Marino".  During the day, you can dine here for 5 euros.  But travelers warn that a complex lunch includes dishes from instant packages.  This is a mid-range restaurant, and therefore the dishes here are appropriate.  Isn‚Äôt it easier to cook this in a room for less money? </p><h2>  Villa Pinjatic: reviews </h2><p>  On various Internet resources there are a lot of ratings about the hotel.  The quality of service reviews are negative.  Guests note that the hostess of the hotel does not monitor the cleanliness of the rooms. </p><p>  In the rooms, only hygiene products were changed on time.  Guests who lived there for about two weeks note that cleaning was done only twice.  Often guests took out the trash on their own. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes there are reviews that the theft of the villa staff thrives in the hotel.  Guests claim that during the cleaning of the room, many lost part of the amount of money deposited in the suitcase. </p><p>  Some families note that the hostess of Villa Pinjatic (Montenegro) in Budva does not allow children of tourists to play on the playground with swings.  She protects the play area for one of her granddaughters. </p><p>  There are also positive reviews about the hotel.  For example, one of the couples wrote that she arrived at the hotel much earlier than the indicated time.  As a result, the hostess of the villa hastened and prepared a room in 40-50 minutes. </p><p>  Another guests note that in the evening the cottage is quiet and calm, so a romantic dinner on the terrace is sure to be remembered by lovers. </p><h2>  Is it worth the ride? </h2><p>  For budget travelers, consider this option.  The price of a ticket to Montenegro with accommodation in this villa is available to almost everyone who wants to relax abroad.  For minimal money you can get acquainted with the traditions and culture of this country. </p><p>  Travelers who calmly respond to economy class conditions will be quite pleased with the room conditions and service.  But if tourists go to rest with young children, then it is worth thinking about a hotel with at least three stars. </p><p>  Villa Pinjatic has one indisputable advantage - its location in a quiet area.  Guests can always relax in the evening in silence on the terrace with a glass of aromatic <span>Montenegrin wine.</span> </p>
