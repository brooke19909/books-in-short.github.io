Mountains covered with greenery and blue waves - all this is one of the most beautiful cities in Russia, which does not descend from the TV screens.  Interesting places in Sochi can be described endlessly because they simply can not be counted. </p><p>  This unique city combines relic groves, tea plantations, picturesque waterfalls, as well as museums and protected areas.  We will try to describe in this article the most interesting places in Sochi. </p><h2>  Mount Akhun </h2><p>  Amazing beauty opens when you look at the city and its surroundings from a bird's eye view.  <span>Mount Akhun is</span> best suited for this <span>.</span>  How to get to this picturesque place will be described below.  If you look at the green ridge from the side of the city of Sochi, then an association with the volcano may occur, but it will be erroneous.  This is an anticline, which was formed from calcareous rocks and sandstones of the Matsesta and Khosta river valleys.  The mountain <span>rivers Khosta</span> and Agur continued along their depressions. </p>

    <h2>  Picturesque places </h2><p>  Matsesta springs rich in hydrogen sulfide are especially appreciated, the healing properties of which are famous for the Sochi resort.  In the place where the Agura River leaves the gorge, there are similar healing springs.  Of the mountain <span>attractions of Sochi, the</span> most interesting is Mount Akhun.  How to get to its very top?  You can do this in several ways: by car, by bus or on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The flora of Mount Akhun is very diverse.  From the southern slopes in the sun there is an oak forest (ash and linden trees are found in the lowlands).  The shady north side is covered with beech (in some places there is an undergrowth in which laurel cherry and hazel grow).  The mountain looks different from this, depending on where in the city you look at it: either a green ridge or a regular cone that crowns the surrounding low mountains. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The origin of the name is a secret hidden from us for centuries, so there are several options.  Previously, the mountain tribes had the god Akhun, who was worshiped by herders during pagan times.  And in the Abkhaz language there is the word ‚Äúakhu‚Äù - ‚Äúhill, hill‚Äù, and the ending ‚Äún‚Äù indicates the plural form.  That is why in the mountain range there are peaks called Big Akhun and Small Akhun.  Especially interesting for travelers is Mount Akhun, which rises 663 meters above sea level.  It is not far from the city - only at a distance of 20 kilometers.  And for the convenience of tourists, an eleven-kilometer road has been laid, which is curled up by a serpentine and crowned with an observation tower. </p>

    <p>  By car, it is best to go from the center of Sochi.  On Kurortny Prospect, you need to go to the Khostinsky district.  When turning on the Matsesta, you need to turn right, cross the bridge.  There will be signs along the road.  By bus you can only get to Maly Akhun Mountain.  Big Akhun should be reached on foot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Singing Fountains </h2><p>  The most beautiful attraction is considered to be the singing fountains - Sochi is famous for such entertainments.  This is truly a magnificent sight when, with the onset of evening, lights envelop a fiery bird, and the dance of water and music begins. </p><p>  This is the legacy of the Olympics.  When the holiday season begins, the show takes place every evening in the <span>Olympic Park.</span>  Now the singing fountains are the hallmark of the city. </p>

    <p>  The fountain is represented by a large bowl (diameter 75 m), which the bird hugs.  Hence the name - ‚ÄúOlympic Fire Bowl‚Äù.  The construction of this facility was specially dedicated to the opening and closing ceremonies of the Sochi Olympic Games. </p><p>  264 fountains make up this complex, and for each individual lighting is provided.  The magic "bird" comes to life under the influence of the control panel. </p><h2>  Real fairy tale </h2><p>  Some interesting places in Sochi can be visited several times a day.  The impression of them will be completely different.  With the onset of the evening, the park of singing fountains is the embodiment of a fairy tale.  Illuminated jets soar into the sky like fireworks.  And the fog that forms above the surface of the water brings a mysterious atmosphere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

The park was founded by a well-known businessman, an honorary citizen of Yegoryevsk, Vasily Alekseevich Khludov, and now this place is one of the most popular among spa residents.  The park is located in the very center of the city, on the coast of the Sochi River.  This place is just created for those who want to enjoy the most delicious kebabs and fried red mullet. </p>

    <p>  Riviera Park is the best place to relax.  In this park, anyone will find something to their taste: educational places - from cinemas, exhibition halls, a dolphinarium and a penguinarium to the library, as well as corners of romance - a reconciliation bench and a fountain of love.  The Green Theater hosts various concerts and shows.

    <p>  The highest mountain is the canyon keeper waterfall.  Women who dream of becoming mothers must definitely visit the Bowl of Rose waterfall, which has magical effects. </p><p>  The most unstable of all - the tandem waterfall.  During the spill of the river feeding it, it is divided into two full-flowing streams.  Its waters are healing: if you take a shower under a stream of waterfall for 40 minutes, the healing effect will be equal to several hydromassage sessions. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe Grotto of Love and Separation‚Äù fully justifies its name: in it you can meet couples in love, taking the first step into the land of love, and people with a broken heart - it has a magical, healing effect on them.  This atmosphere heals the soul and energizes.  Be sure to look at the waterfalls in Sochi.  A tour is the best option to not only see all the waterfalls, but also learn a lot of interesting things about these places. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Olympic Village </h2><p>  In order to see all the beauty of the Black Sea coast, you should go on vacation in Sochi.  The Olympic village is ready to receive guests almost all year round.  This hotel complex was built near the Olympic Park.  This is a comfortable resort with 47 buildings that occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äã72 hectares and are ready to accommodate 3,000 vacationers. </p>

    <p>  The Olympic village consists of recreational complexes and walking areas, landscapes and views of which delight tourists.  Respectable restaurants, cafes and places of relaxation are provided, special attention is paid to the issue of comfort of people with disabilities. </p><h2>  What is the success of the Olympic Village? </h2><p>  Interesting places in Sochi are not only natural attractions and entertainment.  There are still places saturated with a certain atmosphere.  Of particular interest is the concept itself: the goal of the designers was to unravel the mystery of the soul of the Russian people and to present as much as possible the things and phenomena that are traditional for Russia.  All this was presented in the form of a synthesis of the latest technology and classics. </p><p>  On the territory of the Olympic Village, the official mascots of the Sochi Olympics in 2014 settled permanently: the modest Bunny, the purposeful Leopard and the good-natured White Bear.  Residential complex "Olympic Village" is waiting for its guests from all over the world at any time. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in one article it is impossible to describe all the interesting places in Sochi that are worth seeing.  But to get acquainted with the city this will be enough. </p>
