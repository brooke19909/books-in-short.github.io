At the same time, he is an official legal entity that has long and successfully worked in the Russian financial market.  In this regard, you can trust the company, despite the fact that it is kind of virtual.  Yes, and the reviews about Tinkoff Bank from many customers are so good that it is somehow strange not to trust the company ... But sometimes there are completely opposite, angry and indignant ones.  They are also not so few.  Who to believe?  In order to understand this, you need to understand the essence of the claims. </p><p>  <strong>Why do they like Tinkoff Bank?</strong>  <strong>Reasoning Supporters</strong> </p>

Most often these are two types of borrowers.  The first - those who calculated everything in advance, agreed to receive a card on the stated conditions and is calm about them.  The second - those who, on the contrary, do not like to count or do not know how.  The main thing is to get a loan, and how and how many years to pay, they absolutely do not care.

    <p>  Those whose reviews about Tinkoff Bank are exceptionally positive are guided by the following factors: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - simplicity of obtaining a card - in the sense that approval is much easier to achieve than in many other organizations; </p><p>  - 55 days without interest; </p><p>  - small minimum payment; </p><p>  - the ability to take money again and again; </p><p>  - non-intrusiveness of the bank (while payments are made on time or even in advance). </p><p>  Investors are also satisfied: today the company has established itself well, is considered reliable and regularly pays interest, which is quite high by modern standards. </p><p>  In the light of all the above, reviews about Tinkoff Bank can be positive, and there is nothing strange in this even for those who do not share the opinions of its admirers at all.  But probably not everything is so smooth, since there are so many discontented people?  Are there any negative aspects? </p><p>  Probably everyone knows that there are also bad reviews about Tinkoff Bank.  Everyone is interested in what it is connected with.  I must say that regarding <span>insurance, deposits</span> and <span>debit cards,</span> claims are extremely rare, they are difficult to even find.  The main part is credits, in this case cards.  We give a few examples that are most common, and dwell on how objective each of them is. </p>

The usual rate is 36%, but in reality about 48% comes out, and even a little more.  Here you need to understand that the reason is the money for insurance.  There is also an SMS banking fee.  That is why the amount is increasing.  All such charges are in the table, which can be viewed on the site.

But it was prescribed in advance.  Moreover, this is normal for most banks, and Tinkoff at least provides an extract.  From it you can understand where the money went, and you do not need to order it on purpose. </p>

    <ol><li>  Instead of the promised ‚Äú5 minutes to review the application,‚Äù the borrower receives ... up to a month.  Often a call comes from the bank when no one thinks to wait. </li><li>  After this, you can still wait more than one week for the courier to have a free hour for card delivery. </li><li>  55 days are automatically canceled if you withdraw cash (almost all banks sin with this).  They will not warn about this even in the contract. </li><li>  Calls for payment must be received one week in advance. </li></ol><p>  The conclusion is simple: in order not to write bad reviews about Tinkoff Bank subsequently, you should carefully treat the contract, the numbers, and also take into account what is written in the list above.  Are you ready for this?  It suits you?  If not, then find another suggestion.  If so, take a card and remember the flaws. </p>
