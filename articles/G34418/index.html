    <p>  Just think - this street is four hundred years old!  She remembers Catherine the Second and other Russian emperors, at one time Pushkin and Dumas wandered about her, Chaliapin was born and grew up here, to whom grateful descendants erected a monument on Bauman.  By the way, something also reminds of the great Empress Catherine, namely, a chic iron carriage.  Probably, the queen once came to Kazan, and now young Kazan gentlemen bring their beautiful ladies here.  For photo shoots, and just like that - plunge into the past. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another interesting object on Broadway's local spill is the Arabic-style watch.  This is the most popular place where Kazan residents date each other.  And at the fountain from the fairy tale ‚ÄúVodyanaya,‚Äù mothers and their children like to gather. </p><p>  Bauman street will be pleased with admirers of architecture.  On both of its "shores" - a lot of attractions of such a plan.  This is the ancient hotel "Kazan", and the Epiphany Cathedral, and theaters and much, much more.

    <h2>  Old Tatar settlement - the soul of Kazan </h2><p>  The soul of any city is that place where traditions of its native inhabitants are carefully kept;  where, like the apple of an eye, they protect the culture and honor history.  Such a place in the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan is the Old Tatar settlement.  And those who have thought what to see in Kazan in 2 days should definitely add this object to their route. </p><p>  When Kazan was conquered by Ivan the Terrible, it was here that the Tatars were allowed to settle.  They settled down and for many centuries passed on from generation to generation the traditions, rites and customs of their people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to feel the spirit of ancient Kazan, to be imbued with its ‚Äúmood‚Äù, you need to at least walk around the settlement.  And those who look into <span>the Mardjani Mosque</span> will receive an even more complete impression. </p><h2>  "Home village" </h2><p>  So, Her Majesty Kazan: where to visit, what to see, in addition to the already listed?

This is a specially created complex of entertaining and informative nature in the city center, where curious tourists can get acquainted with the peculiarities of the Tatars. </p><p>  The buildings here look like they looked many centuries ago: carts ride through the streets, and <span>windmills</span> carry on their ‚Äúwings‚Äù to the distant past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in kazan in 1 2 days" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/982634.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  City parks </h2><p>  But what is attractive in the warm season of Kazan?  What to see in 2 days in summer or spring? </p><p>  If the weather is good, then the program of the first day in the capital of Tatarstan can include visits to parks or at least one of them.  The choice is not very wide, but there is something interesting. </p><p>  For example, Uritsky Park is famous for its bridges;  conquers with national color the Millennium Park, which is not on the shore of <span>Lake Kaban;</span>  also will appeal to the tourist TsPKiO and the Birch Grove park. </p><h2>  Raifa - the abode of purity and inspiration </h2><p>  If you managed to escape to Kazan for 2.5 days, what should you definitely see?  In this case, it is advisable to set aside one day for visiting suburban attractions.  For example, the Raifa monastery, which is the most important Orthodox shrine.  The monastery is located on the territory of the Volga-Kama Reserve, on the lake.

    <h2>  Ecumenical temple </h2><p>  You can get by car to the Ecumenical Church, which is located in a village called Old Arakchino.  This is another recommendation for those who are considering the question of what to see in Kazan in 2 days. </p><p>  The temple sheltered seven world religions under its roof, so it can be called a memorial of reconciliation.  Believers from different cities and countries come here to honor their shrines and get acquainted with the basics of other faiths. </p><h2>  Sviyazhsk and Bulgar - greetings from antiquity </h2><p>  According to reviews, the centers of ancient culture - Bolgar and Sviyazhsk - are very popular among tourists.

Here is the oldest church in Tatarstan - the Trinity, and will also delight the hearts of the Orthodox Cathedral of the Assumption. </p><p>  Bulgarians also have something to surprise travelers.  This is a city-reserve where tourists can walk directly along the streets of the Middle Ages, excavated by archaeologists.  The most beautiful building of the Bulgar is the Cathedral Mosque. </p><h2>  "Children's" Kazan </h2><p>  So, for an adult tourist in the capital of Tatarstan and its environs there is where to ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù.  But what to see in Kazan for 2-3 days with children?  For younger guests, as evidenced by the reviews, there is also a lot of experience here. </p><p>  Firstly, if a child is not quite a kid, then almost all of the above places will be interesting to him too.  Secondly, Kazan is full of objects designed exclusively for children. </p><p>  This is also the House of entertaining science and technology, where all sorts of different miracles take place;  and the <span>Museum of Natural History of Tatarstan</span> with its dinosaurs, mammoths and the remains of saber-toothed tigers;  and the Millennium Museum of Kazan, crammed full of antiques ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in Kazan for 2 days of sightseeing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/982635.jpg" width="600"></div>
