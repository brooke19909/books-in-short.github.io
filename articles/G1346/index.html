    <h2>  Province </h2><p>  This term refers to the highest <span>unit of administrative-territorial division.</span>  This concept appeared in the Petrine era, during the organization of an absolute state.  There is no difference between such concepts as ‚Äúprovince‚Äù and ‚Äúregion‚Äù.  But in 1929 the first came out of use, and the second came in its place. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Voronezh province was created in 1725.  It included five provinces.  Since 1767, four.  Previously, this province was called Azov.  In 1779, as a result of Catherine‚Äôs reform, the Voronezh region was divided into two separate governorates.  Then, under Paul I, again transformed into a separate administrative unit. </p><p>  Voronezh province existed until 1928.  Subsequently, it became part of the Central Black Earth Region.  Its center was Voronezh.  The Central Black Earth region also included the Tambov and <span>Orel provinces.</span>  Voronezh province bordered on the first in the southeast.  From Oryol - in the west.  Other provinces with which it bordered, are Kursk, Tambov, Kharkov and Don Cossacks.  Voronezh region was formed in the thirties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Provinces </h2><p>  In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Voronezh province consisted of four provinces.  The composition of cities in each of them has also changed over two hundred years.  Provinces that were part of this province: </p><ol><li>  Voronezh. </li><li>  Yelets. </li><li>  Tambov. </li><li>  Shatskaya. </li></ol><p>  In 1775, the provinces were abolished.

Their name is not always original.  Only sat under the name "Red" in one of the provinces of the Voronezh province there were four. </p>

    <h2>  Counties </h2><p>  By this word is understood the lower administrative units in the Russian Empire.  With the abolition of the provinces there were no more districts.  In 1779, the Voronezh province consisted of fifteen administrative divisions.  Among them - Voronezh, Pavlovsky, Zadonsky counties.  Their composition has changed several times.  Counties of the Voronezh province since 1825: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Biryuchensky. </li><li>  Bogucharsky. </li><li>  Bobrovsky. </li><li>  Valuysky. </li><li>  Zadonsky. </li><li>  Voronezh. </li><li>  Nizhnedevitsky. </li><li>  Ostrogozhsky. </li><li>  Zemlyansky. </li><li>  Novohopersky. </li><li>  Korotoyaksky. </li><li>  Pavlovsky. </li></ol><p>  Until 1727, the provinces were divided into districts.

But the administrative center remained the same. </p><p>  The history of Voronezh is associated with a change in the composition of the province.  It should be mentioned several important events in the period 1709-1929. </p>

    <h2>  Voronezh </h2><p>  Since 1709, this city was part of the Azov province.  Six years later, Voronezh became the center of the province.  And in 1725 she was named for this city.  In the second half of the eighteenth century, an educational institution, a pharmacy, a hospital, and a house for the disabled were opened in Voronezh. </p><p>  As you know, in this era, urban buildings were mostly wooden.  And therefore, fires often happened.  After one of them, by decree of the empress, the construction of Voronezh began according to a new plan.  Under Vasily Chertkov, who was appointed governor since 1782, a complete redevelopment of the city was carried out.  The history of Voronezh at the beginning of the nineteenth century is connected with the development of cultural life.  A theater was opened, and regular publication of newspapers began. </p><p>  In 1905, riots began in Voronezh, like other cities in Russia.  One day even martial law was declared. </p><p>  In 1926, a long-distance telephone connection was made in Voronezh and the first tram line was opened.  Since 1934, the city became the administrative center of the Voronezh region. </p><p>  In the twenties in the province, as well as throughout the country, the process of forming new administrative-territorial units took place.  Namely - village councils, which, in turn, were formed around government bodies with the corresponding name.  Their number in the last year of the existence of the Voronezh province reached 1147 units. </p>
