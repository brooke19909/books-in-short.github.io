The service here is also at a high level - maids, waiters and administrators are always polite and ready to help.  Some of them speak Russian and English, so there will be no problems with communication. </p><p>  The beach can be reached in just a few minutes.  And at the tour desk you can always find out about the most popular and interesting routes. </p><p>  Of course, many travelers are interested in questions about how much it will cost to stay at the Grand Resort Hurghada 5. The price, of course, depends on many factors, including the category of the room, the price policy of the travel agency, etc. Nevertheless, an average of ten days at the hotel costs from 30 to 38 thousand rubles, which, you see, is not so much, given the living conditions and the services offered. </p>
