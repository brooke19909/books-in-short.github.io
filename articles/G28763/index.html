  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a tariff?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article we will familiarize ourselves with the concept of tariff.  This is a term that will be considered from a general point of view and in various fields of human activity, in particular in the field of services and insurance.  We will also study its relationship with customs services operating in the territory of the Russian Federation, and in general.  Sometimes you can find the word "dachshund", which is the second designation of the term in question. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Rates - these are certain rates or their system, designed to pay for a variety of production and non-production services provided by a company, organization, company, institution.  The category of tariffs also includes a system designed to pay by applying rates.  A customs tariff is a rate applicable to the import and export of goods or services at the international level in the field of trade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vuljespaarpot.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff is" class="if uuid-2263604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263604.jpg"></div><p>  As a lexical unit of the Russian language, the term ‚Äútariff‚Äù began to be used more than two hundred years ago, and its first mention was found in the Maritime Charter of 1724. This word came from German or French, but these countries also borrowed it.  Initially, the term was created by the Arabs, and it denoted various duties, messages to the people of the country or settlement, announcements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Insurance and Rates </h2><p>  Insurance rates are a form of insurance premium payment taken from the unit of the insured amount.  At the same time, the volume of insurance and its risk profile are taken into account.  The establishment, as a rule, takes place in percentage (%) and correlates with the insured amount.  The tariff system of this type provides for the concept of a range of <span>rates, a system of</span> discounts and odds.  The calculation is made using a number of actuarial calculations. </p><p>  Insurance rates are special payments determined in accordance with legislative acts approved by the supreme government.  An example would be a law requiring compulsory vehicle insurance by civilians.  In the case of voluntary insurance, the insurer may establish obligations on his own.  Setting such tariffs can be done by applying: </p><ul><li>  units of the insurance amount; </li><li>  percent correlated with the sum insured. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.remodeling.hw.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance rates are" class="if uuid-2263605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263605.jpg"></div><h2>  The principles of tariff policy </h2><p>  The tariff is a system designed to regulate various relationships in the state structure.  The means of its implementation is the national and international currency.  Tariffs are built in accordance with certain principles: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  It is necessary to ensure self-sufficiency and profitability of the insurance operation. </li><li>  It is important to observe the equivalence of the relationship of the parties in the insurance issue.  In other words, the rate should be related to the probability of damage.  This allows for the repayment of insurance funds of the fund responsible for the provision of such services. </li><li>  It is important that the tariff is available to various circles of policyholders.  The presence of high rates will hinder the process of "evolution" of the insurance industry. </li><li>  It is necessary that the bet amount remains stable over long periods of time.  Keeping the tariff unchanged will allow the insured to strengthen his confidence in the insurer and make sure of his solidarity. </li><li>  If the current rate allows you to expand the scope of insurance liability, then you should use this. </li></ol><p>  An insurance rate is a rate that is also called a gross rate.  Its calculation is based on 2 components, namely the net rate and the load applicable to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marctomarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tariffs for services are" class="if uuid-2263607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263607.jpg"></div><h2>  General Insurance Information </h2><p>  The concept of insurance tariff refers to averaged values, and therefore it can have a significant set of deviations from the average value.  Compensation for such discrepancies or deviations from the norm is carried out by using the concept of a guarantee premium, the second name of which is stabilization.  Insurance of risk situations and life itself includes many features in accordance with which the tariff is built.  If the question is about the life of the subject, then the net rate will be determined based on data from the mortality tables.  Such reports summarize an increase in age at which mortality increases, which depends on the generation of subjects and various internal and external factors.  High-risk situations are based on probability theory.  Health insurance and its rate are established by analyzing data on the incidence rate.  The average cost of treating a particular disease is also taken into account. </p><p>  Rates of insurance premiums are payments that should not exceed the percentage of income, which can burden the insured.  Otherwise, it will become a disadvantageous enterprise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-part tariff is" class="if uuid-2263606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263606.jpg"></div><h2>  Customs and tariff </h2><p>  Customs tariffs are a special tool of state power, which allows regulating and directing the activities of the customs policy.  This is extremely important for the economic development of any country.  This tool is used to implement political trade, which is a common set and list of all rates that are included in the customs duty of taxable goods.  Customs tariffs are divided into two types: import and export. </p><p>  There are two forms: </p><ul><li>  simple (indicates the common tariff for all countries with the application of a single rate on customs duty); </li><li>  difficult (the establishment depends on the country). </li></ul><p>  Customs nomenclature is usually referred to as a list of products with all types and names of goods. </p><h2>  Customs rate in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  On the territory of the Russian Federation, until 2010, the customs rate was applied, introduced by a government decree of November 26, 2006. The data on it was order No. 718, but at present it is not valid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nydailynews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="customs tariff is" class="if uuid-2263603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263603.jpg"></div><p>  01/01/2010 - the date on which decisions in accordance with the provisions of the EurAsEC Interstate Council on: </p><ul><li>  unified commodity nomenclature applicable within the customs union <span>(HS FEA</span> CU); </li><li>  common customs tariff of the vehicle. </li></ul><p>  In other words, from the beginning of 2010, the Unified Customs Tariff of the Customs Union entered into force on the territory of the Russian Federation.  The previous customs tariff of Russia ceased to exist. </p><h2>  Services sector </h2><p>  The tariff for services is a betting system in accordance with which various enterprises operating in the field of the provision and implementation of services fulfill the requests and wishes of consumers (customers).  Executive authorities are responsible for the regulation of the value of the implementation of various services that provide the population of certain territories.  Wholesale production tariffs have free prices (the cost is assigned only in accordance with the decision of the manufacturer or importer).  The regulation of production services is affected by the law, directly, only on the issue of rail transport or communications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motionmaker.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance premium ariths is" class="if uuid-2263608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2263608.jpg"></div><h2>  Annual fee and amount </h2><p>  A two-part tariff is the sum of two components: annual payment for a specific unit (for example, Kcal (or Gcal) / h) and payments for a quantitative amount of heat energy allocated to a consumer. </p><p>  The definition of a two-part tariff includes accounting and the division of all costs included in the cost of the mechanism for the provision of services, such as heat.  Allocate a conditionally constant and conditionally variable form of costs. </p>
