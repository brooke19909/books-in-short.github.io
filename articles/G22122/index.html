Among the most unique and most visited architectural monuments by tourists is the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.  It should be noted that thanks to this shrine, Barcelona is one of the most popular provincial cities in the country.  The majestic walls and towers of the Sagrada Familia cannot be confused with other buildings and structures of the world.  The general overview captivates and captivates the fantasy world with its extraordinary beauty. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Family Cathedral in Barcelona" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/177933.jpg" width="375"></div><br>  The walls of the building, intricately woven into the original lace patterns, do not give the impression of a stone-built structure.  The ancient Sagrada Familia in Barcelona is a creation of true artists, created on the basis of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa talented architect.  A huge amount of exquisite details, combined into a single work of art, is a characteristic feature of this architectural monument.  It is considered one of the most original buildings of past centuries in the world, which Barcelona is rightly proud of.  The Holy Family Cathedral today has firmly taken an authoritative place among the sights of Europe.  The first stones were laid in the 19th century (1882), after which the construction process was slowed down.  Currently, this building is considered completed. <br><br>  The first developer of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona project was the famous nineteenth-century architect Francisco del Villar.  However, for some reason, he stepped back from the implementation of the construction program and transferred the initiative into the hands of Antonio Gaudi, who willingly got down to business in 1883 and created incredible stone masterpieces.  It is to him that the townspeople owe the arrangement of their city in the 19th century.  Thanks to this architect, Barcelona has acquired unique features that distinguish it from other cities.  Tourists still admire intricate sculptures, buildings, which are realized projects of Gaudi.  He also picked up an unexpected, unusual, but incredibly attractive and catchy design for the Sagrada Familia. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona Cathedral of the Holy Family" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/177939.jpg" width="375"></div><br>  Initially, it was planned to create a temple with the configuration of a cross, as evangelical symbols it was supposed to use decorative ornaments, sculptures and patterns, and towers in the amount of eighteen pieces were to surround the main building.  Unfortunately, the tragic incident that claimed the life of the great architect did not allow him to complete the work he had begun (Antonio died in 1926, being under the wheels of a tram).  The unfinished Sagrada Familia in Barcelona remained an unfinished project.  Only one facade is a completed work of architectural art. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Barcelona Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/177934.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Created by Gaudi, the ‚ÄúFacade of the Nativity‚Äù strikes with incredible beauty, grandeur and sophistication.  He has no analogues in the whole state.  Despite all the efforts of the students of the great master, they were not able to continue the construction in the same style in which it was started.  It is not necessary to have a special education and excellent knowledge of architecture in order to distinguish the hand of a master from the work of other architects.  And yet this is the best creation that Spain owns.  Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhose attractions are riveting tourists, is proud of its history.  You can visit the cathedral from 9:00 to 20:00 from April to September and from 9:00 to 18:00 from October to March.
