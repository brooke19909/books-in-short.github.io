    <h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  This hotel is located near the town of Vagator, 17 km from Panaji (the capital of Goa) and 7 km from Mapusa.  The climate in this part of India is tropical, with very warm winters and hot summers.  The nature in the vicinity of Panaji and Vagator, according to most tourists, is simply magnificent.  The plains and hills in this area are completely covered with magnificent tropical vegetation.  The city of Vagator is located not directly on the coast, but a few kilometers from it.  However, getting to the beach by taxi from the hotel usually does not take long - no more than 5 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest airport to Vagator is an hour's drive (41 km) - near the village of Dabolim.  Russian tourists from Moscow usually fly here.  It is difficult to get to Vagator by public transport, since you have to make many transfers.  It is easier to get to this city by taxi.  But it is best to book a transfer at The Royale Assagao Resort 3 * hotel itself.  True, you will have to pay for it separately. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the suburbs of Vagator, 2 km from its center - in the village of Assagao.  His exact address: Assagao, Bardez, Goa - 403507, India. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Breakfast at The Royale Assagao Resort 3 * hotel is included in the price.  However, according to tourists, the food here is not too good.  For breakfast, most guests take only tea or coffee with milk.  You can, of course, order one of the dishes offered by the local dining room.  However, all of them, according to Russian vacationers, are too sharp and are designed mainly for Indians, who often rent apartments in this hotel. </p><p>  There is a restaurant on site.  But here it is also unlikely to have a good lunch or dinner.  According to many tourists, the dishes in this restaurant are completely tasteless.  In addition, they are very expensive.  Most vacationers who have ever rented rooms at this hotel are advised not to eat on its territory, but on some of the local beaches.  In a cafe by the sea, vacationers are offered many dishes for every taste and at not too high cost. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this hotel is not located by the sea.  Buses to the coast from the village of Assagao do not go.  Therefore, guests of The Royale Assagao Resort 3 * hotel get to the beach by taxi.  Carriers are guarding vacationers right at the fence of the hotel.  And consequently, problems with hiring a taxi for residents of the hotel in any case can not arise.  A trip to the sea is about 250 rupees.  If desired, hotel guests have the opportunity to sunbathe on the beaches: </p><ul><li><p>  Vagator and Anjuna (4.5 km from the hotel); </p></li><li><p>  Baga (5.5 km); </p></li><li><p>  Kalungute (6 km); </p></li><li><p>  Arambol (20 km). </p></li></ul><p>  Anjuna beach, according to most tourists who have ever vacationed at The Royale Assagao Resort 3 *, is better for young people than for families.  Here, parties are often held with dancing and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãalcohol. </p><p>  Calangute Beach is the most popular in Goa.  There are usually a lot of people sunbathing, and sun loungers are close to each other.  The infrastructure on this beach is very well developed.  Tourists can purchase anything from food to souvenirs, beach items and goods on the go. </p><p>  Baga Beach is located in a picturesque place surrounded by cliffs.  The coastline here is very wide and covered with soft sand of beige hue.  There are fewer people on this beach than on Calangute.  You can come here as a family. </p><p>  Arambol beach, like Anjuna, is better for young people.  Here very often informals of all stripes gather.  Tourists who come to India on a package tour are rarely on this beach.  Mostly here savages rest, renting a house in Goa for a long time. </p><p>  Vagator beach is popular mainly not among tourists, but among lovers of modern music.  Young people come here from all over the world.  This beach still retains the atmosphere of the hippies of the 60-70s, once massively living in northern Goa.  It is here that is the closest to get from The Royale Assagao Resort 3 * hotel.  Vagator is the only beach in northern Goa where you can sunbathe, including topless.  Elsewhere on the coast, this is considered unacceptable. </p>

    <h2>  What else to do </h2><p>  India is an ancient country, and there are many interesting places worth visiting by tourists.
