Some people proudly claim that they have nothing to do with the ‚Äúone-eyed gangster‚Äù, but they are still looking for television programs from the air on the Internet, thereby indirectly spending their time on television.  However, not everyone has this wonderful device that allows you to view any corner of the globe.  Someone threw the source of television broadcasting out of their home a long time ago, someone is not able to buy a new device, and someone just does not want to go the easy way and purchase a TV in the store.  Here is just the last category of people that this article can be very useful in which it tells about different ways of creating a TV with your own hands from an LCD monitor without a TV tuner.  It only seems that such operations require large financial costs, time and effort.  In reality, everything is much simpler.  You just need to be careful and do everything carefully.  Our article is equipped with a large number of self-made photo televisions, which will give a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe process, as well as serve as instructions for action. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Video output connector" class="if uuid-3198116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198116.jpg"></div><h2>  TV </h2><p>  Progress is relentless, and more and more people prefer modern entertainment, moving away from reading or spending time in the fresh air.  The TV still keeps up to date, without losing relevance and firmly holding the position of one of the most popular entertainment, both among the elderly and among the younger generation.  This ‚Äúone-eyed bandit‚Äù is so necessary for humanity that more and more people who for one reason or another do not have it, are wondering how to make a TV on the wall with their own hands.  There are many ways to implement this seemingly difficult task, as well as a large number of different authoring methods.  Each master introduces something special in seemingly standard circuits, either simplifying or complicating the process of connecting devices to each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Connected monitor" class="if uuid-3198115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198115.jpg"></div><h2>  What for? </h2><p>  Each person reading this article, probably already wonders with a question about who and for what purposes in general may need to make a TV from a monitor with their own hands.  After all, the era of deficit has irrevocably gone, in any city there are at least a dozen stores selling all kinds of electronics for every color and taste.  Why torment and make great efforts to make one of two good individually separate things, and even of dubious quality? </p><p>  There are several fairly logical answers to such questions. </p><p>  First off, it's just interesting.  Despite the fact that the need to do something with our own hands has disappeared in our time, there are still many people who are nostalgic for the times of the Soviet Union, when we had to solder, tin and saw out almost everything from electric guitars to speakers.  There is a bag with details, there is a set of tools.  All further think and do it yourself. </p><p>  Secondly, not everyone has the opportunity to purchase a new expensive monitor to watch TV shows.  But in the pantry, perhaps, lies an old computer screen and several boards that will make it possible to make a pretty good TV with your own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Soldering board" class="if uuid-3198119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198119.jpg"></div><p>  Thirdly, such operations significantly develop the brain and help simply kill time with benefit.  The result is obvious: an interesting homemade work is hanging in the garage, and time spent with interest, and I kind of found out something for myself, and even got a lot of pleasure from the work! </p><h2>  Ways </h2><p>  There are many different methods for making a TV on a wall with your own hands.  Part of these methods is quite simple and consists only in the use of all sorts of adapters or plugs that make it easy to connect devices to each other and enjoy the result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Selection menu" class="if uuid-3198120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198120.jpg"></div><p>  Other methods relate directly to physical work, since they can not do without soldering wires, installing sockets and configuring the remote control.  It should also be remembered that with absolutely any method of connecting the monitor to the device necessary to gain access to television broadcasts, it will need to be additionally configured using the PC internal menu or BIOS settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Program setting" class="if uuid-3198123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198123.jpg"></div><h2>  LCD monitor </h2><p>  Modern man is increasingly feeling himself part of the future, part of constantly moving progress, so those things that until recently seemed to him to be new and a ‚Äúmiracle of technology‚Äù today no longer have any meaning.  This fate befell vinyl records, floppy disks, CDs and DVDs.  And now the time has come and desktop computers.  And this is not surprising.  Who needs old bulky personal computers when so many different companies produce ultranovye, thin and light laptops, tablets and smartphones with wide screens, as well as laptops and netbooks. </p><p>  Most advanced users have long become part of the "mobile community", moving from computers to new and modern gadgets.  However, given the mentality of the common people, it is safe to say that the old PCs were not only mercilessly thrown into the trash, but most likely they were carefully cleaned, packed, and are now stored in pantries. </p><p>  From the old monitor you can make an excellent TV with your own hands, which, if you perform all the necessary work efficiently, can last for many years. </p><p>  However, before you start creating a new device from several old ones, you need to purchase a few more details: </p><ul><li>  television tuner; </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Black tuner" class="if uuid-3198117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198117.jpg"></div><ul><li>  a splitter, as well as a cord for connecting multi-channel digital television; </li><li>  an antenna; </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Antenna and wires" class="if uuid-3198111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198111.jpg"></div><ul><li>  cable for mounting the antenna. </li></ul><p>  After acquiring all of the above parts, you just need to connect all the devices together.  Since the connectors in them are different, it is simply impossible to make a mistake during installation.  If the TV does not turn on, do-it-yourself repairs will be much cheaper and simpler, since spare parts for the computer are much easier to find on sale than outdated mechanisms for the camera.  It will also significantly affect the popularity of the home-made device among the poor. </p><h2>  TV tuner </h2><p>  A television tuner is required when creating an LCD TV with your own hands, since it has excellent sound characteristics that are quite capable of providing decent sound for the future unit.  Of course, the monitor speakers can not boast of a reference studio sound, but it is quite possible to watch movies on them.  You can also listen to music and even run karaoke programs.  But what if the owner of the device is an avid music lover?  Well, in this case, you can simply purchase additional sources of high-quality sound like a soundbar or speakers from a home theater. </p><h2>  TV set-top box </h2><p>  Connecting a monitor to a do-it-yourself TV through a set-top box is also a good way to set up broadcasting at home and watch your favorite shows.  This method is relatively simple: you just need to connect the monitor to the set-top box using a special adapter - and that‚Äôs all, you can turn on the new device and enjoy the television broadcast. </p><h2>  Pay </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Board and circuitry" class="if uuid-3198118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198118.jpg"></div><p>  Working with wires, parts and boards usually requires great knowledge of electronics, however, in the case of modern monitors, the whole process is reduced to soldering the incoming contacts, which must be disconnected from the connection points with the computer wires and output to a device that provides a television signal.  Such a device can be a tuner or a special set-top box, giving access to the broadcast network. </p><h2>  Tv block </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Side" class="if uuid-3198121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198121.jpg"></div><p>  It is much easier to achieve the goal if all the details from the TV are available, and only the screen itself is missing.  In this case, you just need to disconnect the contacts coming out of the damaged monitor and solder them to the special wires in the computer screen.  You may need to install several additional devices to balance the voltage, however, in general, the process is not so laborious and even less expensive than creating a TV from scratch. </p><h2>  Network tuner </h2><p>  This device is usually used to provide the <span>future TV with a</span> stable connection to Internet broadcasting, which allows moviegoers to watch the programs and movies that they like and not depend on the standardized TV program grid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Wires inside pc" class="if uuid-3198114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198114.jpg"></div><h2>  CRT monitors </h2><p>  All those who started using computers in the era of their appearance remember the old ‚Äúhunchback‚Äù monitors with a convex screen.  Most masters, one way or another dealing with these technical devices, argue that CRT monitors are not suitable for creating a TV on their basis.  No, of course, you can do something, only because of the low production characteristics of the monitor, the image quality will be extremely low, and significant problems with the speed of the video clips can also occur. </p><h2>  Criteria </h2><p>  Before you start making your old TV with your own hands, you need to consider a solution for several important criteria.  On which depends the smoothness of the picture, image quality and color saturation of the frame.  These factors include: </p><ul><li>  signal response time; </li><li>  viewing angle (in most modern screens, it is extremely small; and if you do not observe the viewing angle, the image becomes cloudy or darkened); </li><li>  illumination of the room (sensitive sensors of computer displays require rather poor lighting in the room, otherwise the picture on the screen will look pale); </li><li>  the depth of dark tones (which, unfortunately, for personal computer monitors is extremely low and unable to convey the entire depth of black in the frame of a television movie); </li><li>  contrast level (significantly different for these two types of devices; failure to observe the correct contrast settings can cause great harm to the eye of the beholder). </li></ul><h2>  The advantages of homemade </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="TV image" class="if uuid-3198122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198122.jpg"></div><p>  The positive sides of this design include significant ease of manufacture, greater durability, as well as ease of use.  It is not difficult for an experienced user of a personal computer to master the operation of a self-made TV.  It should also be noted that the device will come out relatively cheap compared to real factory TVs.  The ‚Äúpluses" include the fact that the entire structure is assembled from parts already available in the house at no additional cost. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  However, not all masters who made a simple TV with their own hands are satisfied with their work.  And the thing is not that they did something poorly or carelessly, no.  The problem is the initial basic technical characteristics of a computer monitor.  This device was originally adapted to work with documentation, audio or video files, but not for watching television broadcasts.  The fact is that the monitor‚Äôs image playback speed is several times slower, which allows the eyes of the person working behind him to relax and not strain during the entire session.  All objects on the desktop or in user folders move much more slowly.  What can this lead to in the end?  Yes, at least to the fact that the image will freeze a lot, blink and not keep up with the soundtrack.  Also, rather large chunks of the previous one may remain in the new frame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Monitor as a TV" class="if uuid-3198124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3198124.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, many are attracted by the large resolution of the monitor screen, which is significantly higher than that of any of the conventional TVs, however, it should be remembered that the color depth of the computer screen is much lower, since it is still designed for office-working mode.  Therefore, those who want to make a TV out of the LCD monitor with their own hands should first of all prepare in advance for the relative ‚Äúpallor‚Äù of the video being watched. </p><p>  Also, a greater problem than the television technology, the signal response can become.  This leads not only to problems with contrasting color gamut of the image, but also to the possible constant interruption of the viewed movie or transmission, as the monitor is configured for slower processes. </p><p>  Many lovers of working with circuits and boards are repelled by the need to purchase separate adapters and adapters, in particular, for VGA connectors.  Although a simple TV with your own hands can be made without the use of such devices. </p>
