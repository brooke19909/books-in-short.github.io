  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How long is a credit card valid? What to do when it ends</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Credit cards are issued for a specified period.  After the expiration period they are subject to replacement.  The owner must know the validity of the credit card to prevent delays.  Card reissue is a procedure for replacing a payment instrument.  The service is issued upon request of the client or automatically. </p><h2>  What determines the validity period of a credit card? </h2><p>  Credit card conditions vary by bank and type of payment instrument.  The period refers to a category that the client cannot influence. </p><p>  The validity period of a credit card is affected by: </p><ul><li>  Frequency of use.  After 6-18 months of daily payment and cash withdrawal, the plastic carrier is damaged.  Most of the changes happen with the chip that protects the credit card data.  Scratches and microcracks can cause the card to malfunction. </li><li>  Accuracy of the owner.  If you constantly drop the card, carry it with a mobile phone or remove it too sharply from the card reader, it may be damaged before the end of the operation period. </li><li>  Type of credit card.  Until 2015, plastic carriers were not manufactured with protection in the form of a chip on the front side.  Because of this, they were more often subjected to hacking and deformation.  If the client has an old-style credit card, without a chip, the risk of damage ahead of time increases. </li><li>  Manufacturing defect.  In the case of poor-quality manufacturing of a means of payment, owners complain about the fast fading of the inscriptions and background (within 6 months after receipt), the deformation of the case and protective elements. </li></ul><p>  If one or more factors are present, the risk of premature wear increases to 50%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who sets the period for using a credit card? </h2><p>  Plastic cards are issued by the issuer - a banking organization.  The bank determines how long a credit card will be comfortable for customers and offers products with a limit of funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="garyny4.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card expiration date" class="if uuid-3235416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235416.jpg"></div><p>  The cardholder is not able to influence the standard terms of the product.  But the client has the right to reissue a credit card at any time.  If the credit card expires, he will receive a plastic carrier with a new period.  If there is a technical malfunction, reissue at Sberbank, Rosselkhozbank, VTB 24 is free. </p><h2>  How to find out about the validity period of a credit card?  All options </h2><p>  You can get information about the period of use of a plastic card in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Having studied the data on the front side. </li><li>  In documents. </li><li>  By phone contact line of the bank. </li><li>  On the official site. </li><li>  In self-service devices. </li><li>  Via online banking. </li><li>  In a mobile application. </li><li>  For a personal visit to the office. </li></ol><p>  Information is provided free of charge on the day of contact. </p><h2>  Where is the validity period of a bank card? </h2><p>  Information about the expiration date of a plastic carrier is not confidential.  It is located on the front side of the credit card - the bottom line in the center of the card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The media indicates the expiration of the credit card.  The information is presented in digital format "month / year".  The last month during which the customer has the opportunity to use a credit card is indicated.  After the end of the period, the card is blocked, but the account remains active. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.presstv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card expires" class="if uuid-3235572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235572.jpg"></div><p>  The agreement also indicates the conditions of the credit card: the validity period of the card and the end of the period.  In most large banks, for example, Sberbank, Tinkoff, VTB 24, the credit card is valid for 3 years.  It does not depend on the product, limit and account holder. </p><h2>  How to find out the term at an ATM? </h2><p>  In the self-service device, the client can get almost all the information about the credit card.  These are convenient as the machines operate around the clock. </p><p>  To find out the validity of a credit card, the owner must use the terminals of his bank.  In other devices, limited functionality is available: balance, expense, mobile payment. </p><p>  To find out when the credit card expires, you need to: </p><ul><li>  insert it into the card reader, enter the code; </li><li>  go to the section on bank cards and deposits; </li><li>  find a credit card account, click on the active line; </li><li>  View information or print a receipt. </li></ul><p>  Information on the credit card period is provided along with the number, full name  customer and contract details.  Banks do not charge a service fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Getting information with the help of bank employees </h2><p>  If the client cannot independently find out when to change the credit card, he can take a passport, a card and come to the bank branch.  The manager will print out the conditions of the card and will orient on the terms of replacement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loansindubai.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card expires sberbank" class="if uuid-3235575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235575.jpg"></div><p>  Customers of Tinkoff and other online banks can find out information by calling the support service.  You will need a passport, credit card and control data (indicated in the application).  Without data, operators will not be able to identify the subscriber.  Call for customers is free. </p><h2>  Online Credit Period Information </h2><p>  The issuer's website always contains information about all banking products, including credit cards.  The owner of the means of payment can get information about the terms of the credit card, the terms of the replacement and the benefits. </p><p>  In some banks (Sberbank, Tinkoff) customers can reissue online.  The bank‚Äôs website provides communication on credit cards.  But the standard conditions for all products are the same. </p><h2>  How to find out the period of using a credit card in online banking? </h2><p>  If a client is interested in information only on his card, he can use another online service - a personal account or online banking. </p><p>  To enter the online bank, login and password are used.  The method of obtaining data depends on who the issuer of the credit card is.  For example, in Sberbank, a client can obtain information for entering his personal account in terminals, and in the Moscow Industrial Bank, information is issued in an envelope upon receipt of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card expired" class="if uuid-3235573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235573.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out when Sberbank credit card expires: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the Internet bank using login and password.  The password for Sberbank customers comes via SMS from 900. </li><li>  Find a credit card in the list of bank cards.  It is displayed on the main page when you log in.  In addition, the "Cards" section is provided, you can go to it for information only on plastic products. </li><li>  See the term called credit cards.  The term "valid until 01/0002" is indicated in Sberbank, where: 01 is the month, 0002 is the year the term expires. </li></ol><p>  In the Internet Bank of other issuers, the principle of obtaining information is similar.  Sberbank's credit card is valid for 3 years and is not tied to the type of payment instrument. </p><h2>  Deadline information in the mobile application </h2><p>  The version for smartphones allows you to find out when to change the card, and is always at hand.  In Russia, Tinkoff, Sberbank and Alfa-Bank products are considered the best Internet applications among banks. </p><p>  To study the credit card term through the application, you need to download and install it.  Issuers do not charge a fee for the mobile version of Internet banking. </p><p>  The application information is divided into blocks, as in the full version.  To familiarize yourself with the conditions for a credit card, you need to go to the "Cards" section.  The validity period is located in the line under the name of the payment system. </p><h2>  What to do if the validity period expires? </h2><p>  The client has 3 options, what to do at the end of the credit card: </p><ol><li>  Close an account. </li><li>  Get a new card with a planned reissue. </li><li>  Make a reissue yourself and get a credit card with a new validity period. </li></ol><p>  Account closure does not automatically occur.  The client must contact the bank branch with a passport in order to terminate the loan agreement.  For online banking cards, the operation is performed through the contact center. </p><h2>  Reissue Features </h2><p>  Replacing a bank card with a new one with the same account is called reissue.  In the bank, the operation is performed in the presence of a plastic carrier.  If the credit card has expired, the client must contact the branch where he received it before.  A passport is required with you. </p><p>  The operation of issuing a card with a new validity period takes no more than 15 minutes.  The client signs the receipt of a credit card with a new term, puts a signature on the card (otherwise it may not be accepted at retail outlets). </p><div class="photo" data-original="dentalofficeinstitute.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card loan expiration date" class="if uuid-3235577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235577.jpg"></div><p>  Re-issuance is issued only to the owner of the credit card or its authorized representative.  When obtaining a credit card by a third party, a document confirming the rights of the representative is required.  This can be a bank or notarized power of attorney. </p><h2>  When to apply for a replacement plastic carrier? </h2><p>  A planned reissue does not require additional operations to change the term of the card by the client.  As soon as the credit card expires, the client receives a notification about the need to replace the card. </p><p>  In Sberbank, users are notified in 45 days that they will soon need to replace the plastic carrier.  Sberbank's credit card is 33 years old.  After the period, the client must take a passport and come to the office at the place of opening the credit card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiplinger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card expiration" class="if uuid-3235574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235574.jpg"></div><p>  From 2018, customers of the largest bank in the country can track through when Sberbank Online can track.  Opposite the credit card, which expires, a reissue notification will appear.  As soon as the card is delivered to the branch, the SMS from number 900 will be sent to the client. Sberbank Online will receive information about the credit card received at the office, and the credit card account will be displayed with a new validity period. </p><p>  Apply for a replacement card before the deadline.  Otherwise, the client runs the risk of missing a scheduled payment, as he will not be able to deposit money to a blocked card in the terminal or through Internet banking. </p><h2>  When is a reissue required by the cardholder? </h2><p>  If the plastic carrier is deformed, the card ceased to function, the ATM ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù it, the owner can issue a reissue without waiting for the deadline.  Depending on the reason for the service, a commission from 0 to 790 rubles may be charged. </p><p>  For Internet banks, such as Tinkoff, reissue of active cards is a must for every client.  The Tinkoff credit card is valid for 3 years.  As soon as it comes to an end, the client must notify the bank of the receipt of a new credit card. </p><p>  Since the online bank does not have branches, it is not always possible to pick up a credit card on the day of paperwork.  Courier delivery allows you to get a card anywhere within 1-7 days.  Therefore, it is recommended to complete the transaction at least a week before the deadline so that the bank does not block the card. </p><h2>  How to deposit cash if a credit card is past due? </h2><p>  Not all customers manage to pick up a credit card on time or to issue a reissue.  Unlike a debit card, the risk of an overdue credit card threatens to damage your credit history and possible fines. </p><p>  To deposit funds to an expired credit card in the usual way will not work.  The ATM will instantly ‚Äúswallow‚Äù the card, and operations in the online bank will be temporarily unavailable. </p><p>  The validity period of a credit card loan does not change, as does the grace period, interest and conditions.  But in this case, the owner will be able to deposit funds only through the cashier.  To transfer a credit card to your account, you will need the bank details of the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nomadcapitalist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff credit card expiration date" class="if uuid-3235580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3235580.jpg"></div><p>  The operation of transferring to a credit card account takes more time than depositing cash in a terminal or crediting through an online bank.  The maximum term for receiving money into the account is 72 hours.  It is recommended to take with them an additional 1-5% more than the payment requires, since financial institutions charge a commission for the operation. </p>
