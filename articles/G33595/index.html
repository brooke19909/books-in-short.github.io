It all started as a small settlement, which grew rapidly.  This was confirmed by the decree of Catherine II, in which Podolsk was awarded the title of city.  The railway laid in 1866 served as the basis for economic development: two of the largest factories were built here in a short time: the cement factory and the Singer, where famous sewing machines were produced. </p><p>  Today Podolsk is a large <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnear Moscow.</span>  But this is not what attracts tourists from all over Russia and from abroad to the city, but unique attractions: </p><ol><li>  Church of the Resurrection of Christ, which is the first stone building in the city. </li><li>  The Church of the Intercession is a masterpiece of Russian architecture.  Its mysterious extraordinary structure, combining the architecture of Russian and Western Baroque styles, rises where the Desna and Pakhra merge. </li><li>  Manors Fillipova, Krasnoe, Polivanovo and many others.  Of particular interest are the <span>Golitsyn</span> manor complex <span>, the</span> Ivanovskoye and Mikhailovskoye <span>manors</span> , where in addition to the architectural structures, each visitor gets acquainted with the unique history of each of the objects. </li></ol><p>  Since Podolsk is very popular among lovers of attractions and history buffs, many guests come here, so everyone‚Äôs first task is to book a hotel room. </p>

    <p>  A few years ago, the Moscow Region Hotel opened the Gostiny Dvor.  This is a 24-hour restaurant with original interior design.  The venue is a great place to have dinner, hold a meeting with a business partner, celebrate a family celebration or hold a corporate holiday - the venue is always ready to cater for any events. </p><p>  Top chefs can cook any dish of Russian cuisine, and do it so high-quality that even gourmets with the most demanding taste will be pleased.  In addition to excellent cuisine and a large selection of dishes, impeccable service also makes a good impression: here everything is aimed at ensuring that each client leaves satisfied and wants to return more than once.  The main thing is not to forget to book a table by phone so that you don‚Äôt have to wait long before the place becomes available.  And since they are not in a hurry to leave here, it can take a lot of time. </p><h2>  Facilities and amenities </h2>
