New buildings in the Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Moscow region (Moscow region)</span> is a separate subject of the Russian Federation, which is located right in the heart of the country.  One of the settlements is the urban settlement of Ramenskoye, located thirty kilometers southeast of Moscow.  And this place with a population of more than one hundred thousand people made it possible for the developer to build the Green Outskirts residential complex. </p><h2>  A bit about the settlement </h2><p>  Ramenskoye is not the smallest settlement in the Moscow region.  Its name comes from the word "ramen" (forest edge, outskirts).  Currently, the cosmetics industry is actively developing in it, the instrument-making bureau and the factory are operating.  Since 2012, there has been a steady population growth <span>.</span>  <span>Ramenskoye</span> is an actively developing area in which the Green Outskirts residential complex is not the only one. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Green outskirts" (Ramenskoye) took a very convenient position, and therefore get to it is not more difficult than in any <span>sleeping area of</span> Moscow, and any available transport.  From Kazan station to Ramensky there are electric trains.  Buses and fixed-route taxis often depart from Vykhino Metro Station.  And of course, it will not be difficult to get to the Green Outskirts residential complex by your own car - along the Novoryazanskoye highway to the intersection with Lytkarinsky near the village of Zhilino, then in the city of Zhukovsky to Ramensky.  There, on Krymskaya Street, the Green Outskirts residential complex is located.  Ramenskoye is ideal for construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The described <span>residential complex is</span> designed in the form of two quarters.  The first of them is supposed to accommodate four buildings.  In the second - six.  Like many new buildings in the Moscow region, residential buildings are being built in a semicircle.  This is to create the effect of comfort and the closure of the courtyard in order to ensure the safety of residents of the complex. </p>

    <p>  One building has an extension in the form of a two-story block, built specifically to accommodate social infrastructure facilities.  In the remaining buildings, all the lower floors are reserved for the same purposes.  The developer of the LCD "Green Outskirts" designed almost all possible <span>layouts of apartments: one-room,</span> two-room and three-room.  And in all of them there is a huge spacious loggia. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer did not stint on creating conditions for a comfortable existence of future residents of the complex.  Not all new buildings in the Moscow region can boast such luxury as underground parking.  But this does not apply to this residential complex.  In it, just the owners of their own cars may not worry because there will be nowhere to park.  In addition, on the ground part of the courtyard area, house parking lots will also be equipped. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The buildings are built in a semicircle, which creates additional protection for the courtyard area and allows equipping it with playgrounds and sports grounds.  There is also a separate area for dog walking, walking paths and boulevards.  The first floors of the LCD "Green Outskirts" will be given to accommodate commercial non-residential facilities: various shops, offices, bank branches, service centers, cafes, pharmacies.  Thus, the residential complex will offer its residents everything for a comfortable existence. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The location of the complex is almost in the center of the Ramenskoye settlement, which allows its residents to use the entire infrastructure of the city.  And almost all the facilities that are needed (schools, kindergartens, shops, hypermarkets, clinics) are located within walking distance. </p>

    <p>  Near the complex there is a Birch grove where it is good to relax with your family, take a walk along the alleys, sit on a bench, and breathe in fresh air.  Also nearby is Lake Borisoglebskoye surrounded by forest.  Therefore, those who already reside in the LCD "Green Outskirts" leave only the most positive reviews. </p><h2>  Apartments and their cost </h2><p>  The apartments in the complex are diverse: from one-room to three-room.  Each family and each person will find housing suitable for the plan and wallet.  The footage of one-room apartments starts from forty-three square meters.  The size of the three-room apartments reaches almost one hundred square meters.  Finishing in the premises is draft.  The cost of one square meter of housing starts from fifty-five thousand rubles.  Thus, a one-room apartment can be purchased in just two and a half million rubles, which is quite inexpensive for current prices in the Moscow region. </p><h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  To understand what kind of housing it is and in which complex it is better to purchase it, you should find out as much information as possible about the developer company.  LCD "Green outskirts" is being built by Mosoblinterstroy.  <span>This developer</span> began to work in 1997.  And even then he gained a reputation as the best general contractor.  The company employs highly qualified specialists of the old school.  They are accustomed to a decent attitude in the implementation of construction, which was reflected in the construction of houses, compliance with the deadlines specified in the documentation, and control over the implementation of their obligations. </p>

    <p>  The main principle of this developer is exemplary performance of work at reasonable prices.  Efficiency, professionalism, quality are highly appreciated in the company.  And this spirit, reigning in the organization, infects every newly recruited specialist.  The difficult path covered from the construction of cottages to obtaining contracts for large shopping centers allowed the developer, after ten years of work, to decide on the construction of apartment buildings in the Moscow region. </p><p>  And now, after more than fifteen years, when all completed projects are already visible, apartment owners who are satisfied with their housing are happy to use their apartments.  Basically, everyone praises the comfort and convenient location of the complex.  Do not forget to also note the stable work and reputation of the builder.  Webcams are installed at all construction sites so that you can monitor the progress of construction in real time.  This fact is especially important for those who have already purchased apartments and are worried about their real receipt. </p>
