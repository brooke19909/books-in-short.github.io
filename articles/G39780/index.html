    <h2>  Baikal - paradise lake </h2><p>  Perhaps some do not know, but Baikal is the <span>deepest lake</span> on the planet.  It is located in Eastern Siberia and is a large reservoir of fresh water.  Due to its large size, the lake has a wide variety of flora and fauna.  Unique landscapes and unusual inhabitants will delight any tourist.  All people who like the stunning nature and simply enchanting atmosphere, recommend a vacation on Lake Baikal.  The Small Sea is a part of the lake, which is separated by the <span>island of Olkhon.</span>  Its length is striking: it is 70 km.  Other islands are located in it, such as Zamogoi, Khibin, Izhilhey, Oltrek and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many local residents (and in Russia as a whole there is such an opinion) consider Lake Baikal a sea.  This is not surprising, because its length is 620 km and a width of 24 to 79 km.  This is impressive, since some seas are not worth comparing with Baikal.  Note that in the ranking of the largest lakes in the world, he takes sixth place. </p><h2>  Interesting information about Baikal </h2>

    <p>  Researchers claim that Baikal is the deepest lake on the planet.  It was found that its depth is 1642 meters, which is impossible for an ordinary person.  As for the average depth, it is also not small - 744 m. Surprisingly, in addition to Lake Baikal, only two lakes on the planet can at least get closer to the 1200 m mark. </p><p>  Scientists note that the Baikal waters are saturated with oxygen, and they have very few organic impurities.  As for the temperature, it is very low, and this does not allow swimming.  In summer, it can be + 8 ... + 9 <sup></sup> , and in winter the lake is covered with a thick layer of ice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Small sea </h2><p>  Lake Baikal consists of several parts.

The coast is mostly mountainous and the depth is 210 meters.

    <h2>  Hotel or hostel - which is better? </h2><p>  Most visitors prefer to relax at the camp sites, as they are specially equipped for travelers and are located in the most successful places.  As for the hotel, this is an institution that was created for temporary and emergency residence.  That is, you can settle in the hotel at any time of the day, but not the fact that the vacationer will receive everything necessary within its walls.  This is what distinguishes recreation centers, they were built so as to be as close as possible to nature, and also so that a person had the opportunity to heal, relax. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  The first thing, of course, is the question of vacationers planning to visit Lake Baikal (camp sites): prices.  Small sea allows you to save a little money, as it is located away from the center.  The cost of living at a recreation center is affordable and differs from that requested in hotels of settlements.  For example, you can go to Lake Baikal for three days and enjoy the peace, comfort, and fabulous atmosphere for only 1700 rubles.  But still, the price of accommodation depends on the chosen camp site and, of course, the time that the vacationer plans to spend there. </p><p>  It should be noted that the cost of the permit also depends on the conditions that the vacationer has chosen.  For example, you can order a room with or without meals, respectively, the difference in the amount will be significant.  In addition, the price of accommodation also depends on the category of room.  And, of course, not the last factor affecting the cost - this is a specific camp site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baikal small sea photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/461774.jpg" width="600"></div>

The small sea, the photo of which the tourist will save for his whole life, will often allow you to admire the beautiful landscapes and remember a wonderful vacation. </p><h2>  What to do on Baikal? </h2><p>  Of course, beautiful landscapes, a gentle steppe breeze are great, but entertainment is still needed.  Every tourist wants to see something new, experience exciting emotions and feel happy.  Holidays on Lake Baikal (the Small Sea, in particular, is a priority among tourists) can be truly exciting.  It is proposed to start the trip with a visit to the sources of the Lukovaya Polyana.  They are located in the vicinity of Ognuren - the largest village of the Small Sea.  Mineral springs are famous for their healing power, because water contains radon and iron, which helps to improve and normalize the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bases on Baikal" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/461776.jpg" width="590"></div>

And, of course, it is recommended to visit the stone tent, Sarma gorge, Enhok, Kurkut and Mukhor bays.  The islands of the Small Sea will also interest vacationers.  There are about ten of them, and to look at them, you can go on a boat trip. </p><h2>  How to get to Baikal? </h2><p>  There are several ways to come to Lake Baikal.
