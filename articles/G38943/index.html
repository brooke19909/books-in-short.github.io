It has borders with Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and China.  The last 25 years has existed as an independent state.  It has close economic cooperation with the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Tajikistan is a hospitable state, famous for its fruits and warm climate.  The capital is Dushanbe.  It is the largest and most significant city politically, economically, scientifically and culturally.

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  There are 3 regions in Tajikistan.  Sogdian is located in the north of the republic.  The regional center is the city of Khujand (formerly Leninabad).  Khatlon region is the southwestern part of the country.  The regional city is Kurgan-Tyube.  The eastern regions of Tajikistan are united in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region.  This is the Pamir, the largest territory and the most modest in terms of population.  In addition, 3 more cities and several districts have republican subordination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Republic of Tajikistan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188769.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature and climate </h2><p>  The climate is sharply continental.  There is no access to the sea, respectively, the air is dry, there are <span>dust storms,</span> which often affects the local population.  Tajikistan, or rather its territory, is 93% mountainous.  On its territory there are high mountains that make up the systems: Tien Shan, Gissaro-Alai and Pamir.  Due to the difference in altitude, the temperatures are very different.  While the heat in the valleys below reaches +50 ¬∞ C, eternal ice and snow often lie above 4000 m.  Numerous rivers begin there. </p><h2>  Inland waters </h2><p>  The largest rivers of Tajikistan are Vakhsh, Pyanj, Zeravshan, Syr Darya, Kafirnigan.  They play an important role in the water supply of the republic.  They are also often fished by the local population. </p><p>  Tajikistan is rich in lakes.  They are found in large numbers in the mountains.  Water bodies form as a result of landslides.  The largest lakes are Sarez and Yashilkul.  It is these beautiful ponds that the region favored by tourists - the Fann Mountains (Gissar Range) is famous for.  The largest of them, <span>Lake Iskanderkul,</span> is protected as a nature reserve.  In addition, artificial <span>reservoirs</span> were created on the Syr Darya and Vashha <span>: Kairakkum,</span> Farhad and Golovnoye lakes. </p><p>  A variety of vegetation is concentrated along river valleys and lake shores.  Mostly these are grasses and shrubs, trees often grow alone, without forming a continuous forest.  Only 4% of the <span>territory of Tajikistan</span> is covered by forest. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Tajikistan is currently populated unevenly.  The total population is about 8.6 million people.  Rural areas are more populated than urban areas.  Moreover, there are still villages where there is no centralized electricity, and there are more problems with water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The state is multinational.  Tajiks are indigenous <span>.</span>  <span>Tajikistan has</span> become a homeland for such nationalities as the Pamiri and Yagnobians.  In total, their number is about 85% (together with Tajiks).  The next largest number of people are Uzbeks (14%).  The remaining nations are much smaller.  There are only about 1% of Russians in Tajikistan. </p><p>  The population is very unevenly distributed.  For example, the Gorno-Badakhshan <span>Autonomous Region</span> occupies 45% of the territory, and less than 3% of the total population of the republic lives in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="areas of tajikistan" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188772.jpg" width="536"></div>

    <h2>  Economic development </h2><p>  In terms of economic indicators, the Republic of Tajikistan belongs to poor countries, although the country's potential is huge.  The mountains contain many rich deposits of various minerals.  Their reconnaissance was actively carried out in Soviet times from 1971 to 1990.  The problem is that the mountainous terrain is complicated, the organization of mining requires significant investments and good roads. </p><p>  Roads are a big problem in Tajikistan.  Until recently, the main republican highway Dushanbe-Chanak passed through two passes - Anzob and Shakhristan.  Now the tunnels have been broken there, and with the help of the Chinese, an excellent expressway has been made.  Passes that are closed in winter are no longer an obstacle to communication.  The disadvantage of this road is that it is paid, and there is no alternative way.  That is why the population of the republic is experiencing many difficulties during movement. </p><p>  Other roads in Tajikistan are in poor condition.  This is a significant indicator of the country's economic development and, of course, the standard of living of the local population.  Many of these roads have not been repaired since Soviet times, they have only miserable pieces of memories of asphalt. </p><p>  The able-bodied population, instead of working in their own country, leaves for work, primarily to Russia.  Earned money is spent not on investments, but on everyday needs. </p><p>  On 7% of the flat lands not occupied by mountains, locals grow cotton, tobacco, cereals, vegetables and fruits.  The share of livestock is small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rf tajikistan" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188775.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  The mountainous regions of Tajikistan attract many tourists from all over the world.  The highest Pamir peaks, in particular the peak of Ismoil Somoni <span>(the peak of Communism), the</span> picturesque, warm and easily accessible Fann mountains, rocks and valleys of the Mountain Match are very appreciated by tourists from abroad.  At the moment, in many villages there are special guest houses in which tourists can even take a hot shower, which is very rare in this area.  Locals are very hospitable and responsive, the majority very warmly recalls the charms of life during the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Tajikistan is a very promising country, it is a pity that so far its wealth remains largely only potential, which significantly affects the standard of living of the local population. </p>
