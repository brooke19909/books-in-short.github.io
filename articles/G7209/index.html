    <h2>  Which one is Lower? </h2><p>  Shavlinsky lake belongs to the most picturesque objects of the Altai Mountains.  Shavlinsky lakes will be more correct, because there are several of them.  And how much - the data varies, but not by much.  The question concerns only the reservoir located at an altitude of 1725 meters above sea level.  If it belongs to the Shavlinsky lake massif, then it should be called the Lower Lake, and the next, the most beautiful and occupying the largest area, should be called the Middle.  All subsequent reservoirs are called Upper.  They are also, according to various sources, from 5 to 7 units. </p><h2>  Origin and location </h2><p>  This lake cascade administratively belongs to the Kosh-Agach region (Altai Republic).  Geographically, it is located in the center of the North Chuysky ridge, in the upper reaches of the Shavly River, which flows along the southwestern slope of the Bish-Iirdu mountain range. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shavlinsky lake altai" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1013279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these pools, including Lower Shavlinskoye Lake (located at the level of 1725 m), belong to small reservoirs.  Their origin is associated with glacial activity and is called moraine-dammed. </p><h2>  Non-competitive pond </h2><p>  The reservoir, referred to in this article as Lower, loses in beauty to the lakes located a little higher - only 5 kilometers separate it from the most beautiful reservoir of the Shavlinsky cascade.  It is silty, more reminiscent of a river spill, divided by small, sedge-covered islands.  In addition, its shores are swampy, vegetation is sparse, there are almost no places for parking, with the exception of the east coast.  The size of the lake is small - 800 x 500 m. Maybe that‚Äôs why connoisseurs of the beauty of high mountain lakes do not attribute it to the Shavlinsky massif. </p><h2>  Lovely and welcoming </h2><p>  The next Shavlinsky lake (either Middle, or Lower) amazes the imagination with its beauty.  It is the largest, its length is 1.65 km, and its width is 500 m (in some places a width of only 400 meters is given), it is located at an altitude of 1983 meters above sea level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain Altai shavlinsky lake" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1013280.jpg" width="600"></div>  This lake is the object of pilgrimage - its unique beauty does not leave anyone indifferent.  And nature took care of places convenient for parking.  There are a lot of them on the eastern, canopy, covered with deciduous with cedar interspersed forest shore.

The water in this <span>lake is milky emerald,</span> and it reflects peaks visible in the distance, covered with eternal snow - Fairy Tale, Dream and Beauty.  The names speak for themselves.  They belong to the Main ridge of the North Chuysky ridge and are located at an altitude of 3700 meters above sea level.  This unique view, which, however, opens only from the middle of the lake, is the highlight of this reservoir.  It is this Shavlinsky lake that has been equipped most of all - even horseback routes have been laid here. </p><h2>  Local service </h2><p>  Recently, in the summer, the Altai family settled here provides vacationers with services - a bathhouse and horse rental, guide-guides and, by agreement, meals, as well as the sale of certain products.  There are a lot of tourists here.  Craftsmen leave wood products, which become a local attraction - Glade of idols is located in the middle of the east coast. </p><h2>  Tourist paradise </h2><p>  Lower Shavlinskoe lake (we are talking about the largest, located at the level of 1925 m) is also recently swamped.  In the middle of it there are shallows, in some places sedge is already growing.  Clean, open spaces of water are located mainly along the coast.  Both wild tourists and planning groups come here.  There are no problems with firewood here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lower shavlinsky lake" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1013281.jpg" width="414"></div>  Numerous clean mountain streams provide vacationers with water.  There are enough fish in the lake, especially grayling.  During certain seasons, there are many berries and mushrooms in the Shawla River Valley.  As noted above, you can rent horses and guides here.  The following routes and day trips are possible - to the Zelinsky and Abyl-Oyuk glaciers.

    <h2>  A starting point </h2><p>  This main Shavlinsky lake (Altai) is the starting point for the Nizhne- and Verkhne-Shavlinsky, Orbit and Abyl-Oyuk passes.  From it (preferably accompanied by a guide) you can climb the moraine, from where views of the Upper Lakes are available.  The valley of the Left Shavly is also visible from here (the Upper Lakes are located along the channel of the Right Shavly), in the upper reaches of which there are also water bodies.  More prepared groups of tourists can get to the Alenki Lakes and Lake Maashey through the Nizhne-Shavlinsky Pass.  The abundance of natural reservoirs justifies such a name as the edge of the lakes that bears Mountain Altai.  Shavlinsky lake is one of the tourist mecca of Altai, and not only.  People come here from all over Siberia. </p><h2>  At the very top of the cascade </h2><p>  Upper Shavlinsky lake, or rather a group of several small reservoirs, is located south of the lower reservoir, where the forest boundary has already ended, in the mountains, at an altitude of 2164 meters above sea level, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Great Shavlinsky glacier, which is otherwise called the Shavlinskaya horseshoe.  They are located in a cascade at the source of the Shawla River.  Moreover, 5 of them, among which the largest, the second from the Lower Lakes, are located at one source, and the remaining two at other sources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="upper shavlinsky lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1013282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The way from the main Shavlinsky lake to the upper reservoirs takes a day.  The shores near the upper reservoirs are gentle, characterized by a large pile of stones, some of which are 5 meters in diameter.  The lakes are famous for beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. </p><h2>  Distance to major cities </h2><p>  As already noted, the largest Shavlinsky lake is especially popular.  How to get to this alpine pond?  The main landmark and starting point is the village of Chibit.  They get to him along the Chuysky tract.  Trains do not go here, they only travel by road: from Gorno-Altaysk, the nearest town, to Chibit - 340 km, from Biysk - 442 km, from Barnaul - 630 km, from Novosibirsk - 772 km. </p><p>  Regular buses run from Gorno-Altaysk.  In any of these cities, you can rent any car. </p><h2>  From relative civilization to the hinterland </h2><p>  From Chibit (Ulagan municipal district of the Altai Republic), from either of its two bridges - the Old, located 4 km downstream, or the New, located 4 km upstream the Chibitka river, you need to go through the Oroy pass and the Yeshtyk plateau K√∂l, along the Shabagi River, to the Shawla River Valley.  This is the most popular route for both commercial groups and individual tourists.  The road from the village of Chibit to the tourist base on the shore of the main lake takes 2-3 days. </p><p>  Because of its beauty, the land of Shavlinsky lakes is called Altai Switzerland, or the pearl of Altai.  Shavlinsky lakes reviews are the most enthusiastic.  After all, it makes people something to overcome such distances and all the difficulties of the path.  Obviously, the beauty of these places pays for everything. </p>
