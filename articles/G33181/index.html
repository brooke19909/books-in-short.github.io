    <p>  Fortunately, there are many beautiful places in the world where you can have a wonderful time.  So, among residents of the Urals and tourists, the Talc Rock Stone reservoir enjoys well-deserved popularity. </p><h2>  How to get to the lake? </h2><p>  The path to the destination passes along the Chelyabinsk tract.  Before the traffic police post, a turn begins on Kashino.  Passing the village, the motorist heads to the city of Sysert.  <span>Talc Stone</span> is located near the district center.  First you need to get to the local bus station.  Opposite the station there is a monument to soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War, and a little further is the intersection. </p><p>  From Sysert leave on Timiryazev street (at the intersection to the right).  Outside the district center there is a pond into which <span>the Black River</span> flows <span>.</span>  Not far from it is Talc Stone.  How to get to the lake if the bridge does not support the weight of the car?  Unfortunately, nothing.  By car you can only get to the bridge, and then you have to go on foot, since the structure is malfunctioning.  Pointers are placed along the road, so the probability of getting lost is zero. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another route option is from the southern bus station of Yekaterinburg to Sysert, and from there - by taxi. </p><h2>  What is attractive about this region? </h2><p>  Talkov Kamen Lake is one of the most beautiful places in the region.  The reservoir has the shape of an irregular polygon, surrounded by steep greenish-white shores.  This is the color of talc, which is more than enough here.  Around the Talkov Stone a rare <span>pine forest</span> grows <span>,</span> but closer to the water there are sheer cliffs.  <span>The unusual color of the</span> shores is conveyed by the <span>water surface.</span>  The surface of the lake has a rich emerald hue. </p>

    <p>  In clear weather, it seems that an unknown artist depicted an exquisite ornament on the banks.  On a cloudy day, it seems that the vicinity of the lake chose witches and sorcerers for their dark deeds. </p><p>  The mysterious lake is a favorite vacation spot not only for residents of Yekaterinburg and the city of Sysert.  Talc Stone attracts vacationers from other cities of Russia, near and far abroad.  Not far from the reservoir is the Uralochka cottage, and the lake itself is part of the Sverdlovsk regional natural park Bazhovskie Mesti. </p><p>  Arbors are built on the shore, tables are provided for under the roof, sites for camping.  Park staff sell firewood.  If you do not want to spend the night in the forest, you can spend the night in a hotel in the town of Sysert, and in the morning go to Talkov Kamen.  How to get to the lake, the locals will tell. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lake is often visited by scuba divers.  They sank to the bottom of a mysterious pond in Soviet times, when light diving equipment appeared on store shelves.  Today, everyone is getting diving lessons. </p><p>  Self-diving is not recommended, since at the bottom there are piles of fallen <span>tree trunks,</span> and talc particles float in the water.  Natural obstacles not only interfere with successful diving, but also pose a serious danger to life. </p>

    <p>  At the request of tourists, excursion groups are formed on the Talc Stone.  How to get there <strong> </strong>  to the place, decide during the trip.  For outdoor enthusiasts, ATV rides and horses are organized, and in winter - snowmobile rides. </p><h2>  The origin of the pond </h2><p>  The history of the lake began in 1843 with the development of talc deposits.  Raw materials were required by local metallurgical plants.  Talc slate has been mined for sixty years.  During this time, a twenty-meter quarry was formed on the site of the future lake. </p><p>  By the beginning of the twentieth century, enterprises began to use other raw materials, and the scale of talc mining decreased.  The deposit was transferred to another locality, and the old quarry was safely forgotten.  The resulting space was gradually filled with groundwater.  So it turned out the lake. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Since Talkov Stone (how to get there, see above) is far from civilization, rumors are circulating about the incredible events taking place in these places.  Even during the existence of the career, the watchman met a ghost - a lady with a pale face and transparent eyes.  The lady appeared from the destroyed adit and went to meet the man.  A frightened watchman set off, running six kilometers to Sysert itself. </p><p>  Locals reacted differently to the story of a white woman.  Someone believed, and someone decided that all this is fiction.  However, since then the glory of a mysterious and unclean place has entrenched in the lake. </p><p>  For more than a hundred years, the legend of treasures has been living.  The last owner of the Sysert metallurgical plants, Dmitry Solomirsky, was fond of collecting porcelain, carefully preserving the rarest specimens of dishes.  But ... 1917 came, and two years later the Bolsheviks reached Siberia. </p><p>  Wanting to save a unique collection, the manager of the Mokronos plants decided to drown expensive porcelain in a mysterious lake.  Water was not afraid of the dishes, and the reservoir itself was considered dangerous, so you could not be afraid for the safety of property.  People were afraid to visit Talc Stone.  How to get to the lake, no one was interested. </p><p>  History is considered a legend due to some contradictions.  It is not clear why the treasure was kept by the manager, and not the owner of the jewelry.  At the same time, eyewitnesses claimed that the carts left Solomirsky‚Äôs yard. </p>

    <p>  Bad rumors about the lake were used to their advantage by the Bolsheviks, arranging Mayevka on its shore.  As the lake turned into a tourist attraction, myths were forgotten, and the question "How to get to the Talkov Stone?"  became relevant again. </p><h2>  Climatic features of the area </h2><p>  The typical climate of the Urals is continental.  Air masses from the Atlantic Ocean encounter a barrier in the form of the Ural Mountains.  The western slope is moistened better than other parts of the ridge, since the first meets cyclones. </p>

    <p>  Precipitation is distributed unevenly, not only by region, but also within each region.  In the west, rain and snow are about 100 millimeters more than in the east. </p><p>  The coldest period of the year in these parts lasts from November to April.  The warmest month is June (about + 18 ¬∞ C), the coldest - February (-13 ¬∞ C).  Extreme temperatures are forty degrees of heat in summer and thirty-nine below zero in winter. </p><p>  Winds blow mainly from the west, less frequently south-west and north-west directions are recorded. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Since Talc Stone is a standing reservoir, no fish are found in it.  The inhabitants of the lake are daphnia, rotifers, mollusks, beetles, hairs, leeches, crustaceans, larvae of a feathery mosquito.  Water bugs run on the surface.  In the lake, soft vegetation predominates, mainly elodea and rdest.  Near the water grows river reeds. </p><p>  Primitive plants and animal organisms comprise phyto- and zooplankton, causing flowering. </p><h2>  Minerals </h2><p>  In 1927, the production of talcum powder at the site of the future lake ceased, but valuable rocks have survived to the present day: chlorite schists with quartz crystals, talc schists with dark dolomite, noble white-green talc, etc. (more than twenty minerals).  In Sysert and other cities of the region, copper and iron ore were mined at one time. </p>
