Guests note that, despite the small size of the buildings, the hotels are quite comfortable. </p><p>  Rooms are regularly cleaned and bed linen is changed.  Guests are pleased to be able to cook their own meals in specially designated rooms.  Thus, customers can save their finances by visiting cafes and dining rooms. </p><p>  Of the negative comments can be noted related to the quality of service.  Due to the fact that the hotels are small, the staff here is quite small.  Therefore, household issues are not always resolved on time. </p><p>  Sosnogorsk is quite close to Ukhta.  Therefore, guests who want to stay in the best conditions reserve their rooms there.  Ukhta has a wider selection of hotels, and rooms are provided in more comfortable categories. </p>
