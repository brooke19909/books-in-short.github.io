What is a TFP photo shoot and how to get free studio photography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  TFP photography is a mutually beneficial agreement between a model and a photographer, usually in the early stages of their career.  What does it mean, how is a contract created and what should it contain, what pitfalls does this concept have?  Read on. </p><h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  What does this abbreviation mean?  TFP stands for Time For Print - literally translated, time for printouts.  Since photographs on paper are becoming less popular today, digital images on a disc are often the result of such a survey.  This led to the abbreviation TFCD - Time for CD. </p><p>  DFT shooting is an agreement between a photographer and a model where the latter agrees to pose for the former without financial reward, with the exception of photographs that will be used for her portfolio.  That is, no one pays anyone.  In order to avoid <span>conflict situations,</span> it is better not to confine yourself to an oral agreement, but to clearly indicate the rights and obligations of each participant in the creative process using documentary registration in the <span>form of an agreement.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Why is this needed? </h2><p>  Everyone wants to get paid for their work, but no one will turn to people who cannot prove their professionalism for services.  Customers expect to see the skill of the photographer and model in action before concluding a contract with them.  Therefore, a portfolio is mandatory for both. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the amateur photographer, shooting DFT is a good alternative to hiring and remunerating professional models for obtaining high-quality images.  After all, their fee can be sky-high for him.  While cooperation with beginner models will cost several times cheaper. </p><p>  The situation is the same for the other side.  Models without or with little shooting experience need to have a quality portfolio.  In addition, the more time she spends in front of the camera, the better and more confident she will look in the frame.  But the fees for the services of a famous photographer may be too high.  A mutually beneficial agreement with the photographer will benefit both parties. </p>

    <h2>  How to get studio photography for free </h2><p>  Although there is no instant financial benefit from DFT filming, this does not mean that one of the parties intends to do charity work. </p><p>  When you want to offer such a collaboration to a photographer or model, consider whether it will benefit them.  After all, they also plan to somehow use the material obtained: for self-promotion, for sale, etc. If you cannot offer them something profitable, then do not be offended when you are refused.  This is especially true for working with specialists whose professional level is much higher than yours.  It will be difficult for a novice model to work on equal terms with an experienced photographer and vice versa.  The chances of free shooting here will be zero. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, sometimes it happens that a photographer who already has experience and reputation agrees to work on DFT, because he wants to experiment with a new idea or sell a series of pictures on photo stocks. </p><p>  But it‚Äôs best to choose a partner whose skill level is the same or slightly higher than yours.  Then you can work almost without investment and maintain normal respectful relationships.  So you will either grow together, or improve and move on to working with specialists of a higher level. </p>

    <h2>  The financial side of the issue </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that shooting DFT is completely free.  In fact, there are certain expenses that beginners forget or are not aware of. </p><p>  So, a TFP photographer pays for: </p><ol><li>  Rental and / or acquisition of studios and equipment. </li><li>  Lease and / or acquisition of props. </li><li>  Processing and printing photos. </li></ol><p>  In turn, DFT models will have to pay: </p><ol><li>  Hairdresser, makeup artist. </li><li>  Purchase / rental of clothing and accessories. </li><li>  Stylist services. </li></ol><p>  In rare cases, the photographer can provide the <span>model with a complete</span> team of specialists.  Of course, this is a very good offer for her.  But in most cases, he can only give contacts or completely shift these concerns onto her shoulders.  A common scheme is where both parties summarize the costs and divide them equally.  Such points should be agreed upon at the initial stages of cooperation. </p>

    <h2>  Work result </h2><p>  TFP conditions should clearly state what benefits each side will receive at the end of the survey.  After all, no <span>one wants to work</span> for nothing.  For example, they must agree on how many photos will be provided to the model and how long the TFP photo session will last.  The average figure is from two to six photos per hour of work.  But it varies depending on the arrangement. </p><p>  If the photographer is going to use the pictures for commercial purposes, then the parties must decide what kind of reward the model will receive.  This can be a fixed amount or a certain percentage of revenue.  In any case, you must obtain the permission of the model to use her photo. </p><h2>  Legal Aspects </h2><p>  In order for the contract concluded for the shooting to be valid, make sure that it contains: </p><ul><li>  full <span>passport data of the</span> photographer and model; </li><li>  date and place of shooting; </li><li>  responsibilities of each party; </li><li>  cost allocation procedure; </li><li>  remuneration of the model (number, type, timing of the production of images); </li><li>  signature of each party. </li></ul><h2>  Tips for Photographers </h2><p>  The key to a successful photo shoot of models is careful planning.  Here are some suggestions that will be helpful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DFT conditions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/664046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ol><li>  Designate your idea.  The photographer must know in advance what pictures he / she plans to receive as a result of the photo shoot.  The model does not select the theme, background, props to be used.  Of course, an exchange of ideas is only welcome, but the responsibility for this part of the work lies with you.  Without a specific goal, you may end up with meaningless shots that neither you nor she will need. </li><li>  Explain the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe model.  She should clearly understand what you want from her - from makeup, hairstyles, wardrobe to mood.  Separately, one should discuss the desired degree of nakedness and candor of poses. </li><li>  Frame selection.  Some photographers give pictures at their discretion, some give the model the opportunity to choose.  All this must be agreed in advance. </li><li>  Copyright protection.  Perhaps this is the most delicate moment.  The model can take pictures for the portfolio, but the rights to their commercial use belong to the photographer.  In this regard, there may be <span>watermarks</span> in the pictures <span>.</span>  However, such photos in the portfolio are considered bad form.  Therefore, discuss how you will protect your authorship without prejudice to the model. </li><li>  Carefully develop your TFP contract and terms.  Do not forget about the point in which the model agrees to the commercial use of images.  It is recommended that you attach to the contract a copy of your passport or other identification document with a photograph.  So with any questions, you can easily prove that the person in the pictures really gave her consent to their use. </li></ol><h2>  Tips for models </h2>

      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Carefully choose your photographer.  You should not waste your time and money preparing just because you agreed to work for free. </li><li>  Take into account the wishes of the photographer to make the TFP shooting as productive as possible. </li><li>  Agree clearly with the hairdresser, makeup artist and other specialists so as not to disrupt the work due to their absence. </li><li>  If you are not sure what clothes to take, give preference to basic things, but bring along interesting accessories.  Even a simple scarf can be beaten in dozens of ways. </li><li>  Carefully read the terms of the contract for shooting, insist on its conclusion. </li><li>  You should not choose a photographer who promises you to give all the pictures.  Sometimes this indicates his lack of professionalism - he just hopes that at least something will turn out well from the mass of material.  Each TFP survey should make a significant contribution to your portfolio, where quality is important, not quantity. </li><li>  The same goes for photo processing.  If you are promised the result immediately after shooting - this is an occasion to beware.  The photographer obviously will not have time to process the images.  And even successful shots sometimes need to be trimmed, adjust colors and contrast, remove small specks of dust and other imperfections.  In addition, if the photo is in focus, this does not mean that it is successful.  In any case, a professional will reject part of the photo, because they will have technical, compositional and other flaws.  Remember the quality. </li><li>  But processing may have another problem.  Some experts mercilessly drag out her terms.  Therefore, make sure that there is a clause in the contract: <em>‚ÄúProcessing of photographs will take no more than ___ days, if the photographer does not provide the photographs by the number of months. Months, then he undertakes to pay the cost of the model in the amount of ___ rubles.‚Äù</em>  .  So you protect your interests and you do not have to act as a petitioner. </li><li>  Talk to the photographer about the format of the shots.  If they will be in the form of printouts, discuss paper size and quality.  Please note that you will have to scan them yourself for electronic use.  Or the photographer will provide you with a CD with materials or a download link. </li></ol><h2>  DFP for advertising </h2><p>  This concept is rare, but still has a place to be.  If the photographer offers you such a shooting, then this is a serious reason for reflection.  It is one thing when the footage is used for sale on photo stocks, another thing is when your pictures are intended to advertise a specific product, a team of professionals is involved in the work and someone makes a lot of money from it.  Of course, your recognition as a model will increase, especially if the pictures fall into glossy magazines.  But if you are good enough to print, then why not get a decent pay for your work.  Moreover, there may be serious copyright restrictions with such images, and you will not be able to use them for self-promotion.  It is difficult to give an unambiguous answer here, so carefully weigh the pros and cons for a particular situation. </p>

    <h2>  Professional ethics </h2><p>  Rarely, the conditions for filming DFTs require an advance payment for future expenses between the parties.  However, this is not a reason to treat work irresponsibly.  If the photographer disrupts the shooting, the model may either lose the money spent on preparation, or ruin the relationship with the specialists involved.  After all, everyone needs to plan their schedule.  The photographer can also suffer losses, since the rent of the studio and equipment is paid in advance, not to mention the lost time. </p><p>  Do not forget that this professional environment is rather narrow and everyone knows each other.  Therefore, you need to protect your reputation and fulfill obligations to each other.  Otherwise, they will not want to work with you soon. </p><h2>  The right attitude </h2><p>  Filming DFT is a <span>team work.</span>  For it to be as productive as possible, each of its participants must make every effort.  This is as serious a job as paid photo shoots of models, so you should not undertake it if you are not determined to provide your partner with the maximum of your efforts, inspiration, creativity and experience. </p>
