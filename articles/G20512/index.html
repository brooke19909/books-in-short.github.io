    <p>  Already from the 70s of the 20th century, mankind began to realize that in a world with a catastrophically worsening environment, a <span>healthy society</span> cannot exist <span>.</span>  The economy is also not able to fully develop, but since it cannot stop, it needs to take a different path without destroying nature. </p><p>  A huge amount of knowledge has been accumulated on the problem of a person‚Äôs relationship with his environment.  All of them testify to the fact that sustainable development is the primary task of the entire <span>population of the Earth.</span>  Only its provision and understanding of the whole prevailing picture as a whole will help save our civilization. </p><p>  But the concept of sustainable development can be realized only if a number of fundamental requirements are met. </p><p>  The first condition is a struggle not with the consequences of human activity that is harmful, but with causes.  Correction of the results involves cleaning.  It is clear <span>that such a policy is</span> unpromising.  But the struggle with the causes leads to a complete change in the way people live.  At the same time, such a policy is formed that eliminates the negative impact on nature, the environment and the irrational use of all its resources. </p><p>  The second condition, the observance of which is necessary in order for the concept of sustainable development to be realized, is a rejection of a policy that has no limits to the growth of consumption and production.  This is happening all over the world, but is especially acute in <span>developed countries.</span>  Pursuing such a policy with safe environmental measures is not able to provide any resources of the Earth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The concept of sustainable development will only function if the world's population ceases to grow.  The greatest excess is observed in developing countries.  Already, the number of people on Earth is greater than its natural resources and capabilities. </p><p>  The transition to the use of clean production in all places is also an important condition, without which the concept of sustainable development is not realized.  The ecology of the planet takes enormous damage from the use of traditional technologies.  Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new equipment as quickly and everywhere as possible, which, by virtue of its perfection, generates less waste and consumes less resources (energy and material). </p><p>  The fifth condition is the understanding that economic, environmental and material problems are tightly connected with each other.  The interaction is as follows.  The economic characteristics of production affect the environmental.  And together, they depend on the level of technology used in the work. </p><p>  The sixth condition is the analysis of any activity related to the manufacture of apparatuses, machines, technologies, devices, etc. The fact is that energy production and resources are needed for production, that is, in one way or another, environmental impacts occur.  The operation of products off the assembly line also requires certain costs.  A problem is the disposal of equipment that has failed.  Thus, engineers must find solutions that would lead to the least cost and minimal impact on the environment, starting with the manufacture of the product and ending with the last day of its operation. </p><p>  The seventh requirement is the formation and adoption of preventive measures.  Even when there is no certainty that there will be consequences that threaten the environment. </p><p>  The concept of sustainable development is never fully realized without observing the eighth condition - the formation of environmental thinking among the population. </p><p>  And the last, ninth, condition is a constant struggle for the conservation of species listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  However, the principles listed above, by themselves, still do not solve the problem.  For them to function, the leadership of all countries must develop on their basis such practical measures that could ensure the implementation of all requirements and conditions. </p>
