  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main functions of the psyche of modern man</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the field of medicine and preserving the health of a <span>modern person</span> , the psycho-emotional component plays an important role, the care of which is taken over by such sciences as psychology and psychiatry.  If the latter is faced with the task of treating various deviations in this environment, then the first science is studying directly the causes of the origin of diseases, as well as the peculiarities <span>of human behavior,</span> its mental and emotional components, actions and desires. </p><p>  Many works on this topic allow us to conclude that the basic <span>functions of the</span> human <span>psyche</span> have been studied and classified for a long time, thanks to which students of specialized universities are successfully studying this subject.  However, despite the fact that over the past 2 thousand years a person has constantly evolved and walked along the path of technical and cultural progress, the pace of his life was more or less the same, which allowed a person to successfully adapt to changing living conditions and accept new phenomena and concepts.  As for the modern world order and way of life, the rapid pace of the ever-accelerating development of society, on the one hand, as well as revolutionary breakthroughs in science and technology, on the other, are changing our world so quickly that the basic functions of the psyche of a civilized person are not always performed at the right level .  As a result of this, we can observe a picture of the fact that many people of the older generation, who grew up in completely different conditions and are used to a more measured pace of life, simply do not have time to adapt to new ones.  This gives rise to a number of problems that today have almost become global and, possibly, will be submitted to the World Health Organization for advice in the very near future. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, what are the main functions of the human psyche and what is their main task? </p><ol><li>  Protective.  From birth, every person has an <span>instinct for self-preservation,</span> since only this allowed him to survive in the extreme conditions of the primitive communal system.  And we are talking not only about physical protection, but also about psycho-emotional factors.  The psyche of each person is set up in such a way as to smooth out unpleasant moments, thus protecting the mental health of a person from negative emotions: resentment, anger, anger, and so on. </li><li>  Behavioral (adaptive).  Everything is known that each of us needs a society for normal and harmonious development, since it is practically impossible to grow a mentally healthy and <span>versatile person</span> outside of it.  The key to development and education is communication, as a result of which a person receives not only useful knowledge, but also makes his brain think and analyze various situations.  In addition, thanks to observation and the desire to join the team, a person unconsciously copies the model of behavior of individuals and thus adapts to new conditions of coexistence. </li><li>  Thoughtful.  It is the most important component of the human psyche; thanks to it, he was able to rise above the animal kingdom and become a key figure in the historical development of our planet.  The main functions of the psyche necessarily include reasoning and conclusions that allow you to accumulate the experience gained and continue to follow the path of your own intellectual development. </li><li>  Unconscious.  Despite a number of discoveries in this direction, as well as the works of Sigmund Freud and Karl Jung, many phenomena of the unconscious are still not fully explained by modern science.  Thanks to globalization, the main functions of the psyche of not only a person, but also of society as a whole, made it possible to collect information in this area from around the world, and the modern information base has a huge number of very different phenomena.  <span>Mysterious phenomena of the</span> human psyche, such as reading thoughts at a distance, intuition, levitation (flight), and so on, should also be singled out in a separate category. </li></ol><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the basic functions of the human psyche over the past thousand years have undergone little change, however, modern living conditions of people, a fast rhythm of work and an eternal rush lead to mental overload.  This must be borne in mind and avoid excessive pressure on your own body.  That is why it is always useful to contact psychologists who can give a <span>person good</span> advice and help in a difficult situation. </p>
