Its total area is 10 hectares.  It is located in the north of the former territory of the Likhachev Plant.  It was built in the style of public art.  The Tyufel Grove was opened to visitors in 2018. </p><h2>  About the title </h2><p>  There is several version of the origin of this name.  One version of the story "Tyufel Grove" extends to the 14th century.  In those days, the historical area south of the Simonov Monastery was called just that. </p><p>  According to another version, the name "Tyufel's Grove" goes back to the word "tuhol".  It is treated as "musty."  The fact is that around this area there were many swamps and lakes.  There are many flood meadows, which are also called. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Local flowers" class="if uuid-2972629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972629.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, the Tyufel Grove Park is also called ZIL.  This is the name of the factory that once functioned on this site.  Also, this zone is called "ZILART", by the name of the residential complex. </p><h2>  History of the area </h2><p>  In the 17-18 centuries, this grove came into the palace possession - it was here that the royal hunting grounds were located.  There was a falcon's yard.  In 1694, a palace with a temple was erected here.  Here lived Prince Fedor Romodanovsky.  The first persons of the empire came to these hunting grounds - Peter I, Catherine II.  Since 1797, the architect Nikolay Lvov became the owner of the territory.  When he died, the estate, located on the territory of the modern Tyufel Grove park, was sold. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="It's over there" class="if uuid-2972632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972632.jpg"></div><p>  In 1792, N. Karamzin's novel ‚ÄúPoor Lisa‚Äù was published.  Her main character lived in Simonova Sloboda, near the monastery.  According to the plot, she drowned in a pond, which will later be called in her honor.  After the publication of this work, Lysine Pond along with the grove became very popular.  Here, many walked in the late 18th century.  Over time, the grove was built up with summer cottages.  In the 20th century, the District Railway with the Kozhukhovo station was built here.  In 1916, one of the first automobile plants, called ZIL, began to be erected here.  The trees were cut down, and in 1930 the grove was actually destroyed. </p><h2>  About ZIL </h2><p>  In 1916, the ZIL plant was founded.  He took up the production of trucks under a license from FIAT.  Two years later, he was nationalized.  In its place, workshops were built that assembled and repaired cars.  The organization resumed operations in 1924 when an official order for the production of trucks was received. </p><p>  In 1927, I. Likhachev was appointed director.  After 4 years, the plant was named after Joseph Stalin - ‚ÄúZIS‚Äù.  During the Great Patriotic War, the plant engaged in the manufacture of military trucks, weapons.  He was awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.  With the end of the war, the plant began to produce cars and special equipment.  When Ivan Likhachev died, the plant was named after him - ‚ÄúZIL‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="On the conveyor" class="if uuid-2972626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972626.jpg"></div><p>  When the Soviet Union collapsed, output was critically low.  It was a big enterprise crisis.  In 2012, the Moscow government decided to continue production in the south of the plant, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 hectares.  The entire remaining area was given to the new ZILART residential complex.  Also allocated territory for the opening of the park. </p><h2>  About the organization of the park zone </h2><p>  In the spring of 2017, they began to create a park area at the ZILART residential complex.  A 10-hectare site was located in the north of the former ZIL plant.  The initial description of the Tyufel Grove, the very concept of the park was given into the hands of the Dutch architect Jerry Van Eyck.  It is famous for creating a pedestrian space in Las Vegas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Also here" class="if uuid-2972630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972630.jpg"></div><p>  During the construction of the park area, the soil was significantly updated.  In addition, they changed and cultivated the landscape.  In the summer of 2018, it was decided to transfer the park zone to Moscow and begin its operation.  In July of that year, the park was open to visitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About concept </h2><p>  At the moment, ZILART is the largest project in Europe to restore the former industrial zone.  The Tyufel Grove Park has become an important part of this project.  The basis of its creation was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãembedding art in urban space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In the amphitheater" class="if uuid-2972628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972628.jpg"></div><p>  In the park area there are about 4,000 trees and shrubs.  Here planted 11,000 square meters of flowers.  The park has walking and cycling paths.  What exactly will grow in the park was chosen taking into account how polluted the air in this area is.  Take into account wind erosion, climatic conditions.  In addition, the park has equipped tennis courts, playgrounds. </p><h2>  About landscape design </h2><p>  In landscape design, it was decided to demonstrate the elevation difference.  The level of available stands changes, as does the palette of plants in each individual zone. </p><p>  In the greenest part of the park area there is a pond.  Its depth is about 1 meter, and the total area reaches 3000 square meters.  According to reviews, the Tyufel Grove will have a skating rink in the winter season.  In addition, at the edges of the reservoir, as visitors to the park, you can sunbathe. </p><p>  The park also has a separate walking area, as well as shopping pavilions.  They are presented in a separate building, sheathed in wood.  This item appeals to the factory past of a given territory.  It is called the "Conveyor".  Each path of the park leads to the Hermitage-Moscow Museum Center. </p><p>  According to the creators, the park will be around the clock.  However, someone indicates that the park area will be visited only in fine weather.  It is called a seasonal project.  The park is called the "Second Charge." </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, the park has not yet found its final appearance - it is being completed.  The same applies to the surrounding areas.  Nevertheless, now it is equipped with playgrounds and playgrounds.  There are not too many visitors in it, but because it is quiet and calm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Park itself" class="if uuid-2972625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972625.jpg"></div><p>  Many say that people swim in the pond.  Someone says that the park resembles Spain with its view.  The tracks, according to reviews, are well designed in the park.  He has great potential to become one of the favorite places of Muscovites and guests of the capital. </p><p>  In addition, according to reviews, the pond is very beautiful here.  Someone confuses it with the pool due to the purity of its water.  Ladders do not descend into the water, the coast here is granite.  For this reason, comrades help numerous divers to get out of the water. </p><p>  At the same time, it should be borne in mind that builders who work next door on construction sites come here to swim.  And one can hardly talk about observing the hygiene of the reservoir.  Water is not chlorinated, there are no sanitary facilities, nothing is provided for safety. </p><p>  It is not known exactly how often water will be changed in the pond.  The water here is still.  It is important to note that there are no toilets in the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="With a pond" class="if uuid-2972627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2972627.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the park is still not fully completed, now it has become a great place for walking with children.  Playgrounds on it are built excellent and very interesting.  At the same time, there is no protection in it, and the total area is still quite small.  Many visitors expect the construction of the park to be completed.  After all, then it will turn into a very interesting territory. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Before you get to the "Tyufel Grove", you need to consider that on the signs the park is listed as "ZILART Park".  You can get to it from the station of the Moscow Central Ring "ZIL".  The passage to the park will lie through the green fence, hiding the construction site from the eyes.  You will also need to go under the flyover.  Driving here will be uncomfortable.  The thing is that there are currently no parking lots around the park area. </p>
