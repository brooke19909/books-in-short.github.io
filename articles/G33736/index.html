Many parents of boys thought about this issue.  She can decorate the belt of the carnival costume of a pirate or a hussar, give the child to play "robbers" with other guys.  This is safer and more reliable, since a child in the heat of the game will not injure anyone.  The saber differs from the sword and dagger in the presence of a handle that protects the warrior's fingers from the blow of the enemy.  The blade of such a weapon is straight or slightly curved. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a saber out of paper in different ways.  For decorative purposes, the blade can be rolled up from several layers of A4 thin paper using the origami technique.  The saber cut out of corrugated packing cardboard will be more durable.  The surface of the blade is additionally decorated with silver colored paper or covered with foil to simulate metal.  The handle can be made brighter, choose a color that harmoniously matches with the carnival costume.  For active games, you can leave the craft without decoration, as for the next attack, mom will have to make a new blade. </p><h2>  Cardboard option </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make a saber out of paper with a curved shape with your own hands.  In each house, you will definitely find an even piece of corrugated cardboard from the old packaging, on which you can make a saber drawing.  The curved shape of a pirate weapon is drawn by hand.  You can use the sample presented in the article below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated saber" class="if uuid-3080193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080193.jpg"></div><p>  The handle has a curved shape with thin places to hold the handle.  The remaining elements of the paper saber are made of strips 6 cm wide. A short length is put on at the beginning of the handle into the hole made in the center.  The pen is made by folding the paper with an arc.  If you wish, you can paste the craft with colored paper using PVA glue or wrap it with colored tape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Craft from a cardboard sleeve </h2><p>  If a cardboard sleeve remained in the household after using kitchen napkins, foil or parchment for baking, then you can make a wonderful saber out of paper from it.  Additionally, you need a small strip of corrugated cardboard for the manufacture of the handle.  Having outlined the diameter of the circumference of the end part of the sleeve on the cardboard, we get the contours of the necessary holes for putting the handle on the saber. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="saber from the sleeve" class="if uuid-3080214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080214.jpg"></div><p>  Then cut out the excess with scissors and attach to the base with PVA glue.  The handle fits tightly so that it does not slip.  Additionally, in one place it will be held by a foil wrapped around a ‚Äúblade‚Äù.  The pointed edge of the saber is made by forcing cardboard from two sides.  You can fasten the end with a stapler to a paper clip.  To prevent the child from scratching anyone, wrap with additional tape. </p><h2>  Newspaper Weapons </h2><p>  How to make an original saber out of paper?  Use an old newspaper and beautiful, thick, corrugated paper for your pen.  For density, you can collapse the craft not from one newspaper, but from several.  The printed page is laid out angularly on the surface of the table and twisted tightly with a wooden skewer or knitting needle.  The edge of the newspaper is glued to the last turn with PVA glue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alphamom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper tube sabers" class="if uuid-3080247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080247.jpg"></div><p>  The end of the saber, where the handle will be placed, is additionally strengthened with tape or pasted with self-adhesive.  The pen can be made oval, as in the photo in the article, or a strip, fortified on both sides, as on the standard version of the weapon.  You can tie the satin ribbon to the handle of the saber and hang it on the shoulder or belt. </p><h2>  Silver blade </h2><p>  The next version of the saber looks quite impressive thanks to the shiny coating.  The paper should be thick.  An ideal material for the manufacture of such weapons would be corrugated cardboard packaging, in addition, folded in two layers.  The edge of the saber blade is rounded off with scissors, and both halves of the cardboard on the inside are smeared with PVA glue.  For better gluing of the strips, place the workpiece under the press. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brilliant saber" class="if uuid-3080235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080235.jpg"></div><p>  For the handle, you need to draw a template with edges of different thicknesses.  Attach the larger side from the blade side.  The entire surface must be carefully pasted with silver colored paper, self-adhesive can be used.  The handle is isolated separately, bandaged several times with black tape or electrical tape. </p><h2>  Origami from paper </h2><p>  How to make a saber from A4 sheets by folding in the origami technique, we will describe in detail below in the article: </p><ol><li>  Fold one A4 sheet in half horizontally.  Then lay this blank on top of a flat sheet and all together roll up with a tight tube.  Attach the edge to the last turn with a glue stick. </li><li>  Take the next A4 sheet and fold it in half horizontally.  Then bend the corners inward until joining the center line. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="origami sabers" class="if uuid-3085547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3085547.jpg"></div></li><li>  A similar action is performed with those angles that appeared after the previous folding. </li><li>  On the workpiece from both sides you will see short even sections remaining on the sides of the sheet.  They also need to be deployed in the middle. </li><li>  Fold the resulting part in half, smoothing all the fold lines with your fingers. </li><li>  Re-open the workpiece and reshape the blade with a thinner edge.  To do this, wrap the last folds another 1 cm inward and fold the paper again in half.  Before you will be the shape of a sword blade. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an origami saber" class="if uuid-3080321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080321.jpg"></div><h2>  How to connect parts </h2><p>  It remains to connect all the parts together.  To do this, insert the tube twisted first in the inner fold of the blade and secure the connection with glue.  It remains to make the handle.  To do this, the A4 sheet is folded in half horizontally, and then each half is brought to the center line by folding equal strips.  It turns out a thin flat strip with an oncoming fold in the middle. </p><p>  Cut a length of 4 cm along the bend with scissors and insert a blade with a tube into the cut.  Attach the joint with glue.  It remains to bend the handle out of paper and fix it to the other end of the tube with glue. </p><p>  To do everything right, we suggest you watch the video tutorial. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="YtAdpg1pTvU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtAdpg1pTvU&amp;feature=share" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/5/4/7/14547.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to make a saber out of paper in different ways.
