And already in the afternoon, it almost falls to zero.  This is not the first year that manufacturers of mobile equipment have been struggling.  They, like TRIZ inventors, are looking for alternative solutions.  However, an increase in battery capacity invariably introduces not the best adjustments to the ergonomics of the device.  One of the breakthroughs in this area is the Lenovo Vibe P1M smartphone, reviews of which confirm this fact. </p><h2>  A brief set of technical specifications </h2>

    <p>  The Lenovo Vibe P1M smartphone, reviews of which spread quickly on the international network, is unlikely to qualify for the title of Honored Flagship.  However, according to ordinary users, it can pleasantly surprise potential buyers.  Let's try to find these parameters and consider the rest. </p><p>  To be precise, we have before us a typical representative of the class of smartphones, made in a form factor known as a candy bar.  The SIM card will have to be processed according to the Micro standard.  The device works in networks such as GSM.  Data transfer is carried out due to EDGE, HSPA technologies.  An option with LTE 4G is also possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Platform and chips </h2><p>  Many people have appreciated the Lenovo Vibe P1M smartphone.  Customer reviews indicate its good performance.  People rate it for a solid four.  The device runs on the Android operating system version 5.1.  Two gigabytes of RAM are built into it, however, the user is available for applications to use order of 1.5 GB.  At the same time, the amount of internal memory for storing user data is 16 GB.  This is without taking into account external media.  Micro SD cards up to 32 gigabytes are supported. </p><h2>  Protection and battery life </h2>

    <p>  In its class, this is one of the most competitive devices - the Lenovo Vibe P1M 16 GB smartphone.  Reviews indicate that the device is equipped with special devices to protect against moisture and dust.  For his 13 thousand rubles, such a move can not be appreciated by lovers of mobile devices.  By the way, the device uses a lithium-polymer battery.  It is designed for 4 thousand milliamps per hour.  The battery is non-removable, unfortunately.  Despite this, the Lenovo Vibe P1M Dual SIM smartphone is able to work for a long time: the reviews of its owners suggest that the gadget can work up to 16 hours on third-generation cellular networks.  In <span>standby mode,</span> the operating time will be about 564 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen and processor </h2><p>  Probably, the latter was worth mentioning in the item ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  But since we did not do this, we will try to link the operation of the central processor with the screen.  There is a typical display with a diagonal of five inches.  The picture is displayed in HD quality.  This means that we are dealing with a resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels.  To build the screen, an IPS matrix was used.  She allowed to reduce eye strain. </p><p>  According to users, even if the color rendition is at the level, it‚Äôs impossible to call it excellent either.  The density of dots is 294 pixels per inch.  The capacitive display responds to five simultaneous touches.  This is the maximum value.  And as a processor, we have here a real "work of art" from MediaTek.  The core consists of four cores.  Operating frequency - 1 gigahertz.  Enough to solve even non-trivial tasks, as well as to work in multitasking mode.  However, demanding applications will freeze, unfortunately. </p><h2>  Camera and interfaces </h2>

    <p>  Lenovo P1M Vibe Dual, reviews of which were left in large numbers by customers on the company's official resource, has a main camera module with a resolution of eight megapixels.  The device is equipped with an automatic focus function on the subject.  Customers are pleased that the video is available with a frame rate of 30 pieces per second and a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, there is a flash for creating photos in low light conditions.  The front camera module is designed for five megapixels.  Among the communication capabilities it is necessary to highlight Wi-Fi, operating in the b, g and n bands, ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.1, the presence of an LTE module.  Then everything is according to the standard.  The same MicroUSB version 2.0, a 3.5 mm headphone input.  That‚Äôs probably all we need to know. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  With its bundle, it is unlikely to surprise the Lenovo Vibe P1M Onyx.  Reviews about him at first literally blew up the Internet.  But then, as ordinary people write, it turned out that the set is not so rich.  Although a certain quality of accessories is present.  When we open the box, we can immediately find the charger.  Its output voltage is 5.2 volts.  There is also a Micro USB cable.  There are also simple headphones for listening to music or radio.  These are the same inserts.  Of course, they will come off as a headset if there is simply no alternative.  In another case, using them makes no sense. </p><h2>  Design and appearance features </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the device does not give unambiguous ideas about it.  Opinions remain controversial.  How many specialists - so many of them.  But they all agree that the phone is actually made for a much smaller amount than it looks.  The designers achieved this by polishing the side edging of the device.  They also processed the camera lens, the display edge and each of the keys.  This most expensive shine really confuses everyone.  Such processing is most often found in metal smartphones.  And when we take our device, we expect to feel the cold.  But it was not there. </p><p>  Probably, the first disappointment awaits us right away about what the Lenovo Vibe P1M Black smartphone is made of.  User reviews describe that it, like versions made in other colors, is completely made of plastic materials.  However, you do not have to get used to it for a long time.  It turns out that the plastic is of acceptable quality.  It is very pleasant to the touch, and practical.  For example, the back cover is made of soft-touch.  It has gritty sidewalls.  We can say that designers work out their money with interest.  They worked hard, took into account the tiniest flaws.  We can‚Äôt find fault with any element of the exterior, even if we really want to.  There is simply no reason.  The same can be said about build quality.  This is not the highest mark, but a solid four will do.  There is a slight creak when bending the side panels.  But claims to the back cover will not work.  She is tough, strong, fat. </p><h2>  Smartphone Lenovo Vibe P1M White.  Reviews, ergonomics </h2><p>  In terms of colors, the Chinese company did not become sophisticated.  She simply followed the principle of classic design.  An example was the smartphone Lenovo Vibe P1M, reviews of which are not much different from its white brother.  In any case, the device has fairly typical dimensions, which are characteristic of modern state employees.  Well, the exception may be thickness.  In our case, it is 9.35 millimeters.  The mass of the device is 148 grams.  Such characteristics, far from being characteristic of ultra class smartphones, are the result of embedding a battery with a capacity of 4 thousand milliamps per hour. </p>

    <p>  Such conditions are not very favorable for reducing overall characteristics.  Despite this, the company's designers and engineers made every effort to achieve this goal.  This should include visual methods.  There are also tactile features.  We are talking, for example, about beveled edges.  They partially hide the thickness of the smartphone.  By the way, it is no coincidence that plastic was chosen as the material for manufacturing.  If you use metal, you get an ugly mini-brick.  Designers brought the balancing system to mind.  As a result, we have a strong, we can say, soundly knocked down smartphone, which nevertheless does not tire the hand even with long-term use. </p><h2>  Controls </h2><p>  The connectors along with the buttons are quite typical for the company's smartphones.  On the right side we can find the screen lock key.  A pair of buttons for adjusting the volume and changing the sound mode is located a little higher.  Everything is quite prosaic here.  The only thing that stands out is the elements: they are unusually biased down.  For fingers, at first, this arrangement is unusual.  However, buyers claim that you get used to everything.  And this case is no exception. </p><p>  The lower edge contains holes that are responsible, respectively, for the output of the microphone and speaker.  The left side is also interesting.  There is only one button, it can be called a slider.  When moving, it activates the power saving mode or, conversely, turns it off.  In the upper part we can see the interface connectors, the location of which for Lenovo has already become a tradition.  There are two inputs here: one for wired headphones with a standard of 3.5 millimeters, and the second for a MicroUSB cable. </p>

    <p>  The front panel will appear completely black if the device‚Äôs display is turned off.  This small detail, which was taken into account by designers, pleased buyers, we will not hide it.  At the top of the screen we can see the traditional layout.  It consists of an indicator that signals missed events, a speaker, a front camera.  "To taste" added brightness and proximity sensors.  Which, in principle, is characteristic of a telephone whose price is 13 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  There is no need to talk about surprises.  Although it is not so surprising if we take into account the price of a smartphone.  A typical IPS matrix can be distinguished.  The screen has a diagonal of five inches.  With such indicators, the picture on the display is displayed in HD quality, that is, our resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  The inhabitants say that it‚Äôs far from perfect, of course, but the image quality is far from bad.  Rather, characteristic of more or less good budget smartphones. </p><p>  Having examined the levels of brightness and contrast, you can proceed to calibrate them.  But there is not much room for action.  You can read the text in natural light, buyers do not complain about it.  Everything is in order and with viewing angles.  But what pleased us was a good, high-quality <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  It avoids fast sticking of prints.  And when this happens, you can quickly and easily erase them. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The subject of our review is equipped with a fairly efficient processor family MediaTek.  This is the MT6735m chipset.  We can say that the four cores "Cortex-A53" do a good job with the tasks that are set before the processor.  The clock frequency of each of them is 1 gigahertz, but there can be no talk of greater acceleration.  As a graphics accelerator installed "Mali-T720."  In principle, such a link makes it possible to work effectively in multitask mode without failures and freezes.  Although the so-called heavy toys will behave not quite adequately.  Due to insufficient processor operation, the frame rate drops significantly compared to lighter, simpler options. </p><p>  Even with the maximum load of the processor and the smartphone as a whole, we almost do not feel that the case is warm.  It's good.  But I would like to mention here, probably, the most important detail: the developers worked on saving power.  And although the lithium-polymer battery itself is rather big, the energy-saving functions have played into the hands, as they say.  Among other pleasant features of the hardware, according to the owners of the smartphone, we can name the presence of two gigabytes of RAM.  It, of course, is not fully available for custom tasks.  But to argue that this is a winning solution proposed by a Chinese company to its potential customers is difficult.  From long-term memory (16 GB), about 12-14 are available.  Wireless interfaces include Bluetooth 4.1, as well as LTE.  You can use two SIM cards of the Micro standard. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  On the official website of the manufacturer, the smartphone Lenovo Vibe P1M Black is described in detail.  Customer reviews are also there.  People write that they were pleasantly surprised when they took the device out of the box.  They found that it was running the Android 5.1 operating system.  The Chinese manufacturer has embedded in the software and its shell, so to speak, a proprietary solution.  If someone does not know, then we will tell that his feature is the ability to select a specific visual theme.  For smartphones, this is a traditional move.  The P1M model has a fairly large number of pre-installed programs and services.  Many of the users will probably think that the software does not carry any payload.  Perhaps it is.  However, its installation during repeated tests did not affect the overall performance.  Therefore, talking about this is hardly worth it. </p>

    <p>  I would like to thank the software engineers and developers of the shell for the fact that they worked hard on the interface.  Even after a short use, you already understand that everything works quickly, quickly, without any time delays.  This is what is truly uncharacteristic for the smartphone offered to customers at this price.  Stability, efficiency - these are the distinguishing features of this device compared to other competitors.  During the tests, no abnormal phenomena and crashes in the shell were noticed. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  Here again, everything revolves around the cost of Lenovo Vibe P1M Black.  Reviews say that, on the one hand, one does not have to expect any sky-high results from a smartphone from this price category.  On the other hand, to say that the situation with the photographic capabilities of the device is bad, the language does not turn around.  Rather, there is a positive standard for a smartphone of the corresponding class.  We are waiting for the main camera of eight megapixels and a front camera for five units.  Self-portrait lovers, by the way, will appreciate these modules. </p>

    <p>  There is one interesting pattern.  It manifests itself in the fact that the quality of the images taken will be directly proportional to the level of lighting at the shooting location.  People who bought a smartphone indicate that it will be very difficult to get a good frame with increased sharpness in rainy, sunny weather.  There is a certain set of standard settings that you can twist to squeeze the maximum quality out of the cameras.  Video is recorded in a resolution of 720 pixels, but you can also lower it.  To conclude, to summarize: the camera can take good pictures.  But not masterpieces, that's for sure. </p><h2>  Phone Lenovo Vibe P1M.  Reviews </h2><p>  What can people who purchased this model of the Chinese device tell?  Based on the feedback from two online technology stores.  Thanks to them, it was possible to find out that the positive features are such elements as a productive processor, working in conjunction with a considerable amount of RAM, an energy-efficient lithium-polymer battery.  Users note that the LTE module works well, without failures.  But what they do not like about the phone is not the best (in contrast) screen and not very high-quality cameras.  Although, with skillful handling and good conditions, they are able to take quite decent pictures.  The rest of the device is fully consistent with the cost for which it is offered on the market.  Especially considering the smooth operation of software and the operating system. </p>
