    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa is located on an atoll called Ari.  It is located about a hundred kilometers from Male International Airport.  It should be noted that Ari is one of the largest atolls of the archipelago, which stretches for 33 kilometers from west to east and 96 from north to south. </p><p>  To be more precise, the hotel is located on a small island called Diffushi.  This is the southern part of Ari.  Very cozy little island.  Its dimensions are 700 meters long and 140 meters wide.  The beach here is within easy reach.  But the airport is far, but it is fearless.  Indeed, from there to the island can be reached in 35 minutes by seaplane.  Or spend 2.5 hours going to the hotel on a boat. </p><p>  Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa is popular for many reasons.  Largely precisely because the hotel is a complex of small comfortable bungalows, which have everything you need for a secluded holiday.  However, there is still much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa provides a variety of services.  Except the internet.  He is here, but in public areas.  And besides it is expensive - $ 1 per minute.  However, few people need the Internet here. </p><p>  A paid transfer from the airport and back is provided, there is a photocopy and fax machine, a small gift shop at the hotel, and a currency exchange.  There is a laundry service, and guests are also offered room service.  The hotel also has its own doctor and can be called, but at an additional cost. </p><p>  In the open air, by the way, there is a barbecue and terrace. </p>

    <h2>  SPA center </h2><p>  The name of the hotel clearly hints that it has its own spa complex.  And there is.  In the SPA-center of the hotel you can enjoy not only a sauna, a bath and a hammam.  Here they make sand massage with coconut oil, bathing in flower baths, body wraps, scrubs, cosmetic procedures for face and body care.  You can also take time for aroma and hydrotherapy.  The so-called Ayurvedic procedures are also carried out.  For example, scalp massage with hot oil.  Or stone therapy.  Which is commonly known as <span>hot stone massage.</span> </p><p>  Clients of the SPA-salon of the hotel can be any guest over 12 years old, but all procedures, without exception, are available only to adults.  And children under 12 years old are not allowed in the SPA center without adult supervision. </p><p>  By the way, the salon also has separate treatment rooms for couples in love, where they can enjoy massages and other services together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

In addition to this, they organize barbecue on the beach and various themed evenings. </p><p>  There is a coffee shop where guests can enjoy excellent natural coffee, snacks and pastries.  And yet, even if you can‚Äôt bring and drink alcohol in the hotels and on the beaches in the Maldives, there is a separate disco bar for this.  It works around the clock, and from 18:30 to 19:30 discounts apply.

    <h2>  Bungalow </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel consists of numerous villas.  They are small - 26 square meters.  m, but very comfortable.  Inside there is one large double bed.  Although there is a bungalow with two separate, standard.  All villas are located along the beach, so that all windows offer amazing views of the azure Indian Ocean. </p><p>  Each bungalow has a patio.  The rooms include satellite TV, a safe, powerful air conditioning, a separate seating area, and a spacious bathroom.  It has a shower, free toiletries and a toilet.  There is also a bathtub. </p><p>  And of course, the rooms have a refrigerator, minibar, hairdryer and fan.

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  I must say that the prices for accommodation here are quite modest when compared with other Maldivian places.  They, of course, can vary, as elsewhere.  For example, it‚Äôs more expensive to relax here in winter, and cheaper in summer.  But even taking into account these nuances, it turns out pretty modestly.  For example, a rest week for two in October will be 80,000 rubles (breakfast included).  And if you manage to get the discounts that Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa 4 * often offers, the Standard-room will cost even less.  For example, 60 thousand rubles - this is possible. </p><p>  It should be noted that you will have to pay a separate tax for accommodation (12%), environmental tax and room service (11.2%).  Also, $ 252 must be paid for the transfer (per person) for all accommodation. </p>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  We must not forget to mention the reviews that people who had a rest on holiday at Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa.  All comments are exclusively positive.  As people say, it is worth going here to those who want a quiet and secluded vacation.  An ideal place for lovers of nature and aesthetics. </p><p>  The main entertainment here is the study of the underwater world.  This is indicated by all the reviews left about Holiday Island Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  The underwater world is amazing, you may not even notice how a few hours spent in the process of diving into the ocean fly by.  Be sure to bring a mask and even flippers with you.  Nearby is a reef, you can swim there and even go.  But this will require shorts with special shoes, so as not to get hurt.  However, it is better to go swimming to explore the underwater world with the instructors who are available here.  Since the Indian Ocean is inhabited not only by harmless creatures, but also moray eels, manti and sharks.  And the instructors know safe places where you can admire fish, turtles and get acquainted with dolphins. </p><p>  By the way, even guests are advised to sign up for night fishing.  What they can catch is cooked in a restaurant.  It‚Äôs also advisable to book a trip to a place like Sun Island.  There, guests are given the opportunity to feed sharks and stingrays. </p><p>  Many guests praise the level of staff training.  All polite, courteous and unobtrusive.  Of course, they do not speak Russian (but they try to please guests from Russia with a basic vocabulary), so you need to take a phrase book with you on a trip.  By the way, if you ask to organize a romantic dinner for two, they will do everything in the best possible way. </p><p>  In general, it definitely won‚Äôt be bored here.  In the evenings, parties are held here, discos, karaoke and even such an unusual show as crab races - an original national entertainment.  Therefore, if you have the opportunity and want an unforgettable and vivid experience, silence, solitude and aesthetic pleasure, it is worth going to these places. </p>
