The device and principle of operation of the thermal imager</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the summer, when the street is warm, few people think about the need to warm an apartment or a private house.  Meanwhile, with the advent of winter, it begins to pass through from under windows or on walls so that you have to get heaters out of the pantry and wrap yourself in a rug.  And now the owner would be happy to warm the room, but it is not known where the walls and windows have problem areas, where the heat leaves and the cold air comes in.  A thermal imager can help in solving this issue.  How to use a similar device, by what principle it works - this is the topic that today's article will talk about. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.testo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal imaging principle" class="if uuid-3071198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071198.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a similar device </h2><p>  A thermal imager is a device that can capture the surface temperature and display data about it on the screen.  It works according to a similar algorithm with <span>a night vision device (night vision device)</span> based on infrared radiation, which is converted into a signal that is displayed.  The picture on the screen is displayed in various colors, from red (hot area) to blue (cold).  Warning the question of how the thermal imager differs from <span>the night-vision device</span> , it should be noted that the NVD captures the reflected signal, while the device considered today ‚Äúcatches‚Äù infrared radiation coming from objects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first such devices appeared in the thirties of the last century.  Of course, they were bulky and had practically nothing to do with modern similar devices.  The exception is infrared radiation.  It was precisely this that drew the ‚Äútemperature map‚Äù on the photo target.  The principle of operation of thermal imagers of those years could be compared with a cathode ray tube. </p><h2>  Areas of application of thermal imagers in everyday life and in production </h2><p>  A similar device is really unique.  Examination of the house with a thermal imager will give a concrete picture of the problem areas where there are leaks.  This will allow you to insulate exactly those places where it is necessary, which will save you from unnecessary, unnecessary expenses.  Thermal imagers are also convenient when examining a home electrical network - all poorly made contacts will be in full view, because their temperature is much higher.  Overloaded wires are also heated, which means that the device will help to identify them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal imaging at home" class="if uuid-3071188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071188.jpg"></div><p>  The device is widely used in the defense industry.  With its help, volley fire guidance systems, aviation and missile sighting systems work.  Recently, thermal imagers began to be used in the sights of small arms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device is very useful in search operations when it is necessary to find people under the rubble.  For firefighters, it will also not be useless - with its help you can find the foci remaining under a layer of ash or logs and prevent re-ignition.  Medicine, industry, automotive and even astronomy - the thermal imager is used in any field. </p><h2>  Hunting thermal imager and its features </h2><p>  These are quite compact devices, which does not prevent them from possessing almost the same functionality as a full-fledged professional device.  With it, in the forest you can see the animal at a distance of several hundred meters.  Hunting thermal imagers also draw outlines, so it is impossible to confuse the beast with a person.  They work both in the dark, at dusk, and in a blizzard or rain.  The problem with the purchase of such equipment can only be the cost, which is quite high. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gunsandoptics.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal imager review" class="if uuid-3071192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071192.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of similar devices </h2><p>  Such devices can be divided into 2 main groups: </p><ul><li>  Stationary - used in the shops of enterprises to control the operating modes of electric motors and other equipment.  At the same time, all data is displayed on the monitors of the attendant console, which controls the indicators.  These are quite powerful thermal imagers, requiring separate cooling for the normal functioning.  For these purposes, liquid nitrogen is most often used.  The temperature range of the indicators measured by such devices ranges from -50 Àö to +2000 Àö. </li><li>  Portable (mobile) - convenient devices with a built-in screen that allow you to see in real time a leak or a heat source, directing the device to the area being checked.  Most often they have the ability to connect to a personal computer to provide processing of the received data, and the connection can be either wired or Wi-Fi, which is also very convenient.  All data goes through the cloud storage.  How to make such a connection can be found in the instructions for the thermal imager. </li></ul><h2>  What to look for when choosing </h2><p>  By purchasing such a device, it should be understood that quite expensive equipment is bought, and the error will cost quite an impressive amount.  Therefore, the choice should be approached carefully, thoughtfully and carefully, paying attention to some parameters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vpelectricllc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between a thermal imager and a night vision device" class="if uuid-3071211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071211.jpg"></div><p>  The temperature range of the measurement is very important.  With its growth, the price will increase.  But the step should be as small as possible.  The second thing to consider is the resolution of the IR detector and screen.  It depends on how accurate the readings and visible changes will be. </p><p>  Display, transmission, storage of data is a separate story.  A thermal imager with built-in memory or the ability to connect a drive is ideal.  But overpaying a double amount, despite the fact that the device already costs a lot, for a Wi-Fi module is an unjustified waste. </p><h2>  Do I need extra lenses: expert opinion </h2><p>  Professionals believe that such an acquisition is justified only in the case of organizations examining a home with a thermal imager.  They can be of two types.  Telescopic help when shooting the upper floors of a tall building, giving added clarity to the picture, and wide-angle allow you to see the whole structure when there is no way to move back. </p><p>  For household use in such lenses is not necessary.  After all, the owner of the apartment does not need to shoot the whole house - all you need is your windows.  And even if they are located high enough, a similar device can show a heat leak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal imager instruction" class="if uuid-3071214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071214.jpg"></div><h2>  Requirements for a specialist working with similar equipment </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning right away that this topic applies to employees of audit organizations.  Requirements are determined by regulatory documents - SNiP and GOST.  According to their provision, the rules for conducting the audit are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the inspector must know in all details how the thermal imager works, be able to use it, have all the permissions and licenses on hand; </li><li>  Before inspecting buildings, the device must be verified, as noted in its technical passport; </li><li>  it is forbidden to work with the thermal imager in rain or snow - the readings may be incorrect; </li><li>  the temperature difference in the room and outside it is mandatory, if it is absent, the device will not be able to catch any leaks; </li><li>  when making repeated measurements from another angle, make sure that the distance to the object is the same; </li><li>  when performing paid inspections, the auditor‚Äôs admission must be marked with the cost of the service. </li></ul><h2>  Thermal leak test building conditions </h2><p>  You should not think that all that is needed for accurate measurements is to know how to use the thermal imager.  This is enough for household checks for personal purposes.  But if complex measurements are required, some natural factors must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aabtools.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hunting thermal imager" class="if uuid-3071186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071186.jpg"></div><p>  Wind speed.  This parameter must not exceed 7 m / s.  Otherwise, a shift in heat leakage may be observed, which will not allow pointing to it with an accuracy of a centimeter.  The structure itself should not be in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdirect sunlight for 12 hours before making measurements.  It is for this reason that such checks are carried out late at night or in the early morning, at dawn. </p><h2>  The device for independent measurements: an overview of thermal imagers and which is better to purchase </h2><p>  For such purposes, do not choose too expensive equipment.  After all, it will have many functions that the home master will not use, which means that there is no point in overpaying for them.  But a too cheap option is not suitable here.  If the device costs less than 20,000 rubles, you should not pay attention to it.  After all, low cost is an occasion to think about whether the thermal imager will work longer than 10 minutes.  or will fail the first time you press a button. </p><p>  Normal devices of the middle price category are devices worth over 50,000 rubles.  up to 200,000 rubles., not counting additional lenses (if they are required).  If we talk about professional thermal imagers with a wide range of functions, then they will have to pay more than half a million (the cost is indicated as of December 2018). </p><p>  You can learn a little more about thermal imagers from the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="3MAtvM4Rr0U" data-url="https://youtu.be/3MAtvM4Rr0U" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/1/7/6/14176.jpg"></div><h2>  Some models worth noting </h2><p>  There are a lot of manufacturers of such products.  Therefore, it makes sense to superficially consider some of their models. </p><p>  For domestic use, the RGK TL-70 device, worth about 60,000 rubles, is perfect.  Understanding how to use the thermal imager will not be difficult - the instructions are clear, understandable and without unnecessary, unnecessary information.  The measurement range is small - from -20 Àö to +150 Àö, but this is quite enough for household measurements of both heat leakage and heating of contacts and cables of the home electrical network. </p><p>  Another device worth noting is the Fluke TiS10.  Its cost is slightly higher - about 69,000 rubles, but at the same time using the device is much simpler.  There is no need to focus, everything is done automatically.  The temperature range is from -20 Àö to +250 Àö.  Has a built-in 4 Gb memory + support for removable media up to 4 Gb. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dna-tools.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal imager" class="if uuid-3071203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3071203.jpg"></div><h2>  Can a smartphone replace a thermal imager </h2><p>  Today, the Network offers a lot of programs and devices that, according to the manufacturer, make it possible to turn a regular pocket gadget into a device for detecting heat leaks.  The additional equipment connected to the smartphone will cost the consumer 20,000‚Äì25,000 rubles, but hardly anyone can vouch for the quality of shooting and the accuracy of measurements.  No matter what promises the manufacturer makes, such a device is very far from a conventional thermal imager.  Even if for comparison, choose a cheap option with a cost not exceeding 25,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The acquisition of such a device is not a cheap pleasure.  However, in some cases, such a purchase will be justified.  After all, having figured out how to use a thermal imager, you can help solve problems of heat leakage to others, and, possibly, not for free.  In any case, if funds permit, a thermal imager is worth buying - it certainly will not be lying dead in the pantry. </p>
