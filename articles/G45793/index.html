  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper boat: classic version and application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each child's acquaintance with the art of origami begins with the making of a boat out of paper with his own hands.  They love to do such crafts as preschool children and school students.  Do not forget the skills of folding a sheet of paper adults and pass on the skills to their kids. </p><p>  The fastest and most convenient way to build a boat out of paper is the classic version of its execution.  Origami art is not only entertainment in your free time, creating figures of animals, flowers or technology, the child develops motor skills of hands and fingers, improves motor memory and voluntary attention.  In the process of work it is required not only to remember the sequence of movements, but also to bring accuracy to work, perseverance and attentiveness. </p><p>  Now many children suffer from hyperactivity, can not sit still for a couple of minutes.  Origami classes, namely folding paper boats, will force the child to concentrate on a specific matter in a playful way, to show purposefulness.  And this is a lot. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to correctly make origami crafts out of paper, what you need for this, how you can subsequently play with a boat. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  If you decide to make a boat of paper with your baby, then prepare everything in advance.  It will take two sheets of thick paper A-4.  One will serve to fold the mother‚Äôs sample, the other to train the child.  So that the baby could cope well, you can provide him with a <span>diagram of a boat made of paper.</span>  A step-by-step explanation will be told to him by an adult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To keep all folds even, advise your child to use a pencil or ruler.  If, after folding, these objects are folded, it will turn out to be clear and well bent. </p><p>  If you make a craft as a gift to dad on February 23, then you can prepare paints, pencils or wax crayons for coloring the craft.  A boat made of colored paper or an analogue with a print will look beautiful.  How it can be additionally decorated, we will consider after studying the detailed scheme for making crafts. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  The first training work is best done from plain white paper.  Sheet A-4 is located vertically.  The rectangle folds in half.  Finger or pencil is carried out along the bend so that it is even.  Then the leaf bends again in half, only the action is already horizontal.  This will determine the center line of this rectangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy-is-fun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper boat manufacturing scheme" class="if uuid-2412772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2412772.jpg"></div><h2>  Continue work </h2><p>  Seeing a line in front of you in the center of the sheet, you need to take the corners and pull them down.  The outer edges are lowered so that a right angle forms.  The folds are carefully smoothed so that the triangles do not open.  From the bottom there are thin strips that need to be turned up.  To do this, gently lift the part in front of the workpiece, thoroughly wipe the edge with your finger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then the future boat turns from paper to the back side and similar actions are performed.  The blank for the center is taken by hands and opened so that a square is obtained.  In the diagram, you can consider the sample at number 6. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crafthubs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boat with sails" class="if uuid-2412751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2412751.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to raise the lower corners up on one side and, turning the back side, repeat the action again.  The origami of the boat continues by revealing the triangle.  This is necessary for the last action, namely with two hands to stretch the upper edges in opposite directions. </p><p>  To make the craft look neat, you need to pin it down with your hands and walk your finger along all the fold lines.  Now you know <span>how to make a boat</span> out of paper. </p><h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  You can decorate the vessel with sails attached on thin sticks in the center of the craft.  For such purposes, cocktail sticks are also suitable, on which triangles of bright colored double-sided paper are glued.  If this product was created by a child for the purpose of a gift, then the sides of the vessel can be decorated with applique, glued portholes, draw an anchor with felt-tip pens.  Then it is better to use glossy paper.  It is bright and beautifully shiny. </p><div class="photo" data-original="heartstonepaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boats in the game" class="if uuid-2412767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2412767.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes boats are made to create a picture of the seascape.  Then the boat is glued to a sheet of cardboard, waves are drawn.  You can attach a rope with triangular small flags to the boat. </p><h2>  How to play? </h2><p>  Children‚Äôs paper boats can be launched both in the bath and in a natural pond with small waves.  Having planted the little men from the Lego designer in them, you can play with friends on the beach.  Sea battles and ship wrecks are not terrible, as you can always quickly make a new ship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.libertatea.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boat tests on water" class="if uuid-2412783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2412783.jpg"></div><p>  Not only kids love paper boats, but also serious adults.  Many times around the world, tests were carried out to conquer the expanses of rivers and lakes.  Attempts were made in different countries of the world.  For example, in London on Lake Southwark, a beautiful girl named Morwenna Wilson crossed the distance from one shore to another in a paper boat.  She is a descendant of the famous English engineer Brunel, who in the 19th century was engaged in naval equipment. </p><p>  So, learn to make paper boats.  Perhaps on one of them later you will conquer your water open spaces. </p>
