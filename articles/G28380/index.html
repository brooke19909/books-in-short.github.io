    <p>  But when Alexander Ivanovich Osipov became the director, the construction of the hay hangar, the strengthening of cages, the reconstruction of the roof over the Winter Garden, and the construction of the grain warehouse began immediately.  Further, a summer arbor for birds, a veterinary corner, and new aviaries and housing for animals were built on the territory already. </p><p>  Huge efforts were made to form the collection, and as a result, the number of species increased three times, and there were nine more copies.  Already not only the house, but also the birthplace for animals has become a zoo.  Lipetsk became one of the few cities in which the aquaterrarium first appeared.  At the moment, boas and anacondas, skinks, <span>bearded agamas</span> and many other types of exotic animals live there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Twelve years ago, Lipetsk Park became a member of the Euro-Asian Regional Association of Zoos and Aquariums (EARAZA).
