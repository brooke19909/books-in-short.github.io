First of all, the documents should contain complete and reliable information about the position of the company, the results of its business activities.  In this case, the main criterion is compliance with the requirements enshrined in regulatory enactments of control bodies.  If during the compilation of any data is not enough, the documentation should be supplemented with the necessary indicators and explanations. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The company may not comply with the order on the completeness of the information provided, if it is impossible to obtain the required indicators for objective reasons.  The data that is collected in the process of generating financial documentation should be neutral.  In particular, it is understood that information cannot affect decisions made by interested users who evaluate the information provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 PBU 4 99 financial statements of the organization" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1676795.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  Data complexity </h2><p>  This requirement is considered one of the key.  The information presented in the reports should contain indicators reflecting the results of the activities of all structural units of the organization, representative offices, other units, including those that maintain independent balances.  Documents must be compiled sequentially.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account the continuity of the structure of forms in which indicators are recorded for different time periods.  Accordingly, the forms containing information used for the subsequent preparation of the balance should be permanent.  They can be changed only in exceptional cases.  For example, when switching to another type of activity.  At the same time, the enterprise should be ready to justify the changes, making explanations to the financial documentation.  Reporting must be formed taking into account the continuity of results for different periods.  If discrepancies are identified, the specialist who is preparing the documentation may adjust the indicators.  At the same time, he needs to provide explanations of the operations performed in the appendices to the report and balance sheet. </p><h2>  Specificity of information reflection </h2><p>  There are several nuances that should be considered when working with PBU.  Consider the main ones.  First of all, the indicators of liabilities, assets, expenses, and revenues of the company are reflected separately if they are essential for a reliable analysis of the state of the enterprise.  If they are not of particular importance for assessing the financial position of the company, they can be included in additions to the report and balance sheet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="PBU 4 99 financial statements of the organization briefly" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1676798.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <h2>  Key dates and periods </h2><p>  They are given special attention in PBU.  The key date is the last day of the year.  The reporting period is equal to the calendar year.  For a newly registered company, it is a time period from the date of registration until December 31.  In this case, one should take into account the nuance.  If the company is registered after October 1, then for it the reporting year lasts from the date of registration until 12/31 of the next year. </p><h2>  Additional Rules </h2><p>  There are several more special requirements established in the PBU.  First of all, it is worth saying that each element of financial documentation must contain a set of mandatory details.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Company name. </li><li>  Reference period and date. </li><li>  Document's name. </li><li>  Information about the legal type. </li><li>  A way of reflecting indicators. </li></ol><p>  In the Order of the Ministry of Finance, it is also prescribed to draw up documentation in Russian, and use the ruble as a monetary unit.  Reporting must be certified by the head, ch.  accountant or other employee with the appropriate authority. </p><h2>  Balance sheet </h2><p>  There is a liability and an asset in it.  The indicators contained in them characterize the financial position of the company on the reporting day.  Assets and liabilities are classified into long- and short-term.  The latter include funds / debt, the period of use / repayment of which is less than a year.  For long-term assets / liabilities, the term is more than 12 months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="PBU 4 99 accounting reporting organization consultant" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1676799.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Loss statement </h2><p>  Based on the report, the income of the enterprise and its costs are classified.  The document reflects the results of business operations performed during the control period.  The analysis of the report is of particular practical importance for managers and interested users.  The results of the company show the level of its stability, solvency, payback. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  They contain explanations to the report and balance sheet.  The purpose of the applications, therefore, is the disclosure of information that is present in the financial documents provided for review to interested users.  In the explanations, the specialist, reporting, provides a justification for certain deviations from the rules, indicates their reason.  The annexes also reflect the financial consequences of the inconsistency with the standards governing the formation of financial documentation.  In additions to information sources, information may be present that relates directly to business operations performed by the enterprise.  As a result, interested users receive complete and reliable data on the financial condition of the company, their sources of income. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="PBU 4 99 financial statements of the organization" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1676808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The financial statements must comply with legal requirements, the provisions of local acts adopted by the organization, if necessary, in accordance with the policy.  Documents reflecting the financial condition of the company should be transparent and understandable to users.  If the experts had to refuse to apply these or other standards in reporting, this must be justified in the appendices.  The indicators presented in the documents should correspond to the actual state of affairs.  Otherwise, liability for false information is possible.  PBU corresponds with many regulations governing the formation of financial documentation.  In the regulatory act, far from all the nuances are disclosed.  Therefore, those responsible for reporting should have quick access to all other legal acts. </p>
