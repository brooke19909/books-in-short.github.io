    <p>  The Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach Hotel is very beautiful and new.  In real life, it looks much better than in brochures.  The hotel complex positions itself as a four-star hotel, in 2012 it passed certification. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach features non-smoking and smoking rooms.  The complex is quite suitable for both family vacations and business trips.  This is explained by the fact that on the one hand it is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach, and on the other hand, next to the business center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The number of rooms in the hotel complex is quite diverse, everyone can choose for themselves something interesting: </p><ol><li>  Superior Studio for 2 guests. </li><li>  Two-bedroom apartment for four guests. </li><li>  Three-bedroom room that can accommodate six people. </li><li>  Deluxe (for two adults and one child). </li><li>  Non smoking rooms. </li><li>  Suite. </li><li>  Four bedroom apartment. </li><li>  Suite rooms. </li></ol><p>  The hotel rooms are beautiful, new and very comfortable.

    <p>  The rooms are equipped with plasma TVs, Wi-Fi works fine.  Some apartments have balconies and some do not.  According to the reviews of the guests of the complex, of course, it is better to order apartments with a balcony, since it is necessary to constantly dry swimwear, not to mention washing things. </p><p>  The furniture in the rooms is new and without defects.  The cleaning is of high quality and is carried out daily, and at a time convenient for you.  As for the replenishment of tea, coffee, water, all supplies are updated every day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some rooms include kitchenettes with microwaves, freezers, dishwashers, and washing machines. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The Ramada Plaza <span>Jumeirah Beach</span> 4 * hotel does not have its own beach, like many other hotels.  Vacationers have several public beaches.  The coast is very close, so the road does not take more than five minutes.  Before leaving the hotel, vacationers receive beach sets consisting of an umbrella and towels. </p><p>  It's nice that the coast is cleaned daily.  This is not to say that you will not meet cigarette butts anywhere, but in general the sand is quite clean.  The beach is free for visitors, you can swim and relax at any time. </p><p>  The entire coast is fine white sand, lovers will appreciate this place.  And the sea is generally a separate topic for discussion.  It is incredibly warm and transparent here.  Of course, this is not surprising in such weather, but gradually you get so used to such a temperature of the water that the pool seems already cold.  Vacationers are also advised to definitely visit the city beach near the ‚ÄúSail‚Äù, it can be reached by sitting on the eighth bus near the hotel.  The peculiarity of this place is quite large waves, it is just worth a look. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In the Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach 4 * hotel several food options are possible.  Guests at the complex can order a la carte dishes or use the buffet option.  In addition, by purchasing a tour, you can pay for the most suitable meal option: full board or breakfast only. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has a main restaurant that serves international cuisine.  Vegetarian, baby and diet foods are also available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada plaza jumeirah beach residence" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1447550.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Breakfast starts at 6.30 and continues until 11.00.  The food in the restaurant is always fresh and tasty.  At least one kind of soup is served in the morning.  From the side dishes you can choose mashed potatoes, rice, potatoes.  There are always meat, fish, sometimes a seafood cocktail on the tables, as well as various cold snacks.  From fruits, as a rule, you can see melons, watermelons, pineapples, fruit salads. </p><p>  As for drinks, they are free only at breakfast, coffee pots and teapots are put on the tables, so you can pour yourself as much as you want.  In general, the food in the hotel is very good.  However, it should be understood that the hotel is four-star, so there will not be any special delights, lots of seafood.  At least no one remains hungry while relaxing in the Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach Residence 4 *.  Reviews of tourists regarding food are very positive. </p><p>  Those vacationers who are planning their first vacation in the UAE should know some nuances.  When purchasing a tour at an agency, you need to think about the type of food.  For example, if you are planning a trip in June, then be sure to take a full board, since this is Ramadan time, which means that all street cafes will be closed until evening.  Having breakfast at the hotel, lunch will be problematic.  Therefore, it will be much easier to eat at the hotel.  At any other time, food problems do not arise.  Around the hotel there is a resort area, in the territory of which there are plenty of food establishments. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach Residence is a large hotel that has everything you need for a wonderful holiday.  As such, there is no territory in the complex, so all the institutions are located in a multi-story building.  Perhaps this will not be very familiar to those who are used to Turkish resorts, but in Dubai this is quite normal.  Here, many hotels are multi-story buildings. </p><p>  The Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach Residence 4 * (Dubai) has free parking, a pool, a fitness center, a sauna, and a gift shop.  Animators work with children.  And for adults, entertainment shows are organized in the evenings.  The hotel can book a transfer. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very attentive and polite.  However, it is not always possible to find a person who knows the Russian language at the reception.  But in general, a language barrier does not arise, you can not even worry about this. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach Residence 4 *, you can use the local tour desk.  The UAE is an amazing country that you should definitely see.  Therefore, do not limit your vacation only to visiting the beach.  Experienced tourists are advised to definitely go and walk to the Dubai Mall.  There you can see a fascinating show of fountains.  It starts every evening at 18.30. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada plaza jumeirah beach residence 4 dubai" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1447553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Usually vacationers visit the gold market.  In addition, the fake market is especially popular, where you can buy a variety of branded items at bargain prices (of course, goods are skillful fakes). </p><p>  Walking around the city is quite interesting and entertaining.  Typically, such trips are some kind of dash between different shopping centers, which are nice and cool.  In the United Arab Emirates, as you know, it‚Äôs hot, but because air conditioning works at its full capacity almost everywhere: in supermarkets, buses, shopping centers, restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  Dubai has the tallest building in the world - the Burj Khalifa.  The height of this skyscraper is 828 meters, a total of 163 floors.  The building looks like a stalagmite, it was opened in January 2010. </p><p>  The skyscraper was originally built as the largest in the world, and therefore its height was kept secret.  The Dubai Tower was conceived as a "city within a city."  It houses apartments, a hotel, business offices.  The building was built on the basis of a special concrete mixture that withstands the heat.  Glasses do not let in the rays of the sun, which makes it possible to maintain the optimum temperature.  There are 57 elevators in the skyscraper.  But from the ground floor to the top floor you can only go up to the service.  All residents and visitors to the building move with transfers.  At the very top of the Burj Khalifa there is an observation deck - a favorite place for tourists. </p><p>  Another attraction is the musical fountain, which is a unique composition of sound, water and light.  It is located on the territory of an artificial lake in the heart of Dubai, near the Burj Khalifa.  Currently, this fountain is one of the largest in the world.  Its length is 275 meters, and the height of the jets reaches 150 meters.  The fountain gives out world hits in the voice of Whitney Houston, Andrea Bocelli, as well as numerous Arabic tunes.  This amazing and amazing sight is definitely a must see. </p><p>  Dubai is famous for its many kilometers of beaches, low prices for leather, fur and gold, but not everyone knows that there is a huge aquarium, the dimensions of which are comparable to a three-story house.  It is inhabited by various marine inhabitants.  The aquarium is even listed in the Guinness Book of Records.  It is a must-see, especially for tourists with children.  The aquarium is located <span>in the Dubai Mall.</span> </p><p>  The most amazing thing is that in the center of it there is a completely transparent tunnel that allows you to admire the marine inhabitants and take pictures against their background.  Sharks and stingrays look especially picturesque.  In the aquarium, you can swim with sharks, if you have the certificate of an experienced diver, or go in a boat with a glass bottom. </p><p>  Another attraction of the city is Al Mamzer Beach Park.  It has a large and beautiful territory.  The beach even received the Blue Flag.  In total, the park has five beaches located in the coves.  Each of them is equipped with showers and changing cabins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada plaza jumeirah beach residence 4 reviews" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1447555.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The park has playgrounds and exercise machines, as well as swimming pools, cafes.  There are few people here on weekdays.  However, after the closure of another park (Jumeirah Beach) in Al-Mamzer in 2014, more people are now flocking. </p><p>  Resting in Dubai, you just need to visit the Palm Islands, which are the second building of mankind, visible from space.  They were created by the country's authorities precisely to attract tourists and to increase territories at the expense of the Persian Gulf. </p><p>  The entire artificial archipelago consists of three islands, all of them are collected in a palm tree.  The largest of them is Palm Deira, and the other two are Palm Jebel Ali and <span>Palm Jumeirah.</span>  The islands are surrounded by barrier reefs to protect against waves. </p><p>  Resting with children, you must definitely go to the zoo.  This is a great place not only for children, but also for adults.  <span>Dubai Zoo</span> is considered the oldest in the entire Arabian Peninsula.  An interesting fact is that on its territory not palm trees grow, but deciduous trees familiar to us.  The park is home to 230 different animals and 400 reptiles. </p><p>  Dubai offers not only the world's best beaches, entertainment and shopping, but also an impressive list of attractions: from the highest skyscrapers to archaeological parks.  The metropolis is simply filled with unique places.  All the amazing sights are on the lands once conquered from the desert. </p><h2>  Hotel service: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach hotel (Dubai), I would like to turn to the reviews of tourists in order to have a more complete picture of the complex.  The hotel has a rather original entrance through the parking lot.  At first it seems rather strange, but then you realize that there are seven high-rise buildings very similar to each other nearby.  They occupy an entire quarter and have a huge underground parking.  The hotel also does not have a chic lobby, although in general this is not so important, the main thing is that the rooms are nice and spacious.  At the reception, two workers are greeted by guests, they are quickly relocated to apartments without hitches.  One of them speaks Russian, so there are no problems here. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that when settling they require to leave a deposit of one hundred dollars, which is certainly expensive.  If you talk, then the size of the collateral is reduced to three hundred dirhams.  This money is then returned when you leave.  From this amount you can deduct the cost of the drinks you consumed.  By the way, alcoholic cocktails in the hotel are very expensive (at least ten dollars). </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure: reviews </h2><p>  There are three elevators in Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach (photo in the article), so there are no queues near them.  Most vacationers prefer rooms with a view of the "Marina".  Unfortunately, not all rooms have balconies, which is not very convenient.  What is good Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach?  Guest reviews confirm a well-equipped apartment (there are even kitchenettes).  The presence of kitchen equipment is a huge plus of this place, since you don‚Äôt have to worry about kids eating if they don‚Äôt like local food.  And this happens very often, because nevertheless very pepper dishes are preferred here.  In addition, the apartments are spacious, new, furniture in them without damage.  Everything is organized at the proper level.  The hotel has two-story rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada plaza jumeirah beach tour from ufa" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1447556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The pool and sports bar are located on the terrace and are open from morning until ten in the evening. </p><p>  The hotel complex has four restaurants, among which stands out quite a famous Brazilian.  It is located on the thirty-fifth floor and has a beautiful view of Dubai. </p><p>  The hotel provides a shuttle service to the nearest Jumeirah beach.  However, you can safely walk to it, the road takes no more than five minutes.  There are two options: you can walk through the parking lot or through the territory of the Hilton Hotel. </p><p>  As we already mentioned, Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach 4 * captivates with a very convenient location.  Guest reviews are filled with tips on how to get to the most interesting places in Dubai from the hotel.  Near the hotel there is a subway.  The services of this type of transport should certainly be used at least in order to see it.  The metro really impresses with its beauty and cleanliness.  In addition, it has mainly land lines, and therefore you can see the city. </p><p>  If you are relaxing with a company, then it‚Äôs easier to get somewhere by taxi, it will be more profitable at a cost.  Just get ready for the fact that you can stand in line for a long time until you wait for the car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada plaza jumeirah beach residence 4" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1447557.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach (the description of the hotel is given in the article) has a wonderful view of the ‚ÄúDubai of Venice‚Äù.  The Dubai Marina area itself is very young and at the same time elite.  Its close location to the coast of Jumeirah has ensured the opening of many hotels for tourists seeking the sea.
