Nevertheless, it would be time to think about a summer vacation.  Some will go to the cottage and will be engaged in personal plots, some, for lack of these, will go to friends, someone will choose cozy Moscow resorts with massage and regular procedures. </p><p>  However, over the past 15 years, the number of our compatriots has been growing steadily.  Since Egypt is now not the safest place, and Turkey has risen in price, the Russians are looking for new places of vacation deployment.  Thailand is becoming increasingly popular, which, however, has already been loved by our tourists since the beginning of the two thousandth.  Which resort of the many proposed by the Kingdom to choose?  In this article we have collected the best resorts in Thailand, we will talk about the features of each of them and just take a break from the hard working days, plunging into the warm summer thoughts about the rest as a way of being. </p><h2>  Phi Phi Islands </h2><p>  One of the most popular tourist resorts in the vicinity of Phuket is two mountains connected by a sand spit, on which the fabulous town is located - Phi Phi Don.  In the afternoon it is a quiet place, where it is so pleasant to contemplate lace shadows falling on golden sand and dull waves, measuredly rolling on the coast.  The infrastructure is well developed here: a lot of open tea and cafes, souvenir shops. </p><p>  Going out into the street at night, you find that measured splendor gave way to a riot of lights and sounds, a bright holiday - fire shows begin, artists of various genres began to work, music bars opened.  Life here boils in the dark.  And so here it is replaced here day after day, either enchanting with the sunny serenity of the coast and cicadas, then breaking into the night silence with a riotous carnival. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunrise-divers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of thailand" class="if uuid-2280109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280109.jpg"></div><h2>  Hua hin </h2><p>  Many travelers wonder what resorts are in Thailand.  And here, keep the answer!  This is one of the oldest resorts.  Great attention is paid to cleanliness, order and safety, because the royal family comes here to rest. </p><p>  Hua Hin translates as "stone head."  This name was not given by chance, because on the coast you can see rounded stones of impressive size. </p><p>  The place is very calm.  The infrastructure is also well developed: there are all the necessary shops and cafes.  Here, perhaps, you can relax your soul and body from everyday worries, admire the white beaches and stretching far green hills.  Moreover, <span>Hua Hin</span> is rich in monuments of history and culture of Thailand - you will definitely have something to see.  The colorful floating markets that we definitely recommend visiting are of interest. </p><p>  Of course, you can‚Äôt call Hua Hin a budget resort, nevertheless this place can offer something you cannot find in another popular city - peace and quiet even at night.  After all, the best resorts in Thailand are expensive, right? </p><div class="photo" data-original="presidential-aviation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hua hin from above" class="if uuid-2280119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280119.jpg"></div><h2>  Koh Samui </h2><p>  The second largest <span>island of Thailand.</span>  This resort is also loved by our tourists.  Places, it must be said, are very picturesque: mostly elevations framed by heavy forests, dense jungle.  Directly the same recreation areas are in the lowlands off the coast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The <span>island</span> will also please fans of outdoor <span>activities</span> , because the sea has plenty of entertainment: diving, boat trips, visiting ancient temples.  A photo of the resort of Thailand is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trekearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Samui" class="if uuid-2280123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280123.jpg"></div><h2>  Ayutthaya </h2><p>  If you want to get acquainted with the history and culture of Thailand, you should definitely visit this ancient capital. </p><p>  In the 14-18 centuries.  in Thailand there was a state with a capital in this city!  There are a huge number of beautiful palaces and temples characteristic of Thailand's architectural styles.  Ayutthaya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thailandtourism.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ayutthaya in Thailand" class="if uuid-2280139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280139.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, this city is not intended for a beach holiday, it is the "cultural Mecca" of Thailand, but after spending one day getting in touch with the history of this place will be no less interesting than spending this time on a sun lounger by the sea. </p><h2>  Chang Island </h2><p>  Chang Island is a place where you will surely feel unity with nature, because 80% of the island is covered by a dense jungle with all the ensuing consequences, and more precisely with all animals living there!  Moreover, since this resort began to develop recently, the beaches have retained their pristine splendor.  Although the infrastructure is developed, it is noticeably less than in other resort cities, so nothing here prevents a quiet, measured rest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theitravelchannel.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bungalow on Chang Island" class="if uuid-2280165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280165.jpg"></div><h2>  Phuket </h2><p>  Among the resorts of Thailand, this is probably the most famous and beloved by Russians.  The real "pearl of the Andaman Sea."  The name of the island translates as "gem-like," and Phuket fully justifies such a big name!  It is unlikely that anywhere else in Thailand you can see such a subtle unity of pristine natural beauty with a perfectly developed infrastructure.  This is one of the main beach resorts in Thailand. </p><p>  The island is literally shrouded in green jungle, rocky bays and white and gold beaches, and at the same time, on the wide streets of the city there are a huge number of nightclubs, cafes, various shops and shops. </p><p>  Separately, it should be said about Patong Beach.  It was there that large shopping centers, bars and the famous Bangla Road were located, where the main youth parties are held.  If you want to relax in a quiet environment and silence, choose Karon Beach.  By the way, every beach on the island is unique, so we recommend you to visit everything! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular Phuket Resort" class="if uuid-2280167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2280167.jpg"></div><p>  You should definitely visit the temple complexes of Wat Chalong and Big Buddha. </p><p>  For lovers of exotics, the highlight of the program will be a visit to Monkey Mountain, where these animals walk freely and communicate with tourists.  We also recommend visiting the night markets in Phuket.  There you can taste the most exotic <span>Thai dishes,</span> local fruits. </p><h2>  Pattaya </h2><p>  The name translates unusually poetic - "the wind blowing from the south-west to north-east at the beginning of the rainy season." </p><p>  This place began to develop in the 60s, when American soldiers who participated in the hostilities in Vietnam came here for treatment and recreation.  After the war, many remained. </p><p>  Since the 60s there are a huge number of clubs, cafes, massage parlors and brothels.  Affordable prices annually attract hundreds of thousands of tourists here, and it is this city, perhaps, that is the center of vibrant, bubbling life, which focuses mainly on Walking Street.  The atmosphere here, to put it mildly, is not the most calm: music from different clubs mixes, and go-go dancers invite men to adult shows.  Therefore, for a family vacation this place is not quite suitable. </p><p>  As for the city beach, it is usually crowded here, the water in the sea is cloudy, it is believed that a more or less good beach is located in the Jomtien area.  In general, of course, the beaches are much inferior to the island of Thailand. </p><h2>  Bangkok </h2><p>  The capital and largest city of the Kingdom of Thailand.  Colorful and bright, hardly leaving anyone indifferent.  It‚Äôs a kind of ‚Äúcauldron of the times‚Äù, where ‚Äúwest‚Äù and ‚Äúeast‚Äù were mixed, where ‚Äúyesterday and today‚Äù came together. Among all the resorts in Thailand, the most urbanized and Europeanized: majestic skyscrapers and shopping centers rise above the city, attract luxury restaurants and cafes Signs and banners dazzle with bright lights. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Bangkok managed to maintain the status of the cultural and spiritual center of the Kingdom, among the many skyscrapers, the roofs of Buddhist temples, embodying some islands of serenity, are gilded.  In the center, like an ancient giant, stands the Royal Palace. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="13.7563309" data-lng="100.50176510000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/5/8/958.png"></div><p>  The original name is Krung Thep, but this is only an abbreviation, because the original name is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as <span>the longest name of the city,</span> consisting of 20 letters. </p><p>  Bangkok will impress you not only with its catchy urban personality, but also with original Thai, as if palaces and temples frozen in time. </p><p>  Having considered the most famous resorts of Thailand, favorite by tourists, in the article, I would like to add that a place to stay should be chosen very carefully!  But it is in Thailand that anyone can find a resort to their liking, because the Kingdom is so multifaceted and contrasting that it can please both those who want to escape from heavy workdays and those who like exotic and extreme sports! </p>
