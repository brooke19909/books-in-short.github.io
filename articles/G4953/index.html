  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Poor TV shows: causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No matter what many researchers say, the Internet has not been able to fully replace television.  Modern devices allow you to get the maximum image quality, but it didn‚Äôt work out getting rid of various problems when watching TV shows.  And the owners often wonder why the TV began to show poorly.  Such factors can create various interference and interference: </p><ul><li>  weather conditions in the event of a thunderstorm, overcast, fog or wind; </li><li>  too much distance from the receiver to the signal source, which is especially important outside the city; </li><li>  the capabilities of the device itself, since all TVs differ in their characteristics; </li><li>  device configuration specifics. </li></ul><p>  The article describes the main causes of image problems, as well as how they can be fixed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avsforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shows TV badly" class="if uuid-3192680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/3192680.jpg"></div><h2>  Prevention </h2><p>  It happens that the TV channel interrupts the broadcast in order to prevent and maintain its equipment.  In the case when the rest are working properly, it is worth waiting for the repair work to finish, and the broadcast will resume.  Also, many channels use a characteristic splash screen during technical breaks. </p><p>  In some cases, the absence of a signal may be due to malfunctions on the provider's side.  To confirm this, you can check with your neighbors if the television works for them, or immediately call the technical support line.  It is also worth checking whether the money in your personal account has run out, as a denial of access to the service may be caused by their absence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Antenna Problems </h2><p>  To process the incoming signal, many televisions are equipped with a special receiver.  In most cases, the TV shows poorly from a common antenna due to weather conditions.  They can be rain or overcast.  This problem can be solved by replacing the antenna with a better and more sensitive one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aerialsandmore.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="poorly shows the TV from the antenna what" class="if uuid-3191437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3191437.jpg"></div><p>  There are still cases where interference is caused by deformation of the antenna.  This may be due to strong winds, hail, or in the event of heavy snowfall.  The snow lying on the guides, with its weight, can bend them and disable them. </p><p>  In the absence of mechanical damage, the antenna could turn a strong wind, which caused a decrease in signal reception.  This is due to improper installation.  If we talk about a satellite dish, then from time to time it requires adjustments to the settings, since the satellite may deviate slightly from the original trajectory. </p><h2>  Poor signal reception </h2><p>  As mentioned above, this applies more to the owners of country houses.  Often in the country or in the village the TV shows poorly in comparison with the city.  The reason is that, due to the influence of the atmosphere, the signal does not reach the receiver with sufficient strength, since the transmitters are usually located in large settlements.  As a solution, you can replace the receiver with a more sensitive one.  However, this option is not suitable for indoor antennas, as they do not have sufficient power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifehacker.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shows poorly" class="if uuid-3191430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3191430.jpg"></div><p>  Urban residents may have problems of a similar plan due to unlawful interference with antenna design and switching.  Any changes must be carried out by professionals and after obtaining special permission.  Otherwise, dismantling can be achieved through court. </p><h2>  Switching Issues </h2><p>  Often the reason that the TV does not show well is the poor contact of the antenna connector with the corresponding TV socket.  Periodic degradation of the connection will create picture and sound distortion.  To begin with, it is worth examining the connector itself and the device input.  In case of damage to one of them, it is necessary to replace the failed part.  If both of them are in order, then you need to reconnect them, making sure the contact density.  If a splitter is present, it is necessary to inspect the contacts on it as well.  When all contact points are checked and everything is in order, and the TV shows poorly from the antenna, what should I do? </p><p>  If these steps do not give any result, you should inspect the antenna cable for damage.  It is undesirable to pinch it with pieces of furniture or bend at a strong angle, as this can lead to damage to the wire from the inside, and it will be more difficult to diagnose the problem.  If your antenna cable runs outside the house, you should make sure that it is firmly fixed to the wall during initial installation or replacement, as vibration caused by wind can cause internal damage or a complete break. </p><h2>  Settings error </h2><p>  In order to tune into the wave of a specific channel, the receiver must catch the frequency corresponding to it.  This problem is especially common in analog broadcasting.  If the channel information is incorrect, the TV receiver cannot find the corresponding signal.  This may lead to attempts to configure yourself or some kind of malfunction, which entailed the reset of the device to the factory settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="poorly shows what to do from the antenna" class="if uuid-3191442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3191442.jpg"></div><p>  If such a problem occurs, most likely the TV does not show most of the channels, and the remaining ones are confused and are not on their ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù.  In this case, the device should be set up by a specialist of the service center, since for an ordinary user this process is very complicated.  Also, if the provider provides television services to you, you need to call technical support and call the master at home.  Even in cases where the TV does not show well, a problem may arise due to an unnecessary signal amplifier in such a situation, which must be turned on only in case of uncertain reception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shows the TV from the antenna what to do" class="if uuid-3191444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3191444.jpg"></div><h2>  TV breakdown </h2><p>  If the image on the screen has deteriorated sharply and switching channels does not change the situation, then most likely the receiver or converter has failed.  These parts cannot be repaired, so a solution will need replacing them.  In the case of the warranty period of the device, such repairs should be free of charge. </p><p>  It is worth noting that such cases are found mainly in fairly old TVs.  And, of course, most of these problems can be solved.  So if the TV shows poorly what to do, you now know. </p>
