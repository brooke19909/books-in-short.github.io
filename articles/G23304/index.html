    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Ionian Princess Club Hotel 4 * is located on the first coastline.  This is a <span>beach hotel,</span> it is separated from the sea by 150 meters as a maximum.  You can reach it in two minutes, and such close proximity pleases tourists.  After all, most people come here just to sunbathe and spend their holidays swimming in the gentle warm sea.  By the way, the airport is also nearby, from where, it should be noted, the <span>Moscow-about-Corfu</span> flight regularly runs back and forth.  I must say that the Ionian Princess Club Hotel 4 * (Corfu, Acharavi) is a rather ‚Äúadult‚Äù hotel - it was built in 1982, and the last time it was renovated in 2008.  Outwardly, it looks quite cozy and compact - a small neat building with a swimming pool, located on a well-groomed territory.  So it‚Äôs really nice to relax here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature and landscapes </h2><p>  Speaking about this hotel, you can not ignore this topic.  The village of Acharavi is a cozy tourist village that has been hosting travelers for more than thirty years.  If you go into comparisons, then Corfu is very similar to the botanical garden, which is blooming wildly with exotic plants, with archaeological sites.  For example, while staying here, one cannot fail to visit the church of St. Spyridon or the Cathedral of <span>St. Christopher.</span>  In general, this place is very attractive for tourists, travelers and lovers of beautiful nature.  Clear water, endless beaches stretching for several kilometers, the mighty Mount Pantokratoras, olive and <span>orange trees,</span> cypress avenues, lemon groves and spreading palm trees are truly the perfect place for a relaxing family vacation.  Due to the unique climate and stunning nature, the village of Acharavi has become so popular and famous among tourists. </p>

    <p>  This hotel offers its guests a restaurant, an Internet cafe, as well as three bars.  There is also a laundry room, a hall designed for business conferences, animation, a night club and a currency exchange.  If you want to come to rest with your children, then this idea will definitely be good, as there is a mini-club for the youngest guests, a pool and a playground for games.  In addition, if necessary, the hotel administration is ready to provide a cot for children.  The hotel also has babysitters who can easily take children into their care if their parents need to leave.  Developing the theme of infrastructure, I would also like to note with attention what entertainment you can devote time to while in the hotel.  Basketball, aerobics, windsurfing, billiards, football, tennis, surfing, volleyball - this is not the whole list of what guests are interested in.  In fact, staying in Greece, one cannot fail to devote at least one day to water skiing, polo, surfing and other relevant sports on the beach - this is really interesting, exciting and good for health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece corfu 5 star hotels" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/572359.jpg" width="443"></div>

    <h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  In addition to all of the above, it is worth noting the attention also to those services that are provided for general use.  For example, public areas are equipped with air conditioning and Wi-Fi.  The hotel staff works honestly - they always clean the rooms on time, change towels and bed linen.  And this is very important, because you want to live clean and tidy.  Also, if there is a need, the guest can use the ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù service.  A doctor on call, late check-out upon request and massage are available for a fee.  You can not worry about the rest on the sea, since there are umbrellas and sun loungers on the beach, and towels are provided in the rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  The people who stayed at this place were definitely satisfied.  After all, one cannot but like such a beautiful place as Corfu (Greece).  Reviews of tourists who love profitability, lack of excess and comfort, are definitely pleasing to the eye.  Many people talk about this hotel with warmth in their hearts, as a very comfortable hotel with good service and friendly staff.  By the way, some tourists not without pleasure note that a Russian girl works at the reception.  And indeed, this cannot but rejoice, because it is always nice to be in another country and hear your native language.  In addition, it‚Äôs easier to navigate - if you are interested in something, you can always ask a person who knows both the city and the Russian language.  They note clean, quiet and comfortable rooms.  In general, a great option for those travelers who value a budget vacation, are tired of the bustle of the city and dream of seeing Greece. </p><h2>  All Inclusive on Corfu </h2>

    <p>  Ionian Princess is undoubtedly a good hotel.  However, it is not the only one that exists in this place.  One has only to look at Corfu on a map of Greece - a spacious island with a huge number of secluded picturesque corners and simply mind-blowing capes.  Therefore, arguing on the topic of what hotel complexes exist in this place, it is worth noting the attention of some other hotels.  Definitely, an interesting topic such as hotels in Greece (Corfu) ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  One of the five-star hotels that are popular with tourists is Marbella Beach 5 * - a complex with its own pebble and sandy beach, which offers magnificent views of the expanse of the Ionian Sea and magnificent gardens. </p>

    <h2>  Top ranking of the best hotels in Corfu </h2><p>  It should be noted that the four-star Aquis Capo Di Corfu 4 *, where one standard double room for two will cost about 39 thousand rubles per week.  By the way, this hotel is perhaps one of the best complexes, which clearly shows an excellent combination of price and quality.  Modern interior, correct and helpful staff, excellent cuisine, favorable location - all in all, full four stars.  And for such a small cost.  It is not surprising that this complex fell into the top three hotels that Greece (Corfu) has.  5 star hotels also deserve some attention.  Kontokali Bay Resort &amp; SPA is a luxury hotel for a rich vacation.  The best resort spa hotel on the whole island, which has been awarded such an award as ‚ÄúGreen Key‚Äù, which is the top of recognition in the hotel industry.  It is not worthwhile to describe in detail how this complex is different - magnificent beach restaurants, SPA-center, rich rooms, arranged so that they would not want to leave, sauna, jacuzzi, high-quality drinks and much more. </p>
