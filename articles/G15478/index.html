Among the budget destinations, Prague leads.  This city attracts tourists with numerous attractions, a warm atmosphere, delicious and satisfying food and, of course, an incomparable beer.  But frugal travelers often think about convenient and cheap accommodation.  Where to stay in Prague so as to be closer to its main attractions and not spend money on public transport?  You should know that all places of interest to tourists are mainly concentrated in the central part of the city.  But luxury hotels are also located there, which not everyone can afford.  Although there are exceptions.  In Prague, you can settle in the very center of the city at a affordable price if you choose <span>the Prague</span> Center Plaza 3 * <span>hotel</span> .  This article will be devoted to his review.  An informative base for it was not so much handouts as traveler reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Center Plaza 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1473111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  According to tourists, this is one of the main "chips" of the hotel.  It was amazing to meet the budget "troika" in one of the central quarters of Prague.  All key sights of the Czech capital are within walking distance.  The Prague Center Plaza 3 * hotel is located a little southeast of the center of Prague, at the address: F√ºgnerovo Namesti 1. <span>Wenceslas Square</span> can be reached in leisurely steps in five minutes, and to the main railway station - in ten, even with luggage.  If you want to see more remote corners of Prague, you can use public transport.  Bus and tram stops are just a two-minute walk away.  There is also a metro station (Prospect I.P. Pavlova).  And the Prague Congress Center, Charles University and the National Museum can be reached in minutes.  Tourists say that if you want, you can not spend money on transport at all.  You can get to Vysehrad on your own for twenty-five minutes.  Reviews also note the fact that you can find many cafes, pubs and budget fast foods nearby.  Budget grocery stores such as Bill and Zet Market are nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Center Plaza 3 Prague" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1473097.jpg" width="600"></div>

The atmosphere of antiquity creates a special atmosphere.  From the windows of the rooms on the upper floors you can see the endless sea of ‚Äã‚Äãroofs and the Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower.  The hotel also has a patio.  Those tourists who come in the summer can sit on the open, sunlit terrace.  A beautiful staircase with carved railings is complemented by an elevator.  The city hotel, which is the Prague Center Plaza, does not have any territory other than a dedicated parking lot near the walls of the building.  But in the basement there is an excellent spa center (discussed below), a restaurant, a conference room and a luxuriously decorated reception with a lounge area.  Reviews say that in general the hotel makes a very favorable impression.  The building has been recently renovated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Center Plaza 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1473107.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has ninety-five rooms for guests.  But the only room category in Prague Center Plaza 3 * is Standard.  Prague is a city big enough to find luxury boutique hotels with royal suites at sky-high prices.  And travelers staying at this hotel are used to saving money, but at the same time not depriving themselves of comfort.  The rooms in the Prague Center Plaza Hotel differ from each other only in size and, accordingly, in capacity.  Tourists note that there are single rooms.  Most guest rooms are designed to accommodate two people.  And families can stay in a triple room, in which, by the way, there is the possibility of an extra bed.  What rooms do you recommend for your accommodation reviews?  At the reception or when booking, you should ask for a room on the top, sixth floor.  It offers a wonderful view.  And if this is not possible, at least ask for a room overlooking the courtyard.  Then the noise from a busy street will not disturb your sleep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Prague Center Plaza 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1473108.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the rooms of the Prague Center Plaza Hotel have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  To begin with, the furniture in the bedrooms is new, and the beds are covered with a soft mattress.  If you are accustomed to volumetric large pillows of the old model, they will be delivered to you instead of flat (but more useful for cervical vertebrae).  The room has satellite TV, direct dial telephone, safe and minibar.  Guest rooms include free Wi-Fi.  Reviews emphasize that the bathrooms have only a shower.  Of hygiene items - only liquid soap with a dispenser.  But what unbelievably pleased budget travelers were tea bags with coffee, coffee, sugar and cream.  It was possible, having come from a walk around the city to brew yourself a hot drink.  There is also an electric kettle and cups. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Center Plaza 3 stars" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1473109.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Prague Center Plaza 3 * reviews are characterized as B &amp; B. This abbreviation means that breakfast is already included in the room rate.  Morning meals are served buffet style in the hotel restaurant.  Tourists leave feedback on the sparing breakfast schedule.  Both those who are forced to flee on business before dawn, and dormouse who are accustomed to sleep before ten can eat.  Breakfast is continental.  This is a standard set of meat and cheese slices, eggs of all kinds (boiled, fried eggs, scrambled eggs) and drinks.  Reviews also mention a lot of types of delicious pastries.  At the reception you can "buy" half board.  Dinner or lunch (if you wish) will then cost only ten euros per person.  It is possible to order a full board, but few people used this option in Prague - the city of various restaurants and pubs.  Reviews only mention that this extra meal includes a three-course menu.  You will have to pay extra for drinks separately.  The hotel restaurant serves good and tasty food, the portions are large and its price of ten euros is justified.
