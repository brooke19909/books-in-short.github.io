    <h2>  Famous Patrons of Russia </h2><p>  The history of its creation is as follows.  In 1802, the state appealed for donations to education.  Among the first to respond was a naturalist scientist and philanthropist Pavel Demidov (1739-1821), a descendant of the famous dynasty.  His ascetic activity is very extensive - at his own expense in 1803 he opened a college of higher sciences, which bore his name until 1919.  Then he transfers funds in the amount of 100,000 rubles, an extensive library and a natural science collection he collected during his travels around the world to the future of Moscow State University.  The Zoological Museum will arise from these donations.  In addition, in 1805 P. G. Demidov handed over to the Moscow University the Mintz Cabinet, which contained the richest collections (several thousand) of medals and coins.  These treasures subsequently made up the main fund of the ‚Äúcabinet of natural history‚Äù formed earlier in 1791. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Professional approach </h2><p>  In 1755, by decree of Empress <span>Elizabeth Petrovna</span> , the Imperial Moscow University - Moscow State University was founded.  The Zoological Museum is 36 years younger, which does not prevent it from being considered one of the oldest organizations in the natural sciences.  He was 215 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoological Museum of Moscow State University named after Lomonosov" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/806542.jpg" width="600"></div>  After the funds of the ‚Äúcabinet of natural history‚Äù were significantly replenished by the efforts of philanthropist P. G. Demidov, the need arose for their systematization.  This responsible matter was entrusted to the already well-established (compiled an inventory of a similar study in Paris) Russian natural scientist G.I. Fischer (full name is Grigory Ivanovich (Johann Gottgelf, Gothelf) Fischer von Waldheim, years of life - 1771-1853).  The student and follower <span>J. Cuvier,</span> author of the dissertation ‚ÄúOn the Breathing of Animals‚Äù, G. I. Fischer rejected the offer of Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, who invited him to systematize his ‚Äústudy of natural history‚Äù, and remained in Moscow, in the future, Moscow State University.  The Zoological Museum was created by his efforts.

    <h2>  Ascetic activity </h2><p>  In 1806-1807 he conducted the first inventory of all collections, including coins and medals.  As you know, in 1812 Moscow burned.  In this fire, many buildings perished, the priceless collections of the future Zoological Museum were almost completely destroyed.  And the patriot of Russia, Grigory Ivanovich Fisher, who during the fire managed to save part of the conchological (shell and mollusk) collection, began to restore the ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù, transferring his own collections, collections and library to it.  Then, using personal authority and fame in scientific circles, he turned to naturalists and custodians of private collections with a request to help restore the deceased museum, the revival of which could be discussed already in 1814.  The second inventory, made by G.I. Fisher, ended in 1822, and its data were published.  Along with the systematization of funds, a zoological collection was allocated, and a new museum at the university was created only on its basis.  By 1830, thanks to the ascetic activity of G.I. Fischer, the number of exhibits reaches 25 thousand units. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Necessary conversion </h2><p>  The next improvement was already carried out in 1860.  Then all the funds of the museum were divided into educational, scientific and exhibition ones.  For visitors, the future Zoological Museum of Moscow State University  Lomonosov opened in 1866.  Of course, throughout all the years of its existence, it developed dynamically, and by the end of the century, the premises allotted for it became cramped.  And therefore, in 1989-1902 a new specialized three-story building was built for the museum according to the project of the academician, hereditary architect K. M. Bykovsky, at that time - the chief architect of Moscow University.  He built university buildings on <span>Maiden Field.</span>  In Bolshaya Nikitskaya, in addition to the <span>most beautiful building of the</span> Zoological Museum, K. M. Bykovsky erected a library and buildings of several faculties. </p>

    <p>  A beautiful building, made in the classical style, is located in the heart of the capital.  Nearest metro stations - ‚ÄúLibrary named after  Lenin ‚Äùand‚Äú Okhotny Ryad ‚Äù.  The museum moved from it from the old building to Mokhovaya.  After moving, the museum becomes public only in 1911. </p><h2>  Soviet reformation </h2><p>  In 1930, the Zoological Museum of Moscow State University in Moscow was given to the Faculty of Biology.  A major reorganization occurred in the 90s of the last century.  After all the ordeals, the museum gains an independent status.  To date, its scientific funds reach several million units. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoological research museum" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/806545.jpg" width="368"></div>  It is visited by up to 150,000 people a year, the number of guided tours for the same time reaches the figure of 1700. More widely available and extensive information is available for each type of scientific collection.  Three well-equipped viewing halls were given to visitors - two on the first floor, one (Bone Hall) - on the second.  All collections are arranged in species proximity, from protozoa to vertebrates.

    <h2>  Serious research </h2><p>  The Zoological Museum of Moscow State University carries out serious work - it studies and systematizes knowledge about animals in general, about modern ones in particular.  Therefore, out of the available 10 million exhibits, only 8 are exhibited, among which there are unique representatives of the world fauna, for example, the largest and heaviest goliath beetle and hundreds of other unique specimens of its kind.  It is not surprising that Muscovites begin to visit this museum at a very young age - they come here with one-year-old children and remain satisfied with the tour.  The <span>MSU</span> Zoological Museum <span>, reviews</span> of which are mostly positive, is really very good, keeps up with the times, providing for all the ‚Äútricks" that can attract and interest as many visitors as possible.  And extraordinary people work here as guides.  But always when visiting any museum in the world there are people who believe that guides speak quietly and exhibits are covered in dust.  The photo shows that this is not so. </p><h2>  Ticket prices, reviews, interesting facts </h2><p>  You can verify the beauty and high level of collections by visiting the museum.  The ticket price is only 100 rubles for a child as part of an excursion group of at least 20 people.  For an adult with excursion services - 250 rubles, without excursions - 200. There is a flexible system of benefits, free days for special categories of citizens and one free night a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoological museum mgu reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/806546.jpg" width="600"></div>  Periodic exhibitions are very interesting.  Some visitors buy tickets in advance with a prepayment.  It remains to add some interesting facts - for some time, Marina Tsvetaeva lived in the apartment of Professor A. N. Severtsev, located in the museum building, which was the founder of evolutionary animal morphology.  And he himself served as a prototype of the hero of the "Fatal Eggs" M. A. Bulgakov.
