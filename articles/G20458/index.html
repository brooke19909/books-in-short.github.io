Someone applied to the bank about obtaining a loan, and someone sent applications to <span>microfinance organizations (MFIs)</span> for a microloan through the Contact system.  The second method is most preferable for those people who want to receive money as soon as possible without paperwork. </p><h2>  What is Contact? </h2><p>  Contact is a Russian payment system through which money transfers are made.  This is an international network with service points in Russia and in almost 170 countries of the world.  Contact has earned the trust of users.  Its services are used daily by several million people around the world. </p><p>  Through the payment system, transfers are carried out instantly.  It is convenient to receive them, since service points work in many Russian banks.  To conduct a financial transaction, you need to have a passport with you, know the transfer number, amount, currency and sender information. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of obtaining loans through Contact </h2><p>  <span>Microfinance organizations</span> offer, as a rule, different ways of obtaining loans issued by them.  Among them, you can see the Contact payment system.  It is convenient for those borrowers who cannot use other ways to receive money.  Indeed, microfinance organizations mainly offer transfers of loans to e-wallets, bank cards, but not all users have them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few more advantages people note when receiving money in this way: </p><ol><li>  Through the Contact system, online loans are issued with minimal requirements.  Only a passport is required.  No certificates and other documents, guarantors and pledges are needed. </li><li>  This method of obtaining a loan eliminates the search for an office of a microfinance organization and the need to meet with a company manager.  Money is issued at points of the payment system.  In one city there can be several dozen.  To find a nearby Contact point, it is recommended to use the official website of the system. </li><li>  Money in points of the system are issued very quickly.  The operator checks the number indicated by the client, the data transmitted by the microfinance organization, with the real passport data of the person and, if coincidental, gives only a few papers for signature.  After that, the specialist transfers the loan amount. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Making a loan through Contact </h2><p>  Contact does not directly issue loans.  The payment system is a link between people transferring money to each other, as well as between borrowers and microfinance organizations.  That is why, in order to get a loan, you must first choose for yourself suitable options from the list of all MFIs that offer transfers of approved amounts in this way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To get a loan through the Contact system, it is recommended to send applications to several microfinance organizations, because not all companies make positive decisions.  The essence of this stage is as follows: </p><ol><li>  On the official website of each selected microfinance organization, a questionnaire is filled out.  Users indicate passport data, information about the financial situation, information about previously taken loans. </li><li>  After sending the application, it remains to wait for a loan decision.  In modern microfinance organizations, questionnaires are processed automatically.  Decisions on applications are sent to users within a few minutes. </li><li>  If the decision is positive, the transfer number via the Contact system instantly arrives from the microfinance organization.  You can get a loan right away. </li></ol><h2>  List of microfinance organizations </h2><p>  Not all <span>microfinance organizations</span> have the opportunity to receive money through Contact.  Some offer credit card transfers only.  For those who do not know which MFIs transfer money through Contact, here is a list of several well-known companies: </p><ul><li>  Ekapusta. </li><li>  Platiza. </li><li>  MoneyMan. </li><li>  Vivus. </li><li>  Zimer. </li></ul><p>  Each of the aforementioned organizations attracts customers with the conditions for obtaining a loan in the Contact system without failures and checks.  In reality, sometimes it happens differently - microfinance organizations fail for unknown reasons.  Negative decisions are due to various factors (the presence of a very bad credit history, the indication of false data in the questionnaire, etc.).  Exact reasons are never communicated to customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Conditions from Ekapusta </h2><p>  Ekapusta is one of the most loyal microfinance organizations.  Very often, she gives a <span>loan without refusal to</span> people with a negative credit history, offers installment programs in case of difficulties with repayment.  Sometimes MFIs hold profitable promotions (for example, offer the first loan for free). </p><p>  Ekapusta has many different ways of getting money.  Among them is Contact.  A loan can be obtained through the system on the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  affordable amount for customers - from 100 rubles to 30,000 rubles; </li><li>  interest is 2.1% per day in the first 12 days of using borrowed funds and 1.7% per day in the subsequent period; </li><li>  the period of use of the loan can be from 7 to 21 calendar days. </li></ul><p>  You can return borrowed funds through Contact.  To do this, you need to visit any point of the payment system, inform the operator about the payment of the loan from Ekapusta, give your mobile phone number and amount.  No repayment fee is charged to customers.  Money is instantly credited to the account. </p>

    <h2>  Terms at MoneyMan </h2><p>  Microfinance Organization MoneyMan is a convenient service that provides people with money on credit.  Users are encouraged to arrange loans in the amount of 1,500 to 70,000 rubles for a period of 5 days to 4.5 months.  The interest rate is calculated individually.  Only its borders were established in the documents of the microfinance organization - from 0.2 to 1.85% per day. </p><p>  There are several ways to get loans from MoneyMan.  One of the most convenient and fast is considered to be a transfer of borrowed money through the Contact system.  Unfortunately, when approving the first loan, you cannot use this method.  Clients can only transfer to a bank card. </p><h2>  Making loans at Vivus MFIs </h2><p>  The microfinance organization Vivus has established itself as a reliable center for loans.  Here you can borrow money from 1,000 to 30,000 rubles and for a period of 1 day to 1 month.  The interest rate is about 2%.  When holding shares it is reduced. </p><p>  Applications in the company are not considered instantly.  30 minutes are allowed to make a decision.  Upon approval of the application, money can be obtained through Contact.  But at the same time, this method has a slight minus.  For transfers, MFIs charge a fee of 3%.  However, this method in the company is not the most expensive.  A little more commission is charged when transferring money to a card or electronic wallet from Yandex. </p>
