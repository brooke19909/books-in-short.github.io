All tourists are unique, each has its own view on leisure and service.  He doesn‚Äôt seem like a smart haven for sophisticated travelers.  However, they are rather lenient and loyal to a hotel of this class.  Give her a completely objective assessment. </p><p>  In their opinion, the hotel is reasonably located in the third line from the coast.  The path to the sea takes 7 minutes.  The apartments are well maintained and maintained in good cleanliness.  Thanks to the heating and air conditioning system, the temperature in the rooms is comfortable.  Comfortable beds provide a wonderful stay. </p><p>  Guests are satisfied with the food system.  A variety of fish and meat dishes, fruits and pastries are served at the table.  Poultry and seafood dishes are abundantly offered; champagne and other drinks are not limited.  But there aren‚Äôt enough sweet cereals and soups for the Russian people. </p>

    <p>  Classes in mini-clubs, an entertainment center and sports grounds, children's animation do not disappoint guests.  Entertainment programs for adults at the hotel are very scarce.  You have to go to the appropriate institutions or go in search of adventure to the nearest resorts. </p><p>  The sand spit makes a good impression.  The beach is really suitable for a relaxing holiday.  It is not crowded and clean, a real paradise for family tourists.  It is easy to keep track of children's water activities and things.  On its territory in abundance of garbage cans, toilets, showers.  Rescuers are on duty everywhere. </p><p>  The station is a 20 minute walk from the hotel.  Too lazy to go on foot, get to her by taxi or bus.  Electric trains to neighboring resorts run often.  Getting to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãTarragona, Salou and other tourist areas is easy.  However, the reception should clarify the transport schedule.  Concierges willingly issue a printout with the movement of trains. </p><p>  The coast is dotted with cafes with inexpensive foods.  The ice cream parlor serves a cold treat prepared by its own staff and delicious urchat.  A couple of supermarkets lined up next to the hotel.  Near Koma Rugi, children‚Äôs attractions and souvenir shops were sheltered. </p><p>  Tourists staying in "San Salvador" do not recommend buying excursions from the guide.  He does not negotiate much, gives out the <span>wishful thinking.</span>  In addition, sightseeing with him is more expensive. </p><p>  It is most reasonable to talk with the old-timers of the hotel, to find out about excursion routes from them.  And only after that decide what is better - an independent trip or an excursion tour imposed by a guide. </p>
