Unfortunately, there are no prams for rent at the hotel.  For tourists, the hotel does not provide babysitting services. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Prices for tours in Armeria Hotel, as in other hotels in Turkey, depend on the season, number of guests and type of room.  The cost of the trip is also affected by the duration of the trip and additional services, such as excursions, transfers from the airport to the hotel, etc. </p><p>  The average price for a standard double room starts at 22 thousand rubles per week of relaxation.  Tours during the velvet season increase in price, and Russian tourists who decide to travel in late August or early autumn will have to pay a bit more.  The cost of such a ticket varies between 30-40 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Many tourists from Russia spend their whole vacation in Kemer, and tours for 9, 12 or 14 nights are very popular.  Their cost is 45,000-48,000, 49,000-52,000 and 53,000-58,000 rubles, respectively. </p><p>  Today you can buy a ticket both in a travel agency and virtually.  Modern services provide travelers with various ways to pay for tours.  The main thing to do before buying a ticket to Armeria Hotel 3 * (photo of which can be found here) is to study in detail information about the hotel, its location and the services provided.  This will help to avoid conflicts and unpleasant incidents during the holidays. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey hotel armeria hotel 3" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20435/470629.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Tourists who are counting on a budget vacation option should understand that in a hotel of this category there will be no "royal" dishes and luxurious furniture.  Unfortunately, most Russian travelers are accustomed to something else.  For the quality of service you need to pay a higher price, our citizens do not want to put up with this at all.  When expectations do not coincide with the real picture, disappointment appears, followed by negative reviews.  Hotel Armeria Hotel 3 * is an example of the discrepancy between expectations and reality.  Most often, this contradiction arises due to unreasonable requirements of guests to the staff or the administration of the hotel.  Of course, it happens that the tour operator is also to blame for the negative opinion about the rest when he gives incorrect information about the hotel.  There can be many reasons.  Unfortunately, Turkey, the hotel Armeria Hotel 3 in particular, when receiving Russian tourists, does not always receive a flattering opinion about the rest.  However, this does not affect the number of visitors from Russia. </p><p>  As for the 3 * Armeria Hotel, it has both fans and opponents.  Most tourists give the hotel complex a rating of "3".  Someone did not like the local cuisine.  According to them, turmeric is added to all dishes to hide the smell of expired products.  The sizes of portions seemed small to others; the third was bored with the lines in the dining room. </p><p>  Most often, guests complain about spoiled furniture or broken plumbing in the rooms.  Unfortunately, this is sometimes found.  But this can be avoided, and it can be done quite simply - you need to invite a representative of the hotel administration to the room who will be required to provide a new room. </p><p>  Depending on the time of year, different categories of tourists relax in the hotel.  Sometimes noisy youth interferes with a relaxing holiday for families with children, this also happens quite often.  In this case, you can only advise one thing - pre-select a hotel on the outskirts, closer to nature.  Lovers of rough rest often stay in central hotels.  As for the Armeria Hotel, it is better to go there with children in spring or autumn, summer is the time for students to relax.  Therefore, measured your vacation in perfect silence is unlikely to succeed. </p><p>  Most often, tourists who knew what they were counting on were satisfied with the rest at Armeria Hotel 3 *.  This category of guests includes undemanding tourists and students.  Most often they leave only good opinions about Armeria Hotel 3 *, their reviews are usually positive. </p><p>  As for young people, these tourists note the convenient location of the hotel - it is very close to the entertainment facilities of the city (bars, discos and restaurants).  Many people like the pebble beach and water attractions where you can have fun and have a good time.  Nearby there is a pier where you can stroll along the sea.  Most people like a gentle entrance to the sea or free access to the beach by bus, etc. </p><p>  Also an indisputable advantage of this hotel is the availability of a diverse excursion program.  Numerous walks and trips to interesting places of Kemer and its outskirts are the main advantage of Armeria Hotel 3 *.  Reviews on the work of guides and guides are extremely positive.  The same can be said of the hotel staff.  Despite the controversial situations during the holidays, the hotel staff is always friendly, good-natured and intelligent.  This is noted by all guests. </p><p>  Armeria Hotel 3 * is a wonderful <span>hotel in the center of Kemer,</span> designed for an economical and modest vacation.  If you plan to spend time on the beach, walking around the city or on excursions, then this hotel will suit you perfectly. </p>
