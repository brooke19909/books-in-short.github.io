Once upon a time, a road leading to Rostov ran through the village.  In another direction, you can get to Suzdal from here.  But it is not the geographical location that the village of Veliky is interesting in the Yaroslavl region.  The attractions that are available here attract those who care about the history and culture of the country. </p>

    <p>  The most important political and social events took place in Moscow.  The village of Veliky, Yaroslavl region, is <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="26" data-annotation-idx="0">distant</span> from the capital at a distance of 220 km.  But oddly enough, it was in these places that significant historical events took place.  Here the foundations of a centralized state were born.  For the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting the principalities was embodied in the <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="2" data-annotation-idx="0">village of Veliky, Yaroslavl Oblast</span> . </p><h2>  Battles in the Great </h2><p>  At the end of the fourteenth century, where today several cultural and historical monuments are located, fights were fought between Russian warriors and Tatars.  In 1425, the <span>internecine war began.</span>  Between the descendants of Dmitry Donskoy in those days, hostility arose for the Grand Duchy.  Major battles were carried out by intractable relatives halfway between Rostov and Yaroslavl <span data-kind="mkTypography" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="20" data-annotation-idx="0">-</span> where the village with an ambiguous name is located today.

They headed towards Moscow, again to fight against the impudent Poles who had seized the capital.  Local residents treated the liberators very respectfully: they shared food, and at night they helped carry out a service for the protection of combatants.  Many peasants joined the brave defenders of the Fatherland. </p>

    <h2>  The construction of the first temples </h2><p>  In the 19th century, in the Great, militias made a halt, heading to war with the French emperor.  Before and after 1812, Russian tsars often stayed here.  Peter I also visited here. The great reformer, evidently, picturesque places moved in.  Rewarding his subjects for participating in the Battle of Poltava, the king granted the Great to one of his associates.  In 1712, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin was erected here, which marked the beginning of the architectural appearance of the village. </p><p>  The great in the Yaroslavl region over time has become a fairly well-known <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="27" data-annotation-idx="0">settlement</span> .  In the middle of the XIX century, it became a factory center in the province.  Here, for example, the flax industry developed.  The products of local factories at the beginning of the 20th century were known throughout the country.  What industrial enterprises operate here today is described below.  First, it is worth listing the sights of the village of the Great Yaroslavl region.

    <h2>  Veliky Selo Kremlin </h2><p>  This is the main attraction.  The history of the Kremlin begins at the beginning of the 17th century, when the aforementioned church was laid.  It is customary to associate an architectural monument in the Great with <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="4" data-annotation-idx="0">significant events near Poltava</span> .  As already mentioned, it was thanks to the victory in the battles that one of the close associates of Peter the Great became the owner of the lands near Yaroslavl. </p><p>  The main object in the Kremlin, of course, is the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin.  <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="28" data-annotation-idx="0">It is</span> decorated with several domes with a variety of frescoes.  Many architectural monuments have been preserved in the Yaroslavl region, but the one that is here stands out against the general background with solemnity and grandeur.  It is not for nothing that the <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="29" data-annotation-idx="0">locality</span> to which Peter the Great once drew attention, received such a memorable name. </p><p>  In addition to the church, the architectural complex includes the Holy Gate, the Church of the Intercession of the Virgin, a bell tower and various outbuildings.  There are also chapels and shopping malls.  Each building is decorated with works of Yaroslavl architecture: pediments, spiers, arches. </p><p>  In the thirties, the Kremlin was partially destroyed.  Today, the area is decorated with flower beds, but <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="30" data-annotation-idx="0">serious</span> restoration work is required.  The bell tower was built in the middle of the XVIII century.  <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="31" data-annotation-idx="0">Its</span> height is 75 meters.  This is a rather unusual structure with a square base.  Behind the church is an old cemetery.  Here there are burials that were made more than <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="32" data-annotation-idx="0">three</span> centuries ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Potato Riot Museum </h2><p>  The name of this institution already indicates that a rather unusual exhibition is presented within its walls.  Potato appeared <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="5" data-annotation-idx="0">in Russia in the first</span> half of the 19th century.  The peasants did not want to engage in the cultivation of an unusual, then <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="33" data-annotation-idx="0">still</span> exotic plant.  Later, as you know, they appreciated his merits.  Potatoes <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="34" data-annotation-idx="0">entered</span> firmly in Russian national cuisine. </p><p>  Museum visitors have the opportunity to learn little-known facts from the history of tubers.  In addition, an interactive program operates here, which is very popular today throughout the world.  On the ground floor there is a small cafe, the menu of which presents a variety of dishes prepared, of course, from potatoes. </p><h2>  The estate of the merchant Lokalov </h2><p>  The most unusual building in the territory of the village of Veliky was erected at the end of the XIX century.  She was created in <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="11" data-annotation-idx="0">neo</span> - <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="11" data-annotation-idx="0">Russian</span> style.  Decorated with elements inherent in the classic Russian tower.  An unexpected combination of architectural styles, the building is due to the inexhaustible imagination of <span data-kind="mkSemantic" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="43" data-annotation-idx="0">Fedor</span> <span data-kind="mkSemantic" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="43" data-annotation-idx="0">Shekhtel</span> .  According to the architect‚Äôs projects, several buildings were built in the 19th century in the Yaroslavl region.  The estate has the status of Russia's cultural heritage, but is in rather poor condition.  Before the start of World War II, the museum was located here.  Since the forties <span data-kind="mkTypography" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="21" data-annotation-idx="0">-</span> an orphanage. </p><p>  On the estate, the pupils cultivate a personal plot.  Opposite each <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="22" data-annotation-idx="0">plant is a tablet</span> with a name and description.  Theatrical and ceremonial events are regularly held here.  Among the pupils of the orphanage, located more than 60 years in the building of the former estate, there are famous people.  Information about them is contained on commemorative plaques <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="35" data-annotation-idx="0">placed</span> on the wall of the building.  It is worth saying that in Veliky there are very few modern buildings.  This is one of the oldest <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="36" data-annotation-idx="0">settlements</span> in which time seemed to stop.  Although there is also a furniture company. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  Great was once <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="6" data-annotation-idx="0">the largest village in the Yaroslavl</span> region.  At the beginning of the XX century, about <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="37" data-annotation-idx="0">four</span> thousand people lived here.  Today <span data-kind="mkTypography" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="23" data-annotation-idx="0">-</span> less than two thousand.  Nevertheless, the history of the village is very rich.  It is not surprising that the local museum of local lore has several interesting exhibitions.  One of them is devoted to linen business, which was developed in the 19th century.  Around the same time, demand for leather goods increased.  In the 19th century, not only linen business, but also leather production began to develop.  The most famous merchants at that time were <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="13" data-annotation-idx="0">Morugins</span> and <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="14" data-annotation-idx="0">Butikovs</span> . </p><p>  Several exhibitions tell visitors of the museum about the life of artisans in the village of Veliky.  There is a hall where merchants are shown.  The museum also has an exhibition dedicated to the Soviet era. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  There are two large ponds in the village.  One of them in the eighties received the status of a natural monument.  There is an opinion that a blacksmith was once located on its shore.  All the soot from the work of the craftsmen went into the <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="38" data-annotation-idx="0">pond</span> .  Hence the <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="24" data-annotation-idx="0">name - Black</span> .  The second reservoir is called White.  Probably, unlike the first, he was at a distance from the forge.  Here <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="0" data-annotation-idx="0">is the</span> <span data-kind="mkSpelling" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="15" data-annotation-idx="0">Bogolyubsky</span> temple, as well as the <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="39" data-annotation-idx="0">Svetelka</span> Museum, decorated in the style of an old merchant's hut. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the village of Veliky </h2><p>  In summer and winter, in any weather, in the <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="8" data-annotation-idx="0">village of Veliky Yaroslavl Oblast,</span> unique landscapes: the Black Pond, which, by the way, does not look so <span data-kind="mkYo" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="41" data-annotation-idx="0">polluted</span> , are ancient Kremlin buildings. </p><p>  In the <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="9" data-annotation-idx="0">oldest</span> <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="9" data-annotation-idx="0">village</span> <span data-kind="mkStyle" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-annotation="9" data-annotation-idx="0">of Yaroslavl region</span> , which is the Great, there are always many tourists.  According to reviews, upon closer examination, the Kremlin no longer makes such a spectacular impression.  Buildings are destroyed in places, are in decline.  The building needs restoration. </p><p>  They say that these are quite beautiful, but at the same time strange places.  The weather in the village changes extremely quickly, during the tour there are strange sensations.  But, perhaps, only extremely impressionable personalities survive such emotions. </p>
