Here is everything why people go somewhere to Bulgaria, for example.  Sandy beaches, wonderful climate, healing air, safe sea, suitable for children.  These places are removed not only from enterprises, but also motorways and gas-polluted megacities.  An excellent option for both youth recreation and families with children will be the recreation centers in Koblevo.  "Dolphin" is one of them.  In fact, this is a modern hotel with excellent service and well-trained staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphin Koblevo" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/807319.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it and how to get there </h2><p>  In order to get here, you should first get to one of the nearby regional centers.  It can be Nikolaev or Odessa.  If you were without a car and reached the sea <span>capital of Ukraine</span> by train, then it‚Äôs easy to go further.  Half a kilometer from the railway station is the famous Privoz market, and next to it is a small bus station, from where minibuses leave to Koblevo.  You can also use any public transport that goes in the direction of Nikolaev.  And from this city they get to Koblevo in two ways - either by minibus, which goes directly to the resort area, or by bus, going to Odessa.  Any of them will take you to Koblevo.  Base "Dolphin", of course, is located in the resort area.  But from the bus station of the village every half hour there are small minibuses that make stops at all hotels and pensions.  The hotel provides a paid transfer from the railway stations of both cities and Odessa Airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Koblevo base dolphin" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/807324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Dolphin (Koblevo) - reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of vacationers are delighted with the service, beach, cleanliness, comfort and food.  Settlement takes place very quickly, the procedure takes no more than a quarter of an hour, including payment, key collection, parking and more.  Kids here really enjoy the fun, while adults praise the beautiful rooms, pool and sea.  The apartments are especially good - tourists had the impression that the rest here is no worse than in Spain.  Children with pulmonary problems, whom doctors prescribe the steppe air, feel much better here.  The pool really helped out, if it suddenly became windy, or the water in the sea was cold.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Music does not rattle, all beach discos are far away, and at the same time there is no problem walking to them.  Now the hotel is being completed, and after completion of work it will be able to receive more tourists and give them better comfort. </p>
