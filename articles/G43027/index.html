Sights of the city on the banks of the Rhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lyon is located in southeastern France in the <span>Rhone</span> Valley <span>,</span> on both its banks.  It is the third most populated and second largest city in the country.  A little east of it begins the foothills of the Alps.  The great controversy among historians is the question of when Lyon was founded.  France in the <span>early Middle Ages</span> was a kind of constantly changing conglomerate of feudal territories.  Among which Lyon has always been in a prominent place.  But the first settlements on its territory existed even in antiquity.  A lot of material evidence preserved in stone has been preserved about them.  Monuments of the Roman Empire can be admired by everyone who comes to Lyon.  France in that era was called Gaul.  But Lyon became a full-fledged city much later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lyon France" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/268528.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  Lyon, France: Attractions </p><p>  First of all, Lyon is a big beautiful city, living a dynamic, eventful life.  It‚Äôs never boring here.  There is a constant whirlpool of events in social, commercial, cultural, scientific and sports life.  It is a city of outstanding art museums and unique monuments of medieval Gothic architecture.  It was repeatedly noted that any country should begin to be studied not from the capital, but from the province.  It is such a vibrant French province that Lyon is.  France from here is perceived somewhat differently than from Paris.  This is where one should go if one wants to understand this country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lyon France Attractions" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/268529.jpg" width="496"></div>  The most significant architectural sights of the city include such magnificent examples of Gothic architecture as the Cathedral of Saint-Jean and the Basilica of Notre Dame de Fourviere.  One of the most original architectural monuments is the metal tower Fourviere, erected on top of the hill of the same name.  It is an exact copy of the <span>Eiffel Tower in Paris.</span>  It is curious that its peak is at the same height as its closest relative in the capital.  Many of the main streets and squares of the city, ancient bridges over the Rhone and its tributary Sona are magnificent in their unique appearance. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lyon France Rhone" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/268530.jpg" width="490"></div>  It is not so often that one sees a city that has retained its architectural integrity and harmony to such a high degree as Lyon.  France has always been distinguished by the fact that it is customary to honor traditions and to respect the historical and cultural heritage.  And here, in the southeast, it is noticeable no less than in Paris.

    <p>  France, Lyon: city map and tourist sites on it </p><p>  Like many ancient cities that were built and rebuilt over the centuries, Lyon is characterized by the fact that it is not so easy to figure out its topography.  But logic is still present in it.  Therefore, the best option would be to get a hotel map of the city upon arrival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="france lyon map" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269070.jpg" width="467"></div><br>  The tourist infrastructure, by the way, is very well developed here.  And in his travels and walks around the city it is worth constantly referring to this map.  Very quickly, he will cease to be unfamiliar and incomprehensible.  And most of the attractions, as you would expect, are located in its center.
