  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The anomalous zones of Russia are able to compete in the unusual nature of the phenomena with the Bermuda Triangle, the Gibraltar wedge, the Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Devil ...</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to touch something unknown or frankly abnormal, it is not necessary to travel through the ‚Äúsights‚Äù of the devil‚Äôs belt.  The anomalous zones of Russia have a fairly branched network, confirming all kinds of theories about the existence of the icosahedral-dodecahedral structure of the Earth (IHSS) and the predisposition of certain parts of the earth's surface to the occurrence of anomalous manifestations of different frequencies. </p><p>  Among the most unusual places in Russia, the Tunguska Fall is most often mentioned, which is in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, followed by Shaitan Lake in the Omsk Region, X Tract in the Yaroslavl Region, Labynkyr Lake in Yakutia, Myasnaya Bor in the Novgorod Region, Medveditskaya Ridge in Volgograd, Mountain of the Dead - in Sverdlovsk and others. </p><p>  In addition to the occurrence of phenomena in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese geographical objects that go beyond the foundations of official science, they are also places of increased UFO activity. </p><p>  <span>The anomalous zones of</span> Russia, which are distinguished by the unusual occurrence of the phenomena occurring in them, make up a rather extensive list, which includes the Vitim epicenters from the Irkutsk region, the non-melting Chukchi Lake Elgygytgyn, the Devil's Glade in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, as well as the Labynkyr Lake, Tungusky Dump, which we already mentioned. Medveditskaya ridge, Mountain of the Dead. </p><p>  Not only do the anomalous zones of Russia, like all unusual places, cause quite subjective negative feelings, many of them have very bad fame.  The most dangerous of them are: Devil's Glade, which has more than 70 dead and missing, <span>Mountain of the Dead,</span> which accounts for 28 people, the Yakut <span>Lake Labynkyr,</span> on whose account ten people.  No less dangerous are the Sineus Kurgan from the Vologda Oblast, the Medveditskaya ridge, and the Devil's Lair of the Volgograd Oblast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The anomalous zones of the Krasnodar Territory are not included in any statistical list, but nevertheless, the phenomena occurring in them attract curious researchers with unusual manifestations and even a deadly peculiarity.  All of them concentrated in the area called the Kuban Triangle.  Geographically, this is the southwestern part of the Krasnodar Territory.  Among the most famous are the famous Shapsug dolmens, Novokuban circles appearing on <span>wheat fields.</span>  There are also dangerous places, like an anomalous mine near Gelendzhik.  In it, time accelerates.  The most accurate timepiece in two hours is accelerated by two and a half minutes.  Deep mine exploration ended tragically.  And only a couple of brave men who did not dare to go down below fifteen meters managed to stay alive.  Judging by their stories, the diameter of the shaft does not exceed a meter, the walls are fused and shine like glass.  Many agree that the Gelendzhik mine is of artificial origin, and its age does not exceed one hundred years.  But nothing is known about such technologies today. </p><p>  There are strange wells in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Gladkovskaya (Taman Peninsula), the appearance of which they tried to ascribe to the research activities of the military, but they, in turn, in every possible way deny their belonging to their origin.  A strange shape with a diameter increasing towards the bottom, fused walls with a temperature of 1200‚Äì1300 degrees, the absence of excavated soil and the appearance time no more than two years ago suggest the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir artificial origin.  But whose hands this creation, which is a flat platform at the top of the hill, where in a circle with a diameter of twelve meters and there are five strange recesses of three meters in depth, is not known. </p><p>  The anomalous zones of the Rostov region associated with the Aksai catacombs are better known for all kinds of legends and stories with historical background.  But here, there were some victims and strange phenomena.  The victims of the Kobyakov caves were two research soldiers who performed fairly peaceful engineering reconnaissance in 1949.  The ghostly wandering corridors of the 18th Century Customs Outpost Museum-Museum, and the locals are fully convinced that a strange <span>predatory animal</span> lives in the dungeon <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the anomalous zones of Russia, you can enter every city and settlement with ancient history.  Legends and tales of strange phenomena can be heard in remote villages and even in the center of the metropolis, such as the Bulgakov Museum in Moscow ‚ÄúBad Apartment‚Äù or the Devil's Cemetery in the forests <span>of the Angara River,</span> where the village of Karamyshevo is closest. </p>
