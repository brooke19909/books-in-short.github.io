  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application 'Bullfinch', made together with the child</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reflecting on the topics of your joint <span>activities with the child,</span> take a sufficient amount of time for the application.  This will help introduce the baby to the world and instill an artistic taste.  It‚Äôs worth starting with the flora and fauna.  The Bullfinch applique is perfect for exploring birds.  This is a very interesting topic on which diverse work can be performed.  Let's consider several options. </p><p>  <strong>Application "Bullfinch" from paper</strong> </p><p>  We will need multi-colored paper, a brush, glue, half a landscape sheet, a pencil and scissors.  Preparing the material for the lesson, it is worthwhile to make templates of each bullfinch detail in advance for the convenience of the baby.  And the best option would be if you cut out all the details in advance, and the child only glues them. </p><p>  Before class, during a walk, pay attention to the child sitting on a branch of birds.  Tell us about some species, including bullfinches.  Focus on the external features of various birds, such as the red breast of a bullfinch. </p><p>  Continuing your story about birds, invite the child to make a bullfinch from the already prepared paper parts and stick it on a piece of paper.  Correct the child‚Äôs actions by explaining and showing how to handle the glue and parts to get the best result.  Entrust the kid to independently <span>cut</span> a tree branch <span>from paper</span> for application.  Finished work can be hung on the wall in the children's room. </p><p>  <strong>Application "Bullfinch" with drawing elements</strong> </p><p>  For work, you will also need cut out paper parts, glue and half a landscape sheet, as well as paints and a brush. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before sticking the applique, together with the child, draw on the leaf with the help of paints a tree branch on which the bullfinch will sit.  After that, having laid out the parts in the necessary order, stick them on paper.  You can also paint beak and falling snowflakes with paints. </p><p>  <strong>Application "Bullfinch" using cotton wool</strong> </p><p>  This work will differ from previous versions in a small decorative element.  Or rather, with snow on a branch that is made from ordinary cotton wool.  After you and the baby pasted the bullfinch applique on the sheet, invite him to decorate the twig with small pieces of cotton wool.  You got a decorative <span>New Year's application.</span>  By showing how you can create a composition using various materials, you help your child develop imagination, imagination, and creativity. </p><p>  <strong>Application "Bullfinch" with natural material</strong> </p><p>  This work can be done by an older child (primary school students will cope with it on their own, and kindergarteners will need the help of their parents).  To work, you need several twigs of birch or spruce, a sheet of black paper, cut blanks for bullfinch, glue and scissors. </p><p>  First you need to lay out the details on the table and stick them on a white sheet of paper in the correct order.  In the end, you should get a bullfinch.  Now we cut the bullfinch and put the finished bird on the wrong side of a sheet of black paper.  We circle the outline and carefully cut it out.  We get two bullfinch parts, one black and the other colored.  We glue the parts together, leaving about 1 centimeter below the bird free. </p><p>  Now we come to the most difficult moment in our <span>creative work.</span>  It is required to stick a paper blank on a twig.  Choose the most suitable place for the bullfinch.  Thoroughly glue the loose strip at the bottom of the bird with glue.  Glue is applied to the inside of both parts.  We insert a twig between the parts and tightly squeeze.  Within 2-3 minutes you will have to hold the bonding place, waiting for the glue to set. </p><p>  Thus, you can make several birds on one branch.  By installing such a composition in a vase, you can get an excellent decorative element for the New Year holidays. </p><p>  Applications made of natural material help the child‚Äôs imagination and make him a little closer to nature. </p>
