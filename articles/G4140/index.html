Various products in the form of them are often used to develop women's accessories.  You can make crafts with insects with your own hands from improvised materials.  In this master class, we will try to make beautiful lace butterflies from napkins, then to use them to decorate the interior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY insect from bottles" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1874469.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  The necessary materials for one craft: </p><ul><li>  2 napkins; </li><li>  pin; </li><li>  watercolor paints; </li><li>  chenille wire; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  rhinestones; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  Let the children gently paint the napkins with watercolors as they like.  Warn that wet paper often tears and you need to gently brush with a brush.  Then lay the blanks to the side to dry, cut a small piece of chenille wire and insert it into the clothespin so that the antennae of the butterfly turn out.  Secure with glue.  Decorate the insect head with rhinestones.  Now take the napkins and fold them in half twice.  Scissor out a pattern, like on paper snowflakes.  Gather two napkins together to make wings, and secure with a clothespin.  That's all, the butterfly is ready! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Insects out of the box from eggs </h2><p>  The next interesting option.  You can make crafts - insects - with your own hands from paper from packing eggs.  To do this, it is enough to stock up on the box itself, paints, scissors and a rep ribbon or chenille wire.  Separately, you can purchase eyes for figures.  The easiest way to make bees from sections is from packaging.  You just need to cut off one of them and let the child paint the upper part with yellow and black paint.  Wings are cut from the same box or chenille wire and glued. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY paper crafts" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1874479.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bee can be planted on a flower made of the same section, but cut along the edges into several parts.  If you cut three sections in a row without separating them, you get a blank for the ant.  His body is covered with black paint, and the paws are made of chenille wire or rep ribbon, assembled on a thread to make a "brush".  For this purpose, a thick wire is also suitable, which is inserted into the middle of the body of the insect.  Caterpillars and spiders are created in the same way. </p><h2>  Newspaper snail </h2><p>  There are very light crafts insects.  With their own hands for a kindergarten, their child will be able to make them with minimal help.  For example, you can use unnecessary newspapers or magazines found in every home to make a snail.  Such needlework will teach the child to reuse materials and take care of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY insects from improvised materials" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1874473.jpg" width="534"></div>

We fix the edges with tape. </li><li>  We color the tube from all sides and wait until the paint dries. </li><li>  Now you need to roll the tube into a spiral, leaving a small "tail".  We fix the spiral with tape. </li><li>  A child can glue the eyes of a snail on its own, make horns from wire and draw a muzzle.  The craft is ready. </li></ol><h2>  Bead caterpillar </h2><p>  To develop fine motor skills it is very useful to work with beads, beads and other small decorative elements.  Children will definitely like to make a worm from large beads together with their parents.  Colors and textures can be combined at your discretion. </p><p>  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  chenille wire; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  nippers; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  artificial eyes. </li></ul><p>  Cut a piece of chenille wire of the desired length.  Begin to create an insect craft with your own hands, securing a ball from one end.  Now you need to make a loop of wire to hold it in place.  Then pass the blank to your child and ask him to string the beads, alternating colors.  It may be painstaking work, but it is great for developing hand-eye coordination.  Leave some space on the end and shape your head.  Fasten the wire loop.  Stick the eyes on both sides, and then shape the track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY insect crafts for kindergarten" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1874470.jpg" width="525"></div>
