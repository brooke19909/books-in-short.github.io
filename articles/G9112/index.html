Around the world, many people have been using this product for ten years, but electronic cigarettes have appeared recently in the CIS countries. </p><p>  In appearance, an electronic cigarette is very similar to regular tobacco cigarettes, but it doesn‚Äôt consist of tobacco and filter, but of a battery, cartridge and atomizer. </p><p>  Benefit or harm? </p><p>  Most people have long been interested in the question of which <span>cigarettes are better to</span> smoke, which brand to give preference to.  And answering this question, people themselves were guided by the opinion of others, what is fashionable, and which cigarettes are the best, they were actively prompted by advertising.  But this is an individual matter! </p><p>  Nevertheless, the problem of the dangers or vice versa of the benefits of electronic cigarettes torments hundreds, or even thousands of people around the world.  However, many are wondering which <span>electronic cigarettes are better?</span>  Yes, and generally harmful or are they for health in general?  Of course, more detailed information can be obtained from specialists or manufacturers. </p><p>  It is difficult to say that these cigarettes are harmless, of course, they are harmful if we are talking about those cigarettes that contain nicotine.  And if the electronic version contains a cartridge without nicotine, then it does no harm to the smoker himself or to the people around him.  Yes, even if we talk about nicotine electronic cigarettes, then their detrimental effect is negligible compared to the level of exposure from regular smoking, because the level of nicotine and the presence of various chemicals and compounds in electronic cigarettes are practically minimal.  Which means that they are not the cause of many diseases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a very long time, representatives of the business and healthcare sectors have been engaged in heated debates about the appropriateness and effectiveness of using electronic cigarettes, thereby answering which electronic cigarettes are better, be it Pons, IZI or Gamucci.  It all depends on the manufacturer, which is why it is best to give preference to trusted firms that have proven themselves in the trading market, as manufacturers that you can trust.  And the golden rule is not to save!  After all, why spend money on something that in no way helps to improve your health. </p><p>  Of course, most oncologists claim that electronic cigarettes do not harm the human body, and it does not matter which electronic cigarettes are better.  After conducting a number of studies, various independent examinations, scientists have proved that all kinds of <span>cancer</span> can not occur due to the effects of those substances contained in electronic cigarettes.  Cardiologists unanimously say the same thing, because they do not see any threat of cardiovascular diseases due to electronic cigarettes. </p><p>  When choosing electronic cigarettes, you should also pay attention to the fact that instead of replaceable cartridges, you can use a special liquid that is poured into the cartridge itself.  People who have been using electronic cigarettes for a long time claim that it is best to use this particular liquid, because it lasts for a lot more puffs. </p><p>  Take care of your health! </p><p>  Doctors in the USA advise all their patients to switch to the use of electronic cigarettes, because their purchase indicates that the person really cares about his health, which is why he decides not to expose him to unreasonable risk.  Doctors are also convinced that electronic cigarettes should be assigned to the group of tobacco products, and not to health care devices.  Indeed, the popularization of this product will help people realize that electronic cigarettes are completely safe not only for themselves, but also for others.  After all, you rid them of tobacco smoke, which they are so tired of breathing.  In addition, <span>smoking electronic cigarettes is</span> allowed in many public places.  Which electronic cigarettes are <span>better, a person</span> decides for himself, the main thing is a timely awareness of their benefits to the human body! </p>
