  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Most Valuable Irish Knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, there are many different knitting techniques.  But by right, the most beautiful and most complex technique is Irish crochet. </p><p>  Because of its complexity and originality, only Irish knitting allows you to make a product, a certain part of which cannot be repeated in the same way, no matter how much you would like to.  Tie an exact copy of a dress or sweatshirt according to the magazine scheme does not work, because you still get something different, different from the original, something unique.  That is why things that are connected in this way are so highly valued. </p><p>  This style has other names.  Among them are guipure type-setting lace, Irish guipure, Irish lace, and guipure crochet. </p><p>  Irish knitting, in particular its technique of execution, is quite young.  Its appearance dates back two centuries earlier.  At first, Irish needlewomen distributed their work only within Ireland itself, namely, the environs of Belfast and Dublin.  The rapid increase in demand for Irish lace, respectively, entailed a significant increase in the number of its manufacturers.  And when Irish knitting became famous in 1900 in France and entered the arena of fashion all over the world, it has established itself as a classic knitting to our time. </p><p>  In practical exercises, the technique of knitting the lace itself is very important.  The first step is to make a pattern.  It is for Irish lace that is a prerequisite.  If the technique of knitting or crocheting webs does not require a pattern, but only the correct calculation of the loops, then working with lace elements is a priority.  Mark the recesses on it (unless, of course, you will make them).  A newspaper or <span>graph paper is</span> not suitable for a pattern <span>.</span>  For this, just the fabric or <span>plastic bag</span> (the most dense and transparent enough) is just right. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Be sure to take into account the fact that you will need a surface for assembling the lace itself, on which motifs sewn or pinned with pins will be tightly fixed.  The foam rubber covered with fabric or an ordinary pillow-dummy can perfectly play the role of such a surface.  Make sure that this surface remains mobile for moving it in different directions. </p><p>  The Irish lace technique is crocheted using three threads of different thicknesses.  From the very beginning, all the details of the pattern are made with a thread of medium thickness, after which they are connected together by an openwork mesh, which is knitted with a thin thread.  And the basis of the lace itself is performed using the thickest thread. </p><p>  Knitting such a lace requires a certain level of skill in crocheting.  Since the execution of all models does not imply their execution in successive rows, like ordinary knitwear.  This requires a more complex implementation of each of the parts. </p><p>  Irish lace begins to be knitted with motifs, which subsequently make up the pattern itself.  Yarn for knitting use twisted, thin or medium thickness.  To give the connected part a more embossed shape, as a rule, they lay a thread in several additions under the columns during knitting. </p><p>  Having finished work on the motives, fix them on a template made of paper.  On it, pre-draw those ornaments that will serve as the basis for your future product.  The template consists of contours of motifs and lines along which a fastening mesh will be connected in the future.  After that, the motives are connected one after another with the help of a thin openwork mesh (background).  In this way, Irish knitted lace is created.  Combine motifs on paper by placing them face down. </p><p>  The fact that Irish knitting is still an individual handmade work of the master, and is his most important value. </p>
