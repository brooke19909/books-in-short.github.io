Today, it is distinguished from neighboring settlements only by the abundance of attractions.  However, the history of this city is very complicated and rich in a variety of events.  What is famous for the city of Bogoroditsk, Tula region? </p><h2>  Through the pages of history ... </h2>

It was then that a watch post was established on the site of the modern city to protect Moscow from the south.  Quickly enough, where today the Bogoroditsk of the Tula region is located, a wooden fortress was built, and artisans, farmers and other people began to settle in its vicinity.

    <p>  The status of the settlement has changed several times in the history of its existence.  Bogoroditsk (Bogoroditskaya - until the 17th century) was both an urban settlement and a settlement, and then again a city since 1777.  Significant in the fate of this settlement was the end of the eighteenth century, then on the site of the destroyed fortress a chic palace of Counts Bobrinsky was erected. </p><p>  During World War II, the city was captured by enemy troops.  For a whole month Bogoroditsk was under occupation, during this time the Germans destroyed more than half of the houses, 32 people were executed.  December 15, 1941 the city was liberated.  After the war, Bogoroditsk becomes an industrial center, active coal mining is being carried out in its vicinity, new plants and factories are opening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bogoroditsk today </h2><p>  Today, more than 31,000 people live in the city, it is correct to call local residents: the Bogorodchane, the Bogorodchan and the Bogorodchanka.  Bogoroditsk of the Tula region has a bus station and a railway station, which makes it easy to get from here to the regional center - Tula - and to many other Russian settlements.  You can leave the city by train or bus to Moscow, St. Petersburg, Donetsk, <span>Lipetsk, Voronezh.</span>  Near Bogoroditsky passes the federal highway M4 ("Don").  Until 2010, a large plant, BZTHI, functioned in Bogoroditsk, but today it is declared bankrupt.  However, the industry of the region can be noted as quite developed due to the abundance of private industries. </p><h2>  Bogoroditsk (Tula region): photos and description of natural attractions </h2>

But this does not deprive the charm and beauty of the local nature.  One of the specific features of this area is heaps.  These are artificially created ‚Äúmountains‚Äù near coal mines from worked out impurities of the rock.  It is enough to leave the city and carefully look around, heaps can be seen on the horizon, effectively rising above the surface of fields and meadows.

In addition to coal, sand and limestone were mined in this area by open-pit mining; the quarries developed were eventually abandoned and filled with water.  The resulting water bodies delight the eye with rocky steep banks and sandy beaches, and the water in them has an incredible azure color.  That is why the people often call them ‚Äúblue lakes‚Äù. </p><h2>  Palace of Counts Bobrinsky </h2>

The date of the beginning of its construction is considered to be 1771.  A small but very beautiful palace, a Kazan church and a bell tower have survived to our days.  The chic park around the main buildings was broken by A.T. Bolotov - a famous writer, philosopher, as well as a talented agronomist.

    <p>  An interesting fact is that the palace was almost completely destroyed during the Great Patriotic War.  But, thanks to the efforts of ordinary residents of the city, it was quickly restored completely.  And today the city of Bogoroditsk, Tula region, again boasts a unique historical object.  Today the main building of the palace and park ensemble has been turned into a museum, always ready to receive tourists, ceremonial wedding ceremonies, theatrical performances and some other creative events are also held here. </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2>
