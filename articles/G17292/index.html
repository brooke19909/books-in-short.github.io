    <h2>  Smolino Lake </h2><p>  Since ancient times <span>, Smolino Lake</span> was famous for its healing waters.  At the end of the XIX century, scientists found that bathing from lake water and bathing in it itself cure many diseases and have a beneficial effect on the body.  Smolin resort became famous throughout the country, and hundreds of people came here. </p><p>  Today, the lake is increasingly replenished with fresh water from the pipeline, and the healing properties of Smolino can only be learned from history.  With the disappearance of the “seaside resort”, the local attraction has not become less popular.  The lake remains one of the favorite vacation spots of citizens.  Hotel “Smolino Park” (Chelyabinsk) offers an unusual outdoor recreation. </p><h2>  By the lake </h2><p>  Smolino Park is considered one of the best hotels not only in the city, but also in the region.  Not the least role is played by the location - on the lake, only a 15-minute drive from the center.  This place is suitable not only for family vacations.  In Smolino, wedding ceremonies are often held, as well as major exhibitions and conferences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
