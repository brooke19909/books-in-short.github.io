    <p>  The most convenient for work is a bead with a diameter of 8 mm.  Therefore, it was she who was taken as a basis.  However, you can braid any beads you like.  To create jewelry usually take a diameter of 6 to 12 mm.  During weaving, you only need to adjust the number of beads in a row.  Accordingly, the larger the bead, the more it will be needed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Braiding beads with beads.  Stage 1 </h2><p>  At this stage, a base will be created, which will then be applied to the bead.  These are only 3 rows of weaving, but it is very important to do everything right away.  Experienced needlewomen for this reason recommend using Czech or Japanese beads for braiding beads.  So, how to braid with a bead?  Where to begin? </p><ol><li>  Take the fishing line, thread the tip into the needle and collect 4 beads of the same color.  Then assemble them so that you get a ring.  Be sure to leave the end of the fishing line 10 cm long to make it more convenient to work in the future.  Tie 2 knots.  At the end, thread the needle into the 1st bead. </li><li>  In the second row, collect one beads of a different color.  In this case, after each bead, thread a needle into the bead of the previous row.  Thus, it should turn out 4 pieces already in the second row.  The needle is also threaded into the 1st bead for 2 rows. </li><li>  In the third row, increase the number of beads by 2 times, that is, there should be 8 pieces.  To do this, take 2 beads of the previous color (for example, darker), string them on a needle and thread it into the beads of the previous row and so on.  Again, the needle should be threaded into the 1st bead of the 3rd row. </li></ol><h2>  Beadwork. Beads.  Stage 2 </h2><p>  Since it is not very convenient to braid with a bead on a bead, it is advisable to fix it.  An ordinary eraser and a tailor's pin will perfectly help out.  At the first stage, put the woven blank on the bead and fix it with a gypsy needle in the eraser as conveniently.  This can be done tightly or fairly freely.  It is up to the needlewoman herself to decide, as she will bead herself with beads. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the 4th to the 11th row, braiding with beads beads, in principle, is no different.  Beads are sequentially stacked in each row, and then the needle is threaded through the beads of the previous row.  Each of them should have 8 pieces.  For beauty, you can alternate colors in each row: dark, light, dark, and so on.  After the completion of the 11th row, the braid is already holding well and you can remove the bead from the eraser.  Moreover, further it will be more convenient to weave simply on hand. </p><h2>  Beadwork. Beads.  Stage 3 </h2><p>  In row 12, the number of beads in a row is reduced to 4. This is done in this way.  Collect one bead of the desired color, and then thread the needle through 2 beads of the previous row immediately.  Collect 3 more beads in the same way.  As a result, only 4 pieces will remain in a row.  In the last and 13th row there will also be 4 beads.  It remains only to fix and hide the threads. </p>

    <p>  Experienced needlewomen recommend using special rings or pins and ready-made fasteners.  They can be purchased in needlework stores, taken from unnecessary jewelry and found in jewelry stores.  Using pliers, make small loops with which to assemble the beads into a bracelet.  Fasten the fastener at the ends.  Such a bracelet will look no worse than expensive jewelry. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>
