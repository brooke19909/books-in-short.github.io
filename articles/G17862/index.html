    <h2>  The myth of the birth of the Olympic Games </h2><p>  In ancient times, these were the greatest national festivities.  Who is the founder of the ancient Olympic Games is unknown.  Myths and legends played a significant role in the social and cultural life of the ancient Greeks.  The Greeks believed that the birth of the Olympic Games dates back to the time of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="8" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Kronos</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="48" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">- the</span> son of the first god Uranus.  In the competition between mythical heroes, Hercules won the run, for which he was <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="59" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">awarded a</span> wreath of olive.  Subsequently, the winner insisted that sporting events be held every five years.  That is the legend.  Of the origin of the Olympic Games, of course, there are other legends. </p><p>  The historical sources confirming the holding of these festivities in Ancient Greece include the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="9" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Iliad</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">" of</span> Homer.

    <h2>  Holy truce </h2><p>  A mere mortal who played a significant role in the development of the ancient Greek Olympic Games was King <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Ifit</span> .  During his reign, the interval between the competitions was already four years.  Resuming the Olympic Games, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Ifit</span> declared a sacred truce.  That is, during these festivals it was impossible to wage war.  And not only in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Elis</span> , but also in other parts of Hellas. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="14" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Elis</span> was considered a sacred place.  It was impossible to wage war with her.  True, later the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Eleists</span> themselves invaded neighboring regions more than once.  Why was the ancient Olympic Games called the holidays of the world?  Firstly, the holding of these competitions was connected with the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">names of the gods, whom the</span> ancient Greeks highly revered.  Secondly, for the month the aforementioned truce was announced, which had a special name - ·º±ŒµœÅŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒØŒ±. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="60" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Scientists</span> still have not come to a consensus about sports in the Olympic Games held by the Greeks.  It is believed that initially athletes competed only in running.  Later, wrestling and chariot races were added to the sports at the Olympics. </p>

    <h2>  Members </h2><p>  Among the citizens in ancient Greece were those who underwent public dishonor and contempt of others, that is, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">atimia</span> .  They could not become participants in the competition.  Only respected Hellenes.  Of course, barbarians, who could only be spectators, did not take part in the ancient Olympic Games.  An exception was made only in favor of the Romans.

If at the first Olympic Games in Ancient Greece (776 BC), only running competitions were held, then other sports appeared later.  And over time, poets and artists <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">got the</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="19" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">opportunity to</span> compete in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="61" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">their</span> skills.  During the festivities, even the deputies competed with each other in an abundance of offerings to mythical deities. </p><p>  From the history of the Olympic Games, it is known that these events had quite important social and cultural significance.  Transactions were made between merchants, artists and poets acquainted the public with their creations. </p><p>  Competitions were held on the first full moon after the summer solstice.  Five days went on.  A certain part of the time was devoted to sacrificial rites and to a public feast. </p>

It was said above that women did not have the right to participate in competitions.

    <h2>  Sanctuary of Ancient Greece </h2><p>  Where the Olympic Games were held, it is clear from the name.  Olympia is located in the northwestern part of the Peloponnesian Peninsula.  It once housed the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="26" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">temple and cultural</span> complex and the sacred grove of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Zeus</span> .  On the territory of the ancient Greek sanctuary there were religious buildings, monuments, sports facilities and houses in which participants and guests lived.  This place was the center of Greek art until the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="65" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">fourth</span> century BC.  Later, <span>sports facilities</span> were burned by order of Theodosius II. </p><p>  The Olympic stadium was built gradually.  He became the first in ancient Greece.  In the fifth century BC, this stadium received about forty thousand spectators.  For training, we used <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">gnasii</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="54" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">- a</span> structure whose treadmill was equal in length to the one that was at the stadium itself.  Another site for preliminary <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="55" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">preparation is palestra</span> .  It was a square structure with a courtyard.  It mainly trained athletes who competed in wrestling and fist fighting. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="29" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Leonidoyon</span> , which served as the <span>Olympic village,</span> was built in the fifth century BC according to the project of a famous architect in ancient Greece.  The huge building consisted of a courtyard <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="66" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">surrounded by</span> columns and included many rooms.  The Olympic Games played an important role in the religious life of the Greeks.  And therefore, local residents erected several temples and shrines here.  Structures fell into decay after the earthquake that occurred in the sixth century.  The hippodrome was finally destroyed during the flood. </p><p>  The last Olympic Games in Ancient Greece took place in the year 394.  Forbidden by Emperor Theodosius.  In the Christian era, these events were regarded as pagan.  The revival of the Olympic Games took <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">place</span> two millennia <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">later</span> .

    <h2>  The revival of ancient Greek traditions </h2><p>  The predecessors of the modern Olympic Games were Olympia, held in the middle of the 19th century.  But they, of course, were not so large-scale and had little in common with competitions, which nowadays take place every four years.  A significant role in the revival of the Olympic Games was played by the French <span>public figure</span> Pierre de Coubertin.  Why did Europeans suddenly recall the traditions of the ancient Greeks? </p><p>  In the middle of the XVII century, archaeological research was carried out in Olympia, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="71" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">as a result of</span> which scientists discovered the remains of temple structures.  Work continued for more than ten years.  At that time, everything related to Antiquity was popular in Europe.  The desire to revive the Olympic traditions was infected by many public and cultural figures.  At the same time, the French showed the greatest interest in the culture of sports in ancient Greece, although archaeological discoveries belonged to the Germans.  This can be easily explained. </p><p>  In 1871, the French army was defeated, which significantly undermined the patriotic spirit in society.  Pierre <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">de Coubertin</span> believed that the reason was the poor physical fitness of the soldiers.  He did not try to inspire his compatriots to fight with Germany and other European powers.  The French public figure spoke a lot about the need to improve physical education, but also <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="70" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar">advocated</span> overcoming <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="72" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">national</span> egoism and establishing international understanding. </p>

    <h2>  First Olympic Games: New Time </h2><p>  In June 1894, a congress was held at the Sorbonne, at which <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Coubertin</span> presented his thoughts to the world community about the need to revive ancient Greek traditions.  His ideas were supported.  On the last day of the congress, it was decided to hold the Olympic Games in two years.  They should have taken place in Athens.  The international competition committee was led by <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Demetrius</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Vikelas</span> .  Pierre de <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="32" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Coubertin</span> became Secretary General. </p><p>  The 1896 Olympic Games became the largest sporting event.  Greek statesmen put forward a proposal to hold the Olympic Games exclusively in their homeland.  However, the committee decided otherwise.  The venue of the Games changes every four years. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Olympic movement was not very popular.  This is partly due to the fact that at that time the World Exhibition was held in Paris.  Some historians believe that the Olympic ideas were saved thanks to the intermediate games of 1906, held again in Athens. </p><h2>  Differences of modern Games from ancient Greek </h2><p>  Competitions were resumed on the model of antique sports competitions.  The modern Olympic Games bring together athletes from all over the state; discrimination on individuals is not permitted on religious, racial or political grounds.  This, perhaps, is the main difference between modern Games and ancient Greek. </p><p>  What did the modern Olympic Games borrow from the ancient Greek?  First of all, the name itself.  The competition frequency was also borrowed.  One of the purposes of the modern Olympic Games <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="56" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is to</span> serve the world, to establish mutual understanding between countries.  This is in tune with the ideas of the ancient Greeks about a temporary truce in the days of the competition.  The Olympic flame and torch <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">are</span> symbols of the Olympics, which arose, of course, in antiquity.  The ancient Greeks also borrowed some terms and rules of the competition. </p><p>  There are, of course, several significant <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="73" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">differences</span> between modern Games and antique.  The ancient Greeks held sports exclusively at Olympia.  Today, the Games are organized every time in another city.  In ancient Greece, there was no such thing as a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="43" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> winter Olympic Games. <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="44" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span>  Yes, and the competition was different.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">In antiquity</span> , not only athletes but also poets participated <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">in the Olympic</span> Games. </p>

    <h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  Everyone knows how the symbol of the Olympic Games looks.  Five <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="67" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">bonded</span> rings of black, blue, red, yellow and green.  However, few know that these elements do not apply to any particular continent.  <span>The motto of the Olympic Games</span> is in Latin, translated into Russian means <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="45" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> faster, higher, stronger. <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="46" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span>  The flag is a white panel with the image of rings.  He has been rising at all Games since 1920. </p><p>  Both the opening and closing of the Games are accompanied by a grandiose, colorful ceremony.  The best organizers of mass events are involved in the development of the script.  Famous <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="68" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">actors</span> , singers seek to participate in this spectacle.  The broadcast of this international event attracts tens of millions of viewers around the world to television screens. </p><p>  If the ancient Greeks believed that in honor of the Olympic Games it was worthwhile to suspend any military operations, then in the twentieth century the opposite happened.  Sports were canceled due to <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="69" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">armed</span> conflict.  Games were not held in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">1916, 1940, 1944</span> .  In Russia, the Olympics took place twice.  In 1980 in Moscow and in 2014 in Sochi. </p>
