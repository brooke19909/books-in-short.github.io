Its picturesque nature is difficult to describe in words, it is much better, of course, to see with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Description of the area </h2><p>  Georgian Switzerland Racha-Lechkhumi - that is what this historical region rightly located in the upper reaches of the Rioni River is rightly called.  The center of this paradise of nature is considered the city of Ambrolauri. </p><p>  Let us describe the area that all of Georgia is proud of.  Racha, many centuries ago, was an area that was under the protectorate of the king of Imereti.  At the very beginning of the nineteenth century, it became part of the Russian Empire.  Now this is the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãOnskoy and Ambrolaursky regions of Georgia. </p><h2>  Cathedral in Nikortsminda </h2><p>  In addition to the amazing beauty of the mountain scenery, Racha will delight the tourist with the most ancient Orthodox shrines. </p>

    <p>  The Church of Our Lady of Barakoni is built on a cliff that rises above the Rioni River.  The construction has the shape of a cross with right angles.  The temple has no extensions.  The splendor of the exterior stone walls, richly decorated with carvings, is not inferior to the interior decoration of the church.  A slender stone building with a blue roof looks spectacular among a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgreen foliage. </p><h2>  Minda Fortress </h2><p>  Not far from the temple mentioned above are the ruins of the Minda fortress.  Historians have not decided on the exact date of construction of the temple.  But they claim that it existed already in the tenth century.  Later there was the residence of local rulers.  According to legend, it was here that the childhood of the great Georgian <span>queen Tamara</span> passed <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Racha (Georgia): attractions </h2><p>  Fans of medieval architecture will be very interested in visiting the fortresses of Kvari Bougeuli, Patara Oni and Labeci.  These, full of harsh, and at the same time exquisite beauty, buildings that survived in time look incomparably against the backdrop of mountains. </p><p>  In Rachi there are churches not only of the Orthodox faith.  In the city of Oni is a synagogue built in 1895.  This is where the center of the Jewish community in Georgia is located.  In addition to the synagogue, travelers will be curious to see the local history museum, which tells about the history of the city of Oni, once the capital of all Rachi.  Museum expositions are very diverse from archaeological finds to fragments of temple architecture built in the tenth century, at the dawn of the early Middle Ages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next city, undoubtedly worthy of the attention of tourists, is Ambrolauri.  In the seventeenth century the residence of the Imeretian kings was located here.  Noteworthy is the Museum of Fine Arts. </p><h2>  Khvanchara </h2><p>  In Ambrolauri, there is a monument to the wine of Khvanchar.  It is a huge bottle located on the main square of the city.  This wine has become a kind of calling card of the region.  It was originally called Kipianevsky.  By the surname of the princes Kipiani, who in 1907 presented this sort of wine at a prestigious competition in Belgium.  Wine made a splash.  It won the first prize.  And Georgia topped the list of the best wine-making countries.  Over time, this variety began to be called "Khvanchara."  According to the name of the village in which the grapes grow, "Alexandrouli" and "Mujuretuli" from which this wine is made. </p><h2>  Healing springs </h2><p>  Luxurious nature, amazingly healing mountain air - this is not all that Georgia is rich in.  Racha is a very interesting area.  There are a lot of healing unique sources.  Medical and mineral waters, some of which are rich in sulfur content, are located near the resorts of Hidikari, Bougeuli, Sortuani, Muashi, Keshvake, Shovi, Uzera.  In addition to healthy drinking, these places are simply marvelous corners of paradise.  In the village of Utsera, where the balneological resort of the same name is located, vacationers can visit the church of St. George, built in the Middle Ages.  And nearby </p><p>  there are the ruins of the fortress of three churches.  The unique nature of the mountainous region gives even the ruins a poetic, enchanting look. </p><h2>  Shaor reservoir </h2><p>  A magnificent natural attraction of the region is the Shaor reservoir. </p>
