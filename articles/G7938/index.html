    <h2>  Park Origin </h2><p>  The park was officially opened in May 1940, and eight years later it was named after the 30th anniversary of the Komsomol.  In Omsk it was impossible to find a place more suitable for this purpose.  On the territory of Novo-Zagorodnaya Grove several hundred thousand birches grew.  In the middle of the grove was a natural lake, the shape of which was an ideal circle.  The park was developing at an unusually fast pace.  Even before the Great Patriotic War, the first attractions, volleyball and Russian playgrounds, as well as a dance floor, appeared here. </p><p>  During the war, numerous statues were erected in the alleys, including compositions such as The Sailor, A Fighter on the Border with a Service Dog, A Girl with an Oar, A Girl Holding a Ball, A Girl Throwing a Disc, and Student with a textbook ‚Äù,‚Äú Archer ‚Äù. </p>
