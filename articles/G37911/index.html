One of the most beautiful places famous for the ski resorts of Italy is Cervinia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts italy cervinia" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/797570.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  <span>Dolomites are</span> dotted with all sorts of resort villages and complexes.  Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to understand where one ski resort ends and another begins.  Not only experienced athletes, but also careful beginners will be able to find the track here.  People who have already visited these places say that prices for holidays in the Italian Alps are pleasing - they are much lower than in French or Swiss ski resorts. </p><p>  Cervinia is especially popular.  Italy is a ski resort, tours for which are most in demand among foreigners.  Developed infrastructure is another advantage of Italian resort complexes.  Here you can find everything you need to relax after intense skiing on the mountain slopes.  Hotels, night clubs, various restaurants with excellent Italian cuisine, SPA salons, cafes, bars, shops selling ski equipment, and many other interesting places await skiers who decide to organize their winter holidays in Italy.  Here you can relax perfectly on your own or with the whole family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cervinia </h2><p>  At the foot of the tall peak of the Matterhorn lies the highest Italian ski resort - Cervinia.  Almost everyone who decides to visit the ski <span>resorts in Italy</span> comes here <span>.</span>  Cervinia is a small settlement, as if "stolen" from a New Year's card.  Lovely toy houses and majestic mountain landscapes have made this place the most popular ski resort in Italy.  Despite its small size, the town has restaurants, shops and supermarkets.  The town lives off tourism and is therefore trying so hard to please vacationers, creating ideal conditions for a winter holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cervinia italy ski resort" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/797571.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Like many other <span>ski resorts in Italy,</span> Cervinia provides the highest quality <span>customer service.</span>  For the benefit of athletes, there are 8 funiculars, as well as chairlifts, ski tows and cabin lifts.  These leisurely devices are the only reliable means of transportation on the snowy slopes of the Italian Alps. </p><p>  The population of Cervinia is only a thousand people, however, the village can accommodate up to 15 thousand tourists at the same time.  The environment here has not yet felt the harmful effects of the industrial era, and the ban on the use of vehicles allows you to keep the mountain air clean and healthy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trails </h2><p>  For beginners in <span>skiing,</span> or for those who have recently started their acquaintance with this exciting sport, the best that the Italian ski resorts can offer is Cervinia.  Reviews of those who have already visited this magical place will melt even the most callous hearts.  The tracks here are of considerable length, so the descent along them rarely takes less than 20 minutes.  There are many blue slopes, which will allow beginners to diversify their training in skiing, instead of training on the same track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resorts italy cervinia hotels" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/797572.jpg" width="600"></div>

The circuit diagram here resembles a web that has entangled the slopes of Matterhorn peak.  In such a variety it is difficult not to find a ski track for your skill in skiing. </p><h2>  Reviews for Cervinia and Resort Hotels </h2><p>  The place that glorified the Italian ski resorts is Cervinia.
