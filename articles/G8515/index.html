The fact is that this hotel is new.  It was built in 2013 under the name "Vertia Luxury Resort 5 *".  But under this name the hotel did not last long.  Already in March 2014, she changed the sign to "Premier Palace Hotel 5 *."  The hotel positions itself as a place of family vacation, with the maximum number of services for children and infants.  In this article we will comprehensively look at this hotel.  Does it match its stated five stars?  We will give photos of the hotel territory and rooms, as well as make a digest from the reviews of tourists who visited there recently, in the 2017 season.  Preliminarily, the Premier Palace Hotel 5 * hotel is located on the first line from the sea and has its own beach.  The word SPA is not in the name, but the above services are present in reality.  There is also a small water park.  Reviews recommend this hotel not only to families with small children, but also to couples who dream of a romantic getaway.  The hotel is also suitable for youth - the entertainment of guests at the Premier Palace is given great importance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Premier Palace Hotel 5." class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1994703.jpg" width="600"></div>

This resort town is included in the zone of influence of Kemer, which, in turn, belongs to the Anatolian Riviera.  Tourists are often interested in the question: how long will the transfer from the airport to the hotel take?  It depends on traffic jams at the exit from Antalya Airport.  Beldibi lies halfway between the capital of the Riviera and Kemer.  Therefore, with a group transfer of tourists traveling to this resort village, they will be brought first.  Beldibi is separated from Antalya by some 25 kilometers.  Therefore, the path will take about half an hour.  The Premier Palace Hotel 5 * is located on the north-eastern outskirts of the village, in an ecologically clean area, on the first line of the sea.  Reviews say that the rocky slopes of the Taurus Mountains come right up to the hotel, but the terrain of the hotel itself is flat and you don‚Äôt have to go up and down the stairs.  And this distinguishes the hotel from similar resort complexes in the neighborhood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Premier Palace Hotel 5 Turkey" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1994728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Almost all reviews mention the huge size of the Premier Palace Hotel 5 *.  There are not so many buildings on the territory.  Here stands one three-story building, called the "Main Building" (there is a restaurant and reception) and ten one-story villas.  The rest of the territory of 90 thousand square meters is occupied by a flowering garden.  Palms, bougainvilleas, all kinds of Mediterranean shrubs and trees create a truly relaxing atmosphere.  The territory also has many pools (we will talk about them later), a spa center, a water park, children's playgrounds, a la carte restaurants, bars and other infrastructure, without which modern relaxation is impossible.  Lawns smoothly overlook a wide and long beach.  The path to the shore passes through the hookah room and the pavilion, where G√∂zleme is baked - for those who have not yet eaten.  Near the beach there are slot machines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Premier Palace Hotel 5 *: room description </h2><p>  As in many hotels, this room for the guests are divided into categories.

Premier Palace Hotel 5 * (Turkey) positions itself as a venue for a honeymoon.  Especially for honeymooners, the hotel has the Honeymoon Suites and the larger Honeimun Suite Executive.  These rooms have a private jacuzzi.  The real islands of exquisite oriental luxury are the Prestige and Platinum Duplex suites.  They have not only a jacuzzi, but also a spacious terrace, and in some categories of rooms there is more than one.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe suites is amazing - not a hotel room, but a real palace!

    <h2>  Hotel Food System </h2><p>  The entire tourist season, which lasts in Beldibi from April 1 to October 31, the hotel offers its guests the concept of "Ultra all inclusive."  What does this notorious UAI in Premier Palace Hotel 5 * mean?  Meals are supposed to be around the clock.  Breakfast is available from seven in the morning.  This meal lasts until ten.  A brunch is served immediately thereafter.  From 10:00 to 22:00 you can enjoy ice cream.  For dinner, they invite to half past twelve.  Do not want to change clothes to visit the restaurant?  Then you can dine fast food in the tent.  A worthy end to the afternoon meal will be a coffee party with traditional Turkish sweets, served from one to six in the evening.  Dinner lasts from seven to half past nine.  Managed to get hungry?  Then welcome to a late dinner, which lasts from half past ten to two in the night.  For a fee, meals will be delivered to your room. </p><h2>  Other restaurants, cafes, bars </h2><p>  The main place of all meals can accommodate a thousand guests and has both an air-conditioned room and an open terrace under a canopy.  In the mini-club Premier Palace Hotel 5 * there is a special children's restaurant, so you do not need to pick up a child to feed him lunch and dinner.  This establishment is open from noon to eight in the evening.  A lot of reviews are devoted to a la carte restaurants.  Moreover, for their visit, payment is not required, but only a preliminary table reservation.  Tartufo specializes in Italian cuisine, Tulip specializes in Turkish, Far East Cuisine specializes in the Far East, and Barracuda serves fish and seafood.  All a la carte restaurants are open in the evening, from seven to ten.  But the menu is served not only in them.  The pool has a terrace where waiters serve a la carte snacks (from 12:30 to 16:00).  Reservation for visiting this cafe is not required.  Judging by the reviews, the Turkish Garden is a great place.  Delicious guzleme is baked there and sweets are served.  The guests lost count of how many bars in the hotel: on the beach, on the pier, by the pool, in bowling, in the evening at a disco ... There is a 24-hour piano bar, vitamin (with juices and other healthy drinks), as well as a real Irish pub .  There is also a hookah, but its visit is paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Premier Palace Hotel 5 - Beldibi" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1994747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  Tourists choosing a hotel with Ultra All Inclusive expect not only to swim in the sea, but also to arrange a celebration for their stomach.  And they clearly were not mistaken in choosing the Premier Palace Hotel 5 *.  Nutrition reviews are the most enthusiastic.  In the main restaurant every Wednesday there is a fish gala dinner, and on Saturdays - Turkish Night.  So tourists do not recommend ordering a la carte these days.  As for these restaurants, reviews praise Turkish, Italian and Barracuda.  Sweet tooth loved ice cream and pastries at a local patisserie.  Coffee is served from vending machines.  Tourists suggest: if you have an early departure or are you going on an excursion, you can order a lounge box at the reception, but ahead of time, on the evening before.  About the service in the bars speak only good.  All drinks are free.  Bartenders can mix great cocktails.  Especially praised are reviews of the Irish Pub. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  The coast in Beldibi is strewn with large pebbles.  But for its guests, the Premier Palace Hotel 5 * beach ennobled.  Sand was brought in and a pier was built.  To the beach from the building - 200 meters, from the villas and even less.  The hotel‚Äôs own piece of coast is wide and long - 630 meters.  Reviews say that it is better to go to the sea from the pier - comfortable ladders are equipped there.  Loungers enough for everyone.  There is no need to get up before the light to take a seat.  Sun beds with umbrellas are on the beach, and on the pier, and by the pools.  There are also a few of them - they are all with fresh water.  There are two outdoor pools (swimming and relaxation), one in the room, a jacuzzi, for children, for babies (very small), a private villa and one where four slides of the water park descend.  Sun beds are covered with soft mattresses.  For a fee, you can rent a bali bad (beach tent). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Premier Palace Hotel 5 Beach" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1994730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General hotel reviews </h2><p>  Tourists were satisfied with the vacation spent in the Premier Palace Hotel 5 * (Beldibi).  A large green area and a huge amount of entertainment makes sorties into the city unnecessary.  The staff is very friendly, friendly and tries to please.  The rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable.  Food and drink are beyond praise.  The beach is as comfortable as possible in Beldibi.  In some places there is soft sand, but in order to avoid injuries on large pebbles, it is better to go into the sea in coral slippers or from the pier.  The hotel has a lot of children relaxing.  Plus or minus is up to you.  The national composition of vacationers is very mixed: there are Russians, and tourists from Central and Western Europe, and Turks. </p>
