    <p>  The front part consists of two shelves.  Cut them out, making recesses on the chest and abdomen.  The main difficulty here is the small size of the doll's figure.  The work ahead is pretty delicate.  Both halves are laced in front.  Its role can be performed by a dense thick thread.  Its edges can be tied to knots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The skirt is sewn in a circular pattern, as for a sun-flared skirt.  On paper draw a circle equal to the circumference of the waist.  Take a little more to make it comfortable for your child to put on a dress on the doll.  Then you need to measure the length of the skirt and draw the same radius, then draw a larger circle with compasses.  Since the front of the dress is shortened, they draw it on the pattern.  Then, according to the template, the pattern is transferred to the fabric and cut out.  Do not forget to leave 0.5 cm on each side to the seams.  Before making clothes for a Monster High doll, you need to outline all the details and then sew on a sewing machine with an overlock or overlock foot.  If the machine is not at home, you will have to go around all the seams with stitches over the edge so that the denim does not crumble. </p><p>  At the back, under the skirt, a gathered piece of tulle is sewn so that the dress has a magnificent shape.  It turns out an elegant and fashionable dress. </p><h2>  Hani swamp </h2><p>  How to make clothes for the Monster High doll using jewelry from satin ribbons, we will describe further.  One of the most popular girls from the Monster School is the curly-haired beauty Hani Swamp.  This is a swamp monster, so her body and hair have a swamp green color.

    <p>  The dress is easy to sew, as it is quite simple.  Two halves (back and front) are free, differ only in the size of the neckline.  In front he is larger.  But on the back you will have to make a cut and sew a hook so that the dress can be worn, because Hani's hair style is quite voluminous.  The skirt is a rectangular pipe.  When sketching it with a bodice, you need to make a couple of folds, evenly distributing the fabric along the waistline.  Sew a strip of lace from the bottom.  Separately, you can wind several roses from thin satin ribbons and sew them along the hem. </p><h2>  Knitted set </h2><p>  For knitters it will not be difficult to knit leggings and a raglan sweater.  Before you <span>make clothes for a Monster High doll</span> from yarn, you need to find the thinnest knitting needles and threads.  The sweater should have a large neckline, otherwise it can not be worn. </p>
