The device has been on the market for more than four years, which is by the standards of mobile devices for a very long time, but still has not lost its relevance against the heap of "Chinese". </p><p>  The Highscreen Alpha R phone has something to boast of and there is something to offer domestic consumers in the gadget category up to 10,000 rubles.  The model turned out to be somewhat ambiguous, so there is something to understand here. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of Highscreen Alpha R. Consider the main characteristics of the model, its advantages and disadvantages, analyze the appropriateness of the purchase.  Take into account the feedback of ordinary phone users. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Highscreen Alpha R comes in a simple and unremarkable box made of cardboard with a natural yellowish tint.  There are no mention of any bright colors, pictures with sunsets or cars, like those of noble brands.  But such savings are not critical, because the main thing here is not a wrapper, but the candy itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gagadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone delivery set" class="if uuid-2449579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449579.jpg"></div><p>  The front part shows a rather detailed diagram in the context of Highscreen Alpha R and characteristics of the main elements.  There are no other specifications on the package, but the specifics can be seen in the detailed instructions for use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Equipment: </p><ul><li>  Highscreen Alpha R smartphone; </li><li>  battery; </li><li>  headphones; </li><li>  mini USB charger; </li><li>  cable for recharging and synchronizing with a PC; </li><li>  additional battery; </li><li>  dubbing the back panel; </li><li>  protective film; </li><li>  warranty card and other documentation. </li></ul><p>  The delivery set can be called rich.  Here we have a high-quality power adapter with the same cable, and an excellent headset, and even a spare battery with a back cover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xdrv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone accessories" class="if uuid-2449576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449576.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews on Highscreen Alpha R, users are quite happy with the bundle.  Even the protective film turned out to be surprisingly high quality and lays down like a native, and very easily: even someone who has never glued the film can handle it. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Highscreen Alpha R turned out to be a rather large gadget: 144 x 72 x 9.5 mm plus a weight of 156 g along with a standard battery.  If you install an additional battery, the phone "gets fat" by about another five millimeters, as well as gets heavier until 204. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thinkit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone appearance" class="if uuid-2449581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449581.jpg"></div><p>  On sale you can find only two color options - white with glossy plastic and black with soft-touch coating.  The constitution of Highscreen Alpha R is rectangular with slightly rounded and beveled corners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ends smoothly pass to the front panel, as a result of which a small and tactile tangible side is formed.  The latter adds a few points to the protection of the display if the phone lies face down.  In addition, the screen is additionally protected from damage by a rather thick protective glass.  This, of course, is not the famous Gorilla, but the device is not scratched in the pockets, and it‚Äôs difficult for him to do anything with his nails. </p><p>  The surface of the glass is easily soiled, and it collects fingerprints, like a vacuum cleaner, since they are very easily removed.  On a glossy white case, the stains are invisible, but on the black version with a soft touch it is very difficult to leave them in principle. </p><p>  In general, judging by the reviews, users are satisfied with the exterior of the device.  It does not stand out as something special, but it cannot be called frankly budget either.  Here we have a solid middle peasant without claims to originality.  In any case, if someone does not like the appearance, then you can always decorate it with some kind of funny cover. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the front of the top you can see a barely noticeable mesh, under which the speaker is hidden.  The volume of the latter is slightly higher than usual, the main layout of tones is pleasant, and intelligibility can be described as average, that is, in some cases the interlocutor at that end seems to be muttering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="helpix.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone interfaces" class="if uuid-2449575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449575.jpg"></div><p>  To the right of the speaker is the eye of the front camera, and a little to the left are proximity and light sensors.  There is also a rather sensible indicator of missed events, signaling about incoming SMS, battery level and calls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Under the screen at Highscreen Alpha R there are three familiar touch buttons - ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  The latter are clearly marked with white paint and have a bright backlight, so you won‚Äôt have to work by touch. </p><p>  On the left side, almost "under the ceiling", is the volume rocker.  It is slightly recessed into the case and made of ordinary plastic.  Users on this issue leave mixed reviews about Highscreen Alpha R. On the one hand, it seems to be original, and does not interfere with grip while working in landscape mode, but on the other hand, reaching it if necessary is not entirely convenient. </p><h2>  Exterior Features </h2><p>  The power button is located on the upper end, there is also a 3.5 mm mini-jack output and a micro-USB port.  The right side is devoid of at least some elements and is absolutely smooth.  On the back side in the usual place is the camera‚Äôs eye, a little way off - the flash and speaker. </p><p>  The cover looks durable and is not very easy to remove, but it‚Äôs for the better, because many users in their reviews very often complain about backlashes in this area.  It‚Äôs better to pry a small groove with a tool or a strong nail than to constantly find the phone open. </p><p>  Under the cover there are slots for standard SIM cards, and a little higher is the receiver for external SD-drives.  The battery does not overlap the memory card, but the manufacturer strongly discourages getting involved in hot swapping. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The touchscreen of Highscreen Alpha R is not particularly noticeable and works as it should - moderately understandable, moderately responsive.  For a 5-inch diagonal, resolutions of 1920 by 1080 pixels and a pixel density of 440 ppi are enough with the head, and there is not even a hint of pixelation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone screen" class="if uuid-2449578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449578.jpg"></div><p>  The display matrix also pleased with its characteristics.  Highscreen Alpha R received an intelligent screen with IPS and OGS technologies, which largely saved the thinness of the smartphone.  The capabilities of the matrix allow you to safely work with the gadget on a sunny day without loss of readability. </p><p>  In addition, the screen boasts a solid margin of brightness and contrast, as well as excellent viewing angles.  You can safely flip through pictures or watch videos in the company of one or two like-minded people.  The matrix, although it gives excellent brightness, but the backlight still does not cope with direct sunlight and the phone has to be tilted a little or covered with a palm. </p><p>  Users are very positive about the matrix of the phone and its capabilities.  It‚Äôs a pleasure to work on it, especially if you look at the side of Chinese gadgets, which for the most part are the most capable of it, it‚Äôs HD-sweep, and here we have full Full HD-resolution. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  A very good set of chipsets based on the MT6589T processor from Mediatek is responsible for the device‚Äôs performance.  The latter also featured an additional set of instructions for secure streaming data - ARM TrustZone.  The graphic part fell on the shoulders of the PowerVR accelerator SGX 544MP series. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.notebookcheck.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone processor" class="if uuid-2449582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449582.jpg"></div><p>  On board the device installed 1 GB of RAM and 4 GB of internal.  Of the latter, exactly half is available to the user, so it is very difficult to do without an external drive.  The internal slot quietly accepts cards, both 64-gigabyte and 128, so there are no problems with free space. </p><p>  The interface works like a clock and instantly responds to user tapes.  All regular software runs almost instantly and eliminates even a hint of braking and lags.  Judging by user reviews, problems sometimes happen with amateur or branded (from mobile operators) firmware for Highscreen Alpha R. </p><h2>  Platform features </h2><p>  The interface in this case may not always behave appropriately and "dull" with or without.  The original stock firmware for Android saves.  You can find it both on the official website of the phone‚Äôs developer, and on specialized forums.  There are also no problems with self-installation, but beginners should still contact the service center and give 500-700 rubles to guarantee the stability of the platform. </p><p>  As for the "heavy" toys, then this is all good.  Almost all applications from Google Play are launched normally, work and behave appropriately - without lags, friezes, and FPS subsidence.  With rare exceptions, you have to reset the graphic settings from maximum to average values. </p><p>  Users leave mostly positive reviews regarding smartphone performance.  All full-time software and a good half of Google Play's toys go off with a bang, and there is a premium segment for launching powerful and serious applications with specific optimization. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  This processor in almost all variants and modifications works in tandem with the same 8 MP camera (f2.4, 33 mm).  The front peephole with a resolution of 2 megapixels does not shine with some remarkable features, but is useful for communicating via video messengers and fairly high-quality stamping of "gag". </p><p>  The rear camera can take high-quality photos in high resolution up to 3264 by 2448 pixels.  The video sequence runs at 30 frames per second with Full HD resolution - 1920 by 1080 pixels.  Judging by the user reviews, it‚Äôs impossible to find fault with the quality of photos and videos.  The picture is decent even in low light and in the dark, not to mention normal weather and a good angle. </p><p>  The camera interface is also respectable.  Here you can find a lot of settings for everything and everyone.  You can customize the panorama as you like, apply some real-time effects, make a vintage, darken and a lot of other things.  So the cameras on the smartphone have failed and do not work for show, like most gadgets in the segment up to 10,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In our case, the manufacturer managed to surprise the consumer.  Many companies are changing the design, adding some buttons, interfaces, that is, by and large they are inducing the next cosmetics, but here we have cardinal improvements in the autonomous plan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tltmobile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone battery" class="if uuid-2449580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449580.jpg"></div><p>  The device comes with a standard battery capacity of 2000 mAh, but in the kit there is another battery, already at 4000 mAh.  The battery is installed in the same standard compartment, only the lid is placed another, more massive.  If you are an ardent consumer of high-resolution video and "heavy" games, then this is your option.  In other cases, you can do with a regular battery. </p><p>  A 2000 mAh battery lasts about 10 hours of mixed work: a 3G module is included, about 30 minutes of talk, about an hour of taking photos and videos, and the same amount of time listening to music.  That is, here we have the usual indicators of autonomy, which can be seen in a similar "Android" -bratia. </p><p>  With a 4000 mAh battery, the device‚Äôs operating time is approximately doubled, that is, at full load, the smartphone can easily stretch from morning to evening and only ask for a power outlet closer to night. </p><p>  Such a solution with two rechargeable batteries is rarely seen, especially in this price segment, so this is clearly a plus for a smartphone, as well as for fans to spend the whole day on a mobile gadget. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Highscreen Alpha R fulfills its price by 100% and is not phyllitic, and this is almost 9,000 rubles.  The gadget can be safely recommended to those people for whom a quality screen and battery life are critical.  Even with a standard battery, the smartphone quietly survives until the evening with mixed loads, not to mention a capacious understudy.  Of course, in this case, the device noticeably ‚Äúgets fatter‚Äù, but it's like a breath of fresh air, if you look at other ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù gadgets, which by the end of the day are exhausted even in normal mode. </p><p>  The device is perfect for surfing the net, playing games and watching videos, since the matrix capabilities fully contribute to this.  Excellent viewing angles without any distortion allow you to invite one or two partners to the company. </p><p>  The cameras didn‚Äôt let us down either.  Yes, they are far from DSLRs, but the available capabilities are quite enough for high-quality photo and video, where all the details will be clearly visible, especially when it comes to shooting in high resolution.  In addition, the tools for processing and adjusting the picture are enough with the head. </p><p>  The majority of applications from Google Play smartphone will easily digest and will not even choke - without lags, brakes and friezes.  But lovers of "heavy" toys that are optimized for modern and powerful processors (by the way, to increase the sales of the latter), it is better to pass by.  Such applications may start up, but you will have to conjure with graphic settings.  Thousands for 15 you can take the very-most processor (albeit in a plastic case) and play quietly on ultra-presets, here we are talking about a different price segment. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the advantages of our respondent more than outweigh the shortcomings.  Even despite the dominance of mobile devices from the notorious Celestial Empire, this device will find its buyer, and very easily. </p><p>  As for the reviews, users on large online trading platforms and specialized forums leave completely positive feedback on the smartphone.  The general picture was slightly spoiled by the so-called proprietary firmware from mobile operators and frivolous distributors, because of which the interface starts to lag and freeze from time to time, but this problem is solved by installing the official "Android" drain.  Everything else is just nitpicking, especially if you look at the cost of the device. </p><p>  So the verdict is clear - recommended for purchase. </p>
