The largest international airport in Egypt, where planes arrive from Russia, is located near the city of Sharm El Sheikh.  It is only 18 km from the hotel, so the journey by transport provided as part of the transfer takes no more than 30 minutes.  The central part of Sharm el-Sheikh is much closer - only 10 km, you can get there by shuttle bus or taxi.  At 7 km from the hotel is located one of the most beautiful and, perhaps, the most tourist bays - Naama Bay, famous for not only picturesque views, but also developed infrastructure.  Otium Hotel Amphoras <span>Sharm 5 *</span> in this beautiful place of the coast is not alone.  It is surrounded by other hotels on the left and on the right.  The nearest Otium Aloha belongs to the same company as Otium Amphoras, and does not prevent vacationers from a sister hotel to enter its territory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A plus in the location is the presence of shops with Egyptian goods and a supermarket literally opposite the hotel, where you can inexpensively buy the necessary things. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1036754.jpg" width="568"></div></h2><h2>  Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5 *: description of the territory </h2><p>  This hotel is located on a rather large area of ‚Äã‚Äã110 thousand square meters, so the designers have enough space to realize their exclusive ideas.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Egypt is famous for its beautiful, warm even in winter and rich in exotic fish Red Sea.  Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5 *, although located near the coast, but, as mentioned above, is located on a hill.  Therefore, to get to the beach, you need to use the elevator or stairs.  This does not create any particular inconvenience, since the elevators always work properly, roomy and comfortable.  The beach at the hotel is sandy, quite long.  Sunbeds with mattresses and fungus umbrellas from the sun are always available.  The Red Sea is known for having many corals in it even off the coast.  It is interesting to watch them and the life of its beautiful inhabitants, but they create some problems for water procedures.  To create maximum comfort for vacationers, two piers are built on the beach from which you can descend into the water.  One of them is always on duty by rescuers who do not refuse to take some things for storage (for example, telephones) while tourists are swimming. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the beach is not small, there is not so much space because of the presence of large stones, which is noted by almost everyone who visited the Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5 *.  Photo clearly demonstrates this.  Entering the water from the shore is quite convenient, but only for children and those who can‚Äôt swim, as there is a depth of up to 50 cm, and then the very corals begin.  In the place of descent into the water from the pier, the depth is immediately from 30 meters.  On some days there are waves and strong currents at sea, so not everyone can take this descent. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  In those days when the sea is uncomfortable, everyone can have a better time at one of the 6 pools of the Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5 *.  The photo below captures one of the central ones.  There is also a swimming pool located in a cozy corner under the palm trees, where the noise of the active life of the merry people does not reach, where you can relax and unwind.  One of the hotel‚Äôs most popular pools is on the beach.  There are water slides, which are very convenient to use in between bathing in the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Otium Hotel Amphoras Sharm 5" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1036753.jpg" width="539"></div>
