Many tourists dream of visiting the cradle of mankind, who value the unique opportunity to combine a beach holiday and exciting excursions in Greece. </p><p>  Delphi is a symbol of the country, shrouded in legends, and a mystical corner with a strong energy that unites gods and ordinary people.  A sacred place protected by UNESCO, many recognize by the image of the famous temple of Apollo of Pythia. </p><h2>  The legend of the city </h2><p>  What do the myths of ancient Greece say about the spiritual and religious center? </p><p>  Delphi is the territory where two eagles met, which Zeus the Thunderer released from different ends of the earth so that they could find its middle.  Having learned where the meeting of the birds took place, the formidable god of heaven threw a stone at this place - a monolithic block, thereby marking the center of the world.  The ancient cult object was called the "navel of the Earth." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphies greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434742.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to legend, initially there was a sanctuary guarded by the serpent Python.  Patron of the arts Apollo destroyed the monster, and a new temple appeared on this site, which was erected by the Cretan sailors who arrived here, accompanied by the god reincarnated as a dolphin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This myth, telling about the victory of the son of Zeus over Python, was often played out at constant performances in the ancient city that grew around the sanctuary. </p><h2>  Modern resort and archaeological museum </h2><p>  I must say that Delphi (Greece) consists of two parts: a modern urban resort and an archaeological reserve on the slopes of <span>Mount Parnassus.</span>  A popular tourist center, hosting thousands of guests, was created in 1892, and the territory of the sacred place, according to official figures, was inhabited by tribes in the 14th century BC. </p><h2>  The flowering and sunset of the sanctuary </h2><p>  It is known that only after the accession of the cult of Apollo the first temples were erected.  The political and religious influence of the city, expanding its borders, gradually grew.  Here were held the second most important after the Olympic Greek competitions - the Pythian Games, held once every four years. </p><p>  Between the VI and IV centuries BC there is the greatest flowering of the sanctuary.  Hundreds of people flock to Delphi (Greece) to receive the oracle prophecy and seek the advice of the gods.  The rich offerings of grateful residents even overshadowed the magnificent majestic temple.  For example, such a generous gift was a cast of gold sculpture of Apollo.  Numerous gifts allowed the city to build a stadium and theater. </p><p>  However, already during the period of Roman rule, the emperors' attitude to the religious center was ambiguous: some rulers favored the city, while others plundered it mercilessly. </p><p>  With the spread of rationalism, the glory of the oracle begins to fade.  In 394, the Byzantine emperor, by decree, put an end to the activities of the sanctuary, which influenced the course of world history, and after the reign of Christianity, Delphi (Greece) became the episcopal department.  Over time, the ruins that turned the sanctuary go underground, and in the Middle Ages no one remembered it.  At this point, the village of Castries appears, where connoisseurs of ancient artifacts began to arrive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main temple of ancient Greece </h2><p>  Historical corners, which are well-kept ruins, where experts work, are transformed into museums and are called archaeological parks (sites).  This place is recognized as the sanctuary of Apollo - the true treasure of the country.  In Delphi <span>(Greece), the sights of</span> which are known to many from the school desk, travelers flock to get acquainted with an important religious monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delphi greece sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prophecies of the Pythians </h2><p>  In ancient times, rituals took place in the church related to the cult of the <span>god of light,</span> and the prophecy procedure was the main one.  Here was the main oracle of Ancient Greece, and thousands of pilgrims, looking for answers to exciting questions, came to the city.  All the inhabitants of Hellas wanted to know their future, and soon the village turned into the most revered sanctuary. </p><p>  Tourists notice that the temple is located above a deep fissure, from which many centuries ago incomprehensible vapors flowed.  The fact is that the city of Delphi (Greece) is dotted with geological faults.  The gases escaping to the surface produced a mild narcotic effect and introduced the soothsayers into a trance. </p><p>  Residents believed that it was breaking through the stone foundation the stench breath of the snake cast down by Apollo.  The Pythia breathed in pairs and fell into a frenzy, and when she spoke prophecies, it was believed that Apollo himself spoke with her mouth.  The priests of the temple - profits - gave chaotic statements a poetic form, interpreting in their own way the messages of God. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Delphic soothsayers, who became very young girls and women in age, predicted the Trojan War and the campaign of the Argonauts. </p><h2>  The history of the temple of Apollo </h2><p>  According to myths, the first building dedicated to Apollo was built of laurel branches, huts made of beeswax and copper later appeared, and the last consisted of tuff - rock from volcanic ash. </p><p>  In 548 BC, a fire raged in the city, and the building perished in the fire, after which the Athenian Alkmeonid family thought about building a magnificent temple in honor of the deity.  Built on the contributions of local residents, a rectangular building surrounded by columns was surprisingly decorated with pediments, the main character of which was Apollo.  Unfortunately, the Delphi of Ancient Greece suffered from a major earthquake, and the sanctuary was completely destroyed.  Only in 330 BC a new temple was born. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphins of ancient greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is its ruins that tourists are now observing, and fragments of gables are exhibited in the city‚Äôs archaeological museum.  Very little is known about the interior of the sacred place.  According to scientists, the altar of Poseidon, the monumental statue of God, the image of Homer from copper were lost. </p><h2>  Symbol of the center of the world </h2><p>  The temple was also home to the famous omphal - a conical-shaped stone with unusual patterns, which is known as the "navel of the Earth." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delphi greece photo" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Currently, it is in the museum, and in the archaeological reserve, tourists see only a copy of the artifact, which Delphi (Greece) is rightly proud of.  Enthusiastic tourists who also want to touch the stone love to take photos of this unusual exhibit.  It is believed that this will bring good luck for life. </p><h2>  Open museum </h2><p>  For about forty years, until 1901, archaeological excavations of the ruins of the temple took place.  After clearing, they became available to all tourists who came to Delphi (Greece).  Sights, the photos of which will make you clog with delight of heart, will take visitors many centuries ago.  Open to all guests, the museum will introduce you to the unique exhibits of the early Christian era. </p><p>  The ruins are always crowded.  There are many who want to see with their own eyes the greatest shrine, and this interest is explained by the diversity of the architectural complex. </p><h2>  Treasury of a religious monument </h2><p>  The most significant building of the religious building is the treasury of the Athenians, made of marble.  In a small room, which appeared at the turn of the 6th-5th centuries BC, not only objects dedicated to Apollo were stored, but also trophies obtained, which were brought to Delphi (Greece). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursions in greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434745.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over the long time the temple has existed, the most outstanding works of art have accumulated here.  It is curious that the treasury is the only, well-preserved monument of the ancient city, to which French experts returned to their original appearance in 1906 under the close supervision of the mayor of Athens.  Now she can be seen on the way to the sanctuary. </p><h2>  Delphic Theater </h2><p>  In the temple of Apollo was also an amphitheater for five thousand spectators, about which modern scientists know almost everything.  The spacious building hosted religious holidays and sports.  Today's view of the famous landmark, which underwent several restorations, acquired in the Roman era.  Unfortunately, over many centuries, the architectural monument has suffered greatly from time to time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="myths of ancient greece delphi" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1434743.jpg" width="600"></div>
