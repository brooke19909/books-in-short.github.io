But products made by hands from miracle loops are found even in the tombs of the pharaohs.  Very often, the emergence of techniques with which to obtain modern beautiful canvases is associated with weaving fishing nets.  It is understandable - if you look closely, intricate woven knots are very similar to the picture. </p>

    <p>  Why not suppose that once, thousands of years ago, the fisherman‚Äôs wife decided to weave a smaller network, and got a canvas that looked like ... a scarf.  And why not wear it?  And if weaving is even smaller?  So, <span>by trial and error,</span> shawls, stoles, hats were born. </p><h2>  Orenburg shawl and carpet </h2><p>  Our civilization is driven by a very purposeful feeling - curiosity.  And there are always people who are not afraid of satisfying this feeling.  It is because of this that knitting as such has become a form of art.  Today, craftswomen are able to create unique and dazzling products in their beauty. Modern technology allows us to produce threads of various textures and thicknesses.  And already their talented masters knit the thinnest napkin, bolero or thin Orenburg shawl.  Or a beautiful ... carpet.  Surprisingly, thanks to the development of textile factories for knitting, products unusual in their beauty and texture become available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kamteks yarn" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1956593.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <h2>  Thin and soft thread for babies </h2><p>  Craftsmen of the Kamteks factory produce a huge assortment of yarn for various purposes and colors.  For children, even the smallest, the Bambino series is interesting.  It is soft, weightless and in its composition has more than 50% merino wool.  Its value lies in the high quality of raw materials.  It is especially suitable for babies due to hypoallergenicity and hygroscopicity.  That is, the wool removes moisture well from the body of the child, even if it sweats a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="review of yarn kamteks northerner" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/1955927.jpg" width="382"></div>  Yarn with the addition of merino has a special fiber structure that allows you to repel dirt and protects against unnecessary odors.  Adding acrylic makes the thread even softer, it does not prick and does not cause any harm to the baby.  From it you can tie beautiful booties, socks, hats, blouses.  And from the fine yarn ‚ÄúKamteks-Minx‚Äù beautiful shawls and rugs are obtained, with which you can cover the baby on a cool summer evening or cover your shoulders.
