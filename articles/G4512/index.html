    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Mitsis Laguna Resort &amp; Spa consists of numerous individual houses built of white stone.  There are apartments in which guests are accommodated.  But, in addition to the houses, there is also a large main building, next to which there is a huge outdoor saltwater pool and restaurants. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the roofs of all buildings are made of tiles, which is a durable, environmentally friendly and fireproof material.  Interestingly, it was made by special order of the Mitsis Group.  It is also interesting that during the construction of the complex used a large amount of wood. </p><p>  Thanks to the combination of gold and white in the design, it feels like it's not a hotel, but some kind of architectural landmark or even a palace.  But even more interesting is the fact that the frames of mirrors, lamps and many other decorative elements are really covered with gold.  Not jewelry, true, but leaf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that Mitsis Laguna Resort &amp; Spa was nominated as the best five-star hotel with an all-inclusive system for families. </p><p>  By the way, a few words should be said about the place where the complex is located.  This is the village of Anissaras, located next to Hersonissos in a hilly area.  Here, tourists can enjoy the cleanest sandy beaches and warm, gentle sea.  An ideal place for a quiet, secluded vacation.  And if you want to immerse yourself in the vibrant nightlife of Greece, you can go to Heraklion, the capital of Crete.  This city is 28 kilometers from the hotel.  And the airport, respectively, in the same place. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The 5-star Mitsis Laguna Resort &amp; Spa is not without reason considered one of the best in all of Crete.  It has everything.  One of the main highlights of the hotel is its huge conference room with a capacity of 500 people.  It is often rented for various events, meetings and other important events by various corporations and organizations. </p><p>  The second undoubted plus is that it is a beach hotel.  From it to the sea you can walk in just two minutes.  Another advantage - here you can rent a bungalow.  This fact is especially pleasing to those people who like to feel alone.  Indeed, in the local bungalows there are few rooms.  By the way, 36 of them are surrounded by a lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the territory itself there is everything that may be required.  This is a mini-market, souvenir and jewelry stores, SPA-center and even a fur salon.  Indoor and outdoor pools, car rental, own church, doctor‚Äôs office, laundry, dry cleaning, free private parking - all this is on site. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  In Mitsis Laguna Resort and Spa 5 * there are several luxurious and presentable establishments where you can taste delicious dishes.  To be more precise, there are eight restaurants, one of which is the main one.  In the rest you can try dishes of Italian, Asian, Cretan, Mexican, Japanese, Greek cuisine.  And the last, seventh restaurant, delights its visitors with sweets, as its chefs specialize in the preparation of confectionery. </p><p>  And also on the territory of Mitsis Laguna Resort and Spa 5 * there are several bars.  One of them - the lobby - is open from 10am to 11pm.  There is also a beach and pool bar.  The first runs until six in the evening, and the second until midnight.  Even a buffet is available.  Only it is open during the animation program.  There is also a night bar.  It opens at 18:00.  Closes at one in the morning. </p><p>  Interestingly, the hotel serves an early continental breakfast.  By individual request only.  Early means from four in the morning until 7:30.  Usually it is ordered by people who leave early from the resort or, conversely, settle in the morning.  A typical breakfast starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:00.  It can be ordered in the room, by the way.  Late breakfast starts at 10:00 and ends at 11:00. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For lunch, guests are invited from 12:30 to 15:00, and for dinner from 19:00 to 21:30.  But that is not all.  There is a late dinner.  It starts at 22:30, and ends at half past twelve. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the evening (after 18:30) all guests wishing to enter the restaurant are required to follow the dress code.  Girls are allowed in dresses, and men in light trousers.  In shorts they are not allowed inside.  Still, the institutions are presentable.  The all-inclusive system applies to all restaurants and bars.  Only tables should be reserved in them in advance, as there may be many who wish.  By the way, during dinner, guests are offered beer, bottled wine, water, soft drinks and cocktails in unlimited quantities. </p><p>  Also, guests of Mitsis Laguna Resort and Spa 5 * (Crete) are given lunch sets for excursions.  They can be ordered at the reception and pick up there. </p>

    <h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  If you want to spend your vacation in such a beautiful place as Mitsis Laguna, then the issue of booking apartments should be dealt with as soon as possible.  If you now look at the available rooms for next summer in real time, you will see that they are all busy.  Of course, there will be cancellations, so there will be a chance to book an apartment.  But still, it‚Äôs better not to put off this business.  In addition, you can still fly to Crete out of season - in the winter months, in early spring or late autumn.  Here at this time it is also comfortable, but there are already fewer people. </p><p>  It is worth knowing that guests who come with a small child (under two years old) are provided with a free cot.  And for the baby‚Äôs stay, you don‚Äôt have to pay extra either.  They can also put an extra bed for an older child (up to 12 years old).  In other cases, an extra guest will have to pay 35% of the reservation cost.  By the way, that there will be another guest, it is better to notify the hotel in advance.  To do this, you should contact the property directly. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Mitsis Laguna is an extremely positive hotel.  Which is not surprising, because the hotel really corresponds to the highest level.  The contingent of guests is diverse - representatives of various corporations and companies come here who rent a conference room for large events, single tourists and groups of friends go to the same place, and families also like to relax here.  All in all, this hotel is for everyone. </p><p>  Most of all visitors are pleased with the attitude of staff towards their work.  They are true professionals in their field.  They try to please the guests in everything - if only they were comfortable.  The rooms are cleaned perfectly, five plus.  And the animators in the evening show really interesting shows. </p><p>  Guests leave a lot of comments about restaurants.  Guests assure - this is a real paradise for people who like to treat themselves to various delicacies and exotic cuisine.  And the <span>quality of service is</span> worthy of the highest praise.  Take, for example, fruits.  Their choice is huge, and they are all ready for use (thoroughly cleaned and cut into pieces).  It is also encouraging that the restaurant is divided into several corners in which food is prepared right in front of visitors.  And this once again allows you to verify the quality and freshness of the dishes. </p><p>  The beach also receives positive reviews, although some say that it is difficult to enter the water because of stones and algae.  Many solved this problem by renting a catamaran.  On it you can sail away from the shore and dive into the crystal clear water.  And of course, it is better to go in the fall or at the very beginning of the season - in April.  The hotel is not fully loaded, around silence, comfort and tranquility. </p><p>  In general, this is an ideal place for those people who are determined to get everything from rest and even more. </p>
