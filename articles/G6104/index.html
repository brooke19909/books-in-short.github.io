In terms of the capital, the territory occupied by the park was first designated at the beginning of the nineteenth century (in 1801).  In the eastern part of the city allocated a vast territory adjacent to the river.  On the map, it was signed as "City Garden."  The park was divided into two zones by the Svisloch, with most of it located on the right bank of the river.  On both sides, it was limited to Zakharyevskaya and Policeitskaya streets (currently - Independence Avenue and Y. Kupala St., respectively).  Plans were made for the creation of a small canal enveloping an artificial island, as well as for the construction of a bridge over the Svisloch, in order to unite <span>the Gorky Park</span> in Minsk into one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorky park in Minsk" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/465485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Grand opening </h2><p>  The first visitors strolled around the park on May 1, 1805. According to the recollections of the Polish actor and director Skibinsky, a magnificent celebration was organized that day.  He played a military band, fireworks thundered, actors performed, festive banners were everywhere.  The solemn cantata was performed by dressed up ladies and gentlemen.  Since then, the garden began to be maintained in perfect order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  In 1817, the draft plan for the planning of the capital was finally approved.  In accordance with it, the development of the city was carried out over the next forty years.  Gorky Park in Minsk was also subject to major reconstruction.  The task of gradually expanding its territories in all directions has come to the fore.  An analysis of the later plans of the capital revealed that the design work provided for in the master plan was not implemented.  A large <span>orchard</span> remained to the east of the park <span>,</span> and hayfields, which the local authorities leased, came close to the river. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorky park in Minsk photo" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/465486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From 1839 to 1841, Gorky Park in Minsk was actively landscaping.  At the same time, in the spring of 1840, he was severely affected by the flood.  The liquidation of the damage began immediately.  Mostly, fencing and bridges required repairs.  Then the idea was formed of creating a live fence made of broom, willow and other trees. </p><h2>  Hard time </h2><p>  An updated capital development project was developed in 1858.  According to him, <span>Gorky Park in</span> Minsk was also to be seriously reconstructed.  It was planned to expand its territory to the streets of the Hospital (now Frunze) and Veselaya (modern Pervomaiskaya).  Unfortunately, the project was never implemented.  In 1863, work began on the construction of city blocks in the above-mentioned territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1872, it was decided to create a city water supply network.  For this reason, the park has lost part of its territory.  The right bank of Svisloch was set aside for the construction of water wells and a <span>pumping station.</span>  At the same time, part of the birch grove was cut down.  Soon after, the water supply for the military hospital, it was also decided to lay on the territory of the park.  Fortunately, during the correspondence between the city administration and the military department, it was possible to save the long-suffering green island from the next invasion. </p><h2>  XIX century </h2><p>  In the nineteenth century, the outskirts of the capital were buried in gardens.  Gorky Park in Minsk was one of the largest in Belarus.  Then its area was a little less than eighteen hectares (currently 28). </p><h2>  Next stage </h2><p>  The park entered a new round of development in the late nineteenth century.  At that time, its eastern outskirts came close to Veselaya Street (now Pervomaiskaya).  The summer city theater began to function.  In 1896, work began on the construction of a cycle track.  We chose and prepared a place for a winter skating rink.  In 1912, a greenhouse was built.  Eight years later, the Minsk city garden was renamed the Profintern Garden.  In 1936, he began to be named after the writer Gorky.  In 1960, the first attractions appeared here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions in Minsk gorky park" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/465487.jpg" width="448"></div>
