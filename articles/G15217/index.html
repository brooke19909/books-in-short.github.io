    <h2>  About the water park </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine, but earlier on the site of this water park there was an ordinary dump.  At that time, no resident of the city could imagine that at some point he would visit this place with pleasure.  That was 20 years ago.  The city administration has long wanted the right bank of the river.  To turn Temernik into a visited, cultural place away from the noise of transport.  It was after this that the Osminozhek water park, beloved by many, appeared today (Rostov). </p><h2>  Waterslides </h2><p>  The place attracts guests with its entertainment.  Here you will find breathtaking slides for every taste.  It is worth noting that the pleasure of descending from Kamikaze with a length of 50 meters with a sharp slope is difficult to compare with anything.  The Anaconda slide has an unexpected ‚Äúdry‚Äù finish and is 88 meters long.  The so-called ‚ÄúBlack Pipe‚Äù with a length of 90 meters is very popular with guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Water Park Pools </h2><p>  Waterpark "Octopus" (Rostov) has several pools.  Each of them got its own name: the exotic ‚ÄúDream Lake‚Äù with a smooth approach and complex shape, which is convenient for young swimmers, ‚ÄúSwimming Pool‚Äù up to 1.4 m deep.  For young guests, the Children's Pool is open 0.3 m deep, in the center of which there is a sign of the water park - the Osminozhek attraction, which gave the name to the institution. </p><h2>  Youth entertainment </h2><p>  Waterpark "Octopus" (Rostov) is always open for young people.  Graduation parties are held here every year.  Thanks to the lighting, this place turns into a large disco, where graduates with their parents have fun until the morning. </p>
