In case of payment by the client of the tour on the all-inclusive system, a blue bracelet is issued.  However, in any case, settlement takes place only at 14-00.  Arriving earlier have to wait. </p><p>  But (since the bracelets have already been received) you can have breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  It is spacious, triple ceiling height.

Discounts are provided by cunning managers due to the fact that the hotel is temporarily in a state prior to seasonal repairs.  There will always be vacationers who want to save money. </p><p>  By the way, the wear itself is uncritical, it will be eliminated by cosmetic repairs.  After the repair, as expected, the overhead will be taken into account in the prices of the tours, and their cost will increase.  In addition, special seasonal discounts are provided in Egypt in winter. </p><p>  After all, as you know, the Red Sea is relatively cool at this time (the water temperature is 21 degrees Celsius, which, however, is acceptable for the inhabitants of the middle lane, since it is comparable to our velvet season).  In addition, long winter excursions to ancient sights (to Cairo and Luxor) are complicated by the seasonal 50-day wind from the Sahara in winter.  However, on the territory of the hotel and the hotel beach there is no such problem. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Many tourists choose the hotel Siva Sharm Ex Savita Resort 5 * because of the beach.  Booking describes it as a three-tier, sandy, more than half a kilometer long.  The beach is convenient and comfortable.  A deliberate excess of sun loungers and umbrellas has been installed here.  Visitors can easily find a convenient place for themselves here.  Three buffets are open from noon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel siva sharm ex savita resort 5" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Resorts enter the sea with small and comfortable pontoons.  It‚Äôs more convenient, because the Red Sea is often called coral.  Its distinctive feature is a gentle relief (in order to be at a comfortable bathing depth, you will have to walk several tens of meters along the bottom.) In addition, the coral bottom (except for the beauty of an unforgettable underwater world) has an unpleasant feature: without special slippers, you can hurt yourself on corals.  The entrance to the water from the pontoons is balanced in depth of the sea and deprives bathers of such inconvenience. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  The hotel offers 4 outdoor and one indoor pool.  Their total area is 2645 square meters.  The main pool is just huge.  It is possible to dabble and swim, and even (which is regularly done) breaking into teams, play water polo.  And you can do this at the same time: there is enough space for everything. </p><p>  The hotel also has a heated pool (it is very popular in the winter season, because the water here is heated to 32 degrees.) </p><p>  In the pool area there are a sufficient number of deck chairs, umbrellas.

Fruits are relatively few.  Dates and oranges are present daily.  Melon and watermelon are less commonly served.  The pastries of the main restaurant are good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siva sharm ex savita resort 5 tours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090484.jpg" width="600"></div>  In terms of food, the Siva Sharm Ex Savita Resort 5 * hotel can satisfy any requests of its guests.

    <p>  Vacationing gourmets have the opportunity to order their favorite dishes for dinner in restaurants by appointment: Italian (Bella Vista), Chinese (Dragon), fish (Fish).  The table at which the reservation of dishes is made is located in the main restaurant. </p><p>  Great drinks are offered to vacationers in a Bedouin tent.  Hookah, Internet cafe. </p><h2>  Hotel leisure facilities </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the Siva Sharm Ex Savita Resort 5 * hotel is quite developed.  Bucking sites vyingly praise the Garden Spa spa located here, a beauty salon, gym, diving club, massage parlor, and sports sections.  By the way, the list is true.  Experienced instructors and specialists are engaged with those who wish from vacationers. </p><p>  The billiard room, gym, courts, golf course are very popular.  Animators periodically organize beach volleyball and water polo competitions. </p><p>  As we already mentioned, the hotel has its own diving center, on the Red Sea coast.  The enterprise is successful and profitable: contemplation and photographing of the underwater coral world is in demand by vacationers.  Many novice divers take a few paid lessons.  In addition, the hotel has the opportunity to do water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, parasailing at leisure. </p><p>  In the evenings, performances and shows are organized at the amphitheater.

Diving enthusiasts will find an opportunity to immerse themselves in the bright and unique world of corals, as well as receive a worthy international certificate attesting to their diving skills. </p><p>  From hotels in Egypt there is the opportunity to go on a one- or two-day excursion to Jerusalem. </p><p>  However, according to the specifics of a five-star hotel, we recommend that you still plan your excursions more moderately than if you were staying in a three-star hotel.  Be thrifty!  After all, you paid for a five-star vacation.  In addition, meals on the all-inclusive system on many excursions are not relevant. </p><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  The hotel has children's animators, parents can temporarily hire a nanny.  For families with small children, a cot is provided free of charge. </p><p>  The smallest holidaymakers here are given a lot of attention.  There is a mini-club for children from 4 to 10 years old, both before and after dinner.  For children there is a special playground, a cinema hall, a special pool for games and swimming. </p><p>  Animators are attracted to children in sports games, relay races.  They participate in productions of performances.  Active recreation organically alternates with calm: children draw, Russian-speaking animators tell stories and fairy tales to them.  In a word, the little holiday-makers resting in the hotel complex create the illusion of immersion in a special, bright and fairy-tale world.  So some even get upset saying goodbye to the hotel. </p><p>  At the Siva Sharm Ex Savita Resort 5 * restaurant there is a children's menu and a children's corner is equipped.  There are chairs and tables suitable for growth for small holidaymakers.  They are offered milk porridge, cottage cheese, fruits, delicious pastries. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The hotel complex considered by us provides five-star leisure services at economical prices.  What can you recommend to tourists in order to ensure a more pleasant and complete vacation? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siva sharm ex savita resort 5 booking" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090533.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Smile to the staff, be friendly with him.  Thank you for the services provided.  Learn Egyptian welcome and thanksgiving phrases.

Perhaps that is why they come to rest again and again in Siva Sharm Ex Savita Resort 5 *. </p><p>  8.9 out of 10 - this hotel has a quantitative rating according to guest reviews. </p><p>  This fairly new hotel complex (built in 2006) is really in demand among tourists from post-Soviet countries. </p>
