Indeed, even the category of ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù cannot become an obstacle in order to provide quality service to tourists.  California Garden 3 * is no exception.  Reviews of vacationers about living in it are mostly positive. </p><p>  Cozy and clean rooms, delicious food, polite staff, convenient location in the city, the presence of animation, a sandy beach, the sea, many attractions, the proximity of Port Aventura Park - all these advantages are noted by our compatriots.  In general, with regard to nutrition, Russians leave only good reviews: everything is very satisfying, there are a lot of delicious fruits, the waiters work very efficiently.  And one more thing: those who lived according to the concept of ‚Äúfull board‚Äù separately celebrate dinners, during which seafood is often served.  An amusement park can be reached in just twenty minutes.  The rooms have new plumbing, everything works, nothing leaks anywhere. </p><p>  The Russians left a lot of enthusiastic reviews about the resort itself.  Salou is a place where you can really relax comfortably.  Amazing sea, golden sand on the municipal beach, which is always cleaned up, friendly Catalans - all this was very pleasant for tourists. </p><p>  Of the minuses, our compatriots note paid internet, a not always clean pool, a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms and poor soundproofing. </p>
