  <section class="page js-page"><h1>George Washington Bridge. Interesting Facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most famous bridges in the world is the George Washington American Bridge.  Located in New York City, it is the link between upstate Manhattan and New Jersey. </p><h2>  Who was George Washington </h2><p>  George Washington was a major political figure in the history of the United States of America of the late 18th - early 19th century.  Among the founding fathers, groups of people who played an important role in the founding and formation of the United States had a great influence on achieving independence.  He was a member of the Continental War. </p><p>  After the war he returned to his native estate, from where he closely watched the political atmosphere in the country, conducted extensive correspondence with his colleagues on the topic of strengthening centralized power to strengthen the integrity of all states. </p><p>  George Washington was elected chairman of the Constitutional Convention, which in 1787 developed the bulk of the US Constitution.  Two years later, he was elected the first President of the United States of America, then re-elected.  Council members suggested Washington stay for a third term, but he refused, saying that one person cannot hold a presidential post for more than two terms.  From that moment on, the unspoken tradition of leading the state appeared in America for only two terms, which was violated only by Franklin Roosevelt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newhistorian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="George Washington" class="if uuid-3024559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3024559.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridge construction </h2><p>  The construction of the George Washington Bridge in New York began in the fall of 1927 and involved six lanes.  The design was designed by Osman Amman, the chief engineer of the New York Port Authority.  They completed construction four years later, in 1931. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.8516964" data-lng="-73.95271589999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/3/2/8/13328.png"></div><p>  After 15 years, two more lanes were laid at the upper level.  At the beginning of the 60s, the lower tier of the George Washington Bridge was designed and built and the flow of cars increased by almost one hundred percent. </p><p>  Today it is the only suspension bridge in the world with fourteen lanes. </p><p>  There is a speed limit of 70 km / h on the bridge, as it is part of the federal highway.  An interesting feature is that this bridge has the largest freely developing US flag weighing almost two hundred kilograms. </p><p>  The height of the building is 65 meters.  Of course, the George Washington bridge in the photo looks much smaller. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washington bridge photo" class="if uuid-3024567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3024567.jpg"></div><h2>  Evil glory </h2><p>  One of the largest bridges in the world is notorious, since a large number of suicides are committed from its railing.  However, the bridge belongs to the state of New York, which ranks last in the overall ranking of suicides in the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Divers are on duty around the clock at George Washington Bridge.  In a week they have to pull about four bodies from the Hudson water.  There is a known case when a woman fell next to one of the divers pulling out another body.  Her attempt to go to the other world this time was unsuccessful.  Also a famous case is the attempt of a soldier, a marine, to take his own life.  He survived. </p><p>  Experts believe that one of the reasons for the bitter popularity is the low fence that separates people and water.  Building a high fence would solve the problem, but it requires several hundred million dollars, which ordinary American taxpayers are not willing to invest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.baruch.cuny.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washington bridge" class="if uuid-3024550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3024550.jpg"></div><h2>  Economic component </h2><p>  George Washington Bridge has another important function.  He makes money.  And people use the crossing because alternative ways to get to New York are more expensive and take longer. </p><p>  It is important to note that fees are only charged for entry into the city.  Departure is free of charge.  The price of a single ticket is $ 15.  Over the course of the year, the George Washington Bridge earns as much as an ordinary Russian city of medium size, excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wirednewyork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washington bridge" class="if uuid-3024575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3024575.jpg"></div><h2>  Other Washington facilities </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the Washington Bridge is the largest building in honor of the founding father.  But in the US there are other objects in which the name of the first president is immortalized.  Except, of course, the well-known American state and capital.  It is noteworthy that the photo of the George Washington Bridge in New York is the hallmark of not only the "big apple", but also the United States as a whole. </p><p>  In the warm state of California is a large sequoia national park.  It is in it that for several hundred years the second largest sequoia in the world has been rustling with branches, it bears the name of Washington. </p><p>  In Pennsylvania, the name of Washington is two parks, state and historical.  Universities, small American cities, rivers, and even mountains are named after him. </p><p>  The name of Washington has left its mark on Russian soil.  In Peterhof, on Tsaritsyno island, an oak grows.  Once the Americans gave the royal family an acorn from an oak growing on the grave of George Washington.  Empress Alexandra Fedorovna ordered a gilded fence to enclose the oak and place a commemorative medallion at the foot of the tree.  You can see the amazing tree today.  Park specialists carefully look after a historical oak. </p>
