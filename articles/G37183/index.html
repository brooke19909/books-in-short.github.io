They will not be replaced by any home-made acoustics made by hand, although it will be performed efficiently and with all the nuances.  Popular models satisfy all the needs of users, so there can be no complaints about them. </p><h2>  Monitor Audio Silver 2 </h2><p>  This shelf home acoustics became available to customers in 2014.  It combines an 8-inch midbass as well as an inch tweeter.  This ensures excellent linearity of the frequency response, even when connected to the common output of the amplifier.  The tweeter has an aluminum diffuser, which is distinguished by a ceramic coating, guaranteeing excellent dynamics and, of course, detailing at the highest frequencies. </p><p>  The main advantages of the speakers are: </p><ul><li>  crossover lane separation; </li><li>  beautiful bottoms without losing the quality of the midrange-treble ranges; </li><li>  the ability to connect speakers separately. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings of the <span>speaker system,</span> one can note only the fact that the rear output of the bass reflex does not allow the speakers to be placed close to the wall.  Because of this, you have to think up ways to conveniently place the system on a shelf so that it does not get damaged. </p><h2>  Polk Audio RTi A1 </h2><p>  Durable and high-quality material for the manufacture of columns ensures their integrity.  In addition, the system features support for separate connection of channels to midbass and tweeter, which helps to customize the sound to taste. </p><p>  Reviews about shelf acoustics for the home are only positive and they indicate the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  availability of biamping support; </li><li>  quite impressive power with such a miniature size; </li><li>  Convenient wall mount. </li></ul><p>  The only drawback of the model is considered not the best setting for the internal crossover.  This nuance is most often paid attention to those people who are well versed in such systems and want to buy only the best model for themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shelf acoustics for home" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2180243.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Behringer Truth B2030A </h2><p>  Monitors with more open sound reproduce different frequencies perfectly.  Despite the fact that they were originally intended for small rooms, now they are quietly used for huge halls. </p><p>  The system has several advantages.  The main ones are: </p><ul><li>  adequate price; </li><li>  deep enough bass; <br>  compact sizes; </li><li>  robust construction. </li></ul><p>  Among the negative aspects, attention should be paid to the light noise of amplifiers and the absence of a special grid on the low-frequency radiator.  For beginners, these nuances are not serious shortcomings, but professionals would not buy such systems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shelf acoustics for home rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2180240.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Monitor Audio Bronze </h2><p>  Shelf acoustics for the home has a traditional design and a fairly compact body, despite the height.  Thanks to this, the columns can be placed anywhere in the room where they will not interfere with anyone.  A wide range of frequencies is responsible for excellent clarity of sound.  For small models, all of these features are rare. </p><p>  The main advantages of acoustics include an interesting design solution, excellent ‚Äústretching‚Äù the sound of even not too expensive receivers, the presence of a front phase investor, dynamic sound in any space, as well as accessibility in a variety of colors and high-quality debate.  But, like any system, these columns have certain disadvantages.  Among them, the need for a sound amplifier and a classic design that does not suit some creative personalities should be noted. </p><h2>  Heco Celan GT 302 </h2><p>  Systems from the Neso brand are popular due to the fact that they can qualitatively and dynamically reproduce sound.  This model is great for use under a home theater. </p><p>  The system has a lot of advantages.  The main ones are: </p><ul><li>  intelligibility of sound at a high level at any volume; </li><li>  equipment with a high-frequency head, which is able to expand the sound range; </li><li>  perfectly focused bass, as well as traced high frequencies; </li><li>  compactness, allowing you to place the speakers in a convenient place in order to save space and not degrade the sound; </li><li>  ease of operation, which is obtained due to the lack of additional buttons and parts on the main panel. </li></ul>
