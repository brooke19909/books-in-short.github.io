It was in such a situation that Russia found itself at the end of the 11th century due to strife between Oleg Svyatoslavich, Vladimir Monomakh and Svyatopolk Izyaslavich, the end of which was called to put the congress of princes in Lyubec. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  To understand what happened in Russia from 1093 to 1097, it is necessary to begin the story with a description of the war of the three sons of Svyatoslav Yaroslavich over the inheritance.  In particular, Oleg Svyatoslavich, calling for Polovtsian help, was able to take Chernigov, who was previously the capital city of his father, from his cousin Vladimir Monomakh.  Further, the prince took Ryazan and, having killed the Murom ruler Izyaslav in battle, captured his capital, as well as Suzdal and Rostov.  Such an act, even in those days, was considered the greatest crime, and all representatives of the Monomakh family, who managed to win back their estates, took up arms against Oleg.  But the external threat hanging over the country made irreconcilable enemies think about at least temporarily forgetting about the contradictions and not weakening Russia in internecine wars. </p><h2>  Participants of the princely congress in Lubec </h2><p>  The initiator of the collection of the most famous specific rulers of that time was Vladimir Monomakh - the grandson of <span>Yaroslav the Wise</span> and the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX.  This prince in his early youth showed a remarkable mind and ability to compromise.  In particular, in 1093, having the opportunity to ascend the throne of Kiev, he ceded it to Svyatopolk in order to avoid war, and in 1094 he voluntarily left Chernigov, as he realized that he could not stand alone against Oleg Svyatoslavich and the Polovtsy.  In addition, he was an extremely ambitious person with far-reaching political plans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Among the princes invited to the congress in Lyubec were the grandchildren of Yaroslav the Wise <span>Svyatopolk Izyaslavich,</span> Davyd Igorevich, as well as Davyd and Oleg Svyatoslavichi.  In addition, his great-grandson Vasilko Rostislavich was called from Terebovl. </p><h2>  Year 1097: Congress of Princes in Lubec </h2><p>  The need for a meeting of the most influential rulers of the country is long overdue.  However, Vladimir Monomakh did not succeed in persuading Oleg Svyatoslavich to come to Kiev, since he was afraid of an attack.  Finally, it was decided to hold a congress of princes in Lyubec.  This castle also belonged to Monomakh, but no one lived there for a long time.  According to the chronicles of those years, Prince Vladimir spoke to his brothers and urged them to forget their enmity and defend their homeland from a common enemy - the Polovtsy. </p>

    <h2>  The results of the congress in Lubec </h2><p>  After heated discussions, the princes redistributed the principalities as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Syatopolk Izyaslavich got Kiev with Pinsk and Turov; </li><li>  Vladimir Monomakh received the <span>Pereyaslav principality,</span> Smolensk, Suzdal-Rostov land, Beloozero; </li><li>  Davyd Igorevich was supposed to rule Vladimir-Volynsky with Lutsk; </li><li>  Vasilk Rostislavich and his brother Volodar were given Terebovl, Przemysl and Cherven; </li><li>  Davyd and Oleg Svyatoslavich began to rule in Chernigov, as well as in Seversky land, Ryazan, Murom and Tmutarakan. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the congress of princes in Lyubech proclaimed the principle of inheritance by the Russian princes of the lands belonging to their fathers, and its most important result was the formation in Russia of a new political system based on the prevailing large feudal land tenure, concentrated in the hands of different branches of <span>the Rurikovich dynasty.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Subsequent events </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the congress of Russian princes in Lyubec could not lead to the establishment of lasting peace in Russia, as David Igorevich secretly sent a messenger to Svyatopolk with a message about the allegedly upcoming seizure of the Kiev throne by Vladimir Monomakh and Vasilko Rostislavich.  This insidious act brought many troubles to our country.  The fact is that Svyatopolk, who believed in slander, invited Vasilko to Kiev, put him in prison and blinded him.  Moreover, evidence has remained that Rostislavich was warned of an impending trap.  However, he replied that the princes in Lyubec ‚Äúkissed the cross‚Äù, so he does not believe that he could be in danger.  The result of the actions of Svyatopolk and David Igorevich was a new internecine war, which lasted until 1110. </p>

    <h2>  Congress in Uvetichi </h2><p>  In the summer of 1110, princes Vladimir Monomakh, Svyatopolk, Davyd and Oleg Svyatoslavich gathered and ‚Äúmade peace among themselves.‚Äù  Then they called David Igorevich to court, deprived the Vladimir-Volyn principality, but assured that they were not going to take revenge on him.  In addition, Svyatopolk gave him Dubna and Chertorizhsk, and Svyatoslavich gave a large sum of money.  Since the interests of all parties were taken into account, the internecine war ended. </p><p>  Thus, the goal of the congress of princes in Lyubec, which was to achieve lasting peace in Russia, was not achieved due to the ambitions of some of its participants. </p>
