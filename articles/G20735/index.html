    <p>  More recently, namely in 2010, a new device appeared on the computer market - a tablet computer, or just a tablet.  It very quickly became widespread among users due to its compact size and lower cost compared to laptops and desktop computers.  On the tablet it is very convenient to watch videos, listen to music, read books in electronic form, communicate on social networks.  But working on it, writing texts is difficult and inconvenient due to the lack of a keyboard and mouse.  The advantage of the tablet is also lower energy consumption compared to a laptop.  But still it has to be charged.  There are no problems when there is a charger nearby, and if it is missing, then the question arises of how to charge the tablet without charging? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to charge? </h2><p>  You can use a USB cable.  Well, each user of various gadgets probably knows how to charge the tablet via USB.  It is enough to have this cable with the appropriate connector and a desktop computer on hand.  It should be noted that charging the tablet through USB is much slower than through the outlet, because the voltage and maximum charging current in the computer are much less.  The tablet can be charged in this way from a laptop.  Charging from a laptop follows the same principle. </p><h2>  Charging rules </h2><p>  It was previously believed that for high-quality operation of the device it is necessary to completely discharge the battery before the first charge.  Currently, tablets are equipped with a new type of <span>battery</span> .  And before using the tablet for the first time, you need to fully charge it.  In order for the tablet‚Äôs battery to last longer, it needs to be recharged more often and not allowed to be completely discharged.  To recharge the battery, the above-described method of how to charge the tablet from the computer is also suitable.  But there are times when there is no USB cable either.  And again, the problem arises of how to charge the tablet without charging.  In this case, you can use a cigarette lighter.  Here you will need a car <span>charger for the tablet.</span>  On the one hand, in such a device the connector is adapted to the cigarette lighter of the car, on the other - USB.  It can be bought at any electronics store.  Before charging in this way, first of all, make sure that <span>the current strength is</span> sufficient <span>.</span>  Then connect the cable to the tablet computer and to the car.  This method is only suitable for recharging a <span>seated battery.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mr. Samodelkin </h2><p>  There are a lot of tips on how to charge the tablet without charging.  Some users offer the following option: in case there is no regular or car charging and there is no USB cable, you need to take any old charge that has been idle for a long time, and no one remembers what device it is intended for.  Usually, every owner of modern mobile phones of such houses will have several pieces.  It is necessary to cut off the connector for connecting to the phone - it will not be needed, then strip the wires, removing insulation from them.  Two wires will appear - blue and red.  Then you need to remove the battery from the tablet, find the plus and minus on it.  Then connect the wires: the blue wire will go to the plus, red to the minus, fix this design with an insulating tape or tape.  Connect to the outlet, and that‚Äôs it - charging has started.  In this case, you must act carefully so as not to get an <span>electric shock.</span>  This method, although not very reliable in its design, is faster compared to how to charge the tablet via USB, because the current in the outlet is more powerful and, therefore, the gadget will charge much faster.  But in this way it is better to use only in emergency cases.  And in order to avoid such problems in the future at the most inopportune moment, it is better to purchase a spare battery and carry it with you. </p>

    <h2>  A large number of options </h2><p>  There are chargers that allow you to charge your tablet computer from AA batteries (finger-type) using a USB cable.  Radio amateurs can make such a device on their own, especially since everything you need can be purchased at a radio store. </p><p>  If the ‚Äúnative‚Äù charger is broken or simply lost, but it is impossible to buy the same, you need to purchase a similar one.  There are several rules that should be followed when buying it.  Firstly, you should know such characteristics of current consumption as voltage and current strength.  You can see them in the instructions or on the battery itself.  Secondly, the main rule must be strictly observed - the voltage should not exceed 10 percent of the recommended indicator, and the current strength should be higher, but no more than 3-4 times.  Otherwise, when charging a device that does not meet these requirements, the battery or the tablet itself will break. </p><h2>  How to extend the life of the tablet? </h2><p>  Some users believe that charging time depends on the operating system on which a particular tablet is running, but this is not at all.  It all depends on the manufacturer of the gadget.  So, for example, <span>Chinese-</span> made <span>tablets</span> are less capricious about charging conditions, and therefore there are less problems with them when using various charging methods. </p>

    <p>  To extend the life of the tablet‚Äôs battery, you must constantly monitor its charge level and prevent it from completely discharging.  It is not recommended to leave the tablet turned on during the process. </p><p>  Thus, when answering the question of how to charge the tablet without charging, many answers arise.  All of the presented methods are simple, affordable and safe, subject to simple rules.  But still, it is recommended to use a charger that comes with the tablet and meets all its requirements.  This will extend the life of the battery of the tablet computer itself. </p>
