    <h2>  A few words about Crimea </h2><p>  The Crimean coast offers tourists many options for relaxation.  You can go to the Black Sea or the Sea of ​​Azov, choose pebble or sandy beaches, wild or equipped, and you can stay in small cozy villages or recognized resort centers.  In any case, you will experience a lot of positive emotions, because, for example, if you have your own car, you will have access to all the treasured corners of the peninsula.  And based on your own experience, you will choose the most suitable resorts and settlements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Crimea, a fairly wide selection of housing - for every taste and budget.  Guest houses and private room rental are very popular among tourists.  This usually does not cost too much, especially in early summer, when there are not so many vacationers.  Another category of travelers prefers to stay in modern full-service hotels or health resorts, including wellness treatments.  There are also budget tourists who <span>camp out</span> on wild beaches and enjoy their bit of freedom. </p><p>  You can come to Crimea at any time of the year, here you can always have a great rest, despite the weather and calendar.  But still, summer is the very season for which the peninsula receives several million tourists.  Many are afraid to come here at the very beginning of summer, but in fact, a vacation in Crimea in June has a lot of advantages, which we will tell you about now. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in crimea june reviews" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1809649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crimean peninsula in the first <span>month of summer: the</span> benefits of relaxation </h2><p>  Those who are thinking about when to go on vacation should ask how experienced travelers describe their vacation in Crimea in June.  The reviews, it must be said, are extremely positive and enthusiastic.  Thanks to these comments, you can easily identify the advantages of such a vacation: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Minimum vacationers.  Mothers with young children, who will begin to occupy all the beaches since mid-summer, have not yet arrived at the resorts. </li><li>  Low housing prices.  Since the season in June is only opening, the cost of living remains extremely low.  This is especially noticeable at the beginning of the month, when you can rent a room in a decent guest house for only five hundred rubles a day.  Closer to July, the price may rise two and a half times. </li><li>  Pure water.  Everyone knows that by August, sea water becomes very muddy due to the constant presence of a large number of people in it.  And a vacation in Crimea in June will give you a crystal clear and transparent sea, which will be so nice to plunge into. </li><li>  Lack of sweltering heat.  In the first month of summer you can comfortably explore all the main attractions, because you will not be disturbed by the heat.  Therefore, you will have the opportunity to go to the mountains and other interesting places where it is difficult to be at a temperature of forty degrees above zero. </li><li>  Great tan.  Yes, don’t be surprised.  During a vacation in Crimea in June, the weather will definitely surprise you with an incredibly gentle sun, which will give a stunningly beautiful shade of a tan without burns and redness. </li></ul><p>  Of course, we have listed far from all the benefits of a Crimean holiday in the first month of summer.  But we think that they are enough to show how profitable such a vacation is in all respects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea in june weather" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1809652.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, it is worth choosing those places where in June it is the warmest. </p><p>  If you are planning a vacation in Crimea in June with children, then go to the Sea of ​​Azov, in which the water warms up much faster than in the Black Sea.  You should stay in Kerch or Schelkovo - here is an excellent choice of pensions and guesthouses at quite affordable prices. </p><p>  Traditionally, in the southern part of <span>Crimea, the climate</span> is milder, and the real summer begins at the end of May.  Therefore, you should go on vacation to Feodosia or, for example, to the <span>region of Sevastopol.</span>  Here in June there will be even quite hot weather with little rain. </p><p>  The western coast of the peninsula is also ideal for a June vacation in Crimea.  Here, water usually warms up very quickly, and the absence of strong winds does not allow it to mix with the deep layers.  It is better to rest to go to Evpatoria or to Tarkhankut. </p><p>  Keep in mind that wherever you go, you can swim and sunbathe everywhere.  However, it is worth considering certain nuances that we will tell you about now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea at the beginning of june reviews" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1809645.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Crimea in June: weather reviews (air temperature) </h2><p>  In the first month of summer, Crimea is already much warmer than in May.  During the day, the sun heats the air to twenty-six degrees, and in the evenings it is still quite cool, which, however, makes walking through cafes and restaurants comfortable. </p><p>  Those tourists who prefer to come to the peninsula in June, say that the first summer month is the best time to relax in the Crimea.  The weather allows you to sunbathe, swim and comfortably spend time in the city, as well as on various excursions.  There are known years when the air temperature in June reached thirty-five degrees Celsius.  But this is more a weather anomaly than a common occurrence.  But judging by the reviews, tourists can quite count on an air temperature of 25-30 degrees above zero. </p><h2>  Water temperature </h2><p>  In the first month of summer, vacationers often swim in the sea, but keep in mind that during a vacation in Crimea in early June, the water temperature will not rise above twenty degrees.  Usually it ranges from eighteen to twenty degrees Celsius.  If we focus on reviews, we can conclude that swimming will be a little refreshing, but this has its own, special charm. </p><p>  By mid-June, the Black Sea warms up to twenty-five degrees, and on the Sea of ​​Azov the water temperature can reach twenty-eight degrees above zero.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to go with children on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov, especially at the beginning of the month. </p><h2>  Rains in june </h2><p>  On the entire coast of Crimea, rains in June are a fairly common occurrence.  However, they are never long and cold.  It usually rains for several hours, and after that warm and sunny weather sets in. </p><p>  In different parts of the peninsula its average number of rainy days.  For example, in Yalta there are about six of them per month, and in Feodosia - four.  Most rarely it rains in Sevastopol - just one day, and the rainiest June is in Alushta and Gurzuf.  Here showers are nine and ten days respectively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Crimea in early June" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1809651.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water chasing </h2><p>  If you want to go to the Crimea, then do not forget about such a thing as “water chasing”.  This is due to frequent strong winds in parts of the peninsula.  Thanks to the winds, the heated water mixes with the deep cold layers, and it becomes simply impossible to swim.  Usually during this phenomenon, the sea temperature drops by ten degrees.  The churning of water lasts no more than six days, during this time the sea warms up again, and tourists are happy to start swimming. </p><h2>  What to do on the Crimean peninsula in the first summer month? </h2><p>  For those who are planning a vacation in Crimea in early June, the reviews analyzed by us will help to make a list of classes in case of adverse weather.  So, what should you do if you find the water is moving or the sun doesn’t want to peek out from behind the clouds? </p><p>  Definitely walk and go on excursions.  Vacationers can go horseback riding or decide on a hiking trail through the mountains.  It is also interesting to travel around the resorts of Crimea by bicycle.  You can rent this vehicle in various offices engaged in the rental of sports equipment. </p><p>  In cloudy weather it is good to go on excursions.  For example, in Sevastopol you can go to Balaklava, and in Koktebel to master a hang glider and enjoy the bird's eye view of the surroundings.  If you are fortunate enough to be in Sudak, then at your service will be the mysterious Meganom, Tsarsky Beach and <span>Cape Alchak-Kaya.</span>  At any resort you will find how to have fun and usefully if the weather lets you down for a few days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea in june reviews weather" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1809650.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion: is it worth it to go to Crimea in June </h2><p>  There are quite a lot of reviews of tourists about their vacation on the peninsula in early summer.  Therefore, it is easy to formulate an opinion whether to go here in June.  Based on numerous comments, we can say that in the first summer month in the Crimea you can go to people who prefer an active holiday and seek to get the maximum number of impressions.  Moms with children should go to the Sea of ​​Azov in the second half of the month, when the water temperature will be most comfortable for the kids.  But for those for whom the purpose of the vacation is bathing and tanning, you need to postpone the rest until the end of June or the beginning of July. </p>
