Previously, it was these cities that defended approaches to Moscow, on their territory fortresses of those times, historical buildings were preserved.  Here, in the center, are themed museums.

    <h2>  In the footsteps of poets, writers and artists </h2><p>  Shakhmatovo, Muranovo, Abramtsevo, Ostafyevo, Polenovo, Zakharovo, Melikhovo, Serednikovo - many of the most interesting places near Moscow are directly connected with outstanding people of their time.  Is it not curious to walk along the paths of the park where Tyutchev walked, or to see the bench on which Pushkin was sitting?  Is it not interesting to look out the window and understand what inspired the Wanderers, or to see the oaks that remember Karamzin?  Many estates have museums with exhibits belonging to once famous people who lived here.  Unfortunately, the other tribal nests of the nobles were abandoned and gradually deteriorate, forgetting the balls and famous local guests.  However, they can be interesting in their own way.  Visitors note that most of the expositions may be curious only to fans of certain personalities, but to walk along the paths of the parks and see how the nobles lived before, how they led their way of life - this simply cannot be boring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Picturesque places </h2><p>  Although beauty is a very subjective concept, it is strange to deny the atmosphere of appeasement when looking at the expanse of the river.  The easiest way to find such interesting places in the south of Moscow region, where there is a great example of such an object - the Oka.  Driving in this direction, it‚Äôs hard not to stumble, it‚Äôs simply mesmerizing.  And if in winter the impression may not be too good, then in the summer it just cannot happen. <br>  Another wonderful example of a landscape combining nature and the city is the Zhivopisnoy bridge district in Moscow.  Not everyone likes him, but quite a few are indifferent.  If someone wants to slightly reduce the degree of penetration of the city, you can go a little deeper into Serebryany Bor and the Stroginsky floodplain, there you can well rest from the bustle. </p><p>  Similar places of interest in the <span>immediate Moscow Region</span> are the Bear Lakes in the Schelkovo direction, Pirogovskoye and Klyazminskoe, as well as the Istra Reservoir.  In summer you can also swim here, in many places there are special beaches and picnic areas.  Their popularity speaks for itself - no reviews can be more eloquent than constantly returning visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Historical sights </h2><p>  Moscow neighborhoods remember many events that are now reflected in textbooks.  Mostly it is about military history.  The battlefields have long been built up by cities and inhabited by people, but the memory of them remains.  The famous armored museum in Kubinka, a memorial on the Borodino field in the Mozhaisk district, including an exposition of military equipment in Chernogolovka, the Air Force in Monino, air defense in Balashikha, space forces in Krasnoznamensk, German antifascists in Krasnogorsk and many more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If this seems not enough to someone, you can continue excursions in the capital itself.  By the way, under Taganskaya Square there is a real bunker where visitors are taken.  This so-called <span>Cold War Museum</span> is located at a depth of about 60 meters and is a real catacomb, where you can easily go in the wrong place and get lost.  Some people even think that you can get into the subway from there.  Girls rarely remain enthusiastic about military-themed museums, but boys often come out with literally burning eyes. </p><h2>  Churches and temples of the Moscow Region </h2><p>  Any more or less large city in the European part of Russia is an additional point on the pilgrim's journey, because there are a huge number of them.  The suburbs of the capital, like itself, of course, only confirm this rule.  <span>Trinity Lavra of</span> St. <span>Sergius,</span> Dmitrov, <span>New Jerusalem,</span> Stupinsky and Chekhov districts, etc. The oldest churches are located in Sergiev Posad, Kolomna, Zvenigorod, the village of Kamenskoye, Mozhaysk.  Even just driving along the tracks, you can see beautiful buildings, shaded with golden domes.  It is simply impossible to list them, there are so many of them, and each is beautiful in its own way. </p>

    <p>  As for the holy sources, the most popular are the "Gremyachiy Klyuch" near the village of Malinniki in the Yaroslavl direction and located in Radonezh.  Not only places for collecting water are equipped here, but also baths.  Every year, thousands of pilgrims take all the attractions of this category, excellent infrastructure has already developed, and there is no need to talk about the Lavra - it is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Even the photos and reviews of tourists, who are always enthusiastic, cannot reflect its stunning beauty. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Perhaps, large and small will be interesting ethnic village, some time ago opened on the border with the Kaluga region.  This huge park museum offers a lot of entertainment, some programs are even designed specifically for children, master classes are held, tours to the husky kennel are organized, in a word, you won‚Äôt be bored.  Another opportunity to get out with the younger members of the family is to go to the zoo, but not simple, but contact, that is, as close as possible to the conditions that are natural for animals.  It is difficult to imagine a child who would not want to feed and pet the animal, so their enthusiastic reaction is not surprising.  Adults also often remain on contact zoos of the best opinion. </p><p>  Such menageries exist in several places near Moscow.  For example, you can admire deer living at biostations in Losiny Ostrov, or be surprised at the yaks by driving along Dmitrovskoye Shosse to the village of Ilyinskoye.  There are still wonderful menageries in Gorki and Verbilki, and in the direction of the Kaluga highway, Exotic Park is in full swing preparing to receive small visitors, where you can find tigers, zebras, hyenas, meerkats and many more animals.  But here it‚Äôs simply unsafe to feed animals.  If such interesting places near Moscow for children are not enthusiastic, then you can visit the oceanarium located next to the Moscow Ring Road or the whole family can go to the water park, especially since recently their choice has been quite large. </p>

    <p>  Not far from the capital there is another amazing place that has long been one of the most dangerous.  This is the so-called "Death Road" - a highway near Lytkarino.  For a short period of time on a flat area, more than two dozen major accidents occurred for obvious reasons which were not.  Smerdyachye Lake is also very popular near the village of Baksheevo in the Shatursky district.  It is almost perfectly round, and local residents are afraid to swim here - visitors often drown.  Another interesting fact is that there are a lot of reservoirs with a very similar shape in the vicinity, scientists suspect that several fragments of a large meteorite once fell in this area.  Opinions of visitors vary: it seems boring to some, others build their own theories regarding such places, so it's better to find the time and get out for a day to unravel the secrets of the Moscow region. </p>
