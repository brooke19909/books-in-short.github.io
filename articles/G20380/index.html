    <h2>  Xperia Kandelor Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Enough Russians have already visited this hotel.  It should be said that the reviews of vacationers vary.  Some were satisfied with the choice of hotel, others believe that it was not worth coming here.  Many stay at the Xperia Kandelor Hotel because of the famous Cleopatra Beach. </p><p>  There are no particular complaints about the location: all important infrastructures are within walking distance.  There are many cafes and shops nearby. </p><p>  The territory is quite small.  The hotel is urban, so it is built on a small area.  The rooms, although small, are very comfortable.  Our compatriots consider the presence of disposable slippers to be a big plus.  Another little surprise is the free filling of the minibar with drinking water and two bags of juice. </p><p>  The food is excellent.  So says the vast majority of Russians.  This is noted not only by tourists, but also by representatives of travel agencies selling vouchers here.  A huge variety of dishes, delicious cuisine.  Many say that the food in this hotel is one of the best among Alanya hotels. </p><p>  Another huge plus is the free sunbeds on the beach.  Tourists have to pay for umbrellas and trestle beds along the entire coast of Alanya, but an exception has been made for the Kleopatra Beach Hotels hotel chain, which also includes Xperia. </p><p>  Bottom line: many Russians expressed a desire to come here again. </p>
