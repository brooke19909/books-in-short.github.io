Her first products were perceived without much enthusiasm, but those who managed to evaluate the work of the models of this manufacturer were satisfied.  First of all, success was promoted by a serious approach of specialists to the implementation of these products.  Smartphones also use high-quality materials for the case.  But the most attractive feature of this brand was the low price of products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo p780 specifications" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today there is no definite answer to the question of whether to buy smartphones from Lenovo or not?  It all depends on what the user is used to working with and what features he needs.  And the latest smartphone <span>"Lenovo" R780</span> has plenty. </p><p>  It reflected all the latest developments in the industry, as well as some of its innovations.  This suggests that the company does not stand still and is actively developing this area. </p><h2>  Who is who </h2><p>  For a clear classification of their products, specialists have a very simple and understandable labeling.  Everyone is already used to having a letter in the first place.  It means a device class.  The letter K (for some reason, the last letter of the word Geek) means the most advanced achievements and is assigned to flagship models.  The letter S (from the word Stylish) is assigned to stylish models that have distinctive features in appearance.  If at the beginning of the name is the letter A (from the word Affordable), then these are budget models.  And finally, the letter P means that the model is made for the business class, although it is taken from the word Proffesional.  To this group, as you might have guessed, the Lenovo P780 phone belongs.  In this line, devices with characteristics that are slightly smaller than the flagship ones are collected.  But there is something different from ultra-functional advanced devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  When you first get acquainted with the device, there is a lasting impression that in the hands of a thoughtful and high-quality smartphone.  This is partly the effect of weight, which is 176 g. Compared to other plastic "cars" it is heavier.  This is facilitated primarily by the battery, which, together with a capacity of as much as 4000 mA / h, also has a solid weight. </p><p>  The back cover of the device is completely made of metal, which gives a pleasant chill in the palm of your hand.  There is also a metal edging along the contours.  It is worth noting that not many companies are busy with metal parts and prefer plastic.  In this regard, the characteristics of the Lenovo R780 compare favorably with competitors. </p><p>  There are only three physical buttons in the device itself.  One is for turning on, and two is for adjusting the volume.  On the front side, everything is sensory.  Such a performance, in principle, will not surprise anyone.  Probably soon there will be smartphones without any such ‚Äúremnants‚Äù of the past era. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The appearance of this smartphone is not the most unique.  Everything is made in traditional colors and shapes.  The front side is completely covered with Gorilla Glass 2 and gives the impression of solidity.  The black color of the case adds even more solidity and masculinity.  Everything is done so concisely and simply that I want to call the smartphone pedant.  Undoubtedly, it was created for businessmen, for whom work is of primary importance.  Moreover, in our case, it is quite lengthy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo p780 instruction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500987.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the accessories market, finding it is not difficult. </p><p>  The main three touch buttons at the bottom of the screen are white-highlighted icons that show the essence of the operation when activated.  They are almost invisible when the smartphone is in standby mode. </p><p>  The back side is, as mentioned earlier, a metal cover.  Its color is black with lines appearing under the paint or, if you like, scratches that imply factory quality.  The brand name is also embossed on it in bold white. </p><h2>  Power and memory </h2><p>  After impressing with the physical data, the user will be no less surprised by the hardware.  At the heart of the device is a crystal with four cores.  Each of them works with a frequency of 1200 MHz.  High-speed memory for some reason, there is 1 GB.  But still, this bunch is more than enough for the Lenovo P780 firmware to work reliably and quickly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lenovo p780" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is 4 GB of internal storage space for files, and it can reach up to 32 GB via memory cards.  However, additional memory will have to be definitely purchased, because of the 4 built-in memory only 2.8 GB is available. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For processing video data, a processor is used, which is called Power VR SGX 544. It copes fairly well with its duties and does not disappoint the inhibitions of fans to watch movies in high quality. </p><h2>  Electronic tests </h2><p>  If you run the smartphone system through virtual testers and compare the results with similar competitors, it turns out that our applicant is in the middle position.  In some cases, when users wrote a Lenovo P780 review, there were less than average results.  But you shouldn‚Äôt particularly rely on such data, because not every person has a smartphone that will work on critical loads. </p><h2>  Screen and device sensor </h2><p>  To display information, a five-inch screen with an IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused.  Resolution is 1280 √ó 720 pixels and is not the best solution.  But the sharpness of the image is quite suitable for the operation of Lenovo P780.  Reviews about the screen are mostly positive. </p>

    <p>  You can hand over the brightness control to automation or set your own values.  At maximum illumination, the picture looks clear, and the colors are balanced.  With a strong tilt of the screen, you can notice a certain distortion in color reproduction.  A purely black color when tilted turns into dark blue.  But everything is within reason. </p><p>  For the convenience of the user, when the phone is brought to the ear, the <span>proximity sensor</span> works and turns off the sensor.  Therefore, do not worry that touch can be perceived as controlling functions. </p><p>  The sensor is well-trained to recognize up to ten simultaneous touches.  With this, you can flexibly control functions and quickly switch between them. </p><h2>  Protection against external influences </h2><p>  If you look closely, you can see that the surface of the protective glass has an anti-reflective coating.  It completely copes with its duties.  There is also a special oleophobic (grease repellent) layer, which to some extent prevents the appearance of fingerprints and greasy spots.  And if they do appear, then they can be very easily removed from the screen.  For this purpose, you need to use a soft cloth or microfiber. </p><h2>  Photo and video features </h2><p>  For photography enthusiasts, the smartphone has an 8-megapixel camera.  She shoots with an average quality that will not disappoint, but will not surprise.  Photos from the Lenovo P780 camera, reviews of which can be found on the Internet, look normal, and blurring can only be seen in the background.  The color rendition is true and does not ‚Äúfall over‚Äù into any of the spectra. </p><p>  For help there is an automatic and manual focusing.  It is also possible to select the desired quality and format of the image.  For shooting in the dark, an LED fill flash is installed. </p><p>  Movies are shot in Full HD quality (1080 p).  They look great on the screen.  When viewed on a wide monitor, the quality is a little lost, but this is not critical.  In video mode, a choice of two file formats is available: MP4 and 3GP. </p><p>  For video calls, there is a small <span>front camera of</span> 0.3 megapixels.  Its quality is enough only purely for this purpose.  But you can take a picture for contacts. </p><h2>  Two SIM cards and their mode of operation </h2><p>  To distinguish between business and home calls, the Lenovo P780 phone has the ability to install two SIM cards.  Since the device has one radio module, they work alternately.  When talking on one operator, the second will be unavailable.  The location of the cards is very convenient, since you do not need to remove the battery to remove them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Review Lenovo P780" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To configure the work of operators, you should immediately assign a card to use the Internet, send SMS and other functions.  To make calls, the phone will each time ask for the choice of the operator. </p><h2>  Wireless and useful programs </h2><p>  You can use the built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules to exchange data with other devices.  They will allow you to send and receive files, as well as access the Internet. </p><p>  To work on the network there is a pre-installed browser.  The smartphone‚Äôs menu has already installed icons for quick access to the accounts of all popular social networks. </p><p>  To determine the coordinates there is a GPS navigator.  It will help you navigate the terrain and get directions to the desired object.  In addition to it, there is a built-in compass and an accelerometer. </p><p>  An office software package is installed for working with documents.  If you need to record something, and there is no pen at hand, you can use the built-in voice recorder.  All this is perfect for those who often work with text files and who need to capture various information. </p><h2>  Device battery </h2><p>  The undeniable advantage of the smartphone is its powerful battery.  According to the manufacturer, it is able to maintain up to 43 hours of talk time.  Most likely, this is a very real picture.  With intensive use, the device lasts about three days, which by the standards of such devices is a very good result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="firmware lenovo p780" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500991.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The battery itself occupies a large part under the back cover.  The manufacturer does not recommend removing it.  That is why it is screwed.  To prevent this, a special strip in the form of a seal is even glued.  By the way, the warranty will cease to be valid if damaged. </p><p>  Since the smartphone does not want to part with the battery, a reset button is provided.  It is located near the memory card slot and is colored red. </p><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  Controlling the functions of a smartphone is familiar to those who have been using this technique for a long time.  Holding the device in one hand, you can safely use it.  The only remark on the account of <span>Lenovo P780, reviews of</span> which were found on the Internet, is the location of the lock and power button on the upper end of the case.  This performance makes you reach your finger with it every time you use it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lenovo r780" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/500996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the button is a slot for connecting a USB cable.  It is sealed with a special plastic cover, which can be opened only if there is a threat to break the nail.  It is really very tightly closed.  You will have to fight it every time you need to charge the phone. </p><p>  In terms of managing functions, everything is convenient and thoughtful.  On top of the Android 4.2 system, a small proprietary shell is installed.  Everything works fast.  For example, when you start the navigator, satellites are detected surprisingly quickly.  Therefore, in this regard, the characteristics of the Lenovo P780 are well suited for a car that needs an interactive map of the area. </p><h2>  Manufacturer Options </h2><p>  When unpacking the Lenovo P780 box, a photo of which is shown on its surface, you can directly find the smartphone itself, the charger and the USB cable in it.  I would also like to say about the OTG cable, which is also included.  It is a short wire, on which there is a micro USB plug on one side and a USB slot on the other.  Thus, you can connect a regular USB flash drive to the smartphone to transfer and copy data.  Not every manufacturer can boast of such a function. </p><p>  Among other things, they put <span>vacuum headphones</span> in the box <span>.</span>  They sound good.  They can be safely attributed to the benefits. </p><p>  For those who are holding a smartphone for the first time and want to master the Lenovo P780, the instruction is to help.  It will allow you to quickly learn the basic functions of the device for effective use. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This model will undoubtedly be in demand in the market.  Since the competitors' problem of battery life is quite acute, those who need a long time without recharging will prefer this particular brand. </p><p>  Also, a positive incentive will be the price of Lenovo P780, which is slightly lower than others.  However, there is no danger that this could be a sign of poor quality. </p><p>  After the release of this smartphone in 2013, users started talking on the Lenovo P780 model on the forums.  Reviews in most cases were positive.  Everyone noted a good build, fast work and, of course, just an unprecedented battery life. </p>
