There are parking lots for cars, places for rest with the arrangement of barbecues and a smokehouse - barbecue or smoked fish are an integral part of cultural leisure. </p><p>  You can rent a room or even a house for the weekend.  Shershnevskoe reservoir - a reservoir on the banks of which there are always places for tourists.  Beautiful and equipped gazebos on the beaches are considered very convenient for spending holidays during the holidays both in summer and in winter, because they are open to the penetration of the wind.

There are many vertebrates in both quantity and variety.  This is told by local fishermen and just people who have visited this pond. </p><p>  Reading the essays of spinningists, one can find out what the small ruff, crucian carp and perch, large pike perch and burbot, rich pike and meat tench, as well as bream and chebak, and even valuable fish, bite, bite here.  The area of ​​the Shershnevsky reservoir completely contributes to the good reproduction of these species.  Fishing is carried out from the coast, a regular fishing rod and simple bait are used.  And from boats, as a rule, fish are caught thanks to spinning rods, donks, and a feeder fishing method. </p><p>  Most often, a chebak is caught - a fish similar to roach found in many rivers, lakes and even ponds of Russia.  Like roach, it bites well on dough, maggot and worm, and during winter fishing - on bloodworms.  And if seekers of rare and cunning predatory fish go to the reservoir, you will have to try hard to catch it. </p><h2>  Reservoir problems </h2><p>  Shershnevskoe reservoir (Chelyabinsk) is equipped on the site of the flooded Mikhailovsky farm, where there were many houses, farms, gardens and even a plant.  The remnants of water-damaged wooden buildings often nailed to the shores earlier, which created a displacement and reformation of the coastal zone of the reservoir.  This also interfered with the fishermen, creating inconvenience in their movement on boats and rafts, which simply hooked on logs and boards sticking out of the water, sometimes intertwined with bushes growing on the banks. </p><p>  Now the coast is relatively clean, there are no obstacles to the free and comfortable rest of tourists.  The environmental situation is under control, the common areas are carefully protected.  In the zone of water attractions for children, everything is provided for protection against danger, even special sand was brought there, and the bathtubs for babies are filled with purified water from microbes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water temperature in Shershnevsky reservoir" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1368282.jpg" width="600"></div>
