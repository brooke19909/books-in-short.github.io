    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  One of the best accommodation options in the capital is "StandArt" (hotel, Moscow).  Reviews about this place contain the following positive comments: </p><ul><li>  very beautiful design of the bathroom, as well as new and high-quality plumbing; </li><li>  high-quality cosmetics in an individual disposable set; </li><li>  comfortable large bed with high-quality orthopedic mattress; </li><li>  convenient location in the central part of the city; </li><li>  excellent cuisine in the restaurant; </li><li>  the rooms are very large and incredibly beautifully decorated; </li><li>  beautiful city views from the windows of the rooms, which are located on the upper floors. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only positive, but also negative comments are characterized by the hotel "StandArt".  Reviews of it contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the smell of chemicals in the corridors (apparently it is poison for mice or insects); </li><li>  there are no handles on the windows, and therefore they do not open; </li><li>  road works are constantly carried out near the hotel, which greatly complicates the access; </li><li>  the staff is too loose and cheeky in relation to the guests; </li><li>  breakfasts are too expensive, it is much cheaper to eat in neighboring establishments; </li><li>  despite the fact that the booking indicates a late check out, it is refused even if there are free rooms; </li><li>  the smell of cigarettes in the rooms. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  If you have developed a habit of luxury and comfort, then, arriving in Moscow, feel free to choose the "StandArt" hotel for your accommodation.  Its main feature is the original design of the apartments.  In addition, due to their spacious area, they accommodate a large number of amenities.  As for breakfast, it is better to take a room without it, because its cost is quite large, and the quality is no better than in any other nearby institution. </p><p>  The high cost of living at the hotel is due not only to the luxurious design, but also to its location in the central part of the city.  Nevertheless, if we talk about the service and the level of service, then there are some questions.  It cannot but please a huge list of quality services for a good rest.  But speaking directly about employees, they lack knowledge regarding communication with guests. </p>
