Skating rink (Gorky Park of Culture and Rest): working hours</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many, Soviet squares are associated with the agitation of the ruling party.  Indeed, patriotic music played there for a long time and ideological work was carried out.  But people did not go there for socialism, but to sports grounds, attractions and an ice rink.  Park of Culture and Rest  Gorky today can pleasantly surprise his visitors. </p><h2>  The birth of a national favorite </h2><p>  The history of this complex began back in 1753.  Then, near the territory of the modern institution stood the estate of Prince Trubetskoy.  In the fashion of that time, which, it is worth noting, was introduced by Peter the Great, the nobleman paved a garden near a house of amazing beauty. </p>

The territory under the square was allocated next to the Neskuchny Garden, which once belonged to the aforementioned prince.  According to the plan, the new facility was to smoothly move into the old square.  The project was entrusted to the avant-garde architect Konstantin Melnikov.

    <p>  On August 12, 1928, the first Culture Park was inaugurated.  The skating rink attracted citizens in the winter, the rides were popular in the summer, and regardless of the time of the year, mass events and concerts were held. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ensemble of flavors </h2><p>  Even ordinary residents of the city participated in the design of the recreation area.  The ideas that they proposed, the leadership accepted.  The former relied on physical education, the latter focused on the theme of entertainment, the latter wanted dancing and music. </p><p>  Despite the fact that everyone saw the future park differently, consensus was reached.  The architects managed to combine all the proposals, so the complex turned out to be extremely versatile and satisfy the tastes of all visitors. </p>

    <p>  It is very important that the administration gives a chance to people of retirement age to come for free.  Traditionally, they choose one day of the week when the elderly can go to the site only by presenting a certificate. </p><p>  It will help improve the emotional health of the ice rink.  A culture and recreation park awaits representatives of various segments of the population, but most often it is visited by families.  For a fee, a personal teacher will help adults and children, as well as those who are skating for the first time, for a fee. </p><h2>  Additional benefits </h2><p>  On both sides of the platform are cafes and restaurants that will not only warm visitors with a cup of hot drink, but also provide tasty and satisfying food. </p><p>  You can get from the ice immediately to the shops.

    <p>  Those who have a few hours of free time should definitely visit the skating rink (Culture Park).  The work schedule will suit both students and busy people.  The <span>ice town is</span> open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.  The first session is much cheaper.  Guests should also be aware that sanitary work is in progress from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. </p><p>  For the convenience of visitors, a parking space was allocated near the tracks. </p><h2>  Theme of joy </h2><p>  The administration offers all kinds of discounts and promotions.  Price on weekends and <span>weekdays is</span> different.  But the high cost of a ticket for the holiday pays off, because spending time on the site is a great pleasure and a lot of positive emotions. </p><p>  The feature that the skating rink offers (Gorky Park of Culture and Leisure is trying to follow the latest in entertainment) is the thematic design.  The background, which was framed for the 2014-2015 season, was the starry sky.  To create the effect of the infinity of the galaxy, more than 30,000 multi-colored light bulbs were mounted under the ice.  In addition to the radiance pouring from the rays, the designers revived the pictures. </p>

    <p>  The site is especially charming at night.  Light musical notes and bright light, which flooded the floor, turns an ordinary evening into a fairy tale. </p><h2>  Cons and disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite all the innovations, the sites are full of criticism towards this base.  Hundreds of guests do not like the ice rink.  Culture Park, reviews of which are very different, has a lot of ill-wishers. </p><p>  Many visitors complain that during the holidays not only is it difficult to walk, but also breathing.  Another problem of the weekend is huge lines.  People say that sometimes under the checkout you can stand for more than 30 minutes.  The inventory process takes even more time. </p><p>  The next minus is the farther from the center, the less cheerful the atmosphere.  At the edges of almost inaudible music.  It is dirty and dark. </p><p>  Offends customers and bad manners.  Many people complain about rudeness and negative attitude from the workers.  The guards do not fulfill their duties and instead of displaying drunk youth, they ignore these and other violations. </p><h2>  Atmosphere is everyone‚Äôs business </h2><p>  Information that ice with potholes is not true.  Most visitors really note that in some places they come across hills, but they absolutely do not affect skiing.  The prices are affordable.  Skates are given on bail, and the lockers, where you can store personal items, are spacious.  This information is especially important for athletes who can not do without training bags in training. </p>

Of course, there are people who can not stand the working voltage.  Especially on weekends the ice rink is very popular.  The culture park is large, and if someone meets an unskilled worker, you can contact another employee.
