The toy that the child made himself will become more valuable to him than the most expensive gift.  There are several versions of how to make a boat.  We know some from childhood;  others are more complex, and require some experience in the art of paper crafts.  But the most impressive models are those that are assembled from small elements - modular ships. </p><p>  <span>How to make</span> origami paper <span>ship</span> ?  There are many ways, many techniques.  For some interesting models in this article we give instructions and give tips on proper assembly. </p><h2>  Simple paper applications </h2><p>  First decide which paper folding technique you will use?  For preschoolers 4-6 years old it is interesting to make applications.  Elementary boats glued from cut pieces of paper do not even require any patterns.  It is enough to draw a felt-tip pen ship - two- or three-masted.  Cut it and stick it on a blank sheet of paper or cardboard, and at the bottom, invite the child to draw the waves.  Cardboard paper can be placed against the wall or folded so that the boat is level. </p><h2>  How to make a paper ship?  Two schemes of origami ships </h2><p>  Even a schoolboy will make a regular ship of colored paper.  We will not focus on it.  The scheme is very detailed and explains everything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jetoni.ru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of an ordinary boat" class="if uuid-2851602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2851602.jpg"></div><p>  We better explain a different scheme.  This is a more unique scheme of the ship with two pipes.  Sometimes it is called an envelope boat, because it can give gift money to a colleague or friend.  This is also an interesting surprise for children.  This model can even be put on water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jetoni.ru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope ship diagram" class="if uuid-2851319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2851319.jpg"></div><p>  What do we have to do? </p><ul><li>  We take a square sheet of any paper and make bends diagonally. </li><li>  Expand, and bend all 2 corners exactly to the center.  It turns out a smaller square. </li><li>  We turn over and in those small squares that turned out, we bend out every free corner.  In the diagram, this step is numbered 6. </li><li>  Then you need to open a couple of bottom "pockets" on the back side, all the necessary actions are shown by arrows in step 8 and 9. </li><li>  Fold in half, as shown by the black arrow in diagram number 9, and this is the last step. </li></ul><p>  If your child asks how to make a paper ship, answer that you need only 10 steps and 8 minutes of time.  The result was a wonderful ship model. </p><h2>  <span>Sailing ship.</span>  Scheme and instruction </h2><p>  You can also make a cute sailing boat out of colored paper.  Its assembly is also nothing complicated. </p><ol><li>  First, as always, we bend the square sheet 2 times diagonally.  This step is not even illustrated, because this is the initial preparation. </li><li>  Divide the sheet of square in half. </li><li>  Once again in half on each side. </li><li>  Next, we easily bend the corners to the center line of the fold </li><li>  The next bend must be done at a sharper angle.  All 4 bends should be tried equally. </li><li>  We bend the last remaining corners, and make a blank such as in fig.  5. </li><li>  Then you need to fully deploy this workpiece and make deflections along the initial diagonal lines to get the bow and stern of the ship.  You will see that the boat will form for you after all these paper manipulations. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sdelatbumagi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper sailing boat" class="if uuid-2848058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2848058.jpg"></div><p>  A sail consists of one triangular leaf, dressed on a toothpick.  Despite the terrifying simplicity of the craft, it still looks beautiful and neat.  The child will cope with the scheme in two counts.  In principle, a sailboat does not have to be worn.  And you can put the passenger in a toy - some kind of lego character, for example. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rukodelielux.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper boat" class="if uuid-2851301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2851301.jpg"></div><p>  Origami is a whole art that must be studied and loved.  This will teach the child to spend time profitably. </p><p>  A lot of paper ships in the form of a boat with a sail can be made from different colored paper.  Then you get a whole flotilla of sailboats. </p><h2>  A real military paper cruiser.  Instruction manual </h2><p>  Such a sailing boat will appeal to young children.  Older guys are better off finding a pattern to create a true cruiser.  The network has many sites where old magazines "Young Technician" are published, there are online publications of the Polish magazine - MALY MODELARZ, where there is a step-by-step guide and all the schemes for the ship.  This ship will no longer be easy to assemble;  it will take patience.  In addition, you must have a good color printer to print these models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="only-paper.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawings for the assembly of a large ship" class="if uuid-2851605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2851605.jpg"></div><p>  There is another option.  Namely, to find on the Internet a ready-made set of models.  However, these kits cost money.  How to make a paper ship that will be like real? </p><p>  Modeling ships sometimes captures adult men.  This is not surprising.  Paper models of ships are created not only for entertainment and a pleasant pastime.  Modeling is also a development. </p><p>  Since the circuit is in one copy, and there are no spare parts, everything needs to be done carefully.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs easy to spoil the ship.  There is a paper ship manual in the box.  The child will first have to cut out all the details with scissors, and then glue them in the order shown in the instructions. </p><h2>  Modular origami.  Ship of the future </h2><p>  Talented craftsmen make real masterpieces out of modules.  Modular origami (crafts made from small triangular parts) is very popular around the globe.  How to make paper craft using modular origami technique? </p><div class="photo" data-original="masterclassy.masterpodelok.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The modular scheme of the ship" class="if uuid-2848057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2848057.jpg"></div><p>  First buy at least 10 sheets of colored paper.  And if you still do not know how to make triangular modules, then practice first to make smooth, high-quality elements.  The ship will not come out of the curved paper parts. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="i59t-MKNYNs" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i59t-MKNYNs" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/3/6/7/9367.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a paper ship out of paper that is too soft?  Such paper will not work.  For modular modeling, choose thicker, even stiffer paper. </p><p>  Select the model you are interested in.  And find a step-by-step video tutorial with detailed explanations.  First choose a model with a minimum of color patterns.  And try a few times.  One day it will certainly turn out to fold so that the craft does not fall apart. </p><h2>  How to glue modular origami ships </h2><p>  Large ships need to be glued.  When there are a lot of details and many rows, the design is too heavy and even a cardboard frame is needed.  But if you have a minimodel, with a small number of modules, then it is optional. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="tb3dZwsj6Nc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3dZwsj6Nc" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/3/7/1/9371.jpg"></div><p>  If you buy glue, take ordinary PVA.  But to apply to the surface of each element is not necessary.  Several points in each row are glued, and then very carefully so that there are no white marks. </p>
