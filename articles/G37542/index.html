One of the most striking examples in Belarus is Oginsky Manor, which is located in the agricultural town of Zalesye.  The estate belonged to the politician and composer Mikhail Oginsky, who is known throughout the world as the author of the polonaise "Farewell to the Homeland." </p><h2>  Oginsky Manor (Belarus) </h2><p>  In the town of Zalesye (Republic of Belarus) there is a manor that has been under construction since 1802.  The construction was completed twenty years later.  The estate is included in the list of historical and cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãof Belarus and stands on the banks of the Dry River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oginsky Manor" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/2024973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, not all the buildings that were part of the complex were able to survive, but in 2011 a major restoration was started.  So, for example, in 2014, the Oginsky Palace was solemnly and re-opened.  In 2015, work began in park areas, in the future it is planned to open a museum and cultural center. </p><h2>  The composition of the estate </h2><p>  To better imagine Oginsky Manor, it is necessary to describe what it consists of: </p><ul><li>  The palace itself, the construction of which was completed in 1822. </li><li>  Large park complex. </li><li>  The Catholic chapel, which was built in 1815, and was restored in the 20s of the last century. </li><li>  Water mill, also built in the 19th century. </li><li>  Barn of the XIX century. </li><li>  The pavilion "Temple of Amelia" of the XIX century. </li></ul><p>  All this can be seen if you visit the estate, going to the town of Zalesie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Lithuanian-Belarusian princely and noble family of Oginsky originates from Prince Dmitry Glushonka.  They began to own the Zalesye estate long before the birth of Mikhail Oginsky, in the 18th century. </p><p>  When Oginsky's estate was inherited from Uncle Frantisek Xavier by Mikhail, it consisted of a wooden palace and several buildings for household purposes.  In 1802, after the Kosciuszko uprising, Mikhail returned to the Russian Empire and began to build a new stone estate.  For eight years, he constantly lived in Zalesye, and then for more than 10 years periodically stayed in this place.  The author of the project was Mikhail Schulz, and Joseph Putier led the entire construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oginsky Manor in Zalesye" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/2024971.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <p>  When the palace was built, a park in the English style was laid out nearby, a chapel, several gazebos and bridges, pavilions were also built.  It is interesting that in the park for a more complete picture, a lake was equipped, which was filled with water from two rivers, Bobrinka and Ruditsa, flowing throughout the park. </p><p>  Some of these buildings can be seen today, some of them were rebuilt and restored, while others were almost completely restored. </p><p>  Why is Oginsky's estate named after Mikhail?  What was the Polish prince so famous for on the territory of Belarus? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Michal Oginsky was a composer, diplomat and politician, a senator of the Russian Empire.  For several years he was actively involved in politics, was the confidant of Alexander I. He created the well-known work "Oginsky Polonaise", and many think that it was written in this estate. </p><p>  In the city of Molodechno, in Belarus, a monument to Mikhail Oginsky was erected, the College of Music bears his name, and there are also several streets in different cities named after him. </p><p>  After the death of Mikhail Oginsky, the estate was inherited by his sons.  But he did not begin to live there, but leased the estate.  Unfortunately, the palace and the park began to gradually collapse, since they were not properly cared for.  Then the estate was inherited by the daughters, and those, in turn, already sold it in parts. </p><p>  During the years of Soviet rule, Zalesye was first used as a holiday home for residents of Minsk.  In 1961, it was transformed into a nursing home, and in 1977 it passed into the possession of a silicate plant, which was planning to create a dispensary here, but since there were no financial resources, this idea was not realized.  Only after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Oginsky Manor became subordinate to the Belarusian Ministry of Culture.  It was then that it was planned to create a museum of <span>Mikhail Kleofas Oginsky</span> in this place <span>,</span> and in the future a school for children.  But to implement the plan was difficult due to the economic crisis in the 90s, but gradually the ideas still began to be implemented. </p><h2>  Exposition </h2><p>  You can see the estate not only from the outside, but also from the inside, looking at the presented expositions.  The entire exhibition is located in 13 rooms, where you can get acquainted with the life and various activities of Mikhail Oginsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, there is an interesting hall in the Oginsky estate in Zalesye called ‚ÄúOginsky Music‚Äù, where musical instruments of the 19th century are presented, or the Zalesye hall where you can get acquainted with the history of this place and the owners of this estate from the Oginsky clan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum Oginsky estate" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/2024970.jpg" width="600"></div>
