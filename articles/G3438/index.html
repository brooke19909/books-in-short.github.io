    <p>  Naturally, for certain entertainments special equipment is necessary.  And the tourist will not carry it with him.  This problem was provided by the hotel administration.  There is equipment rental on site.  You can rent golf clubs and other necessary equipment, use the attributes for water sports, especially for diving.  And this is not the whole inventory that is offered to guests. </p><h2>  Comments </h2><p>  Reviews about Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort Golf 5 are mostly positive.  The hotel is very young, he was only 3 years old, but at the same time he works for a full grade of 5. There are several buildings throughout the institution, each of which has its own characteristics.  The hall of each building is furnished in a modern individual style.  The villas are scattered throughout the complex.  They are small houses with two floors, each has its own small pool.  It all looks very nice, immediately prompts you to think about paradise relaxation.  To get from your house to the center of the complex, where the restaurants are located, you need to travel in tuk-tuk.  It can be ordered by phone and will arrive at the guest within a few minutes. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  All rooms are chic and very spacious.  Usually they have two rooms - a bedroom and a living room.  They are equipped very comfortably, equipped with upholstered and new furniture.  The bathroom deserves special attention, because it is very spacious and made of natural materials (stone, glass and other types of finishes).  The bathroom has a toilet, shower and all other necessary hygiene items.  And also there are sets of wonderful mini-cosmetics, snow-white towels and other bath attributes. </p><p>  Food on the territory of the complex is simply excellent.  A huge amount of fresh exotic fruits and juices are served daily.  For dinner or for dinner, cooks prepare delicious grilled dishes, it can be juicy meat or fresh seafood.  At the request of the client, they can cook something special or exclusive.  You can order some dish that was not presented on the menu or on the buffet.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to stay hungry, because every day an ideal list of dishes is thought out, each guest can fully satisfy their taste. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The sea and the beach deserve special attention.  The entrance to the sea is specially made smooth for the convenience of bathing children.  The water is incredibly clean, although there are quite a lot of people on the beach.  On the territory there are sun loungers, so the guest can quite comfortably settle in.  It will be especially pleasant here to relax with children, the sand is always clean.  The beach has a wonderful restaurant serving a variety of seafood.  There are not many guests here, but you can order any dish from the menu and it will always be prepared.  This approach to each guest is very happy, because you feel the care of the staff on yourself, and this is very important for a good rest.  Seafood is incredibly delicious, and most importantly, all products are spotlessly fresh. </p><p>  It is surprising that there are very few Russian people in the complex.  The main contingent is made up of people of Chinese nationality.  They come in large companies, but there is no noise from them.  The good news is that the complex is quite large, so there is no need to intersect with other hotel guests.  They communicate in their native language, do not understand Russian speech, and you can speak on any topic without any hesitation that someone will hear you. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2>

    <p>  Reviews of Vinpearl Resort Phu Quoc 5 indicate that in addition to a comfortable stay and chic food, the hotel offers guests a good time.  There is a good water park with the necessary slides for children and adults, there are even extreme attractions.  But there are not as many of them as we would like for those who appreciate thrills.  There is no possibility to eat in the water park, therefore, to eat, you need to go beyond it or take some food with you.  In addition to water slides, a safari park is located on the territory, where there are a large number of animals.  The safari area is huge. </p><p>  The service of this institution is at a high level.  The reception is open around the clock.  Housekeeping takes place twice a day.  This item suits guests 100%.  The only thing that upsets the guests is the lack of Russian-speaking staff, and their English leaves much to be desired, but you can explain yourself if you wish. </p><p>  On the territory of the entire complex there are a huge number of small shops where you can buy jewelry.  But, unfortunately, the choice is not so big.  You can buy souvenirs home and much more.  I am glad that the prices here are not high, this once again confirms customer care. </p><p>  The territory of the entire complex is landscaped, there is a huge number of green spaces.  You can observe all kinds of flowers and many other magnificent plants.  Walking around is very nice.  This is a separate town with developed infrastructure and its own unique atmosphere.  Therefore, at least once to visit this hotel is recommended to everyone.  This is truly a paradise vacation that will bring a lot of emotions and memories.  Many guests of the complex visit it annually whenever possible. </p>
