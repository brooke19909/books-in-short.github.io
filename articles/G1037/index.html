Afghan war (1979-1989)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The favorable geographical position and backwardness in the development of Afghanistan always only contributed to the fact that other countries lay claim to the territorial possessions of this state.  Repeatedly, Afghanistan was invaded by enemy troops, there were many wars.  But there is an unprecedented event in this country, when the government of the state personally asked for help from the USSR to eliminate the unfolding civil unrest in the Republic of Afghanistan.  The war, about which there are still different opinions, has begun.  The deployment of Soviet troops only contributed to the development of the conflict with the civilian population, and the confrontation affected the whole world. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  One of the main reasons for the invasion of Soviet troops on the territory of Afghanistan, according to the USSR authorities, was the desire to support the adherents of the socialist concept, who reigned in the dominant posts of the state after the April Revolution, but subsequently experienced strong resistance from the opposition.  A huge number of works have been written about the war in Afghanistan, but many of them contradict each other. </p>

    <p>  However, most researchers agree that the Soviet Union nevertheless decided to take part in the military conflict, because it intended to neutralize the Islamic fundamentalists, who gained strength in this territory after the revolution in Iran in 1979. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  International background </h2><p>  The emergence of the conflict contributed to the ideological mood of the USSR.  Afghanistan, a war in which would have flared up without the invasion of Soviet troops, could inflict a serious blow on the positions of the community, serving as an impetus for the overthrow of the pro-Soviet government.  In addition, the spread of fundamentalism, in addition to destabilizing the political situation, could significantly affect Central Asia.  According to the statements of the USSR, taking part in the military conflict, the state was guided by "proletarian internationalism."  The Politburo, in order to justify its actions to other states, stated that the invasion was due to repeated appeals by the Afghan government for help in the fight against anti-government forces. </p>

    <h2>  How did the war begin? </h2><p>  Much has been said about Afghanistan, but it is difficult to understand what is true and what is false, because any military actions develop under the influence of at least several factors.  The confrontation of 1979-1989 is only one of the <span>stages of the civil war in</span> Afghanistan, during which Soviet troops were present on the territory of the state, seeking to establish peace.  On one side of the barricades were the forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, on the other, armed members of the opposition, known as the Mujahideen, or Dushmans.  The victorious side would gain total control over the entire country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Limited contingent, 40th Army </h2><p>  The common name of all units of the Soviet troops residing in Afghanistan is the Limited contingent, whose main power was the 40th Army.  The last colonel general who led the withdrawal of the army believes that it is impossible to say whether he defeated the Soviet Union in a confrontation or, on the contrary, lost.  It can be clearly stated only that the troops coped with the task assigned to them and were able to return to their homeland.  Before the unification of the 40th Army, several tasks were set.  First of all, Soviet troops on the territory of Afghanistan were supposed to help the country's government stabilize the situation and contribute to ending the war.  This was done mainly through the fight against armed opposition groups.  In addition, Soviet troops in the state were supposed to prevent aggression from other countries.  According to the colonel, the 40th Army completely coped with these tasks. </p>

    <h2>  Confrontation Results </h2><p>  After all Soviet troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan on February 15, the regime of the ruler of Najibullah, adhering to openly pro-Soviet ideas, was overthrown three years later, and he fell only when Russia ceased to support him, that is, in 1992.  Groups of field mujahideen took part in this.  During the war, damage was caused not only to the Republic of Afghanistan.  The war contributed to the consolidation of the positions of Islamic radicals and the creation of the al-Qaeda terrorist group.  They are still initiators of conflicts around the world, especially in Chechnya, Algeria and Egypt. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Afghanistan Chechnya war" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/437404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who went to fight in Afghanistan? </h2><p>  A war always needs soldiers, whether it be a small confrontation or large-scale action on the territory of several states at once.  The Soviet people were of the opinion that eighteen-year-old boys were sent to Afghanistan, who had no choice but to become <span>cannon fodder.</span>  However, this is not quite true.  A large part of the soldiers went to Afghanistan voluntarily: some, deceived by Soviet propaganda, some to go through a real school of life, some to defend their homeland.  There were, of course, those who turned out to be a participant in another‚Äôs war against their will, on the orders of the state, and there were many.  This is not surprising, because the soldiers went to war, to which they actually had no special relationship.  Ideal warriors did this to defend their homeland, to fight for a better future in their state.  For some citizens of the USSR, this was unthinkable and it seemed to them that this was another deception of tyrant-agitators.  However, a large part of the officers and soldiers went to war of their own free will;  some for laurels and fame, some for money, and some just to test yourself. </p>

    <p>  An excellent confirmation of all of the above is also the fact that in the fall of 1988, when many military personnel in Afghanistan expired and they could return home, they did not.  The soldiers themselves proposed to stay for a few more months so that the new arrivals, who had not yet had the appropriate experience, were not killed. </p><h2>  USSR losses </h2><p>  Not without those killed in the republic of Afghanistan.  The 1979 war claimed the lives of many Soviet soldiers.  However, if the annual losses for the USSR reached an average of 1,537 people, the enemy suffered much more.  According to various sources, from 1 million to 1 million 200 thousand people died during the entire campaign.  Of course, one and a half thousand lives is a huge number, but do not forget that the Soviet military had to survive in an unfamiliar area in an unusual climate.  For comparison: for example, 3,677 soldiers died in Iraq, even considering that the advantage in terms of weapons was on the US side. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Many Soviet troops, often still very young, were sent to Afghanistan.  The war needed them, and they failed neither the government nor the fellow citizens.  These are courageous people who managed to defend their homeland, protect their loved ones.  Iran, Afghanistan, Chechnya ... The war does not pass without blood, but the Soviet military managed to do everything that was required of them, having lost a minimum number of lives.  Was the decision of the USSR correct or not, now it is not so important, it is too late to judge about it.  The dead cannot be returned, but the lives of these heroes helped strengthen peace in our country.  After all, this is exactly what they were striving for. </p>
