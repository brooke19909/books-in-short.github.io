In our article we want to talk about one of the hotels on the island‚Äôs northern coast - Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach <span>Agios Nikolaos</span> is located almost in the center of Agios Nicholas.  Getting to the hotel is not difficult, since the nearest airport in Heraklion, Nikos Kazantzakis, is located seventy kilometers away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572841.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex is a series of bungalows built in the usual Cretan style.  Small buildings are tiered and stoned.  The hotel will be a great place for families.  The hotel complex has been operating for a long time, it was built in 1975 and has since been hosting tourists.  The last update of the interiors was made in 2010. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos offers 139 rooms of the following categories: </p><ol><li>  Bungalow garden view has a garden view.  The apartments are equipped with a double bed and extra bed.  This room can accommodate a maximum of three guests.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is about 16 square meters. </li><li>  Bungalow side sea view - rooms with side sea view for three guests.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is also 16 square meters. </li><li>  Superior bungalow side sea view has a side sea view.  Room size is up to 20 square meters. </li><li>  Superior suite side sea view.  These rooms also have a side sea view, but are equipped not only with a double bed, but also with a sofa bed (for two guests).  The apartment has a bedroom and a living area (room area - 32 square meters).  It can comfortably accommodate no more than four guests. </li></ol><p>  All rooms are equipped with individual air conditioning, music channels, satellite TV, wireless internet, hairdryer, safe and balcony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos offers its guests a variety of dining options.  As a rule, people choose half board or All Inclusive.  The food is served as a buffet.  Breakfasts are not very diverse, but there is always a decent choice: omelets, salads, snacks, yogurts, toasts, fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572844.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lunch and dinner offer a greater variety.  A good selection of meat and fish dishes, appetizers, salads, seasonal fruits appears on the tables.  For those tourists who prefer All Inclusive, all drinks during the day are absolutely free.  The hotel has a restaurant and two bars. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos 4 * has an on-site car and motorcycle rental, currency exchange, dry cleaning, laundry, hairdresser, car parking.  There is a mini club for children, there is a playground with carousels and slides, as well as a children's pool.  If necessary, you can order babysitting services. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos (Crete) is not a hotel in which vacationers are offered an incredibly active entertainment program.  However, guests at the hotel can play table tennis, use the gym and water activities on the coast.  In the daytime, tourists are entertained by animators around the pool, and in the evenings, shows are sometimes held. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos 4 * (Greece) is located near the coast.  The nearest beach is 50 meters from the hotel.  However, in this area, on the coast, you can choose any municipal beach.  All of them are equipped with paid sunbeds and umbrellas (5 EUR per day), but many come to relax with their own accessories, so as not to pay money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos crete" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572847.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beaches are sandy.  Small pebbles are found only at the beginning of the coast.  Sunset at sea is very gentle and convenient, there is a sandbank where kids can comfortably flounder, and a little further depth begins, so there is no need to wander for a long time to swim. </p><h2>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos 4 * (Crete): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I definitely want to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to relax in it.  The hotel has an unusual design.  It is built in the form of separate bungalows at different levels.  The hotel territory itself is continuous descents and ascents.  According to guests, it is better to live in those buildings that are closer to the reception and the coast, since it is far difficult to carry suitcases, and there are no devices to overcome the numerous steps with bags.  There are also no ramps for the disabled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos 4 greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572848.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel area is small, but it is very well-groomed and green.  Aloe and other evergreens grow on the flower beds.  The complex offers tourists a variety of rooms.  Among them there are more outdated apartments and renovated.  Furniture is also not new, but in good condition.  Balconies and windows offer beautiful views of the sea (the hotel is located on a mountain). </p><p>  But regarding the cleaning of the opinions of the guests were divided.  Some tourists were lucky, and their rooms were cleaned every day, and in others they were only slightly refreshing.  Moreover, according to guests, the presence of tips does not affect the quality of the procedure.  Apparently, it all depends on the maintenance staff.  Towels and bed linen are changed strictly according to the schedule - once every three days.  Sometimes the staff forgets to report toilet paper or soap, or is mistaken with the number of towels, then you have to remind, and the maids immediately bring what you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos 4 lassithi" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572851.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The employees of Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos 4 * (Lassithi) are pleasant and charming people, sometimes a little scattered and inattentive, but all guests are warm and cordial.  The reception is open around the clock.  In the event that you do not like the number, there is always the opportunity to exchange it for another (unless, of course, there are available apartments). </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel complex has quite good food.  Of course, many vacationers talk about the uniformity of breakfasts, but in general they are the same in all hotels.  But with lunches and dinners all the guests are very satisfied.  The buffet always has a good selection of local and European dishes.  For tourists with All Inclusive, all drinks are offered absolutely free of charge, both alcoholic (of quite acceptable quality) and non-alcoholic.  The local poolside bar serves good cocktails.  Guests who prefer half board can eat at the many nearby restaurants and cafes.  In any institution you can taste excellent seafood dishes. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Ariadne Beach Agios Nikolaos 4 * makes a pretty good impression.  The hotel is located in a good and quiet place, away from the hustle and bustle, but at the same time practically in the very center of the city.  The complex has animation events, but there are not so many, and they are not too active, so no matter what bungalow you live in (even near the pool), it is always quiet and comfortable around, there is no excessive fuss and noise.  In such a hotel it is good to relax with children who need a day's rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariadne beach agios nikolaos 4 crete" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1572850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The recreation area near the pool is quite spacious, and there are always empty seats.  Near the hotel there is a coast with nice beaches.  Vacationers themselves can choose their favorite place and relax on it.  All beaches of the resort are free (except for the cost of sunbeds and umbrellas), and all have a sand cover.  The coast of Crete is an ideal place for kids to relax, so every year an incredible number of couples with children come here.  But for adults on the island there are entertainment. </p><p>  Everyone here can find entertainment to their liking.  Relaxing in Crete, you should definitely see the main attractions, because the island is really rich in beautiful natural and historical places. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that the hotel is an economical vacation spot for unassuming tourists.  If you expect the presence of new apartments and gourmet dishes, then you should look for another complex.  This hotel is designed for the average tourist, for whom additional benefits are not so important.  The main advantage of the hotel is its excellent location and good food.  A close proximity to the sea makes the complex very popular among lovers of budget holidays. </p>
