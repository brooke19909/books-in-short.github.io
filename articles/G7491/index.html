The history and process of the exaltation of the Moscow principality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Until 1263, there was no Moscow principality on the map of feudal and fragmented Russia.  The great Alexander left the legacy of the great Alexander Nevsky, dying, as an inheritance to his two-year-old son Daniel.  The reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality, which at first was small, insignificant, we will cover in the article. </p><h2>  Start </h2><p>  In this remote Middle Ages, when the land suffered under the yoke of the Horde, Vladimir-Suzdal and <span>Novgorod Russia</span> became the center of political life <span>.</span>  In the middle, in a convenient place, lies the Principality of Moscow, which the 14-year-old prince began to control.  The young man cautiously looks at the feuds of neighbors and does not interfere in them.  He pays tribute and lives quietly and peacefully.  Therefore, immigrants from more dangerous places slowly reached the <span>Principality of Moscow</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1354068.jpg" width="600"></div>  People and peace are the first reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality.  In it, economic life began to develop quite intensively.  The prince only at the end of his life's journey decided to annex two new cities to his lands.  Kolomna was needed because it stood on an important place where the Moscow River flowed into the Oka River.  And Pereyaslavl-Zalessky opened the way to the capital city of Vladimir.

    <h2>  XIV century </h2><p>  It was a time of struggle for the establishment and strengthening of Moscow lands.  Prince <span>Yuri Danilovich,</span> having subjugated Mozhaisk, gained control over the entire course of the Moscow River.  This was a very important event for the residents: a new trade route opened.  But at the same time, the struggle begins with the Tver princes for the great reign in Vladimir.  At this time, Vladimir lands joined.  Their area was large, and the entire population paid taxes.  Therefore, the struggle for reign in Vladimir was very serious: Prince Dmitry was killed by Prince Dmitry of Tver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The transformation of the principality into the center of political life </h2><p>  The brother‚Äôs business was continued by Prince Ivan Danilovich, who is better known as Ivan Kalita.  He was a far-sighted and wise ruler who annexed to his lands Veliky Novgorod, Kostroma, Rostov, Torzhok.  Prince Ivan transferred the chair of the metropolitan, the head of the Russian church, from Vladimir to Moscow, having built magnificent Arkhangelsk and Assumption Cathedrals in the Kremlin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1353683.jpg" width="557"></div>  Secular and spiritual power concentrated in one place - these are the reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality in the middle of the XIV century.

    <h2>  Diplomacy of Russian princes </h2><p>  The deeds of the prince were continued by his sons.  Skillfully conducting diplomatic relations with the Horde, they ensured a peaceful life for the entire population, which was not subjected to raids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for strengthening the Moscow principality briefly" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1353686.jpg" width="600"></div>  What are the reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality led him to expansion and wealth?

    <h2>  Disputes of historians </h2><p>  Historians usually name 4 reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality.  They can be summarized as follows: </p><ol><li>  The Principality stood in the very heart of Russian lands.  This favorable geographical position allowed less attack by neighbors: warlike Germans, Lithuanians, Swedes and Tatars.  Thus, his very situation provided residents with security and attracted more and more refugees who strengthened military and economic power. </li><li>  The Principality has become a crossroads of trade routes.  There was a road from the southwest, from Kiev and Chernigov, to Rostov and Yaroslavl.  The waterway along the Moscow River allowed to get to the Oka, and along it to the Volga and get to Nizhny Novgorod.  Merchants traveling along these routes paid taxes enriching the Moscow principality. </li><li>  Diplomatic moves led to the unification of church and secular power.  Thanks to this, the authority and public weight of the principality increased. </li><li>  And the last one.  Peaceful, cautious and persistent activity of the princes.  They did not quarrel among themselves, and also avoided direct clashes with Lithuania and the Horde, ensuring a peaceful life and achieving the goals set step by step. </li></ol><p>  These are the reasons for the strengthening of the Moscow principality in our time. </p>
