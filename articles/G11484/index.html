    <p>  Naturally, most tourists visit Goa to have fun on the beach, because this place is famous for its picturesque coast.  Mandrem's beautiful public beach is just 300 meters away.  A convenient path leads to it, and on the way to the sea you can always enjoy the picturesque scenery or spend a few minutes in a colorful Indian shop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach here is clean, covered with soft sand, which is regularly cleaned.  Nevertheless, special beach shoes will not hurt.  The entrance to the sea is convenient, and the waves are small, and therefore the coast is suitable for swimming.  Since this is a place of public relaxation, you need to pay for the rental of sunbeds, mattresses, umbrellas and towels, although the prices are quite reasonable.  The same applies to water activities, including boating and boat trips, water skiing, scuba diving, etc. </p><h2>  Do guests offer additional services? </h2>
