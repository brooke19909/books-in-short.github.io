    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  Hotel Centara Blue Marine Resort &amp; Spa Phuket receives mostly positive reviews.  People who have been here say that the hotel is quite quiet, since it is located at a fairly large distance from the central noisy streets.  Higher rooms offer chic panoramic views of the surroundings. </p><p>  And the attitude towards the guests is a separate issue.  On an important event for the guest (birthday, for example), he is congratulated - they bring the cake to the room. </p><p>  If you need something, you just need to ask.  Additional shampoos or gels, fresh towels - the request will be fulfilled immediately. </p><p>  And tourists are advised to take rooms with sea views.  Because otherwise, there is a risk of getting apartments whose windows do not open a picturesque panorama, but the corridor of the building located in the neighborhood.  However, all the nuances can be clarified even when drawing up a reservation request. </p><p>  Tourists assure: being here on vacation, you need to enjoy the atmosphere, comfort and delights of the resort.  And the hotel with reasonable prices and decent service will make the pastime even more enjoyable. </p>
