Its harvesting is carried out in early spring, so that it is easily separated from the bark of swollen birch sap.  Given the quality of the material, several types of blanks are distinguished. </p><p>  Plast bark is pieces, layers of birch, which are limited by the circumference of the tree trunk.  It is used for weaving small souvenirs created from a single piece.  With the help of a knife, a neat vertical incision is made so as not to damage the pubic layer.  With a knife-jamb, the edge of the formation is separated from the tree, then it is completely removed.  Dirt and moss are removed from the top. </p><p>  To create large birch bark products, spiral long ribbons are used.  In order for their length to be several meters, several spiral cuts of a certain width need to be made around the trunk, from top to bottom.  The tapes are rolled up, the front part is placed inside, leaving a small hole for ventilation. </p><p>  The most time-consuming process is considered to be the process of preparing a cylinder for weaving tangs.  Not every birch can be used for such purposes.  The trunk should be smooth and clean, free from cracks and sag.  It is sawn off, then knotted sections are removed, and on even places ring cuts are made with dense steel wire. </p><p>  Then the birch bark is pulled off, getting a solid cylindrical billet.  When preparing material for future use, it must be stored in a cool, dry place, avoiding direct sunlight.  In the damp, mold appears on the birch bark, it becomes unsuitable for work. </p>
