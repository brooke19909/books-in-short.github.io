    <h2>  Apartment prices </h2><p>  The cost of housing may depend on several factors.  Not yet fully populated "Count Orlov" (LCD).  The commissioning of some facilities is scheduled for 2017.  Apartments in houses that are under construction are the cheapest.  The price of one square meter in such apartments is 80,000 rubles. </p><p>  Offered apartments with different layouts.  For a finished studio apartment with a total area of ​​32 square meters, you will have to pay 3,200,000 rubles.  For a <span>two-room apartment</span> with an area of ​​about 60 squares, you will need to pay at least 7 million.  Three-room apartments remain the most sought after.  Apartments with a total area of ​​up to 85 squares will cost at least 9 million rubles. </p><p>  On sale there are more overall premises.  Large apartments of an area of ​​200 square meters are less in demand.  Calculating the cost of such housing is quite simple, given that the price per square meter is 120,000 rubles.  People who are ready to pay the full amount immediately receive additional discounts.  And if it is possible to conclude a deal for the purchase of an apartment before the start of construction of the house, the cost of housing will decrease by 30%.  It is no coincidence that many today already planned to move into the new building "Count Orlov" (LCD).  House delivery is scheduled for the second half of 2016, and almost all apartments in them have already been sold out. </p><h2>  What other payment options are offered? </h2><p>  Everyone needs a good living space, but not everyone has the appropriate financial opportunities.  On loyal terms, you can buy real estate in the complex "Count Orlov".  ZhK provides apartments on the terms of a mortgage and by installments.  If the buyer does not have the full amount for the purchase of housing, the developer will be able to meet them.  Installments are provided to those customers who are willing to pay 50% or more of the cost at a time.  Installment periods may depend on the amount deposited, as well as the time remaining until the object is put into operation.  Payments under the contract can be made both monthly and quarterly.  The installment agreement is notarized. </p>

    <p>  The Deferred Payment service is also popular.  It consists in the fact that the developer can conclude a preliminary contract with the buyer, which allows you to not immediately make the full amount for the housing.  This is convenient for those people who sell real estate in order to purchase an apartment in the new line "Graf Orlov" (LCD, St. Petersburg).  There is a nice bonus.  The amount in rubles for apartments is fixed at the time of signing the contract.  The jump in currency is not terrible for the buyer, who made a deal with the developer before the sale of the previous apartment. </p><p>  The construction company appreciates its customers and rewards them for their help.  So, if someone recommends a company to his acquaintance, and he decides to sign a contract for the purchase of real estate, he will be able to earn an additional discount.  So people who act as intermediaries, housing is provided almost half the price. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  Parkings in the residential complex “Graf Orlov” deserve special attention.  Photos of these structures are impressive.  For each apartment there are two parking spaces, given that each tenant will move on his own transport.  Already today, a huge two-story parking lot, designed for 543 places, has been built and partially functioning.  It is heated and guarded around the clock.  Residents do not have to worry about where to leave the car at night. </p><p>  Parking lots in the residential complex “Graf Orlov” are being built using modern building technologies.  The quality and reliability of engineering systems is guaranteed.  Materials used at the construction site are rigorously tested and meet all GOST standards.  The parking project provides for a high-quality ventilation system, as well as a fire extinguishing system.  Additionally there is a place for a guard post. </p><p>  In the residential complex is also planned day parking in the open.  Here, residents and their guests will be able to leave vehicles absolutely free.  On the street, a <span>fencing</span> of 500 cars is planned. </p><h2>  What other facilities does L1 offer? </h2><p>  To date, the construction company is engaged in the construction of other residential complexes in St. Petersburg.  Close attention is drawn to the Imperial facility, located near the Frunzenskaya metro station.  Like LCD "Graf Orlov" (St. Petersburg), the reviews "Imperial" has the most diverse.  However, most successful buyers have a positive opinion about the deal.  The residential complex is represented by houses with different number of storeys.  Here you can purchase housing ranging from 25 to 200 square meters.  The most sought after are two. </p>

    <p>  Great reviews can also be heard about the London Park residential complex, located in the Vyborg district.  Beautiful landscaping, remoteness from the city center, the presence of kindergartens and schools makes London Park the most attractive for young families.  This complex can be called the most environmentally friendly in the entire Northern capital.  Also pleases is a large assortment of apartments at an attractive cost. </p><h2>  LCD "Count Orlov".  Reviews </h2><p>  St. Petersburg is growing every year.  A new generation of young families seeks to live in improved conditions.  Old Khrushchev is not the best option.  Moreover, excellent housing today can be purchased at an attractive price.  It is no coincidence that many of the indigenous inhabitants of St. Petersburg turn their attention to the Count Orlov LCD.  The object's address is St. Petersburg, Moskovsky District, Moskovsky Prospekt, house 181. Just a 10-minute walk are two metro stations at once - Victory Park and Moskovskaya. </p><p>  Until a certain time, the construction of houses in the residential complex progressed very slowly.  Therefore, there are a lot of negative reviews from investors about the company.  People invested money and had no idea when they could move into a new apartment.  Today, the situation has radically changed.  The first houses have already been commissioned, and the happy tenants are not overjoyed by the excellent conditions. </p><p>  Many potential buyers are pleased with the place in which the residential complex is located.  Well-developed infrastructure along with a good environmental situation - what could be better?  LCD "Graf Orlov" - a great place for a measured life of a standard Russian family. </p>
