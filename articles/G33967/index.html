    <h2>  Negative Resort Reviews </h2><p>  The following negative aspects are present in the work of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  most standard rooms with a double bed do not have windows, which is not indicated in the brochures (when checking in and booking, be careful and specify this information in advance); </li><li>  due to the lack of windows in some rooms (or too small), the apartments are very warm and damp, which contributes to the appearance of an unpleasant odor, mold, as well as a huge number of insects; </li><li>  even if you are not satisfied with your number, you will not be able to replace it (reception staff refuse to do this even if a supplement is paid); </li><li>  the apartments are incredibly small - it is impossible to approach the bed from any direction, and there is practically nowhere to put bags, which forces you to use a paid storage room; </li><li>  construction is being carried out literally next to this hotel, which is why the rooms are always noisy and dusty, and around the hotel it is sloppy and dirty; </li><li>  the walls of the rooms are whitewashed with lime, which is why there is a great risk of staining clothes (and especially given the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms); </li><li>  since the water is heated from the sun in the tanks on the roof, you can not count on a hot shower in the early morning or in cloudy weather; </li><li>  Room cleaning is very poor, and bed linen and towels for the entire period of rest never change. </li></ul><p>  This hotel is a rather specific institution.  Special care should be taken when booking a room.  Be sure to check the availability of windows in the apartment.  An undoubted advantage of this hotel can be considered that it is located in a quiet area and is located quite close to the sea. </p>
