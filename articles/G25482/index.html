Not only the price, but also some important characteristics changed in the smartphone. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of the novelty has not undergone any special changes relative to the prototype.  The only thing that has changed in the HTC Desire 626 is its weight and thickness.  The device became slightly thinner and lost a little weight. </p><p>  The device looks pretty stylish.  Among the competitors, the design of the gadget is distinguished by matte plastic, even pleasant in appearance.  Reducing weight to 140 grams significantly affected the usability of the device.  The user can not be afraid that HTC Desire 626 will slip out of hand. </p><p>  An extravaganza of flowers will also please.  The manufacturer has released smartphones in white, blue, dark blue and purple colors.  The number of colors makes the phone stand out among faceless competitors. </p><p>  An interesting arrangement of external elements makes the device more stylish.  So, the front side sheltered the display, camera, speakers, sensors and logo.  Function buttons are on the display.  The main camera, flash and logo are located behind.  The left side has a card slot, and the right side has the usual volume control and a power button.  The top end placed on itself a connector for a headset, and the bottom - a USB input.  Add a twist to the design and painted side panels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, such a bright appearance also has problems.  Due to the use of plastic, the back panel collects prints and small scratches.  The beauty of the device required sacrifice, and the manufacturer made the case inseparable.  Actually, you can forget about replacing the battery. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Equipped smartphone HTC Desire 626 LTE with a diagonal of five inches.  Characteristics resolution has only 1280 by 720, and they are on the verge of acceptable for such a screen.  And so it was a shaky balance.  Looking closely at the display, you can see the pixels, but the situation in this regard is still not critical. </p><p>  The display of HTC Desire 626 shows itself quite well in the sun, and also has a large viewing angle.  Actually, you should not complain about the screen, because HD-quality is already wonderful.  In addition, the owner will not notice a big difference with Full HD. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Surprisingly, photos taken with HTC Desire 626 are lifeless.  Despite the redesigned camera, which now has 13 megapixels, the device does not shine with the brightness and detail of the pictures.  The quality is slightly higher than average.  A similar situation has already occurred in some representatives of the company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When taking a photo in low light, be prepared for the addition of grain and noise to existing problems.  The settings will not help to fix the situation either, they really aren‚Äôt even in the device. </p><p>  The camcorder shows itself a little better.  Recording in HD is pleasant, but it is no longer able to surprise.  Many cheaper devices boast even better quality. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the front camera of HTC Desire 626 turned out to be more successful.  Of course, she did not surpass the main one, but the pictures come out more vivid.  Equipped the front camera with five megapixels and even the ability to record video in HD. </p><p>  Despite the redesigned camera, the changes do not cause much enthusiasm.  Although the characteristics of the predecessor are lower, the quality is almost the same as that of the follower. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The manufacturer definitely decided to save on the HTC Desire 626. The characteristics of the device are impressive, namely eight cores with a performance of 1.7 GHz each.  That's just the MTK processor used significantly worsens the impression.  Undoubtedly, such parameters look great, but Chinese manufacturers have long been making budget smartphones with similar fillings. </p><p>  Two gigabytes of RAM will please more.  Given the price of the device, less was not expected.  The graphics are also answered by the favorite of the Chinese, the Mali video accelerator, but the fresh model - T760MP2. </p><p>  We also increased the device‚Äôs native memory.  In place of 8 GB of the predecessor came as much as 16 GB.  Naturally, it will be available much less, only 9 GB, but this is already not bad.  You can expand the memory using a flash drive up to 32 GB, with a larger volume the smartphone starts to slow down. </p><p>  Characteristics that look great on paper do not do everything in reality.  Although the filling is perfectly controlled with the operation of the interface and applications, there are difficulties with 3D games.  It comes to the fact that the phone just freezes. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  HTC Desire 626 is running under the guidance of the already obsolete Android 4.4.  On top of the system, the company installed its new product - Sense 7 design. The interface has many capabilities and great flexibility.  Although the version of Android is not very fresh, the amazing shell of the company significantly improves the impression. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The noticeable weakness of the Desire 626 is its duration.  Deteriorating position and non-removable battery with a capacity of only 2000 mAh.  Standby mode will allow the phone to live for a day, and constant use shortens the duration to five hours.  Increasing the load to the maximum will further reduce operating time. </p><p>  It is absolutely not clear what the company was trying to achieve by installing an obviously weak battery on a powerful phone.  The user will be forced to get out, reducing the brightness of the screen and disabling unnecessary applications. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the device is definitely overpriced.  You can become the owner of 626 for 17 thousand rubles.  Although the initial price has dropped significantly, the cost is still impressive.  Given that the smartphone is positioned as a budget, in all respects it looks more like a middle class. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  A nice feature was the appearance of HTC Desire 626 Gray.  User reviews note a stylish design and pleasant to the touch plastic. </p><p>  The filling of the device, although not particularly productive, will completely satisfy the needs of most users.  Two gigabytes of RAM and a good processor make the gadget useful in work and entertainment. </p><p>  The shell of the company breathed new life into an outdated Android.  The interface of the 626 model can be considered one of the best among competitors. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The disadvantages of the device are quite noticeable and greatly spoil the impression.  The same camera changes made the smartphone a little more expensive, but in terms of photo quality, no changes happened. </p><p>  A sore spot was the autonomy of the device.  A total of 2000 mAh is not enough for all its needs.  Deteriorating situation and non-removable battery.  The owner of the device becomes very dependent on charging throughout the day. </p><p>  The most unpleasant place is the price of HTC Desire 626 G Dual Sim.  Reviews are full of misunderstanding of the greed of the manufacturer.  Competitors of the company, although they have lower characteristics, are an order of magnitude lower. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Regarding its predecessor, the novelty has become much better, but there are also new disadvantages.  It is absolutely unclear in which segment the device belongs, but it looks alien among state employees and the middle class.  The whole picture was ruined by the incredibly high price of Desire 626. </p>
