This model combines many useful functions and options that turn tedious ironing into a comfortable and simple task.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Model description </h2><p>  <span><span>The body of the iron <span>Philips</span> <span>GC 4425 is plastic, made in white-gray-blue color.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The front of the model is elongated and narrowed.</span></span></span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Philips GC 4425" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/2012247.jpg" width="600"></div>  A transparent cover with a sealant is located above the water filling hole - it prevents splashing out of liquid droplets during ironing.  The hole itself is enlarged in diameter, which allows you to fill the iron directly from the tap, opening a small stream.  The back of the device is expanded.  This allows you to stably place it on the ironing board.  The long three-meter network cable has a swivel mount.  This type of connection prevents the abrasion of the cord, increasing its service life.

    <p>  In this model, the constant steam output is 40 g / min.  This means that for a minute of operation with continuous steam, the iron can consume 40 grams of water.  Steam boost (one-shot at maximum power) equals 100 g / min in this model - 2.5 times more than in constant mode.  This function is used if it is necessary to smooth heavily wrinkled fabric or linen folded in several layers. </p><h2>  Vertical steaming </h2><p>  <span><span><span>According to reviews, many buyers are willing to purchase a Philips</span> <span>GC 4425</span> <span>iron</span> <span>only because of this feature.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Not everyone can afford to buy a steamer (for financial reasons or due to the lack of storage).</span></span></span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Philips GC 4425 Specifications" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/2012253.jpg" width="500"></div>  And it is not necessary to smooth vertically hanging things every day (the function of vertical steaming will be needed in this case - when you need to straighten curtains or a blouse of delicate fabrics).  However, this option also has disadvantages, as evidenced by consumer reviews.  The Philips 4425 iron is rather heavy and massive, and for a long time it is inconvenient to keep it on weight.  Therefore, the option can be useful only if you use it from time to time.

Reviews say it easily smoothes fabric in hard-to-reach places - such as corners of folds, cuffs or collars.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>A lot of this contributes to the presence on the nose of the iron holes for the release of steam.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  User's manual </h2><p>  The instruction manual describes the operating modes of the iron, as well as the care requirements.  Separately, it is possible to note the cleaning of the device from scale. In addition to the built-in cartridge, which operates continuously and does not require replacement, the owners are encouraged to clean with steam every two weeks.  To do this, fill the tank and warm up the Philips GC 4425 iron at maximum temperature. The instruction recommends turning off the device after that and lifting it above the sink, press the Calc-Clean button on the body.  The rust that has accumulated inside the tank will come out with the steam.  If necessary, the cleaning can be repeated.  The procedure is recommended to be carried out monthly, if the hostess uses steaming water from the tap - once every two weeks. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Since the Philips 4425 iron belongs to mid-priced models, there were many who wish to purchase it.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Reviews about this device are more than positive.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Mistresses note that the iron is ironed well and they do not have to drive several times in the same place to straighten the folds.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This is facilitated not only by the quality of the sole cover, but also by the weight of the household appliance.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Not too light so that you do not have to press on it when ironing, but also not so heavy that your hand gets tired of it.</span></span></span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Philips GC 4425 Azur" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2013136.jpg" width="450"></div>
