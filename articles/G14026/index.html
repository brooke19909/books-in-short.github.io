It is not surprising, because these animals are associated with something big, soft and undoubtedly kind.  There are so many toys on the shelves of modern stores that every parent can easily find a suitable factory bear.  But only for mom and dad their child is the most wonderful in the world, and therefore deserves only the best. </p><p>  On the eve of the New Year, when parents are concerned about only one question, how to arrange a real fairy tale for the baby, many try to come up with an original gift.  Quite often, the choice of moms and dads falls on a homemade knitted bear. </p><p>  How to crochet an idea?  You can‚Äôt make it out without instructions.  Therefore, in the article we described in detail the whole process so that even beginner knitters could successfully deal with it. </p><h2>  Which character to stop on? </h2><p>  Many experienced needlewomen joke that it is much easier to realize your idea than to decide how the desired craft will look.  Indeed, if you familiarize yourself with the various master classes and the abundance of photographs presented in the virtual space, it‚Äôs quite easy to get lost. </p><p>  To get the right answer to the question of how to crochet a bear, you need to determine which bear you want to make. </p><p>  After all, the studied animals are presented in different variations: </p><ul><li>  Winnie the Pooh - Western or domestic. </li><li>  Umka. </li><li>  Olympic Brown Bear - 1980. </li><li>  Olympic White Bear 2014. </li><li>  Po - from the cartoon "Kung Fu Panda." </li><li>  Boo from the cartoon "Season of the hunt." </li><li>  Teddy bear. </li><li>  Bear from the movie "Masha and the Bear." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoamigurumi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a bear" class="if uuid-3066128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066128.jpg"></div><h2>  What yarn to use? </h2><p>  You can proceed to the next stage by solving the question posed earlier.  To do this faster, we recommend that you gently ask the baby which character he likes best.  For example, you can offer him to draw a bear.  Although in most cases, mothers already know exactly what character the favorite child is delighted with.  Therefore, you only need to find step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a specific bear crocheted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The description of any craft begins with recommendations for yarn and knitting needles.  Experienced needlewomen advise using a soft and pleasant to the touch knitting thread to realize the idea.  Rigid and prickly is better to refuse immediately.  In addition, it is important to remember that the toy is intended for the baby, who can chew it inadvertently.  Therefore, you should avoid too fluffy and fleecy yarn.  After all, it can get into the eyes.  A knitted bear should bring the child only joy! </p><p>  There can be no recommendations regarding the color of recommendations.  It is only important to be guided by the natural shades of the selected character.  For example, for Umka you can buy textured yarn.  But working with her requires experience and great patience. </p><h2>  How to find a convenient hook? </h2><p>  The next step in describing a crocheted bear involves selecting a tool.  Of course, the needlewoman can use her beloved.  But to make the craft neat and beautiful, it is worth giving preference to the fact that it is slightly thinner than the purchased knitting thread.  It is also important to note that experienced craftswomen advise beginners who are too tight for loops to knitters to prefer a metal hook.  But if the needlewoman, on the contrary, knits too loosely - with large, elongated loops, it makes more sense to consider a wooden one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blogs.yahoo.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bear crochet workshop" class="if uuid-3066141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066141.jpg"></div><p>  Also, regardless of what material the tool is made of, it is more convenient to work with a fairly short hook.  The ideal length is the distance from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What technique to knit? </h2><p>  It is impossible to talk about how to crochet a bear without mentioning the interesting word ‚Äúamigurumi‚Äù.  It should be understood as art that originated in Japan and instantly became popular.  It is in this technique that any toys are made.  Whether it‚Äôs animals, little men, and human-like creatures - funny inanimate objects with faces.  And, of course, it has its own characteristics. </p><p>  Any detail begins with knitting an amigurmi ring, which many professional craftswomen call "magic."  Next, you need to knit in a spiral, that is, without lifting loops.  And after passing three rows, focusing on the instructions, turn the resulting circle.  As a result, the initial thread will be on the wrong side.  But that is not all.  The subsequent rows will have to be formed, moving in the opposite direction, that is, counterclockwise. </p><h2>  What is an amigurmi ring? </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter at all which one you decided to crochet a bear - big or small, sitting or standing, the principle of performing a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù ring should be mastered, and then applied throughout the work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stylesidea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet a bear" class="if uuid-3066131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066131.jpg"></div><p>  However, you should not be afraid, you will not have to perform complex actions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  We take a working thread. </li><li>  Wrap on two fingers. </li><li>  Carefully remove, while it is important not to dissolve the loop.  Otherwise, everything will have to start again. </li><li>  We take a hook and, making columns without a crochet (only 6 pieces), we tie a ‚Äúring‚Äù. </li><li>  We connect the first and last loop of the row. </li></ol><p>  Mission accomplished.  Apparently, there is nothing complicated! </p><h2>  How to crochet a bear? </h2><p>  According to surveys, the most popular toys of the studied category are: </p><ul><li>  Teddy Bear is a mostly gray character with deliberately carelessly sewn patches on the body and head. </li><li>  Bear - the hero of the domestic cartoon about the shy girl Masha. </li></ul><p>  Both options are quite simple and we will describe in detail the whole process.  But first, it must be noted that, by analogy, you can perform other brown or white animals.  It is only necessary to purchase skeins of yarn of suitable colors.  And then proceed to re-study the instructions that tell how to crochet a bear for beginners.  After that, it will be possible to begin the creative process by connecting ingenuity. </p><h2>  Knit Teddy Bear </h2><p>  To bring the idea to life, you need to prepare a filler, a sewing needle with a big eye, a hook and yarn.  Concerning the tool, enough has been said.  But the information about the material is worth adding. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen recommend choosing a mohair, angora or a product of the Turkish brand ‚ÄúKroha Nazar-Rus‚Äù.  However, it is worth considering your own skills and abilities.  If a beginner takes the job, it is better to consider a simpler thread.  Because the proposed yarn allows you to create interesting fluffy textures, but the whole product will have to be knitted almost blindly. </p><p>  It is also important to recall that the instruction on how to crochet a Teddy Bear toy involves preparing skeins of light and dark gray shades, as well as white, black and azure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.websta.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Bear Description" class="if uuid-3066176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066176.jpg"></div><h2>  Head </h2><p>  Knitting this and all subsequent details begins with the amigurumi ring.  After that, we knit according to the instructions: </p><ol><li>  From each loop we knit two new ones. </li><li>  We make an increase through 1 column. </li><li>  From this row to the 7th, we increase the interval between increases to five. </li><li>  The next 5 rows just spiral. </li><li>  We make a decrease after 5 loops. </li><li>  In each next row we decrease the interval. </li><li>  Before knitting 2 loops together through one, we stuff our head. </li><li>  Then we make decreases without gaps. </li><li>  Through the remaining loops we stretch the thread, tighten and tie. </li></ol><h2>  Torso </h2><p>  Recall again: if you want to crochet a polar bear, for example, Umka, you just need to use the appropriate yarn.  You can work according to the description below: </p><ol><li>  We start with the Amigurumi ring. </li><li>  Double the number of loops. </li><li>  We make an increase through one loop. </li><li>  In the following rows, gradually increase the interval to 4 loops. </li><li>  Now we knit 3 rows without changes. </li><li>  We knit a row, making a decrease through 4 loops, then two - in a spiral.  Repeat step 2 times, reducing the interval to two columns. </li><li>  Alternate the decrease and the single crochet column. </li><li>  We stuff the body. </li><li>  Repeat the last two steps of the previous instruction. </li></ol><h2>  Upper paws </h2><p>  We start with the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù ring, double the number of loops, and then: </p><ol><li>  We alternate the column and the increase. </li><li>  We knit without changes. </li><li>  Alternate the column and decrease. </li><li>  We knit 4 rows without changes. </li><li>  We make a decrease after 10 loops. </li><li>  Knit in a spiral. </li><li>  Reduce the spacing to 9 columns. </li><li>  Stuff the paws. </li><li>  We finish by familiar technology. </li></ol><h2>  Lower paws </h2><p>  Many needlewomen in master classes telling about how to make a crocheted bear (large or small) do not provide a description for the lower legs.  Therefore, if you wish, you can connect the four details, guided by the previous instructions. </p><p>  If you want to make a real Teddy bear, you should act differently: </p><ol><li>  We start with the Amigurumi ring. </li><li>  We make increases without gaps. </li><li>  We alternate the column and the increase. </li><li>  Repeat step 2 again. </li><li>  Then we make an increase through 2 columns. </li><li>  We knit 2 rows without changes. </li><li>  We make a decrease through 8 loops. </li><li>  We knit 3 rows in a spiral. </li><li>  From this series, we begin to reduce the interval to one loop. </li><li>  We are finishing work on the familiar technology. </li></ol><h2>  Assembling Teddy Bears </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted bear" class="if uuid-3066121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066121.jpg"></div><p>  Having prepared all the necessary details, we knit a few squares with dark gray yarn and sew, imitating the patches.  We knit two pads on the muzzle, repeating the first five steps from the instructions for the implementation of the upper legs.  Do not forget to make ears: </p><ol><li>  Amigurumi ring. </li><li>  Double loop increase. </li><li>  A series - 1 column and 3 additions. </li><li>  Strapping in a spiral. </li></ol><p>  Then we collect all the details together, embroider the nose and eyes.  The product is ready! </p><h2>  We knit a bear from the cartoon "Masha and the Bear" </h2><p>  As we noted earlier, the second most popular is the domestic cartoon character.  Despite the fact that in the story he cares about the restless girl, many boys adore him.  Therefore, further we will tell you how to crochet a bear from Masha and the Bear. </p><p>  The first step is to prepare a sewing needle, filler, hook, yarn in dark brown, flesh and black.  In this case, it is better to use acrylic, designed specifically for children's knitwear. </p><h2>  Lower legs and torso </h2><p>  Having prepared everything you need and tuned in the right way, we proceed to creativity: </p><ol><li>  We collect a chain of 14 loops. </li><li>  Knit single crochet columns in each loop.  But from the first and last we draw three.  Repeat step 3 times. </li><li>  Four next rows we knit a column in each loop. </li><li>  We divide the part in half - the sock and the place from which the lower leg begins.  In the first part we make reductions, the second - we simply tie. </li><li>  We make a decrease through 3 columns.  In the next row after 2, then after 1, then a series of decreases without intervals. </li><li>  We knit the three remaining loops of the bow as one. </li><li>  We knit a leg in a length of about 13-17 rows. </li><li>  By analogy, we knit the second. </li><li>  And we connect them, forming the body. </li><li>  Double the number of loops. </li><li>  We make an increase through 1 column, in the next row through 2, then after 3. </li><li>  After 8 rows we knit in a spiral. </li><li>  We make a decrease through 4 loops, we knit a row without changes.  Repeat the step, reducing the interval to 1 loop. </li><li>  We knit 3 rows in a spiral. </li><li>  Repeat step 13. </li><li>  We stuff the body. </li><li>  We make decreases without gaps. </li><li>  Pass the thread through the remaining loops, tighten, fasten. </li></ol><h2>  Head </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a cartoon bear" class="if uuid-3066187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066187.jpg"></div><p>  We begin the implementation of this part with an amigurumi ring and double the number of loops, then: </p><ol><li>  We make an increase through 1 column. </li><li>  In each next row we increase the interval.  Maximum - 5 columns. </li><li>  Now 6 rows just knit in a spiral. </li><li>  We make a decrease through 5 columns. </li><li>  In each next row we decrease the interval.  Maximum - 3 columns. </li><li>  We stuff our head. </li><li>  We knit 2 more rows in a spiral and finish according to the technology described earlier. </li></ol><h2>  Upper legs </h2><p>  Many experienced needlewomen, according to the instructions presented, manage to crochet a bear costume for their baby.  This venture is not so impossible.  The only snag is that you have to adjust the size yourself to the child‚Äôs parameters. </p><p>  Although in this case it is not necessary to knit out the muzzle, the tips of the lower and upper legs.  That is, you can take any children's costume as a basis.  So, the task is much easier. </p><p>  If you still want to make a toy, then proceed to the description of the following details: </p><ol><li>  We start with the amigurumi ring and double the number of loops. </li><li>  We make an increase through 1 column. </li><li>  Now we knit 8 rows without changes. </li><li>  Double the number of loops. </li><li>  Repeat step 1. </li><li>  In each next row we increase the interval between increases.  Maximum - 5 columns. </li><li>  We pass to the brown thread. </li><li>  We knit another 4-6 rows in a spiral. </li><li>  Then we begin to reduce the loop.  First, the interval is 5 columns, then gradually reduce it to 1. </li><li>  We stuff our head. </li><li>  Next, we alternate several times a series of continuous decreases and a simple strapping. </li><li>  We tighten the remaining loops, fix the thread. </li></ol><h2>  To summarize </h2><div class="photo" data-original="knitting-life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie Masha and the Bear" class="if uuid-3066192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3066192.jpg"></div><p>  This is so easy enough to fit a large and good-natured character from the movie "Masha and the Bear."  We assemble crocheted parts together as they are ready.  We knit ears and an overlay on a stomach, we embroider a muzzle. </p><p>  If you succeeded, then there will be no problems with Masha‚Äôs implementation.  After all, she fits in the same way.  You just need to pick up yarn and do not forget to knit a scarf and a sundress. </p>
