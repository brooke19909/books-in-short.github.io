This is a new complex with all modern types of tourist service, a first-class level of comfort and a well-developed infrastructure.  We can say that this hotel will satisfy the most demanding customers.  The hotel is a beach hotel, its buildings are on the shore - some are far away, and some are near the sea.  In addition, they are buried in the greenery of the park, which is carefully looked after.  The hotel belongs to the famous Italian line "Domina".  She has her own concept of relaxation, which is not very familiar to this African country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Domina coral bay el sultan 5 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1008244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Charm, as tourists lovingly call it </h2><p>  This Egyptian resort with fantastic coral colors is not only a paradise for divers, but also an ideal place to relax on the beach.  The one who is called the "seal."  That is why not only beach hotels are being built here, but entire cities and palaces for wealthy vacationers.  Such as Domina Coral Bay El Sultan 5 *.  Reviews of this hotel indicate that this is one of the best solutions for tourists who come to Egypt for sea and sun baths. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  When travel companies flew to Sharm, charters to the international airport of this resort arrived from all over Russia.  The average flight time from the central regions of the country was about four and a half hours.  But this is how travelers of package tours arrive.  Independent tourists can fly to Cairo, and from there get to Sharm by internal lines or by buses.  Hotel Domina Coral Bay El Sultan 5 * is located six kilometers from Ras Nazran Airport, but the noise of taking off planes does not bother travelers.  An air-conditioned shuttle bus will take tourists in ten minutes.  The resort center is about four kilometers from the hotel; the same amount is reached to the famous Naama Bay area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Domina coral bay el sultan 5 egypt charm el sheikh" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1008239.jpg" width="600"></div>

Everything is planted with lime, pomegranates, figs - a real oasis in the desert!  Hotel "El Sultan" consists of five beautiful buildings.

And so that tourists can move around the entire territory of the complex, mini-buses and cars run along five routes, like the Thai "tuk-tuk" (here they are called taf-tafami).  They walk every quarter hour.  On the territory of the "Sultan" ply number 4 and 5. Vacationers advise at the reception at the settlement to take a hotel card so as not to get lost.

A safe playground is equipped for children, there is a club for kids.  In the evenings there is a disco, the gambling audience prefers the Aladdin casino, and there is also a real cabaret here - Smaliyas Club.

Animators entertain guests in the afternoon near the pool or on the beach, and in the evenings the shows are held at the Mosaic cafe or at the special Angel venue.  This arena is built so that tables with chairs ledges descend to the stage, and at the top there is a tarpaulin canopy, and not a roof, which saves from stuffiness.  Very beautiful scenery, powerful music and lighting equipment.  Especially praised the show "Elvis is alive", "Cleopatra", as well as "Michael Jackson." </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Guests say that <span>the Domina</span> Coral Bay El Sultan 5 * <span>hotel</span> can boast of its service.  And indeed, the guest service here is at the highest level.  Perhaps, due to Italian management, certain notes of a chic European holiday are felt here.

Photos of guests show us a huge beach - almost two kilometers long!  - and three large pools.  Of course, umbrellas, sunbeds, towels can be used here for free.  Moreover, regardless of whether you are sunbathing at sea or at the pools.  Sunbeds have special visors under which you can hide your head.  In the surf there are special deck chairs.  But there is one thing to keep in mind.  Towels should be returned at the place where they were taken.  The hulls that are closer to the water have their own beaches.  Each of them boasts some kind of feature.  Almost all hotels have pontoons, from which you can admire the coral.  And on the beach of "Sultana" there is a special plot, cleared for children.  On the main coast of the complex there is a special department for people who do not know how to swim, but want to swim in the sea.  On the central pontoon is an indoor pool where diving students are trained.  There are a lot of beautiful fish in the sea.  Tourists complain that they often do not have the opportunity to visit the pools, because they spend hours watching the sea fauna with a mask.  The beaches are open from nine in the morning until six in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Domina coral bay el sultan 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1008248.jpg" width="600"></div>
