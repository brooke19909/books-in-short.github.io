    <h2>  Rest in Phan Thiet </h2><p>  This resort is rightfully considered one of the best in Vietnam.  On its coast, drowning in vegetation, problems and city bustle are easily forgotten.  The coastline stretches from Phan Thiet to the <span>Mui Ne</span> Peninsula and is more than twenty kilometers long.  And along the sea, a chain of hotels are located, which are mainly of a three- or four-star level. </p><p>  It is not only quiet, but also safe, especially for children.  Fine golden sand with a gentle entrance create excellent conditions for relaxation.  And thanks to the sand dunes and peninsulas overlooking the sea, Phan Thiet has its own special microclimate.  Here the weather is good all year round, and rains are extremely rare.  The exceptions are July and August. </p><h2>  Phan Thiet Hotels </h2><p>  Almost all the hotels located on the first line have not only territory fenced off from the outside world, but also private beaches equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds, which are issued to residents free of charge.  Each hotel is distinguished by its architectural features and landscape design.  Most of them are built on the principle of a villa or a bungalow, although sometimes there are hull buildings, however, no higher than three floors.  All hotels are buried in thickets of coconut palms, pines and tropical vegetation, allowing tourists to forget about the outside world and enjoy their vacation in isolation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiore healthy resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1076812.jpg" width="600"></div>
