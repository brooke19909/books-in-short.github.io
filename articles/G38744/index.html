    <h2>  Creation Background </h2><p>  Hungarians very reverently honor the traditions of their native land.  The monument to Istvan I - the saint and the first king, who became almost the first full-fledged ruler of the country, means a lot to them. </p><p>  The local cathedral is also dedicated to government officials whose hands created the foundation for development.  It was here that they twice married Matyash the Saint, and also crowned the heads of the country, the ruling already closer to our time.  In addition, Franz Joseph I and his wife Elizabeth came here for ceremonies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Once there was a temple, whose patron saint was the Virgin Mary, but over time it was destroyed by the Mongol-Tatars.  After this, Istvan the Great laid down his church, which Bela IV restored after him, when the country was liberated in 1270.  Under Matyash Korvin, the state strengthened, so his church became the main Catholic church in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Occurrence </h2><p>  How did the Fisherman's Bastion (Budapest) come about?  Its history in the 19th century began to unfold at the height of the Buda hill and is not as long as that of many other architectural structures in Europe.  So this place is sometimes called a remake, like many of the local attractions such as <span>Vaidakhunyad Castle.</span> </p><p>  The creation of this attraction was timed to coincide with the 1000th anniversary of the formation of Hungary, which took place in the century before last.  However, the work was not completed by the right time, so the delivery time was shifted to 1905. </p><p>  A few centuries before the opening, the Fisherman's Bastion had a completely different look.  There was a square that was surrounded by a high fortress from different sides.  The fisherman's bastion got its name due to the fact that the main product that was traded here was a catch from local waters.  In exchange for permission to trade here, city guests had to defend the settlement in the event of a military threat that could approach the fortress.  The fishing bastion was gradually losing its attractiveness, as the walls were dilapidated, trade was no longer so lively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When reconstruction was carried out in the Royal Palace, they also decided to pay attention to this place.  We used it for completely different purposes, but the familiar name has not gone out of use.  Its name sounds rather formidable and powerful, but the Fisherman's Bastion was not used for military purposes.  The photos show that this is a pretty picturesque building, the main purpose of which was to complement the Matthias Church within the framework of a single architectural composition.  It has been dealing with it for more than a century. </p>

    <h2>  Structure </h2><p>  Once in this city, you probably want to visit the Fisherman's Bastion.  How to get there  You need to follow to pl.  Holy Trinity.  Both this building and the church were updated by an architect named F. Shulek.  He worked on all the designs for these buildings that now adorn Budapest. </p><p>  The fisherman's bastion, whose photos give only a distant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe power and scale of the building, is a gallery, 8 meters wide.  The total length is 140 m. The temple is in the center of the composition.  Here you can see seven towers of a conical shape of a tent-like type.  These are the symbols of various tribes that united centuries ago into a single state - Hungary. </p><p>  When the Second World War was in full swing, this building was seriously damaged by bombs being dropped on the city.  After that, it was necessary to carry out the reconstruction, which Janos Shulek, the son of the very architect who built this attraction, took up.  The bastion of its kind has become their family affair and responsibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Recent improvements </h2><p>  Also, restoration work was carried out in the 80s.  20th century.  The reason for the beginning of these changes lies in the gray color of the walls, which is not natural.  This is due to the fact that the air is polluted, it contains a large amount of poisonous gases that spoil even the structure, not to mention human health. </p><p>  Moreover, many statues that had to be repaired or altered altogether collapsed.  When all operations to restore the architectural monument were completed, it became part of the heritage of the UNESCO World Foundation, as well as the Buda Palace. </p><h2>  Ruler Monument </h2><p>  Tourists will be very interested in the monument located here, erected in honor of the first king of Hungary - St. Stephen.  The author of the sculpture is Strobl. </p><p>  This is a magnificent statue of a rider on a horse, towering on a massive pedestal.  Stepping closer, you can see the charming bas-reliefs, representing various events from the life path of the ruler.  There is his coronation, the beginning of the construction of the temple and much more.  This beautiful attraction was established in 1906. </p>
