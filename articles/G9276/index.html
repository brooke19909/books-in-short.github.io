She is a very well-developed discipline.  It should be noted that in this case everything is connected, and it is pedagogy that plays a large role in preparing the future generation.  Its subject and functions are also interconnected.  There are two directions, each of which has three levels.  Each of them has its own characteristics.  So, the theoretical function is implemented at the descriptive, diagnostic and prognostic levels.  She is engaged in the preparation of the test material.  The technological function has the following levels: design, transformative and reflective.  She is engaged in the implementation of best practices.

The purpose of such actions is to change behavior, activities and attitudes towards something or someone.  Here you need to give an interesting answer.  We remind that the subject of pedagogy is precisely the process of education.  Therefore, there is a study of many aspects of educational activity.  So, for example, we can say that deviant behavior is the subject of pedagogy.  And that will be absolutely true.  Moreover, it should be borne in mind that not only ordinary people are studied, but also the researchers and educators themselves.  So, the thesis that the subject of pedagogy is the psychology of the teacher is also absolutely true.  It should be understood that this discipline is inseparable from other sciences about man.  Therefore, there is a constant accumulation of new knowledge, experience, work skills and so on.

    <h2>  What does pedagogy do? </h2><p>  In order to get an answer to this question, you should remember what directions it has.  The foundation for this discipline is philosophy.  It is complemented by a history of education.  This is followed by general pedagogy, which deals with theoretical foundations, didactics and school studies.  It is taught at universities for the overall development of man.  Then, in order of complexity, there is age-related pedagogy.  They are engaged in pre-school education, school, vocational and higher educational institutions.  To solve the problems of upbringing and assisting society, social pedagogy is applied.  She is engaged in families, re-education of violators, prepares for training and memorizing data, and also teaches a person how to present themselves.  In addition, there is also special pedagogy.  She deals with especially difficult cases, for example, teaching dumb or children with developmental problems. </p><h2>  International Relations </h2>

As you can see, this is a real complex of sciences.  And all this is aimed at raising a person in whom society is interested.  Moreover, it should be noted that they operate in close interpenetration, and it is often possible to observe a situation where the boundaries between the sciences are erased and it is not possible to determine which discipline belongs.

    <h2>  Practical application </h2><p>  When can pedagogy be useful?  This will seem surprising to many, but it is used not only and not so much in schools, vocational schools and universities.  Since education is the subject of pedagogy, it is also used in various organizations.  An example is an enterprise.  The owner of the company is interested in ensuring that it works with maximum efficiency, and for this it is necessary to take care that there are no problems within the team.  To do this, he hires a manager with a pedagogical talent who can find an approach to any person and solve a problem before it has time to escalate significantly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

True, it must be remembered that knowledge alone, without their practical application, <strong></strong>  have little value.  But it is necessary to have a certain framework.  So, for example, many believe that one should not strive to become a skilled manipulator.  Learning to defend oneself from them is a good thing.  But it is necessary to act within the framework of the rational, and if power over a person falls into the hands, do not abuse it.
