Several techniques can be used at the same time, then the product will gain the necessary accents and the baby will definitely like it. </p><h2>  DIY manufacturing requirements for slippers for children </h2><p>  So that the product in the process of wearing does not bring discomfort and harm to the child, it is worth following these recommendations: </p><ul><li>  The materials from which you make children's slippers should be natural and pleasant to the touch. </li><li>  In the manufacturing process, avoid the formation of large nodes and overlays of the material.  Such elements may crush or rub. </li><li>  The sizes should correspond to the parameters of the baby's legs, so as not to harm the forming foot. </li><li>  It is necessary to take into account the age features and possibilities of the crumbs when choosing a design. </li></ul><p>  If you take into account all the nuances and follow the recommendations, the product will turn out not only beautiful, but also high-quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers Bunnies made of fur" class="if uuid-2686154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2686154.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits of Animal Slippers </h2><p>  Children are usually very difficult to teach to use shoes that should be worn indoors.  This is especially true for slippers.  If you create slippers "Bunnies", then you can get several advantages at once (compared to classic room shoes): </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  An original design that no one else will recreate. </li><li>  Children are happy to wear products in the form of animals at home. </li><li>  For manufacturing, you can use leftover materials. </li></ol><p>  The list goes on, as hand made is very popular among all masses of the population. </p><h2>  How to knit slippers in the <span>form of a hare with</span> knitting needles? </h2><p>  The easiest way to make warm and comfortable slippers "Bunnies" is to knit the product on the knitting needles.  The desired color scheme and type of yarn are selected.  For children, it is better to use acrylic, as this yarn does not "bite", pleasant to the touch, worn for a long time, easy to care for.  For warmer options, it is worth choosing acrylic with a certain percentage of wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet slippers" class="if uuid-2680464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2680464.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest option for making slippers in the form of bunnies: </p><ol><li>  From a yarn, knit a rectangle, the dimensions of which depend on the parameters of the crumbs leg.  Hosiery is used: one side is knitted with facial loops, and the other is purl. </li><li>  The side knitted with purl loops in the work is defined as the front, therefore all knots and seams will be made from the side of the front loop. </li><li>  Fold the rectangle in half and sew one side (the width of the resulting figure), forming a heel. </li><li>  Measure from the free edge towards the heel about 12 centimeters.  You can mark the place with threading.  Mark the middle of the free side (which is not stitched), located opposite the finished heel.  You should get an isosceles triangle. </li><li>  Starting from the bottom top, flash the thread that remains from knitting, the fabric to the highest peak, and about it to the last.  A basting seam is used, the thread is not fixed by knots. </li><li>  Pull the thread evenly, pulling it on both sides.  The thread after tightening is knotted inside the work.  The ears of a hare and a muzzle are formed. </li><li>  The muzzle is a place where in the future will be placed the fingers of the child.  The face of the face should be embroidered with contrasting threads for the main product. </li><li>  On the heel, you can fix the tail, which is a regular pompom from threads. </li></ol><p>  To form a stiff foot, you can put a dense insole inside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unique Crochet Hare Slippers </h2><p>  The principle of how to create <span>crochet ‚ÄúBunnies‚Äù</span> slippers is practically no different from how ordinary socks fit with this tool.  The only difference is the finish of the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted bunny slippers" class="if uuid-2680365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2680365.jpg"></div><p>  The algorithm for creating slippers in the form of a hare: </p><ol><li>  Crochet the easiest sock or track. </li><li>  From the remnants of yarn, knit two strips of width 6-8 loops.  These are future ears.  The length should be short so that the ears are stable.  At the end of the strip, it is worth rounding the ends, removing 2 loops in each row from the sides. </li><li>  Sew these 2 strips to the slippers. </li><li>  Muzzle is better to embroider. </li><li>  Attach a pompom tail on the heel. </li></ol><p>  Along the sock, you can embroider the legs with a contrasting thread, as if the animal is sitting, holding its limbs under itself. </p><h2>  The principle of tailoring slippers-hares of felt </h2><p>  If knitted slippers are usually low, then high boots can be sewn from textiles.  Hare ears are sewn to the lower leg, due to which an original design is created.  The ideal textile for indoor slippers will be felt, which has a lot of advantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing felt slippers" class="if uuid-2680448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2680448.jpg"></div><p>  Pattern slippers <span>"Bunnies" of felt</span> is done like this: </p><ul><li>  Unfold the canvas and transfer the parameters of the child‚Äôs legs to the fabric using a ruler and crayon. </li><li>  If there is no artistic talent, then you can remove the insole from the crumbs shoes and circle it like a stencil. </li><li>  There should be 4 such details: two of felt - left and right, and 2 of dense fabric, which will serve as a lining.  Subsequently, all details are duplicated by the lining fabric. </li><li>  It is necessary to cut out two rectangles that have the height desired for the finished product and the width determined by the circumference of the calf muscle of the child. </li></ul><p>  Next, a pattern of the main surface is prepared.  The principle of its formation: </p><ul><li>  The upper part consists of 2 main parts.  Additionally, the lower leg can be formed to make the slippers high. </li><li>  The simplest top pattern for beginners can be performed as follows.  Cut oval.  Its size should be 2 times larger than the finished foot pattern.  In the middle of the oval, cut another oval, which will correspond to the parameters of the lower leg along the circumference.  Cutout closer to some edge. </li><li>  A large oval must be sewn to the foot pattern.  In the process of sewing the top of the slippers to the foot, it is worthwhile to overlay the fabric. </li><li>  You can cut the oval into two halves to make it easier to fit the size of the slipper under the leg. </li><li>  Ears cut from felt.  To make them stand, you can insert something solid into them, such as cardboard.  Ready-made ears need to be sewn on the sides of the lower leg at the very top. </li><li>  At the back of the boot, where there will be a heel, you can sew on a felt pompom stuffed with cotton. </li></ul><p>  Other types of finishes are made at the request of the needlewoman. </p><h2>  How to make an interesting design for children out of the simplest slippers? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.brit.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finishing bought slippers" class="if uuid-2680424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2680424.jpg"></div><p>  Any children's slippers can be transformed, showing a little imagination.  You need to buy slippers that are as simple as possible in terms of color and design.  Further, a matter of technology. </p><p>  Making slippers "Bunnies": a master class on transformation: </p><ol><li>  Remove all decorative elements (if any) from the surface of the purchased slippers. </li><li>  Sew small ears from the fabric that is most suitable in color to the material of the slippers purchased. </li><li>  Sew finished items to the product. </li><li>  The muzzle can be embroidered with thread. </li><li>  To give shape, you can sew a satin ribbon bow, hat, panama between your ears. </li></ol><p>  If the surface of the slippers allows, the shape can be made by pulling the surface of the material with threads from the inside.  This technique is used in the process of making faces of dolls from nylon tights. </p><h2>  Using several techniques in the manufacturing process of slippers </h2><p>  It is difficult for a real needlewoman to dwell on a specific technique.  Slippers "Bunnies" with their own hands can be made using several crafts in the same work.  When choosing a material and techniques, the ratio of fabrics and the features of their combinations should be taken into account. </p><p>  Knitting and crocheting combined without any problems.  It is important that the thickness and texture of the threads match.  It is necessary to observe the density of knitting. </p><p>  The felt elements of the decor fit perfectly into the design of the knitted base of slippers.  It is worth choosing the color gamut and thickness of the materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hooksandthread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="possible product finish" class="if uuid-2680370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2680370.jpg"></div><h2>  Possible finishes for finished products </h2><p>  It is important not only to carefully make "Bunnies" slippers, but also to beautifully decorate the finished product.  Additionally, lace, sequins, satin ribbons can be used.  Stripes and inserts can be made of contrasting material (spoilage, tulle, mesh, satin). </p><p>  Crochet slippers "Hare" can be embroidered with thread for knitting.  Beads and beads can be used to form decorative elements.  A product knitted or sewn from textile can be decorated in the same way. </p><p>  Within one product, several types of decoration can be used. </p>
