You can even replace standard applications.  Don't like the built-in camera?  It is possible to choose another, much better.  But what is the best camera for Android?

    <h2>  Google Camera </h2><p>  First of all, do not immediately brush aside what the system offers by default.  Who said Google‚Äôs camera isn‚Äôt the best camera for Android?  It provides many useful features. </p><p>  Here is some of them: </p><ul><li>  Panorama shooting, as well as wide-angle; </li><li>  focusing, the effect of professional photographic equipment; </li><li>  timer; </li><li>  HDR effect; </li><li>  the ability to shoot high-quality video; </li><li>  high viewfinder expansion + no cropping. </li></ul><p>  And, of course, do not forget that this is absolutely the best free application - a camera for Android.  It does not even need to be downloaded. </p><h2>  Camera Zoom FX </h2><p>  Camera Zoom FX ("Camera Zoom EFIX") is an application from a foreign developer without Russification.  Despite the fact that the program does not belong to those that improve the quality of shooting, it can be used not only as a camera, but also as a photo editor.  Its main advantage is expressed in the name of the application itself - zoom, which allows you to enlarge the image by six times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best camera app for android" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36882/1160302.jpg" width="600"></div>

This circumstance makes the application an excellent application for creating beautiful pictures.  Many will say that this is the best camera for Android, and many will agree with this statement. </p><h2>  Camera FV-5 </h2><p>  The very successful development of Camera FV-5 ("Camera EfVe-5") has an impressive number of features, and in order not to rant in vain, we immediately proceed to list them: </p><ul><li>  the interface is designed in such a way that all important parameters are always at hand; </li><li>  uninterrupted operation in the normal and <span>background mode,</span> during the shooting and processing of already shot frames; </li><li>  many user settings with the ability to save them; </li><li>  work with metadata; </li><li>  timer; </li><li>  support not only the usual <span>JPEG</span> image <span>format,</span> but also the format of professional cameras - RAW and PNG;  the latter two allow the subsequent processing of personnel without loss of quality; </li><li>  Possibility of adjusting exposure up to one minute. </li></ul><p>  Everything else, this camera is Russified. </p><h2>  Camera MX </h2>

Perhaps this is precisely why users believe that if this is not the best camera for Android, then definitely one of them.  The number of downloads on Google Play only confirms this conjecture.  The latest update of the program has an amazing feature - now with this camera you can take so-called live pictures.  The bottom line is that in addition to the frame itself, a few seconds will now be saved in memory before it was made.  It is possible to view the animation in full or cut out one or another successful image from it.

Anyway, the program inspires confidence only because it is one of the most popular products on the market, and this is not just that.  She really deserves such an assessment. </p><h2>  Camera 360 Ultimate </h2><p>  The case when the name speaks for itself.  If you need a program in which there will be countless different effects - from color accents to focusing on any object of the photo, then Camera 360 Ultimate (‚ÄúCamera 360 Ultimate‚Äù) is the very best camera for Android. </p><p>  "What is the best photo?"  - This question will become very relevant from the moment the application is installed, because all the frames are excellent.

    <h2>  Vsco cam </h2><p>  You could not hear about the VSCO Cam.  In popularity, she surpassed even the famous "Retrik", which had to step aside to give way to a new star.  VSCO Cam will appeal to instagrammers and bloggers, Tumblr aesthetics and just people who appreciate beautiful shots.  It is difficult to say how the developer achieved this, but it is a fact - the pictures are literally transformed using this application.  Become more elegant and refined. </p><p>  Editing with VSCO Cam is also possible, and with permanent success.  The interface and functionality of this application in terms of processing the resulting frames significantly surpasses similar programs.  And the result can be called almost professional.  Even if you have an inexpensive Android with a good camera, the VSCO Cam will make it even better. </p><h2>  Manual camera </h2><p>  It‚Äôs impossible to get off with little blood.  Perhaps this is how the motto of this application might sound.  In a good sense.  Manual Camera ("Manual Camera") is not suitable for beginners - unless they decide to start immediately with heavy artillery.  But real pros will be delighted with the program.  If you already have a <span>phone with a good camera, the</span> Android application will only improve it.  For this, various settings, parameters and adjustments are provided, for which it refers directly to the Camera2 API, so there is no shortage of them.  The developers tried to make a product for the masters, to give them scope, without limiting the imagination of the geniuses of photographs in anything - and, I must say, they got it one hundred percent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camera for android which is better" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36882/1160299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, Manual Camera has a peculiar drawback that arises directly from the merits.  It is too good and therefore works only with the latest versions of the Android operating system. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Choosing a camera is not so difficult, but not an easy task.  The best camera for Android in the end, everyone has their own.  The choice directly depends on what the user himself understands by this characteristic, what he wants from the application, what he expects, is there a budget model or an Android smartphone with a good camera. </p><p>  Beginners and professionals can choose completely different products, everyone will turn out to be right, everyone will get wonderful pictures.  You need to focus on the description, reviews and your own preferences. </p>
