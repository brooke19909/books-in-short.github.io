However, the old problems are still relevant.  For example, as a result of a software malfunction or careless action, correspondence may be deleted.  How to recover messages in Vatsap in this case? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted messages in vatsap" class="if uuid-3157797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157797.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, you must perform some complex actions that do not always lead to a positive result. </p><h2>  When can a WhatsApp chat be deleted? </h2><p>  Most often, the WhatsApp chat history disappears after an accidental deletion (instead of ‚ÄúAdd message‚Äù you clicked on the ‚ÄúDelete chat‚Äù button).  This often happens not because of the fault of the user, but because of the inconvenience of the touch screen.  In addition, this can happen for the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  after reinstalling the phone: all data stored in the internal memory is irretrievably lost. </li><li>  after changing the phone: you must reinstall messenger, as a result all messages will be lost. </li></ul><h2>  The main ways to restore WhatsApp chats in Android </h2><p>  How to recover deleted messages in Vatsap?  This can be done in one of three ways: </p><ul><li>  through backup from Google drive; </li><li>  through the EaseUS data recovery wizard; </li><li>  through special recovery programs. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="thefanmanshow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recover whatsapp android messages" class="if uuid-3157798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157798.jpg"></div><h2>  How to recover deleted messages in Vatsap in Android: standard way </h2><p>  Fortunately, all WhatsApp chats are securely backed up.  Such duplicates are made automatically on the phone: every day and on a schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps the easiest way to get old messages is to uninstall WhatsApp and reinstall it.  After specifying the confirmation number, you will be prompted to restore the backup duplicate from the Google Drive or import a separate file containing the message history. </p><h2>  Recover messages using Google Drive </h2><p>  How to recover Vatsap messages in Android using a cloud service?  After the first launch, WhatsApp suggests enabling data backup in the Google Drive cloud.  Accordingly, the simplest and most obvious way to restore chat is from a file stored in Google Drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.valuewalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted messages in whatsapp android" class="if uuid-3157801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157801.jpg"></div><h2>  How to restore correspondence from a backup duplicate of Google Drive </h2><p>  After installing the WhatsApp application, open the messenger and indicate your phone number (which you used before).  Select the desired item in the "Restore chat history" window and click the "restore" button. </p><h2>  If this does not work </h2><p>  If you were unable to find the backup, messages will not be restored.  This could happen for one of the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  You are logged in to a different Google Account (not the one you used before on Whatsapp). </li><li>  You have indicated a phone number that was not previously used in the messenger. </li><li>  The memory card is damaged or has errors (or the Vatsap message file cannot be opened). </li><li>  There are no message backups on the memory card. </li><li>  Recovery from a local file </li></ul><p>  Is it possible to recover deleted messages in Vatsap without a cloud?  If you haven‚Äôt connected your Google Drive account to WhatsApp, there‚Äôs another way - to restore chat from a local file. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore chats in vatsap" class="if uuid-3157804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157804.jpg"></div><p>  Backups of chat files are stored in / sdcard / WhatsApp /.  If you cannot find them, check the internal memory of the phone.  If they are not there, you may have deleted them.  In this case, another method will help, which is described below. </p><p>  Remember that Google Drive only copies the latest chat version, while your phone stores WhatsApp data for the last seven days. </p><h2>  How to get the remote chat history of Vatsap from a local file? </h2><p>  Install a file manager, for example, ES Explorer or TotalCMD.  Open the folder along the sdcard / WhatsApp / Databases route.  All chat backups are stored there.  If there are no files, check also the main storage. </p><p>  Select the file you want to restore from the list (its format should look like msgstore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt12).  Rename it to msgstore.db.crypt12. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aljazeera.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover messages in vatsap on iphone" class="if uuid-3157802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157802.jpg"></div><p>  Uninstall WhatsApp from your phone (if installed) and reinstall it by downloading the latest version from Google Play.  Specify the phone number that you used during installation.  In the "Restore chat history" window, click "restore" to import old conversations and return to deleted messages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Using the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard </h2><p>  If the backups were saved on the computer, you can use any software to receive deleted Vatsap messages.  For example, the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard is suitable for this.  Theoretically, you can restore backups using the deep scan option.  Nevertheless, the chances are high only if duplicates really exist, and not much time has passed since they were deleted. </p><h2>  Recover old messages </h2><p>  How to recover messages in Vatsap after deletion if a lot of time has passed?  This is done in EaseUS as follows. </p><p>  Select the drive where the backup duplicates are stored.  Click Scan and wait for the scan to complete.  Sort the files by their type and restore them to disk using the Recover command. </p><p>  It is worth noting that there is a free alternative to EaseUS - Recuva.  The functionality of this service is exactly the same, but there is no Russian-language interface in it. </p><h2>  Using a special service to restore conversations from a smartphone‚Äôs memory </h2><p>  How to recover messages in Vatsap using such services?  If backup copies of correspondence are stored in the device‚Äôs internal memory, try searching through a special application.  The program scans the phone‚Äôs memory and extracts all the files that it can access.  This requires root access (superuser rights). </p><div class="photo" data-original="tech.froodl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover messages in vatsap after deletion" class="if uuid-3157803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157803.jpg"></div><p>  Some manuals say that programs help you find call history in the messenger.  This is actually not the case.  All this application can do is recover lost backup files that have been deleted by the user. </p><p>  An alternative Whatsapp chat recovery tool is DiskDigger for Android.  It scans the SD card and internal memory.  The application is best suited for recovering photos and videos, but it can also find user-specific Vatsap files. </p><h2>  Recover conversations from WhatsApp backup in iCloud </h2><p>  How to recover messages in Vatsap on an iPhone?  WhatsApp will not store your daily data on its servers, so it will not help you recover deleted messages.  However, it allows you to back up chat history and media files in iCloud with the appropriate settings. </p><p>  Make sure you back up WhatsApp messages in iCloud.  To verify this, simply go to WhatsApp -&gt; settings -&gt; chats -&gt; backup. </p><p>  Remove Vatsap and confirm your phone number after a new installation of the application from the store.  You will then see a welcome notice prompting you to restore your chat history.  Just click on the appropriate menu item and you will receive your deleted messages back after the recovery process is completed. </p><h2>  Recovery without backup </h2><p>  How to recover messages in Vatsap without duplicates?  If you don‚Äôt back up your device to iTunes regularly or if you weren‚Äôt able to activate this feature automatically in iCloud, returning old conversations can be more difficult.  In this situation, you will need third-party data recovery software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thehacktoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to recover deleted messages in vatsap" class="if uuid-3157800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3157800.jpg"></div><p>  So, iMyFone D-Back is a powerful tool for recovering deleted information, including from instant messengers.  To get a positive effect, stop using your iPhone as soon as you delete messages.  Otherwise, all WhatsApp erased chats will be overwritten, and they will not be able to return. </p><p>  The service recovers text and sound messages, photos and videos in Vatsap.  In addition to the data of this application, it supports other types of files.  You can recover deleted Viber messages, photos, text messages and notes on iPhone. </p><p>  The program allows users to view WhatsApp correspondence before recovery, so you can selectively recover the data you need.  The service supports retrieving information from WhatsApp from the iPhone and backing up without overwriting the current data on the device. </p><h2>  How to use this program? </h2><p>  How to recover messages in Vatsap using this service?  Download and install iMyFone D-Back on your computer.  Do not worry, the download is completely safe. </p><p>  Press the start button to enter smart recovery mode.  Then select a data loss method.  It is best to dwell on the item "Lost or destroyed by accident." </p><p>  If you decide to recover data from your iOS device, you may need to connect your iPhone to your computer, and the software will scan your device before downloading.  Once it is recognized, you can click the "Next" button to continue. </p><p>  If you decide to restore chats from iTunes backup, select one appropriate backup file, which may contain lost WhatsApp messages. </p><p>  If you decide to use iCloud, you need to log in to your account before starting.  The program will not save your login information. </p><p>  You will then be asked to select the types of data that you want to restore from the list of files.  Here you need to select WhatsApp.  Click "Next", and then the program will begin scanning your iPhone. </p><p>  When the scan ends, you can look at the data to find exactly the Vatsap correspondence that you want to return.  Select the desired messages and click the "Restore" button.  Select the desired route, and the lost WhatsApp correspondence will begin to be restored to the designated folder. </p>
