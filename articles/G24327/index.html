    <h2>  Day of love, family and fidelity </h2><p>  Today, tourists know Murom largely thanks to Saints Peter and Fevronia, who have long become symbols of a happy family life.  According to legend, Peter won the battle of a fiery beast, but the monster's blood got on his body, which caused terrible leprosy.  No one could cure the disease. </p><p>  Once a brave young man had a dream that Fevronia, the daughter of a flight attendant, could help him.  The virgin in return asked to marry her, the future prince agreed.  After healing, Peter did not keep his promise, because the bride was ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù.  However, Fevronia envisioned such an outcome - the girl left one wound on her body, due to which the disease began to spread again.  After the second attempt, the young married, but the boyars did not want to accept the princess. </p><p>  Then Peter and Fevronia left their hometown.  After their departure, the struggle for the throne began, in this troubled time, many people died due to the thirst for power.  Nobles had to ask the princes for return.  Until the end of their <span>life, Peter and Fevronia</span> were together and died at the same time and day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the relics of the saints are in the Holy Trinity Monastery.  Since 2008, Russia has celebrated July 8 as Family Day, whose patrons are Peter and Fevronia.  Husbands and wives come to Murom to ask for happiness and future offspring, and grooms and brides are married here.  If you plan to visit this wonderful city, then you should learn as much as possible about the Murom hotels. </p><p>  The tourism industry is well developed here, therefore, problems with housing or food should not arise.  Of course, it is impossible to see all the sights in one day, which means that you should take care of the reservation in advance. </p><h2>  In the center of city life </h2><p>  Hotel "Lada" (Murom, Moskovskaya St. 43) invites guests to choose one of 45 rooms.  Each of them has a bathroom, air conditioning, refrigerator, TV and a bed - double or single.  Standard double room will cost 3500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lada murom" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/736715.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel offers a wide range of additional services: from ordering tickets to a luxurious banquet.  Caring staff will organize a trip to the theater and museum, help with laundry service, and provide a shuttle service. </p><p>  One of the hotel‚Äôs permanent partners is the Ancient Murom travel agency, whose specialists plan excursions not only around the city, but also to the neighboring Gus-Khrustalny, Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod and Suzdal.  If you are interested in the Lada Hotel (Murom), reviews of which are mostly positive, hurry up to book rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a special offer for newlyweds.  When checking into a wedding apartment, the hotel director promises flowers, photography and wine as a gift.  It is interesting that the Lada Hotel has hosted well-known guests more than once.  Moore is especially popular with them. </p><h2>  Guest house - rest in Russian </h2><p>  For more than twenty years in the field of Russian tourism such a concept as a guest house has been firmly entrenched.  If you are going to Murom, hotels will welcome you warmly, but only one of the guest houses will feel at home. </p><p>  This type of housing is no worse than traditional offers for tourists.  Today, guest houses are especially popular on the <span>Black Sea coast.</span>  The person who owns the <span>house rents a</span> room or an entire floor to guests.  The owner himself and his family, as a rule, live there.  It turns out that you are just going to visit someone.  This way of relaxation requires a little more independence, however, low prices more than compensate for all the inconveniences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="murom hotel rusich" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/736716.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  On the part of various authorities, the requirements for guest houses are more loyal than for hotels.  Homeowners do not need to earn ‚Äústars‚Äù or strictly follow sanitary and epidemiological standards.  In fact, the requirements are minimal, as for ordinary houses or apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Visiting Murom </h2><p>  Planning a trip to Murom?  Hotel Rusich is one of the best guest houses in the city.  The excellent location - near the center, near the bus and train stations - will allow you to easily find this place.  The cozy rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay, the rental price will be from 1000 to 4000 thousand rubles per day. </p><p>  In your free time you can relax in the sauna or play billiards.  Representatives of the fair sex will certainly be interested in the opportunity to do a manicure or one of the procedures to correct the figure. </p><p>  A library and an excellent cafe are always open for guests, dishes from which can be delivered to your room.  The wonderful hall is designed for 45 people and is perfect for holding a festive event. </p><h2>  In the historical center </h2><p>  Near the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery, the Svyatogor Hotel is conveniently located (Murom, Krasnogvardeisky per. 3).  The room stock for the city is quite large - 40 comfortable rooms in which there are toiletries, a hairdryer, a TV, a fridge and other necessary things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murom hotels" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/736717.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  There is also a wellness center on site.  After interesting excursions you can hardly get to the hotel?  The city of Murom will leave a lot of impressions, but you can restore your strength literally in one evening.  An infrared sauna, a cedar barrel, a massage room, a swimming pool and a Russian bath will help to truly relax and discuss the delights of the Russian hinterland with companions.  For active guests there is a dance hall, fitness equipment, tennis and billiards. </p><p>  On the territory of the <span>Muroma Hotel</span> there is a parking for cars and a gazebo for relaxing, where you can dine in the fresh air.  Wonderful home cooking is offered by the Svyatogor cafe. </p><h2>  Overlooking the promenade </h2><p>  The Volna Hotel (Murom, Gubkina St.) has an amazing location.  Almost all sights are within walking distance, but the bustle of the city will not be able to disturb you. </p><p>  Guests are offered rooms of different price categories, but their distinguishing feature is the lack of a private bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel svyatogor murom" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/736714.jpg" width="300"></div>  This option is suitable for people unassuming, and it is unlikely that you will spend a lot of time in a hotel when even the air in the city is saturated with history.

    <h2>  Times of glory </h2><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúRus‚Äù will help you feel the nostalgia of Soviet times (Murom among visitors was formerly famous for the service of this particular establishment).  Today, unfortunately, little has changed since then. </p><p>  The hotel, which has 71 rooms, has long been in need of renovation.  This is indicated by some of the guests.  The immediate plans of the hotel management include a major renewal of the fund and an increase in service, because ‚ÄúRus‚Äù does not seriously reach the two declared stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel rus murom" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/736713.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  It is fair to say that many Murom hotels face similar problems.  The modern tourist is used to a certain level, and we are not talking about fashionable hotels.  Elementary cleanliness, order and polite staff - these are the minimum requirements of guests. </p><h2>  The highest level </h2><p>  Another institution from the category of "home" boasts Moore.  The Kremlin Hotel offers its guests one of fifteen rooms with amenities to choose from.  The building has a shop and cafe, food from which you can order takeaway. </p><p>  The cozy courtyard has everything you need for a pleasant pastime, <span>the hotel administrator</span> will be happy to find several board games for you. </p><p>  The Kremlin offers four accommodation options for honeymooners.  Regardless of the price, the room will be decorated with wedding accessories and rose petals.  In addition, the hotel has a special offer for a group of seven people.  Accommodation in two rooms, the necessary accessories, breakfast and dinner, as well as a city tour will cost 2500 rubles per guest. </p><h2>  Private Ads </h2><p>  Already in April, the number of tourists coming to the city increases significantly.  It happens that Murom hotels are crowded and it is very difficult to find an overnight stay.  Bookings during peak periods must be booked in advance, especially if you are traveling with children.  But if necessary, you can turn to private ads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels city murom" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/738785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many citizens leave several guest rooms in their houses, as well as rent apartments in high-rise buildings for a day or more.  You can find such owners through special city portals.  And even if you hear that everything is busy, do not hesitate to ask for advice.  Often, local "businessmen" communicate with each other and can share the contacts of competitors. </p><h2>  Gold ring </h2><p>  The Golden Ring consists mainly of the cities of Vladimir-Suzdal Rus.  This famous route is loved not only by Russian tourists.  When traveling through ancient cities, you will see historical monuments with your own eyes and get acquainted with folk crafts. </p><p>  Murom is not part of the main composition of the Golden Ring, but this does not mean that he does not deserve attention.  The legend of Peter and Fevronia gives hope for family happiness, independent of the circumstances.  Thousands of couples come to the city for the blessing of their patrons. </p>
