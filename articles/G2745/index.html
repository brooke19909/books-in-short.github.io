    <h2>  Climate, ecology </h2><p>  Since Golovinka is one of the districts of the city of Sochi, the weather is based on forecasts for this territory. </p><p>  <span>Sochi's climate is</span> humid, subtropical.  Due to the unique location of the Caucasus Range, a strong and cold wind does not penetrate the city, and the Black Sea saturates the territory with heat. </p><p>  So, due to high temperatures, in the city you can find many exotic and unusual plants.  Unfortunately, the environment is not so good here: due to the numerous buildings for the Olympics, it is deteriorating more and more, as can be seen in statistics on monitoring the cleanliness of the city.  Every year more and more territory is allocated for the construction of buildings of this kind.  On the one hand, the city is transforming and acquiring a new, unique look, but on the other, the environment in which people live is exposed to dangerous effects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The situation is slightly different with the Golovinka (Sochi) district.  “Castle by the sea”, reviews of which are almost always positive, is located in one of the cleanest areas of the city. </p>
