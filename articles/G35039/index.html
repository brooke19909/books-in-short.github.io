    <h2>  El Salam </h2><p>  The area where the Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 * is located, reviews of 2015 were called the most comfortable and safe in Egypt.  Residents of hotels located near Naama Bay never get bored.  Cafes and restaurants, hookahs and shops, nightclubs and discos, supermarkets and shopping malls - here you can walk endlessly when you get tired of sunbathing, swimming and watching the animation. </p><p>  The promenade Naama Bay, which is located in the El Salam district, is a modern, never-sleeping street, lit with neon signs and sparkling lights.  Of the local restaurants, regulars recommend the Panorama cafe with a breathtaking view and oriental dances, Tam-tam near Gazaly (famous for its inexpensive prices), as well as Dannanier.  If you want to go on boats or yachts, then go to the pier Iberotel Lido.  Of the clubs, tourists strongly recommend Le Pasha and Hard Rock Cafe.  But they say that they are already losing in popularity to the new Taj Mahal.  Naama Bay is Sharma's most prestigious resort, and you will appreciate it when you settle in the Hilton. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton sharm dreams resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1073461.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 * hotel is located in the middle of a magnificent park.  Its territory is huge, but at the same time very well-groomed.

For convenience, between the buildings, in the park and the restaurant you can ride on special cars.  They also bring luggage to rooms.

From some you can see <span>the Sinai Mountains.</span>  There are rooms with balconies or patios.  Almost all junior suites are built so that they offer a mountain landscape or a hotel park.  They have a living room where there is a folding sofa, a dining room, two bathrooms. </p><p>  So-called guest rooms are a bit simpler.  They are designed like junior suites, but have only one bathroom.  King rooms have king size beds and there is a lounge but no dining room.  In any room there are all the benefits of civilization: iron, ironing board, cups, sets for coffee and tea, a huge plasma TV.  On the balconies and terraces - chairs and a table.  The rooms are very spacious and there is where to put things.  Solid furniture.  Cleaned every day and give a bottle of water.  If not enough, you can take extra at any restaurant.

    <h2>  Sea and sun baths </h2><p>  Recall that this hotel is on the second line.  Nevertheless, the Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 *, the reviews of which we analyze in the article, has its own beach with a length of about half a kilometer.  It occupies the central part of Naama Bay and is actually located on the territory of the Quartet of the same Hilton network.  Here you will find everything you need to have a good time at the sea: towels, umbrellas, deck chairs, sun loungers ... And there are so many fish that even if you don‚Äôt swim with a mask, you can watch them standing waist-deep in the water.  And to go here just a few minutes on foot from the Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 * hotel.  The reviews of 2015, however, warn that the real time for which you get to the sea depends on which building you live in.  After all, the territory of the "five" is very large.  Near the beach there is a water park owned by the hotel.  A professional diving center also works here. </p><p>  Vacationers consider this coast the best in Sharm El Sheikh.  It is far from boat moorings, and therefore there are no oil stains on the water.  The sunset is sandy, but there are corals away.  Free sunbeds are always available.  The beach is very clean, it is carefully cleaned.  A bar near the sea is paid, but some tourists, especially with children, considered this a plus.  Indeed, in this case, the sea does not show people who have taken to the chest.  And if you prefer swimming pools, then there are seven of them at the hotel.  There is also a children's pond with various attractions.  Some pools have a jacuzzi, and all of them have different depths. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  It is difficult to find vacationers who only go to Egypt for the sun and sea.  Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 * is a good place to start exploring Sharm El Sheikh.  In walking distance - Naama Bay, which is considered as an alternative to Soho.  But it‚Äôs worth going to this area even for comparison.  View the Old Town, listen to concerts.  To do this, you can use a sightseeing tour of Sharm El Sheikh. </p><p>  This resort is also famous for its water parks.  Of course, you can limit yourself to hotel.  But to see the best water park, visit Bora Bora.  Unforgettable emotions are really waiting for you there.  Those who want to spend an easy evening can go to the show ‚ÄúA Thousand and One Nights,‚Äù and those who like to fish can take a fishing rod and instructors to the Red Sea.  After all, this is one of the opportunities to bring the catch home and then brag about it. </p><p>  A heavy night ascent of Mount Moses is not for the weak in spirit and body.  But then there will be something to remember. </p><h2>  Where is better to shop?  Useful Tips </h2><p>  If you didn‚Äôt just come to relax and buy souvenirs, but to find out the soul of this country, go to the eastern bazaar.  After all, this is Egypt.  The Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 * hotel, as we have already said, is located next to Naama Bay.  And there, behind the Le Pasha night club, there is a real colorful bazaar.  They don‚Äôt just buy things, souvenirs, products and spices.  They enjoy it here.  And for cheap goods it is better to go to the shopping mall in the form of a pyramid, which is called accordingly.  It is good to take cigarettes, drinks, fruits.  The product is of high quality, and you are calculated at the checkout.  It is better to take excursions not in the hotel, but in the city.  They cost two to three times cheaper there.  You can buy a trip from a tour operator for eighty dollars, although with street guides the same costs thirty.  Hookahs are different.  But the highest quality costs about twenty-five dollars. </p><h2>  Hotel Hilton Sharm Dreams Resort 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists find this hotel very comfortable for families.  There is good food, friendly staff, a huge beach with convenient sandy entry into the sea.  There are many amenities and activities for children.  Pools for every taste.  It's nice to walk around the hotel: a lot of flowers and greenery.  The hotel has a great location.  This is a very budget ‚Äúfive‚Äù, and in terms of price and quality, the Hilton network, as always, is at its best. </p>
