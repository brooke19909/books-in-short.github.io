    <h2>  Life during the reconstruction period </h2><p>  In 1956, it was decided to update the existing "Green Theater" park named after  Gorky.  After perestroika, its area became much smaller than the previous one and was connected to the territory in Neskuchny Sad.  Construction took place at a rapid pace in connection with the preparations for the World Festival of Youth and Students.  Literally at the end of winter, the "Green Theater" park named after  Gorky was put into operation. </p><h2>  The role of the Namin Center </h2><p>  In 1989, the "Green Theater" Park them.  Gorky was already in disrepair.  The building required major repairs.  In this regard, it was decided to prohibit any activity in it, since it has not been completely repaired since its construction.  In the same year, having leased the Green Theater for almost 50 years, the Namin Center began to patronize it.  <span>Overhaul</span> was carried out in the building <span>: the</span> roof, heating were replaced, the boiler and engineering communications were put in order, the walls, the foundation, and much more were strengthened.  Throughout the 90s, the "Green Theater" actively existed.  After every winter, repairs were carried out here, but not so significant.  Concerts became regular, creative studios actively developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green theater in gorky park" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/454384.jpg" width="497"></div>  In 1998, the Green Theater was transferred to the Committee of Culture.  So he became a government agency.  His leadership continued to be the Namin Center, which contributed to the development of the Green Theater.  There were many concerts, creative contests and festivals.  After several years, namely in 2002, the Moscow government transferred the complex to the Theater of Music and Drama.  At the same time, the Namin Center voluntarily refused to rent, but did not cease to patronize the institution.  Thanks to this, the complex is actively developing now, various events are regularly held there.
