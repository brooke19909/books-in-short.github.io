  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Methods and forms of scientific knowledge</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientific knowledge is the most objective way to discover new things.  In this article, we will consider the methods and forms of scientific knowledge, try to understand the essence of the question of how they differ. </p><p>  There are two levels of scientific knowledge: <span>empirical and theoretical.</span>  And in connection with this, the following forms of <span>scientific knowledge in philosophy</span> are distinguished <span>: scientific</span> fact, problem, hypothesis and theory.  We will give each of them a little attention. </p><p>  A scientific fact is an elementary form that can be considered as scientific knowledge, but about one particular phenomenon.  Not all research results can be recognized as facts if they are not obtained as a result of studying them in interaction with other phenomena and have not undergone special statistical processing. </p><p>  The problem exists in the form of knowledge, in which, along with the known, there is something that needs to be known.  It consists of two points: firstly, the problem must be established, and secondly, it must be solved.  The sought and known in the problem are closely interconnected.  In order to solve the problem, you need to make not only physical and mental, but also material efforts.  Therefore, some of the problems remain unknown for a very long time. </p><p>  To solve the problem, a hypothesis is put forward, which testifies to the scientist's knowledge of the laws that can help this or that problem.  The hypothesis must be substantiated, that is, it must meet the conditions of verifiability, compatibility with the actual material, the possibility of comparison with other objects under study.  The truth of the hypothesis is proved in practice.  After the truth of the hypothesis is verified, it takes the form of a theory that completes the stages of development that modern methods and forms of scientific knowledge have reached. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And the highest form of scientific knowledge is <span>theory.</span>  <span>This is a</span> model of scientific knowledge that gives a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe laws of the studied field.  Logical laws follow from the theory and submit to its main provisions.  The theory explains, systematizes and predicts and determines the methodology of scientific knowledge, its integrity, validity and reliability. </p><p>  The forms of scientific knowledge in philosophy also determine the basic <span>methods of scientific knowledge.</span>  <span>Scientific</span> knowledge develops as a result of observations and <span>experiments.</span>  <span>An experiment</span> as a method of scientific knowledge arose in the 17th century.  Until this time, researchers relied more on everyday practice, common sense and observation.  The conditions for experimental scientific knowledge have developed with the development of technology and the emergence of new mechanisms as a result of the industrial revolution that happened at that time.  The activity of scientists at this time increases due to the fact that the experiment made it possible to subject the studied object to special influences, placing it in isolated conditions. </p><p>  However, considering the methods and forms of scientific knowledge, one cannot belittle the importance of observation.  It is it that paves the way for the experiment.  Let us recall, for example, how V. Gilber, rubbing amber with wool, discovered the existence of static electricity.  This was one of the simplest experiments related to external observation.  And later the Danish H. Ersted conducted a real experiment, using an already galvanic device. </p><p>  Modern methods and forms of scientific knowledge are much more complicated and are on the verge of a technical miracle.  The dimensions of the experimental equipment are huge and massive.  Impressive and the amount that is invested in their creation.  Therefore, scientists often save money by replacing the basic methods of scientific knowledge with the method of thought experiment and scientific modeling.  An example of such models is <span>an ideal gas,</span> where it is assumed that there is no collision of molecules.  Widely applied and mathematical modeling as an analogue of reality. </p>
