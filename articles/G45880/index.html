    <h2>  Novela Resort 4 *: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more accurate and complete picture of Novela Resort, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the opinions of our compatriots who spent their holidays here this year.  Looking ahead, we note that most tourists really liked this hotel, and they were very pleased with the choice made.  However, we suggest learning more about everything. </p><p>  First of all, dwell on the hotel rooms.  Our compatriots found them very comfortable and spacious.  At the same time, experienced tourists recommend taking rooms with sea views if possible for an additional fee.  This will not only provide you with a magnificent view from the window, but also save you from noise.  The fact is that part of the hotel‚Äôs windows faces the road, and local residents are famous for their love to honk each other, as they say, with or without.  In general, the rooms have everything you need.  Travelers were especially pleased with the availability and regular updating of toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower gel and shave, disposable razors, bath caps, etc.).  Our compatriots also liked the new comfortable furniture, a large flat-screen TV with lots of channels, among which were broadcast in Russian.  Most tourists were also satisfied with the cleaning.  Towels and bed linen were changed regularly. </p><p>  Travelers also appreciated the location of Novela Resort 4 *.  Most of the reviews of tourists come to the fact that the deployment of this hotel is one of the most successful in Mui Ne.  So, it is located in the center of the main street of this resort.  Therefore, within walking distance from it there is a whole tourist infrastructure: restaurants, bars, shops, souvenir shops, excursion bureaus, pharmacies, a hospital, etc. Experienced tourists recommend to have a meal at least several times in local cafes called here ‚Äúbokeh‚Äù .  In them you can taste perfectly cooked dishes of traditional Vietnamese cuisine at more than reasonable prices. </p><p>  As for the beach of the hotel, despite the fact that it is quite narrow, there is always enough space to accommodate everyone.  The sea in Mui Ne is restless, waves often rise.  Therefore, there will be a real expanse for fans of surfing and kitesurfing.  By the way, many tourists tried themselves in these water sports, took a few lessons at local surfing schools. </p><p>  Of the entertainment at the Novela Resort &amp; SPA 4 * hotel, our compatriots note only evening animation.  It is represented by Filipinos performing songs in different languages.  According to tourists, they sing very well.  Many vacationers had a great time by the pool or in the jacuzzi, and also attended massage sessions.  As for entertainment outside the hotel, music lovers experienced travelers recommend visiting a local nightclub.  For the rest, in Mui Ne, you can only go shopping and tasting traditional dishes.  However, tourists are strongly recommended to go on a variety of excursions.  To do this, you can either use the services of excursion bureaus (there are enough of them), or rent a car for a very reasonable price and explore this amazing country yourself. </p><p>  But back to the hotel.  As for the reviews of our compatriots about the staff, most of them are positive, even though many employees here do not speak not only Russian, but even English.  But due to the fact that the hotel workers are very friendly and sociable people, it was not difficult for tourists to explain them even in sign language.  If, nevertheless, the language barrier becomes a problem, then you can always turn to the Russian-speaking guide, almost always located in Novela Resort 4 *.  He will be happy to help you resolve all issues. </p><p>  In general, most tourists recommend the Novela Resort Hotel as a great place for a relaxing holiday by the sea.  Here couples and newlyweds, as well as family travelers and older people, will surely like it.  However, this hotel, like the resort town of Mui Ne, can slightly disappoint young people who are looking for noisy entertainment, discos until the morning and vivid impressions. </p>
