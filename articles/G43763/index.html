Long-lived smartphones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones are becoming more powerful every day, receiving <span>multi-core processors,</span> gigabytes of RAM and non-volatile memory, as well as powerful graphics accelerators.  However, manufacturers often lose sight of the fact that, first of all, a smartphone remains a means of communication, which should have good autonomy, which allows you not to live in a rhythm ‚Äúfrom the outlet to the outlet‚Äù. </p><p>  Especially the load on the battery increases when using the smartphone in active mode, when several instant messengers and other programs are running, megabytes of traffic are pouring through the mobile network, and calls do not stop.  Not every eminent manufacturer can boast of a model capable of withstanding such loads without much stress. </p><p>  However, Ulefone drew attention to this and released a gadget called Ulefone Power, which is a perfectly balanced high-tech ‚Äútoy‚Äù that copes with high workloads.  Let's look at its main characteristics and distinctive features that made the model unique, in order.  We also analyze in detail the Ulefone Power smartphone, reviews of which can be found without difficulty.  Their number allows you to put together a complete picture of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions and appearance </h2><p>  Despite the capacious battery, which we will talk about a little later, the smartphone turned out to be elegant and does not create the impression of chopped plastic.  Its thickness is 9.5 mm, which is the average for devices of this class.  The weight of the device was still not quite standard - 190 g, but at the same time it is not critical, and the phone does not pull its hand when used, such as the Oukitel K10000, whose weight reached a record mark by today's standards of 320 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The gadget is available in three color variations.  Here, the manufacturer did not experiment much, using blue and silver colors.  Separately, it is worth highlighting the third color - this is a wood-like color, which is a rather unusual solution, although it is found in other manufacturers.  The smartphone has an aluminum frame that increases the strength of the case, the rest of the body elements are made of plastic.  Case for Ulefone Power <strong> </strong>  comes complete, so the smartphone will remain presentable for a long time. </p><p>  On the left edge there is a tray for SIM-cards and micro-SD format cards, on the right there are all the controls, such as the volume rocker and the power button, as well as a large round button designed to quickly launch the camera.  At the upper end are a headphone jack with a diameter of 3.5 mm and an infrared emitter, with which you can control various equipment using a smartphone as a remote control.  Below is a microphone hole and a connector for charging and data transfer.  On the back cover on top are the main camera with a dual LED flash, as well as <span>a fingerprint scanner.</span>  In general, a pleasant impression of the appearance of Ulefone Power is created.  The review can be continued by disassembling the internal filling of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Communication Standards and Wireless Modules </h2><p>  The smartphone will delight those who are used to make the most of wireless capabilities.  There is support for 4th generation networks at all frequencies used in most countries.  The manufacturer promises (with support from the operator) the speed of downloading data in 4G networks up to 150 Mbit / s, and the return can reach 51 Mbit / s.  The signal reception level is always stable in the Ulefone Power model, 4G connects instantly as soon as you get into the coverage area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It can also please the support of all modern standards of WiFi-networks, allowing you to use at the highest possible speed any access points, wherever you are, at home or, for example, in a cafe. </p><p>  The smartphone has a Bluetooth module version 4.0, which allows you to quickly transfer files at close range.  In addition, the new version makes it possible to connect several different devices at the same time. </p>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The main processor is the budget <span>MediaTek MT6753.</span>  Despite the fact that it belongs to the budget segment, it has a capacity that is enough to perform most everyday tasks, while it is quite energy efficient.  High performance is provided by the presence of 8 cores operating at a frequency of up to 1.3 GHz.  The processor integrates the Mali-T720 MP3 video accelerator, which can cope with most modern demanding games that can be found in the application store.  After reading reviews about Ulefone Power, you can make sure that these indicators are quite enough for comfortable work and not only. </p><p>  This tandem is complemented by DDR3 standard memory, which has a capacity of 3 GB.  This volume is enough to use a browser with several open tabs and several instant messengers.  However, they will not be unloaded from memory and between them you can switch almost instantly.  Users often describe the performance of a smartphone as an example of performing various tasks, this is also true for Ulefone Power.  W3bsit3-dns.com is full of news and posts about this model, you can find a lot of interesting information on working with resource-intensive applications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For storing user files and software provides non-volatile memory capacity of 16 GB.  Here, the manufacturer slightly let us down, because with current standards this memory may not be enough.  However, if necessary, it can be expanded using a micro-SD memory card, but you will have to sacrifice one SIM card.  Given that when you purchase this model, you buy a good smartphone inexpensively, you can close your eyes to such small flaws. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  To display information, a matrix with a diagonal of 5.5 inches and a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels is used.  The Ulefone Power screen has a density of 401 ppi. Pixelization can only be seen by a very picky user with perfect vision.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology, which provides good viewing angles, as well as comfortable use in bright sunlight. </p><p>  It is protected by a sensor with a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3.  However, do not forget that the protection of this class does not make glass shockproof.  Therefore, it is worth using the smartphone carefully so as not to drop it on a hard surface with sad consequences. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main camera of the smartphone is made by Sony and has a model IMX214 Exmor RS.  Often, modules from this manufacturer are of high quality images, they did not fail this time.  The camera matrix has a resolution of 13 megapixels, which is software interpolated to 16 megapixels.  Thanks to the double powerful flash, the pictures are obtained quite high-quality even in low light, however, in complete darkness it is still not recommended to shoot. </p><p>  The front camera installed on the Ulefone Power smartphone has more modest indicators - it is a 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5648 module.  It is enough for talking on Skype or an ordinary selfie, but you should not expect high quality pictures from it.  The resolution of the front camera is also programmatically increased to 8 megapixels. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  The gadget supports positioning using three technologies - GPS, A-GPS and Glonass.  The satellite signal reception level is confident, it will be enough for fairly accurate positioning even under adverse conditions, for example, with high cloud cover.  This is a good indicator, given the fact that this model is included in the category of state employees, and you, in fact, buy a good smartphone inexpensively, without risking being left without navigation at the most inopportune moment. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  This item should be disassembled in more detail, since a long operating time of the device from one battery charge is the main feature of this smartphone.  Despite the small thickness and acceptable weight, the gadget became the owner of a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 6050 mAh, which is more than in many flagship devices of famous manufacturers. </p><p>  According to the manufacturer, this capacity should be enough for continuous conversation on a 2G network for 63 hours.  In third-generation networks, this figure is slightly reduced, but not critical, and amounts to 60 hours.  If the device is in standby mode, then one charge is enough for 1800 hours, and this is two and a half months. </p><p>  The smartphone uses MediaTek Pump Express Plus fast charging technology.  It is enough to charge the smartphone for only 5 minutes to get the opportunity to continuously talk on it for almost 2 hours.  When connected for 2 hours to charging the Ulefone Power smartphone, the battery charges from 0 to 100%.  Do not forget that the fast charging technology only works with the "native" bundled cable and adapter, so they should be used carefully. </p><p>  On average, according to user reviews of this smartphone, with a moderate load, one battery charge lasts for 4-5 days.  A moderate load means the use of instant messengers and mobile Internet, as well as a couple of hours of conversations throughout the day.  Among other things, the phone has an energy-saving function that disables unnecessary software modules at the moment and reduces the power consumption of the processor.  For the budget employee, who is Ulefone Power, the 6050mAh is just the perfect indicator.  At the same time, there is no overestimation of capacity; a large number of tests showed that it is real and not exaggerated. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The manufacturer has proven itself in terms of providing device support.  Initially, the smartphone came with the Android 5.1 operating system, but soon after the presentation of the new version, all users got the opportunity to wirelessly upgrade to Android 6.0.  It is not yet known whether updates to newer versions will be released for this model, however, small packages with corrections of minor bugs periodically come.  The Internet community is not slumbering regarding Ulefone Power, w3bsit3-dns.com already has a topic on the forum on firmware for this device, including custom. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ulefone Power 4G" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/1436686.jpg" width="476"></div></h2><h2>  Positive user reviews </h2><p>  In general, the smartphone receives good ratings from users.  However, in connection with a certain percentage of marriage that went on sale with the first lots, you can find reviews about Ulefone Power on the network that emphasize the weaknesses, the camera and the touchscreen of the gadget. </p><p>  Among the advantages and strengths, those who have been using a smartphone for some time, highlight the following points: </p><ul><li>  High performance and speed of information processing, comfortable use of any resource-intensive programs, including at the same time. </li><li>  Stable update of the operating system, good technical support from the manufacturer. </li><li>  High quality display both in terms of color rendering and viewing angles, and in terms of brightness.  Users mark.  That sometimes in the afternoon on the street even 50-60% of the maximum brightness is enough for comfortable operation. </li><li>  A definite plus is autonomy.  The battery lasts for a long time, ideal for active business people who always need to stay in touch, and at the same time use energy-saving features, such as navigation and mobile Internet.  Speaking of Ulefone Power, review after review, all well-known sources emphasize this strength. </li><li>  Build quality and nice design.  Despite the 5.5-inch diagonal, the gadget does not look like a ‚Äúshovel", but lies nicely in the hand and does not create inconvenience when using. </li></ul><p>  In general, the smartphone can be called pleasant, with a friendly design and interface, but not without its drawbacks. </p><h2>  Key flaws </h2><p>  Like any electrical novelty, the gadget is not without its drawbacks, which buyers often notice in reviews, talking about Ulefone Power.  Reviews often come down to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  High heat during operation and charging.  When launching demanding applications, such as games with high quality graphics, many users notice a rather noticeable heat in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera and fingerprint sensor.  In addition, the smartphone becomes very hot when using a standard charger.  This is due to the features of the battery, so it is not recommended to use a smartphone while charging. </li><li>  Poor sound quality.  There are no complaints about the volume, but the sound of the speaker gives off ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  Headphones are also best chosen according to your preferences, since the sound path is not of the highest quality. </li><li>  On some models, false sensor triggers during charging, again when using a standard adapter.  If you use other adapters with a standard charging speed, the problem disappears, in addition, the battery temperature decreases. </li><li>  Camera.  However, this is rather the standard for this price segment, and not a drawback.  In the afternoon, in good lighting, pretty high-quality photos are obtained, but in twilight and darkness you should not count on the fact that you can make a photo without noise, for example, due to a flash.  If the quality of pictures is not important for you, then you can ignore this controversial flaw. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A smartphone is a productive and ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù device that is perfect for those who should always stay in touch, and not only in the standard sense of the word.  It has a nice, presentable appearance, and does not look like a cheap toy, it is not a shame to get it with business partners. </p><p>  Buying it, you should be prepared for some minor inconvenience, but basically they are uncritical and you can close your eyes to them.  Its main feature is autonomy, and it was emphasized by the manufacturer.  The smartphone received a good price / quality ratio, taking into account all the nuances, as well as the high performance that is often forgotten when designing long-lived smartphones.  This gadget will be a great helper in everyday and working life. </p>
