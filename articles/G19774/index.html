The bridge is an ancient invention that allowed people to move from one point to another over water.  Each year, the engineer‚Äôs talent was honed, and the buildings turned into real architectural works that delight in technical excellence.  Today we will tell you about several original sights erected by talented engineers with the same names. </p><h2>  Gateshead Masterpiece </h2><p>  English architects surprised the planet by creating a genuine work of art, which was awarded the Sterling Prize 14 years ago.  The world's first tiltable bridge was unofficially called the Winking Eye.  About $ 44 million was spent on the construction of the original structure, consisting of two steel arches, one of which is raised above the water, and the other, in fact, is the lively Millennium Bridge (Gateshead). </p><h2>  The ingenious project of architects </h2><p>  Named after the new millennium, the design, which appeared in the English town, connected Northern England with Newcastle.  An amazing sight, allowing even large vessels to pass under it, has no analogues in the whole world.  When the Millennium (bridge) turns, which happens about 200 times a year, this incredible sight attracts the attention of a huge number of people, and such a dynamics looks simply amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="millennium gateshead bridge" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1451346.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As vessels approach, the lower arch rises, and the upper arch lowers, and this rotation occurs very quickly and takes a little more than four minutes.  The turns of the bridge, which are driven by the hydraulic system, turn the English landmark into a kind of blinking century of a huge eye.  But even in a frozen state, a brilliant architectural project delights with its perfect beauty. </p><h2>  The highlight of the building </h2><p>  Another feature that makes the Millennium (bridge) unique is that the structure consists of two decks, one of which is equipped for walking, and cyclists ride along the other.  Tourists are surprised by the seats in the pedestrian zone, because in this way the creators of the structure took care of those who want to enjoy longer the view of the river. </p><h2>  Montenegrin landmark </h2><p>  One cannot fail to mention the attraction that appeared in 2005, which attracted close attention to Montenegro.  The Millennium (bridge) connecting the two banks of the Moraca River is so unusual that it cannot be confused with any other construction.  The most beautiful building, opened for the main public holiday, appeared in the capital of the country - Podgorica. </p><p>  A miracle of engineering, which perfectly reflects all the opportunities that a person has opened up, is intended for motorists and pedestrians, in addition, a complex engineering structure with a stunning design is equipped with special areas for the movement of cyclists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="millennium bridge" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1451348.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The long, 175-meter "Millennium" bridge surprises with massive pylons, rushing into the sky 60 meters high.  Along its sides are steel counterbalance cables evenly supporting the structure, the appearance of which marked the entry of Montenegro into the new century. </p><h2>  Kazan miracle of engineering </h2><p>  By the way, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan also boasts a millennium symbol of an ancient city with a rich history.  The massive and modern Millennium Bridge, crossing the Kazanka River, has become part of the ring road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="millennium bridge" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1451347.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The huge pylon, made in the form of the letter "M", is brightly illuminated in the dark, and the magnificent structure looks incredibly attractive.  According to local residents who come to admire the design, this is the most illuminated object in Kazan. </p>
