  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Levels of organization of living matter: names and characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The levels of organization of living</span> matter is a symbol adopted to classify all living organisms on our planet.  The wildlife of the Earth is truly diverse.  Organisms can take on various sizes: from simple and unicellular microbes, to multicellular creatures, and ending with the largest animals on earth - whales. </p><p>  Evolution on Earth took place in such a way that organisms developed from the simplest (in the literal sense) to more complex ones.  So, either appearing or disappearing, new species improved in the course of evolution, taking on an increasingly bizarre appearance. </p><p>  In order to systematize this incredible amount of living organisms, the organization levels of living matter were introduced.  The fact is that, despite the differences in appearance and structure, all living organisms have common features: they somehow consist of molecules, have repeating elements, in one sense or another - the general functions of organs;  they feed, multiply, grow old and die.  In other words, the properties of a living organism, despite external differences, are similar.  Actually, focusing on these data, we can trace how evolution took place on our planet. </p><p>  So, we will consider the <span>levels of organization of living matter in</span> more detail.  The first level applies to <strong>all</strong> living organisms without exception.  The higher it is (the level), the more and more representatives of <span>wildlife are</span> eliminated. </p><p>  <strong>1. The molecular</strong> level is inherent in all organisms.  Within this level, processes that are invisible to the naked eye occur in any living organism: the synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, building materials or protective substances.  This is the level of large molecular compounds (proteins, <span>nucleic acids</span> , etc.) </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>2. Supramolecular or subcellular.</strong>  The level at which the structuring of molecules into organelles of the cell occurs: <span>cell membrane,</span> chromosomes, vacuoles, nucleus, etc. </p><p>  <strong>3. Cellular.</strong>  At this level, matter is represented as an elementary functional unit - a cell. </p><p>  <strong>4. Organ-tissue level.</strong>  It is at this level that all organs and tissues of a living organism are formed, regardless of their complexity: brain, tongue, kidney, etc. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that tissue is a collection of cells united by a common structure and function.  An organ is a part of an organism whose ‚Äúduties‚Äù include the implementation of a clearly defined function. </p><p>  <strong>5. Ontogenetic or organismic level.</strong>  At this level, organs of various functionalities are combined into a single organism.  In other words, this level is already represented by an integral individual of any kind. </p><p>  <strong>6. Population and species.</strong>  Organisms or individuals with a similar structure, function and similar appearance, and thus belonging to the same species, are included in the same population.  In biology, a population is understood as the totality of all individuals of a given species.  In turn, they all form a genetically unified and isolated system.  The population lives in a certain place - area and, as a rule, does not intersect with representatives of other species.  The species, in turn, is a collection of all populations.  Living organisms can interbreed and produce offspring only within the framework of their species. </p><p>  <strong>7. Biocenotic.</strong>  The level at which living organisms are combined into biocenoses is the totality of all populations living in a particular territory.  Belonging to a particular species in this case does not matter. </p><p>  <strong>8. Biogeocenotic.</strong>  This level is due to the formation of biogeocenoses, that is, a combination of biocenosis and non-living factors (soil, climatic conditions) in the area where the biocenosis lives. </p><p>  <strong>9. Biosphere.</strong>  The level that unites all living organisms on the planet. </p><p>  Thus, the levels of organization of living matter include nine points.  Such a classification determines the systematization of living organisms existing in modern science. </p>
