Although the world was stirred up more by the opening ceremony.  Find out more in the article. </p><h2>  Gotthard Tunnel </h2><p>  In June 2016, a new railway tunnel appeared in Switzerland.  Its length was 57 kilometers, and if you take into account all the pedestrian and service crossings, then all 153 kilometers.  The opening of the Gotthard Tunnel was a bright and noisy event.  After the builders laid the western and eastern branches, he received the title of the longest in the world. </p><p>  The southern entrance to the tunnel is near the village of Bodio, the northern one is near the village of Ertsfeld.  About 25 million tons of rock were recovered for its laying and spent more than $ 12 billion.  They plan to start operation only in 2017. </p>

    <p>  Gotthard tunnel is called basic or basic.  In German, this name sounds like Basis and means that it was built right at the foot of the ridge.  Due to this position of the tunnel, the train enters it from a flat section and can quickly gain speed. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The idea and plan of the tunnel arose back in 1947.  It was supposed to have a length of 45 kilometers and connect Amsteg and Giorniko.  It was planned to make it double-track, with an exit for overtaking in the middle.  And the speed of trains, almost as in the modern plan, was supposed to reach 200 kilometers per hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tunnel design options have been repeatedly changed.  The impetus for the final decision was a significant load on the highway.  The Gotthard tunnel was supposed to solve this problem, and at the same time reduce the harmful effects of truck exhausts in a clean alpine region. </p>

    <p>  Preparation of the first works and plans began only in 1993.  Instead of a double-track tunnel, it was decided to build two single-track tunnels equipped with stations and exits.  Every 180 <span>meters, tunnels</span> should be connected by pedestrian galleries.  Thus, from one corridor one could get into another. </p><h2>  Opening holiday </h2><p>  The opening day of the Gotthard Tunnel in Switzerland cost a considerable amount and became a real event.  The country did not stint at the ceremony, many media broadcast it online.  At the very beginning of the festival, the place was consecrated with holy water and blessing.  Then, trains with passengers entered both tunnels at the same time. </p><p>  After the trip, the audience staged a stage performance, which made many world conspiracy theories excited.  The action, entitled "The Holy Gotthard," resembled not an acting production, but rather an occult ritual.  Along with rhythmically walking workers, strange creatures appeared on the scene, reminiscent of some spirits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The main person was a man with a goat mask and horns on his head.  A large screen shows how he is released from the cliff, trying to interfere with the workers.  Then frantic dances with people in fancy masks and costumes begin, the performance is accompanied by strange sounds and music. </p><p>  This area has a long legend associated with the construction of a mountain bridge.  The devil helped to build it in exchange for the soul of the first visitor, but people deceived him by sending a goat instead of a man.  So, perhaps, a masquerade is just a tribute to tradition, a free retelling of Swiss fairy tales. </p><h2>  Tunnel value </h2><p>  Gotthard Tunnel is a significant achievement in engineering.  Before him, the longest in the world was considered the Japanese Seikan, which connects the two islands, Honshu and Hokkaido.  More than 2500 workers were involved in the construction.  The last stages of the work were broadcast by local television. </p><p>  The Gotthard Railway Tunnel will be able to pass up to three hundred trains a day at a speed of 200-250 km / h.  Both freight and passenger trains will be able to cross it.  Now the journey from Italy to Switzerland will be reduced by about an hour. </p>

    <p>  The tunnel is part of the Altransit project, whose total value exceeds $ 20 billion.  Its operation will allow to unload the highway, reduce the negative impact of cars on the environment of the region.  Moreover, this method of transportation is considered more efficient and less costly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Gotthard tunnel is a real victory for the country.  Switzerland has literally paved the way for her for more than seventeen years.  The tunnel has become the longest in the world, and according to some reports, the deepest.  In certain places, it reaches a depth of 2.3 kilometers underground. </p><p>  Dozens of years and billions have been invested in a grand railway project.  The launch of the tunnel is planned for 2017.  In the meantime, the whole world is discussing not so much engineering skill as a grand opening.  The ceremony became a real find for lovers of conspiracy theories.  Church officials say they saw in this a ritual of calling the devil and stories from revelation. </p>
