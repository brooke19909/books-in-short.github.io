  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY do-it-yourself postcards: interesting ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Making crafts for the holidays from different materials is a rather fascinating activity.  Do-it-yourself postcards can be made on a regular sheet of cardboard or cut out any other shape, for example, a heart or figure eight.  In order for the image to have volume, layer-by-layer gluing of parts or kirigami is used. </p><p>  Also, when creating postcards, you can use, in addition to plain paper, for example, napkins or corrugated paper, create a composition of sponges or crumpled pieces, use satin ribbons or quilling strips. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for making bulk postcards with your own hands, and the photographs presented will help to understand the correctness of the work. </p><h2>  Easy craft </h2><p>  On March 8, mom or grandmother will be able to make such a card in a senior group of kindergarten.  It consists of a bouquet of flowers and a palm cut from white paper, which holds them.  You can choose a different background, as well as a paper texture.  It is better to use thick sheets to get a good volume. </p><p>  A palm for a voluminous postcard on March 8 is cut with your own hands along the drawn contours, which you can simply draw or circle your palm.  A palm is glued onto the cardboard only from below, fingers remain in a free position. </p><div class="photo" data-original="funfamilycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers for mom on March 8" class="if uuid-2404753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2404753.jpg"></div><p>  Next, cut the stems and leaves of green color and have a bouquet lying in the palm of your hand.  Fingers bend around the stems and stick to the edges on the PVA glue.  The flowers themselves on a voluminous postcard with their own hands create from dense pink circles, which are cut along the edges by sectors, but not completely.  The middle remains intact, as it is attached to the base. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The petals are bent up, you can use a round object, for example, a pencil or felt-tip pen.  It remains according to the template to cut out the yellow middle and glue them on the central part of each flower. </p><h2>  Postcards from cotton pads </h2><p>  Using cosmetic sponges, you can make bulk postcards with your own hands.  The photo below shows two options for doing this.  Younger children can easily make a simple flower with round petals.  As a middle, children attach a piece of contrasting plasticine, and the stalk and leaves are cut out of colored paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="darling.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sponge cards" class="if uuid-2404706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2404706.jpg"></div><p>  Volumetric cards on March 8 with your own hands can be created from delicate calla lilies, which are twisted from a cotton pad.  The middle is made of cotton buds painted yellow by lowering in gouache paint.  To do the job, a basket cut out of red colored paper is first glued, then carved green leaves are attached.  At the end are a bouquet in two rows, twisted into a bundle of cotton pads with colored sticks inside. </p><h2>  Flowers from many elements </h2><p>  <span>A 3D do-it-yourself postcard with flowers</span> can be made up of identical petals cut out from a pattern.  They can be of completely different shapes, starting with simple circles, hearts and leaves, ending with beautiful carved options.  After cutting out all the details, they are bent in half, and then glued.  However, only one half is smeared with glue, the other part of the blank remains free so that the postcard looks voluminous. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="darling.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric flowers" class="if uuid-2404710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2404710.jpg"></div><p>  Petals are attached alternately.  In some cases, it is possible to partially overlap the previous element, but some should be located nearby.  Petals are placed as usual in the flower, with rays from the middle to the outer edge. </p><h2>  Volume postcard for February 23 </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make a beautiful card for your beloved dad on Defender of the Fatherland Day.  Usually military equipment is placed on postcards - tanks, boats, ships, planes, etc. These vehicles can be made voluminous in the origami technique, but such an image as in the photo below will be interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="masterbud.dp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ship for dad on february 23" class="if uuid-2404759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2404759.jpg"></div><p>  For the background, blue or blue cardboard, depicting the sky and the sea, is selected.  On plain A4 white paper, a picture of a ship moving forward and sea waves is drawn.  Further, the workpiece is folded in half and cuts are made in the lower contours of the vessel, the main and upper decks. </p><p>  When gluing, the ship is attached only at the edges, and the central part will be moved forward when the postcard is opened.  On the one hand, red numbers are attached - 23, on the other hand - clouds.  Small details are drawn with a blue marker. </p><p>  The article provides just a few examples of creating volumetric cards for gifts for mom or dad for the holidays.  It‚Äôs easy to make them, and the crafts turn out spectacular. </p>
