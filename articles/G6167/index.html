    <p>  The complex is located on the territory of the main tourist brand of the coast - Golden Sands National Natural Park.  Varshava Hotel is conveniently located in the very center of the tourist "heart" of Bulgaria.  The city of Golden Sands was built in 1956.  Architects and builders created a resort paradise intended to become a tourist mecca of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.  It was originally planned to create 60 hotels for receiving guests, but now this figure has doubled. </p><p>  In the 90s, privatization was carried out, thanks to which significant investments began to come into the tourist infrastructure of the resort.  The quality of services provided by vacationers has significantly improved and rose to a high level of European traditions.  Without exaggeration, the Golden Sands resort can be called a tourist metropolis, in the hotels of which (among them the Warsaw Hotel) at the same time up to 30 thousand people can relax.  The warm and mild climate allows the tourist season to last six months - from May to October.  The ability to plan your vacation in such a wide time range is an additional incentive for tourists from different countries to visit this place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  15 kilometers from the resort area is Varna - the third largest city in Bulgaria, a cultural, financial and commercial center and the largest port.  The ancient Black Sea ancient settlement is famous for its museums and exhibitions.  The History Museum features the world's oldest gold items made 600 years ago.  Museums of archeology and Renaissance, naval and nature science expositions - visiting Varna has become a tradition for vacationers on the golden beaches of the resort area.  Tourists often describe the impressions of visiting Varna in the most enthusiastic terms.  A special place among the reviews is occupied by the zoo and the dolphinarium located in it - a popular place of entertainment for many guests of Varna. </p><h2>  Hotel and rooms: on the basis of reasonable sufficiency </h2>

    <p>  When buying a tour, the vacationer chooses the appropriate food scheme: the standard offer of Varshava Hotel (BB) or other, broader, service options (HB, AI). </p><ol><li>  BB - <span>continental breakfast</span> included in the price (buffet).  The designation came from the English expression Bed and Breakfast - bed and breakfast. </li><li>  HB - half board, meals twice a day (breakfast and dinner). </li><li>  AI - already became a familiar spoiled overseas service to Russian tourists All Inclusive, which includes <span>full board</span> and additional meals in the form of a second breakfast, afternoon snack and snacks.  Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks (mainly locally produced) serve as a pleasant compensation for some appreciation of the resort pastime. </li></ol><p>  A separate section of the menu is dedicated to fans of vegetarianism. </p><p>  Guest reviews give a more complete picture of the level of service at the resort than the dry press releases of travel agencies in which the ticket is purchased.  <span>Golden Sands (Bulgaria</span> raised this Black Sea region to a high European level of service) are able to satisfy the pretentious tastes of gourmets with an excellent level of local cuisine and quality drinks. </p><h2>  Beach: Golden Necklace of the Black Sea </h2>

    <p>  The splendor of the Golden Sands beach area is worth staying separately.  Clean air, a coastal line in a green frame of a pine forest and parkland, overflowing horizon and a high bottomless sky - this is how a sunny beach meets visitors.  Golden Sands (Bulgaria considers them a precious pearl of its coast), according to one legend, got its splendor because of the gold that was once buried here by ruthless pirates robbing sailors.  Outraged by their cruelty, the nature crushed gold bars into sand and scattered it over the sea coast.  Apparently these were significant treasures - the one-hundred-meter gold coastline of the resort stretched for 3.5 km. </p><p>  Flowing fine sand, a <span>gentle beach,</span> warm and clear sea ... Bulgarian beaches belong to the state and there is free access to water anywhere on the coastline.  Some coastal areas are rented by businessmen who set up sun loungers, umbrellas, bamboo and reed pavilions on the shore - a small fee is required for use.  Near paid beaches there is a place for free relaxation, where you can sunbathe and swim without unnecessary financial costs.  In general, the democratic nature of rest can be called a feature that everyone who comes to Golden Sands feels.  Reviews of tourists indicate that it is possible to have a good rest and have fun on the coast without any special monetary expenses. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: entertainment around the clock </h2>

    <p>  A colorful resort promenade stretches along the beach and coastline.  Open <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> bars, street vendors and musicians - the vibrant atmosphere of seaside carefreeness is best felt in this part of the vibrant resort town.  There are several shopping centers in the walking distance.  Bowling, tennis, horse riding, minigolf will diversify the stay of vacationers after they leave the beach.  Golden Sands (Bulgaria is famous not only for its beaches) offer everyone to plunge into the world of excitement and illusions - visitors will find an open casino in the coastal zone. </p><p>  Not far from Varshava Hotel is another attraction of the resort - the water park "Aquapolis".  The International Association of Waterparks called it one of the most picturesque open water parks in Europe.  From the heights of the rides there is a unique view of the resort and the sea, merging on the horizon with the sky.  For visitors organized entertainment for every taste - children's and adult pools, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãextreme entertainment, slides, shooting gallery and a small climbing wall.  Many tourists take the whole day to visit this complex, alternating water fun with a bar and relaxing on the water park coastal zone. </p><p>  The resort has a large number of various attractions and entertainments - carousels, cars, discos, youth parties and the Ferris Wheel, which offer magnificent views of the surrounding nature.  The heat of the day is replaced by a cool southern night, when the center of gravity moves from the sea into the depth of entertainment complexes, without which it is impossible to imagine tours to Bulgaria.  Golden sands do not fall asleep during the holiday season - the heady Black Sea air gives extra strength. </p><h2>  Excursions: a frozen chronicle of the world </h2>

    <p>  Holidays in Bulgaria are impossible without touching the history and culture of the Balkan state.  Each step along the ancient land, remembering the Thracians and the Odrisian kingdom, the empire of Alexander the Great and the chariot race of Ancient Rome, arouses curiosity and the desire to touch the millennial roots of the hospitable Slavic people.  The easiest way to quickly get to know the country is to book an excursion or rent a car yourself, or with the help of the staff of Varshava Hotel 2. Bulgaria (Varna is the nearest city) is a small country in which interesting places can be found in any of the nearby cities. </p><p>  Varna is the sea capital of Bulgaria. <strong> </strong>  The distance is 15 km.  Archaeologists have established that in the VI century BC.  e.  Odessos, a Greek colony, was located at this place.  Nowadays - a large modern tourist, cultural and historical center.  What to see: </p><p>  <em>1) Church of the Assumption of the Virgin - a</em> postcard symbol of the city.  The current temple, considered the most beautiful religious building in Bulgaria, was built at the end of the XIX century.  Located at the intersection of Botev and Barnenchik Boulevards. </p><p>  <em>2) Sea Temple</em> - has Russian roots.  It was built on money donated by the merchant Nikolai Paraskeva.  Once in a storm, he prayed to St.  Nicholas about salvation and promised in case of deliverance from dangers to build a temple in his honor.  The merchant fulfilled the promise and donated 50 thousand rubles for the construction.  The temple is located on the street of Prince Boris I. </p><p>  <em>3) The archaeological site of the late II century - Roman baths.</em> </p><p>  <em>4) Seaside park with dolphinariums and museums located in it.</em> </p><p>  <em>5) Aladzha is a rock monastery founded around the 12th century.</em> </p><p>  <em>6) The residence of the Bulgarian kings</em> - travelers from Varshava Hotel 2 * will certainly pass this place.  Located on the road from Varna to Golden Sands. </p><p>  Varna gave shelter to many Russian officers who did not accept the 1917 revolution and emigrated to Europe.  For 7 years (1949-1956) the city bore the name of Stalin, in the year of whose death the Black Sea froze. </p><h2>  Climate and ecology: cloudless sky above the natural park </h2>

    <p>  Each trip remains not only in memory, but also takes place on shelves and coffee tables in the form of souvenirs and memorable trinkets brought from the next vacation.  Should not fall out of this trend and rest in Bulgaria.  The prices of local products are flexible and a varied assortment is offered for the pleasure of tourists. </p><ol><li>  <em>Rose oil.</em>  The famous Valley of Roses, in which flowers are grown for three centuries.  Beware of fakes.  Each bottle of real rose oil is sealed and has a certificate.  And besides this, cosmetic creams and soap are made with rose oil.  Another original, purely Bulgarian souvenir is soap with dried rose petals. </li><li>  <em>Bulgarian wines.</em>  The falsification of wines in the country is prosecuted by law, so the quality of drinks is kept at a high level.  In addition, local winemakers have not forgotten about the famous roses and make liquor from their petals. </li><li>  And again the "pink" theme.  <em>Jam from rose petals</em> - surprisingly delicate and delicate.  You will not find such a delicacy in any other country in the world. </li><li>  <em>Cooker masks.</em>  Cookers are the patrons of fertility, driving away evil spirits.  In their honor, an annual festival is held in Bulgaria.  Masks are wooden, leather, fur ... </li><li>  <em>National embroidery of Chevychev.</em>  Filigree Bulgarian patterns and very delicate work. </li><li>  <em>Copper Products.</em>  Can be purchased on any street artisans.  Often, a souvenir is made by the master right in front of the buyer. </li><li> <em>Ceramics.</em>  Products of national pottery for all occasions - cups, plates, jugs, wineglasses.  At the request of the client, commemorative inscriptions are applied to the ceramics.  Many vacationers book the inscription: "Golden Sands, Bulgaria."  Product prices depend on the size of the product and place of purchase. </li></ol><p>  There are also original attributes of the Martenitsa holiday in the form of amulets, figurines, wicker paintings.  Martenitsa‚Äôs spring celebration (in honor of the first spring day on March 1) has long been associated with well-being, happiness and health. </p><h2>  Rest always begins and ends the same: the road </h2>

    <p>  Having become the owner of a paid tour to Bulgaria with accommodation at the Varshava Hotel, you can get to the Black Sea coast of Golden Sands in various ways: </p><p>  1) <em>Air transport.</em>  There are several regular flights to Varna from Moscow airports.  Travel time (Domodedovo Airport) - 3 hours 25 minutes. </p><p>  2) <em>Railway transport.</em>  In the summer months, direct trains Moscow - Varna run daily.  The route passes through the territory of Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Serbia.  Travel time is 65 hours. </p><p>  3) <em>Bus routes.</em>  Those who wish can take advantage of one of the many offers of bus operators, which have already gained popularity among passengers because of their low cost. </p><p>  4) <em>Road transport.</em>  The ability to travel several Eastern European countries on their own attracts a large number of motorists.  Such a trip in itself can become an interesting and informative vacation.  Upon arrival at Golden Sands, the problem with parking for a car is solved simply - the Warsaw Hotel provides its customers with a free parking space at the hotel. </p>
