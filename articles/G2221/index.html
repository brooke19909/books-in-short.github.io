It is located on the banks of the river and has stunning promenades and beaches.  For residents there are many places to relax and for every taste.  But the most popular are, of course, water parks.  Water procedures and attractions are very loved by the locals, large and small. </p><h2>  "Chip" - a water park in Voronezh: photos and description </h2><p>  Water parks are located on the left bank of the reservoir.  One of them is in the territory of the Dolphin park, which was once the most favorite vacation spot of the city residents. </p>

Due to the frequent change of owners, the park became desolate.  And only recently began to revive.  In its northern part an entertainment complex has opened, which includes a water park.
