And it takes far from last place there.  It‚Äôs not enough to say that Palolem is a popular beach.  He is megapopular.  In addition to foreign tourists vacationing in Goa, many Indians from neighboring states come there on weekends.  Palolem enjoys the same popularity among local residents as Sochi has among Russians.  Therefore, if you are looking for peace and quiet, then you are definitely not here.  But the guidebooks call Palolem a "paradise."  And this is largely true.  Beautiful hills surround Palolem on three sides, and on the fourth a turquoise sea stretched out.  If they allowed to paradise without any quota, this beach really could be called heavenly.  But at the entrance to Palolem is not St. Peter with the keys.  Only a few cows, according to the custom of India, lie peacefully at the shops.  What do tourists say about Palolem?  Below you will find a detailed overview of the beach, compiled by reviews of tourists.  How to get there, hotels, prices - all these nuances of relaxation will be reflected in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palolem Beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492158.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Palolem Beach (Goa): where is it and how to get there </h2><p>  This paradise nestled in the southernmost part of the state.  Goa has only one international airport - Dabolim.  It is located in the city of Vasco da Gama.  On the map, the distance between the airport and Palolem beach is relatively small - sixty-seven kilometers.  But, based on the complexity of Indian roads and traffic on them, the travel time, even by taxi, will be about two hours.  Such a trip, by the way, will cost two thousand rupees (about 30 US dollars).  An alternative to a taxi is a bus.  You need to sit in the one that goes to the city of Margao.  And there already transfer to the next bus to Canacona.  But you don‚Äôt need to go to the final station.  Ask the driver to drop you off at Palolem.  The travel time by bus will last up to four hours, but the price will be one hundred and twenty rupees (two dollars).  Palolem Beach can also be reached by train.  The nearest Canacona station is three kilometers away.  You can come directly to the beach by bus or taxi.  The latter will cost only two dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Palolem Beach Feature </h2><p>  Now let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs worth covering such a distance in order to find ourselves in the extreme south of the state of Goa.  The coastline of Palolem is not a record - only about two kilometers.  Depth is optimal for those who do not hold well on water.  For quite some time, the bottom is felt under the feet.  Palolem takes 1st place in the list of "Best beaches of South Goa" for cleanliness.  It is cleaned and tidied daily.  Palolem is located in the bay, and therefore there are no big waves here.  But the width of the beach is insignificant, and at high tide (and this happens in the evenings) only a narrow strip of sand of several meters remains.  Reviews repeatedly mention the bright colors of Palolem.  This is emphasized by houses painted in festive, cheerful colors.  By the way, it is forbidden to build concrete buildings in Palolem.  Therefore, there are no tasteless barracks, as on Arambol.  Palolem - a place of all kinds of parties.  Fun is guaranteed to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palolem Goa" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay in Palolem </h2><p>  The main type of accommodation here are beach bungalows.  Palolem (Goa) is planted with palm trees that create a shadow.  Therefore, in simple houses made of boards with a roof made of leaves, it is quite cozy.  Reviews recommended Abel Cressida Bungalow Complex.  It is located in the very center of Palolem.  There are houses right on the beach, but there are also in the garden.  In these bungalows the traveler will find a minimal set of services.  This is a bed under a mosquito canopy, wardrobe, table.  But all this comes with a shower with hot water, a terrace with chairs and a hammock and high-speed Wi-Fi.  And the price is more than appetizing.  If you book your bungalow in advance, you can count on eight dollars a night.  Usually a house by the sea costs ten $ per day.  But, of course, there are quite chic cottages, the night in which will cost fifty to sixty dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Bungalow Palole Goa" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492190.jpg" width="600"></div>

The price for them is the same as that of the huts on the shore, but more comfort.  Of course, guesthouses on Palolem (Goa) beach are located far from the sea - this is the reason for their low cost (about ten dollars per night).  The best in this category of housing reviews are called Sun N Moon.  Air conditioning, spacious rooms, well-functioning plumbing, cleanliness, wi-fi, friendly staff ... And to go to the sea only three minutes.  ‚ÄúAlba Rooms‚Äù will appeal to those who are tired of noise (and on the Palolem beach itself it is observed throughout the tourist season).  The guesthouse is located near the bus station, among the greenery.  It‚Äôs just as quiet, tourists say, at Princes Cottages.  The rooms of this guesthouse are clean, there is hot water, fast Internet, sincere hosts.  Go to the sea for about two minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of south goa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  But Palolem beach attracts not only budget tourists.  The resort has several pretty decent hotels.  Judging by the Russian-language reviews, the leader in popularity is the Palolem Inn.  A night in this hotel will cost sixty dollars per room.  The Fern Gardenia Resort Hotel belongs to the same price category.  Good quality-price ratio at the Camaxi Beach Hotel.  For six hundred thirty-five Russian rubles, you have at your disposal a cozy bedroom with a bathroom and a veranda.  This hotel complex of cottages is located near the edge of the sea.  Another worthy hotel - Tubki Resort - offers rooms with Wi-Fi for fifty-three dollars a day.  But in view of the huge popularity of the resort, hotels here need to be booked in advance.  At the peak of the tourist season, you can stay nearby - in the town of Kanakona or on the coast of Putnam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South goa palolem" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492161.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Private sector rental </h2><p>  If you come to Palolem beach for a long time (a month or more), tourists recommend renting a house, floor or room with the local population.  Prices for such housing are comparable to the cost of the private sector in neighboring Arambol.  For the floor in the house, depending on the level of comfort, they ask from fifteen to twenty thousand rupees per month (250-320 US dollars).  A room will cost many times cheaper.  The only minus of such accommodation is that the houses of peasants are not on the shore.  This option is good for tourists who rent a motorbike or car.  It is even cheaper to rent a house in Canacone for long term rent.  There is more choice and lower prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palolem beach tourist reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  Palolem Beach has no shortage of restaurants, cafes and shekels.  The last catering establishments are especially in demand among tourists, especially in the daytime, since they stand on the beach itself and have umbrellas and sunbeds.  You can make a small order in the shack and at least sunbathe all day for free on its territory.  Since Palolem (Goa) is a fishing village that has only recently turned into a resort, deliciously prepared seafood is offered in local cafes and restaurants.  Do not be afraid of food poisoning, which happens so often with Europeans in India - all this living creature swam for another hour.  If you remain an adherent of traditional cuisine, tourists recommend visiting such establishments: the pizzeria Magic Italy, Fernandez (near the church), a restaurant on the beach Samir.  You can have a drink at the British Smaglers Inn pub or the Cool Breeze jazz cafe.  All cafes prepare delicious fresh juices and cocktails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palolem Goa beach where is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492196.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The geographical position of the beach allows you to explore South Goa in detail.  Palolem is in close proximity to the Agonda.  This very beautiful and quiet beach has the ruins of the old fort of Cabo da Rama.  Only half a day will take an excursion to the Cotigao National Nature Park.  Tourists recommend a trip to the Dudhsagar Falls.  Its name translates as "Milk Sea".  It is one of the hundred highest waterfalls in the world.  A popular excursion to Palolem is swimming with dolphins.  The boat leaves at dawn or at sunset, when bottlenose dolphins come to feed in the bay.  You can go trekking or canyoning through the local jungle and the Solena River. </p><h2>  Palolem Beach: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Summarize.  What are the pros and cons of Palolem beach?  This is a good place for budget travelers.  You can rent a house right on the beach even for eight dollars a day.  The beach is very clean by Indian standards.  There are few cows, therefore, traces of their vital functions too.  The resort has a lot of shekels and budget cafes.  The average cost of dishes in them is about three hundred rupees.  Even cheaper products at the Main Bazaar.  You can buy a whole bag of vegetables and fruits for half a dollar.  Most homes offer high-speed Wi-Fi, which is rare in India.  The beach itself is very convenient for swimming, especially for those who are not confident in their ability to deal with waves.  Far prominent in the sea capes pacify the surf.  Great conditions for snorkeling and diving.  The only negative, according to tourists, is the crowded beach.  For privacy, choose Agonda. </p>
