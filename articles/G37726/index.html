    <p>  The Kremlin Diamond Fund was created in 1719 by Peter the Great.  The last Russian Tsar established the rules according to which all the most valuable things (primarily related to various coronation regalia) belonged to the Russian state and were constantly kept in the treasury under round-the-clock protection.  Only three officials, gathered together, could get precious items intended for certain ceremonies.  This is the royal rentmeister, chamber adviser and chamber president.  Each of these people had their own key to one of the locks.  Initially, the chamber, which was specially built by decree of Peter the Great to store various valuables, was referred to in the official documents as the Diamond Fund, but a little later it was renamed the Diamond Room.  The boyars had to guard the treasury day and night and were responsible for the royal jewelry with their own heads. </p><h2>  From the Romanovs to the present day </h2>

Initially, the adopted set of rules changed, but the order of storage of jewelry remained always unchanged.  During the reign of the old noble family of the Romanovs, the room in which all the values ‚Äã‚Äãwere located was called the Diamond Room.  In 1914, during the First World War, there was a direct threat of the loss of royal jewelry.  For this reason, the entire collection was moved from the Winter Palace, located in St. Petersburg, to the Armory <span>of Moscow.</span>  In January 1922, by decision of a specially created commission for the selection and examination of values, part of the jewelry was transferred to museums.  The other half went to Gokhran - the State repository of values, which became a kind of successor to the treasury of the Imperial family.  In 1925, coronation regalia and other jewelry were first put on public display at the House of Unions.  In October 1967, the government decided to create a permanent exhibition in the Moscow Kremlin. </p><h2>  Diamond Fund Exposition </h2>

Throughout the entire period of its existence, it was gradually replenished with orders, rare gems and other precious stones.  At the same time, a special jewelry laboratory created to carry out the restoration of destroyed values, such as, for example, the Small and Large Imperial Crowns, as well as other items belonging to the imperial family, made an enormous contribution to the collection of the fund.  Thanks to very fine professional work, more than a hundred jewelry were returned to the fund.

In the first, visitors can see domestic diamonds and diamonds, artwork from semiprecious and precious stones, made by Soviet jewelers, as well as platinum and gold nuggets.  The most famous of the latter are Mephistopheles, Camel and the Big Triangle, which weighs thirty-six kilograms.

By the way, the latter are also represented in this room.  This is mainly the work of the masters of the Smolensk factory.  A special place is given to the Russian Gems showcase, which demonstrates the diversity and richness of Russian colored stones.  Today, the exhibition includes an extensive collection of sapphires, emeralds, topazes and amethysts.  In addition to all of the above, contemporary art is presented in the first hall and rare photo documents are shown that characterize the achievements of the Soviet-era diamond mining industry. </p>

    <h2>  The second hall of the fund </h2><p>  The second hall of the fund presents a variety of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãand jewelry of the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, which until 1917 were among the crown values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Russian Empire.  Most of the jewelry is made in the style of classicism and rococo.  The latter is most pronounced in the "Big Bouquet" made of Brazilian diamonds and Colombian emeralds and serving as a decoration for the corsage of the formal dress of Elizabeth Petrovna.  In addition, the work of one of the most famous jewelers of the eighteenth century - Duval and Nozier, is represented in the second hall by the Diamond Fund.  The museum also offers visitors to get acquainted with a variety of costume jewelry - epaulets, stripes, laces with tassels and hairpins, studded with diamonds of various sizes.  Two historical stones of the foundation are exhibited here - the largest chrysolite in the world, brought from the Seberget island, and the famous diamond from India called "Shah", weighing eighty-eight carats and whose incredible history is engraved by skilled craftsmen on the stone itself.  And finally, it is in the second room that the Great Imperial Crown, which was made in 1762, is kept.  In terms of richness of material, beauty and subtlety of jewelry work, it has no equal.  Spinel, crowning it and weighing more than three hundred and ninety-eight carats, is the sixth historical foundation stone.  Its transparency and purity allow us to confidently classify it among the most beautiful in the world. </p>
