In almost any bank, you can ask for a loan in order to make an important expensive purchase.  Important: before going to a financial institution in order to get a loan, familiarize yourself with the terms and characteristics of the product in order to choose the most profitable and convenient option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aspirantsg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For what purpose" class="if uuid-2511725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511725.jpg"></div><h2>  For what purposes can I get money on credit </h2><p>  Making loans at banks is a very convenient opportunity that will allow you to make important purchases, start a business, or solve any other current financial issues without delay.  When receiving money in debt, the client should state the purpose of obtaining funds, because the parameters, conditions and characteristics of the banking product may depend on this.  The main types of bank loans are the following: </p><ul><li>  Mortgage.  Making a loan involves the acquisition of real estate or land.  As a rule, the bank draws up a pledge on the loaned property in order to receive payment guarantees.  In this case, if the client for some reason cannot or does not want to fully repay the debt, the financial institution has the right to put up for sale property to pay off the debt.  In general, taking real estate on credit is a fairly reasonable decision.  Indeed, in order to save up for such a significant purchase, it will take a lot of time.  In addition, the client, in this way, fixes the cost of real estate for himself, and yet this figure can change due to jumps in the exchange rate, which, as you know, are often. <div class="photo" data-original="www.businessmantraa.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of bank loans in Russia" class="if uuid-2511740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511740.jpg"></div></li><li>  Car loan.  As a rule, banking institutions have contracts with car dealerships.  This facilitates the mission of the client who wants to buy a car, because the place of purchase of a car has already been determined.  In addition, raising money for a car is also not easy.  Therefore, obtaining a loan will help to rationally distribute income and pay obligations in fixed amounts over the period specified in the contract. </li><li>  Personal loan.  This lending option involves a lot.  Such loans are issued for the purchase of necessary things for an apartment, home, for travel, for repairs.  The purpose of receiving funds can be anything.  The rate and terms of the banking product will depend on the amount and terms of the obligations. </li></ul><p>  Having determined the purpose of borrowing money from the bank, a person and a bank employee will be able to choose the most relevant, beneficial and suitable type of loan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The process of obtaining a loan at the bank </h2><p>  The decision to grant loans is made in each bank differently.  Typically, financial institutions give an answer to a client‚Äôs request within 24 hours, in some banks this decision is made within a few hours or instantly.  In any case, when a client arrives at a branch of a lending bank, the employee will inform you about the timing and features of the product design.  As a rule, the design sequence is standard: </p><ol><li>  The loan manager enters the basic data into the system on the basis of personal documents received by hand.  Then comes the authentication of the data and the credit history of the person who wants to receive money from the bank. </li><li>  If everything is in order with the first form, the specialist will clarify the details with the client, such as the place of work, phone numbers of relatives or friends, and also enter information about education, work experience and everything that the program requests into the system. <div class="photo" data-original="www.magicalcredit.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get a loan from a bank" class="if uuid-2511715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511715.jpg"></div></li><li>  After entering additional data, the process of checking the questionnaire starts.  If the verification was successful and the application is approved, the client receives funds on hand or on a bank payment card. </li></ol><h2>  What are loans </h2><p>  Credit products are distributed in many ways.  The main one is the debt repayment scheme.  Two payment schemes are offered for customers: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Annuity.  This repayment scheme involves the distribution of debt for the entire period in equal parts.  Thus, the client can rationally calculate his money, regardless of the loan term. </li><li>  In decreasing payments.  In such a scheme, first the payments are larger in amount, then they become smaller over time.  This option will allow the client to reduce the credit burden in the future. </li></ul><p>  When applying for a loan, bank employees offer the client a choice of a program.  Sometimes, depending on the level of income of the credited and age, a loan can be provided only according to one of the schemes. </p><h2>  Sberbank  Features and conditions </h2><p>  Making a loan at Sberbank is a common service among citizens.  The bank offers different conditions, they depend on the age, financial capabilities and credit load of the client.  The main parameters of loans at Sberbank are as follows: </p><ul><li>  An initial fee.  As a rule, a part of the amount of the purchased property is required when making loans for real estate.  At the moment, the bank does not provide a mortgage loan service.  But at the time when real estate lending was, the client needed to pay from 15 to 20% of the total cost of the apartment, house. </li><li>  Interest rate.  Depending on the amount, loan term and purpose of obtaining funds, the base annual interest rate can vary from 9.5 to 20.9%. <div class="photo" data-original="informator.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conditions for obtaining a loan at Sberbank" class="if uuid-2511732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511732.jpg"></div></li><li>  Loan terms.  The period for which loans are issued at Sberbank ranges from 3 months to 5 years.  It all depends on the amount and financial capabilities of the client. </li><li>  The loan amount is from 30,000 rubles to 500,000 rubles.  The size of loans is calculated depending on the needs of the client and financial load. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank can pick up a loan for different needs and with varying conditions. </p><h2>  Customer reviews of loans in different banks of Russia </h2><p>  As with any bank service, some citizens like loan products, and some are indignant.  Often customers write that Sberbank has the most comfortable and loyal conditions.  However, there are those who are dissatisfied.  For example, there is discontent caused by the lack of professionalism of specialists. </p><p>  At VTB Bank, customers often take loan products.  There are also many opinions and reviews about him.  Typically, customers are satisfied with the speed of disbursement of funds, favorable interest rates.  And there are clients who insist that they overpay fabulous amounts, paying off a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.forexmagnates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on loans in Russian banks" class="if uuid-2511736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511736.jpg"></div><p>  Often there are reviews of Alfa Bank.  Almost everyone responds that the bank has transparent and understandable conditions.  But there are opinions that the interest rates of this institution are too high. </p><p>  You can read a lot of reviews about each of the banks.  Someone is happy with the opportunity to get a loan and buy what you need.  And others can endlessly talk about how high interest rates are in a financial institution.  In any case, it is not always worth starting from reviews, because the same banking product can cause different opinions among people.  The main thing is to familiarize yourself with the terms of the proposed loans and clarify the details with the manager.  And then choose the conditions that are best suited. </p><h2>  What documents are required to apply for a loan </h2><p>  To get money from a bank, it is not required to collect documents for months.  For registration, it is enough to take with you identity documents.  And in some financial institutions they also require a certificate of income confirmation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quickbooks.intuit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chance to get a loan" class="if uuid-2511730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2511730.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes additional documents may be required to increase the chance of obtaining a loan.  These nuances are negotiated individually. </p><h2>  How to increase the chance of getting a loan </h2><p>  An employee is unlikely to be able to provide assistance in obtaining a loan.  The main thing that a bank representative can do for a client is to correctly and comprehensively enter information voiced by a person who wants to get a loan.  You can increase the chances of obtaining a loan by disclosing information about yourself as much as possible.  The client should prepare by writing down the date of employment, dates of birth of close relatives and other details that will increase the chances of getting a loan. </p><p>  Credit is a very convenient service that opens up prospects and opportunities.  The main thing is to comply with the terms of the contract and pay obligations in a timely manner. </p>
