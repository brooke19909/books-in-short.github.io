Holidays in Cuba</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cuba is the hot tropical sun, coral reefs, white sand beaches, clear ocean water, the widest fishing opportunities, stunningly beautiful nature, and, of course, comfortable living conditions for everyone who decided to stay at the Aguas Azules hotel.  Reviews about both the country in general and this hotel in particular are mostly filled with flattering epithets and enthusiastic exclamations. </p><h2>  Sights of Cuba </h2><p>  Perhaps, acquaintance with Cuba, as well as with many other countries, is worth it from its capital - Havana.  This city is located on the <span>Gulf of Mexico.</span>  The old part of the <span>capital of Cuba</span> today looks almost the same as in the colonial period.  Here you can see rectangular squares, churches and houses built in the Baroque style, as well as defensive fortresses at the entrance to the bay.  And these are just some of the <span>sights of Havana</span> that each tourist center of Cuba offers to visit its customers. </p><p>  Slightly inferior to Havana regarding the historical heritage of Santiago de Cuba.  However, the inhabitants of this city are very hospitable and cheerful, having talked with them, tourists can learn a lot about the Cuban culture.  In addition, on the territory of Santiago de Cuba there are many museums and exhibition halls that are certainly worth a visit. </p><p>  Holidays in Cuba are unthinkable without a visit to the island of Cayo Coco - a nature reserve with sandy beaches stretching for 20 kilometers.  The road connecting these two parts of the land deserves special attention.  After all, it passes right by the sea and fits perfectly into the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Active holidays in Cuba </h2><p>  For most tourists, vacation in Cuba is associated with sunny beaches, amazing swimming in the ocean waters and fiery evening and afternoon shows with Latin American dances and great music.  However, Cuba can offer no less options for an interesting pastime to active people. </p><p>  There are 30 centers for diving fans in Cuba, where you can either rent equipment for <span>scuba diving</span> and learn the basics of scuba diving, if you are still completely new to this business.  There are excellent surfing opportunities in Cuba.  However, those who plan to engage in this sport should think about this in advance.  Indeed, despite the suitable <span>natural conditions</span> for surfing, there is nowhere to rent a board, you only need to bring it with you. </p><p>  Fishing, exciting spearfishing, trips on a catamaran, yacht, boat, a trip through the jungle, a jeep safari - all this Cuba can offer its guests.  Tourism in the country is developed quite well, so if you can not limit yourself in your means, you will open the most exotic corners of this country. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Spacious grounds, clean rooms, a luxurious beach - all this is said by tourists who once rested in Aguas Azules.  The reviews are also filled with many good words about the hotel staff.  However, there is a "fly in the ointment": some tourists claim that the territory looks well-groomed only in residential buildings and pools, and if you go to a tennis court or soccer field, the impression is not the best. </p><p>  The reviews also note that the hotel corresponds to a solid 3 stars, so if you hear somewhere about the Aguas Azules 4 * hotel, check this information.  Perhaps this is a different housing option, or someone was wrong in giving a description. </p>
