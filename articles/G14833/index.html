There is also a well-developed <span>tourist infrastructure,</span> and there are many attractions that make this city very attractive for travelers around the world. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The sunniest state of America is Florida.

    <p>  This resort got its worldwide fame thanks to the largest thematic attractions located nearby and various amusement parks: Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and many others.  In addition, in this metropolis there is almost always a bright sun shining, as well as a huge number of <span>restaurants, museums,</span> supermarkets, chic hotels and many interesting places with beautiful nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, by far the most popular tourist destination in America is the state of Florida.  Orlando is visited annually by more than 52 million vacationers.  Such an influx of visitors allows the region to actively develop. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  This state may have different weather conditions.  Florida (Orlando) is influenced by the subtropics, so the year here is divided into two seasons.  In early June, a hot and rainy period begins, which lasts until about October.  Heavy rainfall in Orlando at this time of the year, and air temperature rarely even drops below +22 <span>degrees Celsius</span> even in the dark <span>.</span>  In the daytime, the thermometer can go up to +38 <sup></sup> , and the increased humidity in the street creates a feeling of even greater heat. </p><p>  The second season in Florida begins in late September and lasts until May.  During this period, mild, pleasant and sunny weather is observed in Orlando.  Humidity is low, and the average temperature during the day is 22 degrees Celsius.  At night in winter, the thermometer can drop to +10 degrees. </p>

The sights of this metropolis have become famous all over the world, but it is difficult to imagine them without seeing them at least once with your own eyes.  The main one is the local "Disneyland", in the territory of which there is always the opportunity to see many heroes from different cartoons and ride exciting rides.  It consists of four zones, two water parks, twenty hotels, several large shops, many cafes and other different places for sports and leisure activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the special pride of this metropolis is Epcot.  This center is a small town modeling the community of the future.  It is divided into two parts, in one of them there are different pavilions in which exhibits from around the world are presented.  In the second, people can see models of the Earth, spacecraft, time machines, as well as a huge model of the planet with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11 thousand hectares. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, Universal Film Park enjoys special success among film buffs.

    <p>  In addition, the state of Florida, including Orlando, has picturesque botanical gardens, pristine beaches and beautiful lakes.  You should also go on an exciting excursion to the Space Center, where you can see the launch pads.  It is located on Merritt Island and is named after President <span>George F. Kennedy,</span> who sent the first man to the moon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Famous expositions of the metropolis </h2><p>  In addition to all kinds of entertainment and parks, there is also something to see in Orlando (Florida).  The attractions of this city, attracting millions of tourists, are museums.  One of them is the famous Ripley's Believe It or Not, which is able to give its visitors the opportunity to see unimaginable spectacles with their own eyes.  In its exhibition halls are collected all kinds of interesting exhibits from all over the world.  Here, to my great surprise, you can find the skeleton of a mermaid, the skulls of cannibals, the sculpture of Marilyn Monroe, made of banknotes, and much more. </p><p>  One of the most famous science museums in the world is Orlando Science Center, located in the city of Orlando (Florida).

    <h2>  Reviews and travel tips </h2><p>  Travelers who visited this American resort speak of it as the world capital of children's entertainment.  From the first minutes of your stay at the airport of this city, you might think that you find yourself in a certain fairy tale. </p><p>  Life in Orlando (Florida) is much cheaper than, for example, in Chicago or New York.  But many experienced tourists advise those who are going on a trip not to forget that in this state a tax of 11% is included for all services and products.  Since it is not registered in any price in this city, you should add it to the value of a particular thing in advance in your mind. </p><p>  In general, all tourists who have been to Orlando take home a lot of positive emotions and indescribable impressions. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The state of Florida, Orlando in particular, is not connected with Moscow by direct flights, so you need to fly there with transfers.  First you will need to head to New York, and then take the plane and fly to Orlando.  The total cost of the trip will cost about $ 400. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better not to travel by train or bus from New York, as such a trip will last more than twenty hours, and ticket prices are not much cheaper. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It is simply unbelievable that Disneyland employs more than 67 thousand people, so this park is America's largest employer.  Throughout its history, it stopped working just five times when hurricanes were approaching Florida. </p><p>  Kodak estimates that approximately 50 percent of amateur photographs taken in the United States are shot in parks in Orlando. </p>
