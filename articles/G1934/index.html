    <h2>  General description of the city </h2><p>  The presence of large cities is famous for Norway.  Trondheim is the third most populated city in the country.  It is located at the mouth of the Nidelva River on the coast of the Trondheim Fjord.  There are many attractions in Trondheim, but you can get around them on foot.  This city has a wonderful climate: in mid-January, the temperature rarely drops below three degrees below zero.  Both fauna and flora are diverse, and the fjord never freezes. </p><p>  Norway, Trondheim in particular, is a major scientific and industrial center.  In the country, as in the city we are describing, there are many institutes, universities, factories and enterprises that have become famous throughout the world.  Trondheim is considered the first capital of the state, and it was here that Saint Olaf was killed.  And over his grave was built the cathedral Nidaros, in which even today the coronation ceremonies of the Norwegian monarchs are held. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Trondheim is located in the center of Scandinavia.  He was repeatedly destroyed by fires.  After another invasion of fire in 1681, the city was completely rebuilt.  But even after that, despite the measures taken to prevent fires, the village burned several more times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trondheim city norway" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1360333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Royal Stevesgarden Residence is another masterpiece of Norwegian ancient architecture.  The building was built in 1788.  The Stevesgarden is the largest palace of wood.  The building is designed in an eclectic style, with elements of a rococo and antique style. </p><p>  The Nidelva River is a natural landmark and a gem of Trondheim.  In the summer season here you can watch the breathtaking beauty of the sunsets.  The best view of the river opens from the Marinen Park. </p><h2>  The most interesting city holiday </h2><p>  Norway (Trondheim) is interesting for its local traditions and national holidays.  One of the most colorful national events is St. Olav's Day, which takes place in Trondheim in late July. </p><p>  The celebration is dedicated to Olaf II Haraldson, king, who ruled the village at the beginning of the XI century.  Christian traditions in Norway were finally established precisely during the reign of this king.  But because of his views, the monarch was forced to leave his homeland, and when he decided to go back, he was killed in one of the battles. </p><p>  Now every year, residents of Trondheim organize a ten-day festival in honor of their heavenly patron.  During the celebration, various open-air concerts, theatrical performances and various competitions are held.  And on the first day of the holiday, services are held in the Nidaros Cathedral, where the relics of the saint are stored. </p><h2>  Features of a stay in Trondheim </h2><p>  If you decide to visit the city of Trondheim (Norway), then you should know some nuances.  So, young women who expect to drink alcohol in restaurants and dance in nightclubs must have a passport with them.  In such establishments there are age restrictions on the sale of alcohol. </p><p>  The village maintains perfect cleanliness.  A large fine will have to be paid for garbage thrown away in an inappropriate place.  Bottles and cans of beer can not be thrown away, but taken at any point of sale that sells a foamy drink.  Many stores offer good cash rewards for returning used containers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trondheim norway how to get" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1362093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Outside Trondheim </h2><p>  Tourists will be interested not only in Trondheim itself (Norway), the photo of which we propose to see, but also its surroundings.  Having decided on a trip outside the city, you must visit the town of Styklestad, which is 95 kilometers from the city.  This town played a big role in the history of the development of Norway itself.  Here is the altar of the Church of Stiklestad.  It was in this place, back in 1030, the beloved King of the Norwegians Olaf II, who, after his death, was counted among the saints. </p>
