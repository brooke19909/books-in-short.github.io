However, despite the era of plastic cards and contactless payments, very often you have to pay or deal with cash.  And in such cases, if you want to or not, you are faced with the need to exchange money for small things, which is often a big problem.  Today, there are many ways to exchange - from the most traditional, such as buying something in a store, to more complex ones, expressed in a trip to financial and commercial institutions.  Let's analyze in detail where to exchange money for a trifle? </p><h2>  Exchange in banking institutions </h2><p>  To exchange paper money for a trifle in a bank does not present any difficulties.  However, before visiting the bank you need to be sure of the authenticity of banknotes that are subject to exchange. </p><p>  Until recently, this service was provided on completely free terms, and now each commercial bank has the right to indicate its percentage for providing this option.  So, for example, the most popular PJSC Sberbank in Russia takes away 1-2% of the amount exchanged in its favor.  However, this option is suitable only if you need to exchange a large number of five thousand notes for fairly small money, otherwise the passage of this procedure is pointless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ules.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recalculation of exchange notes" class="if uuid-2884975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884975.jpg"></div><h2>  Rules for exchanging banknotes for trifles in a bank </h2><p>  If, nevertheless, the need for an exchange of a bill for a trifle has arisen, some requirements will have to be observed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, when contacting any branch of the bank, you must have an identity document with you (passport, driver's license). </p><p>  Secondly, a document (application) is drawn up, in which all information about an individual, as well as the face value and number of the bill, which must be exchanged, are written in detail. </p><p>  Next, the cashier checks the authenticity of the banknote and issues a change in the exchange currency you have indicated.  It can be paper money with a face value less than shown to the cashier or small coins.  After the cashier makes a note on the application for the operation and gives small money to the visitor of the bank. </p><p>  It is necessary to remember about the commission, which each bank sets at its discretion.  Therefore, before conducting this operation, you should check with the administrator regarding this detail, since the percentage value can vary not only from bank to bank, but even be different in one institution, in its different branches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jar with coins" class="if uuid-2884969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884969.jpg"></div><h2>  Why the bank may refuse to exchange a large bill </h2><p>  The method of exchanging money in the bank is the least common service of all possible.  Obviously, banking institutions, like no one else, deal with banknotes and must freely conduct any operations, but in practice, not every bank has such an option in the general list of services provided.  So, when visiting another bank for an exchange, it should be borne in mind that you may be denied regardless of the status of a financial institution, and you will have to accept the position of the bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to exchange bills for trifles, if not at an ATM </h2><p>  One of the easiest and at the same time unpretentious ways of exchange is an ATM.  The exchange is convenient in that transactions can be carried out 24 hours a day, and for this you need to have only the appropriate bank card.  The process is completely simple - we replenish the card account, and then remove the necessary amount with small bills.  But even with this method of exchange there is a difficulty, since at the ATM there are not always small money and options for withdrawing and replenishing an account. </p><p>  However, this option is one of the fastest, and even if you can‚Äôt exchange it for trifles, at least you can exchange it for a lower denomination, which will further facilitate the exchange process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money in hand" class="if uuid-2884971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884971.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to exchange bills for trifles in public transport </h2><p>  Each of us has experience in using public transport.  This is a story for everyone.  Someone uses it every day, and someone even forgot the number of the bus or tram that goes towards his house.  However, most of us found ourselves in an awkward situation when driving on a tram or trolleybus, if in the morning we handed a <span>five-thousandth note</span> to the conductor with a secret desire to exchange it for smaller notes and coins. </p><p>  In some cases, you can travel to your destination for free, and therefore, stay with the same large bill.  And the picture is radically opposite, if you turn to the conductor with a similar request at the end of the work shift.  After all, each conductor hands over the accumulated cash, reports and recounts it, and is happy to exchange the little thing accumulated during the day for the large bills you have proposed.  This exchange method has a drawback.  In case of exchanging a large proposed banknote for coins, the time for mutual settlement may be delayed, despite the fact that the time of arrival of vehicles at the depot at the end of the shift is strictly regulated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ohmconnect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money after exchange" class="if uuid-2884972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884972.jpg"></div><h2>  Subway Tokens as an Alternative </h2><p>  This method is good in cities with underground transport, as, collecting a large flow of passengers, cashiers always have a cash supply.  The next time you buy a token, you can always exchange your large amount for coins.  The advantage is the machines that also have the function of issuing change, which is good news. </p><h2>  Use a vending device </h2><p>  Under the Soviet regime, the question of where to exchange banknotes for trifles was not an acute issue for society, since special machines were very popular in which it was possible to exchange banknotes for trifles.  Such machines were everywhere.  Nowadays, these devices are not present in our lives, but some analogues are very rare - vending machines.  These devices are distinguished by the largest commission - up to 5%, but the device can not only exchange your banknote for a trifle, but also vice versa, accumulate all your accumulated coins and issue a new banknote. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dollarsprout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Initial exchange procedure" class="if uuid-2884968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884968.jpg"></div><p>  Often, such devices are installed in conjunction with a light snack by analogy with a vending machine, and if you pay attention to such devices, you will notice that you come across models not only with your favorite coffee and chocolate, but also those that can give out a bargaining chip.  Here you can also simply exchange a bill, if in a hurry to lower the banknote into the machine, but not make an order.  And the question of where you can change money for a trifle closes. </p><h2>  Other ways to exchange notes </h2><p>  The most obvious way that most people are guided is to go to the nearest store (stall, kiosk, pavilion) and buy some small goods such as chewing gum or ice cream.  Often, sellers reluctantly part with the bargaining chip accumulated during the day, and the situation is especially difficult in the early morning or in the morning, when there are clearly few coins at the box office.  As practice and logic show, it is better to make a swap operation in the evening, when enough coins accumulate in stores, the number of visitors is minimized by the evening, and it is soon necessary to hand over the cash desk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different money bills" class="if uuid-2884970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107602/2884970.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, the question of where to exchange bills for trifles should no longer cause difficulties. </p><p>  Note that a few months ago, by order of the Central Bank of Russia, 2 new bills of 200 and 2,000 rubles were put into circulation in the Russian economy.  This action is necessary to facilitate payment transactions and reduce the load on the largest denomination of 5,000 rubles. </p><p>  In any case, everyone should consciously approach where to change paper money for a trifle, weighing the pros and cons, because you can not only not achieve the goal, but also get into an awkward position. </p>
