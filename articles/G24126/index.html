But this type of housing is quite comfortable, you can relax in it for quite a long time.  The article will focus on vacation in a bungalow in Thailand. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.870032" data-lng="100.99254100000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/0/4/5/16045.png"></div><h2>  What is a bungalow? </h2><p>  Today, quite often tours include accommodation in a bungalow, but many travelers have no idea what it is.  In their view, these are huts in which local residents live. </p><p>  A bungalow in Thailand on the shore is an ordinary house made in the architectural style inherent in this country.  It can have 2-3 small rooms, and there can be huge rooms.  The thing is that local residents do not divide dwellings into cottages, houses, apartments in houses and villas.  All living quarters for them are bungalows.  But earlier, small huts were called so, more similar to tents in which the whole family lived and hid from torrential rains and heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpapers13.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Relax in the bungalow" class="if uuid-3163329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3163329.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays in Thailand in a bungalow by the sea </h2><p>  Is it not a paradise vacation when a stone's throw from the mighty azure ocean on snow-white sand among exotic tropical thickets, in a place where the minimum number of people is, there is a bungalow in which you can settle in and have a good time?  Such a dream is quite feasible and real, including with a modest budget. </p><p>  Below are some interesting accommodation options. </p><h2>  Koh Payam, Koh Phangan and Koh Lanta Islands </h2><p>  Today, such traditional fishing-style bungalows on the beaches of Thailand are becoming less common, as many other areas are moving higher and higher in the tourism industry.  But there are still such huts in sufficient numbers on the islands of Koh Phangan, Koh Lanta and Koh Payam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.internationaltraveller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Phangan Island" class="if uuid-3163341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3163341.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a holiday in a bungalow in Thailand, you should pay attention to the island of Koh Phangan, which gained popularity and worldwide fame for the Full Moon Party (noisy parties on Had Rinh beach) - the most beautiful part of the island in the shape of a crescent.  It should be noted that this place is not very crowded with vacationers.  Parties that are attended by about a thousand party-goers last only a few days a month, the rest of the time Koh Phangan is very calm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Less well-known among these islands for travelers is Ko Payam.  The relaxed hippy atmosphere prevails here.  Until now, this place is considered a secret island of the Thai state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitthailand.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koh Phayama Island" class="if uuid-3163339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3163339.jpg"></div><p>  All three islands have beautiful sandy beaches.  Holidays in Thailand in a bungalow in these places can bring a lot of pleasure.  The beaches have retained their original atmosphere of solitude and natural attractiveness.  They can accommodate in a hut worth about 800 baht (1670 rubles) per day.  The price depends on the location of the bungalow, the number of beds and the availability of air conditioning. </p><p>  When choosing between the islands of Koh Phangan and Koh Lanta, you should consider the seasons.  Since the first is in the Gulf of Siam, and the second is in the Andaman Sea, the rainy season in them occurs at different times.  On Koh Lanta, the rainy season lasts from June to October, and on Koh Phangan - November-December. </p><h2>  Vacation Bungalows in Phuket </h2><p>  Hotels with bungalows in Thailand are very popular among lovers of a quiet relaxing holiday.  Of course, accommodation does not guarantee that peace and quiet will reign, but, having settled in them, you can get rid of many neighbors.  The advantage of this holiday is that right from the room you can get to the beach or pool. </p><p>  This holiday is also popular on the island of Phuket, where many hotels have bungalows.
