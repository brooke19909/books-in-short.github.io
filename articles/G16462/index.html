    <h2>  What weather is characterized by November Phuket? </h2><p>  Together with November, the rainy season in Phuket ends.  There is already much less rainfall, and the temperature of water and air is close to comfortable.  All November is characterized by such parameters, that is, it doesn’t matter if you fly to Thailand at the beginning of the month or at the end. </p><p>  However, it is important to know that in October-November, rainfall, thunderstorms and cloudy weather are still possible in Phuket province. </p><p>  The time is approaching the high season, so with each November day the weather is more and more suitable for recreation.  This is expressed not by an increase in temperature, but, on the contrary, by a decrease.  It becomes not so hot and stuffy, so the rest is much more pleasant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along with this, prices for trips are increasing and the number of tourists on the beaches of Phuket province is increasing.  In November, water in the sea gradually becomes more transparent, and the chance of a storm or the appearance of large waves is much lower. </p>

    <h2>  Average air and water temperature </h2><p>  During the month, the daily air temperature ranges from 28-31 degrees heat.  At night, it is expected + 23 ° C - + 27 ° C. The water temperature in the Andaman Sea is almost always +28 degrees, but can vary between + 27 ° C - + 30 ° C. </p><h2>  Beach <span>Vacations in November</span> in Phuket Province </h2><p>  Those who are going to the kingdom in November should not worry about a beach holiday.  This month, it’s quite possible to swim in the sea and sunbathe for days, as evidenced by the temperature of the air and water.  As already mentioned above, in November it is not as hot as in the beach season, there is almost no rain, the wind is much weaker.  All these parameters indicate that a vacation spent here will be ideal. </p>

    <h2>  Low or high prices?  Phuket in November: ticket prices </h2><p>  Prices at this time are no longer as low as in September and October, when there are heavy rains, but since November is a transitional month (from the rainy season to high), you can still find quite a reasonable price for hotel accommodation and inexpensive cafes and restaurants  But you need to prepare for the fact that hotels are being rebuilt to the influx of tourists, so less and less attractive offers for accommodation are found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Kingdom of Thailand (Phuket), prices in November are approximately the following: </p><ul><li>  Typical trips: 79-82 thousand rubles for 7 nights (with a flight). </li><li>  Last minute trips: 34-44 thousand rubles for 3-13 nights (depending on the hotel). </li></ul><p>  You can go to Phuket on your own, especially since at this time, airfare also does not bite too much.  The cost of living in this case fully depends on the rank of the selected hotel.  The cheapest options offer to stay for 2 weeks for only 6000-9000 rubles, better establishments - for 10000-15000 for the same period, and in popular hotels the price can increase to 60,000. </p>

    <h2>  Thai holiday Loi Kratong: this is not to be missed! </h2><p>  One of the most striking events in Phuket in November is the Loy Krathong festival.  The name translates as "floating boat of leaves."  This is an incredibly beautiful and romantic holiday, which is necessarily held only in November - on the day of the twelfth full moon. </p><p>  The essence of the event is that the locals make boats from the leaves of a banana tree.  There is no special technique for the creation of “ships”: as they say, who cares.  But often you can see real works of art. </p><p>  In the evening, boats are laid on the water.  So they symbolize gratitude to water and light for life and food.  Coins and candles are placed inside the boats, the sea shimmers with lights, which looks very impressive. </p><p>  At the same time, a festival of air lanterns is held.  Lighted sky and water are a very beautiful and unusual sight that will leave the most pleasant memories in the soul of tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion: is it worth it to fly in November? </h2><p>  You should definitely visit Thailand at least once in your life.  Phuket (November or April - this parameter does not play a special role) is a beautiful island where you can find pleasant activities for yourself even in the rainy season. </p><p>  The above information suggests that in the last autumn month in the province you can spend time with benefit: swimming and sunbathing, surfing or other sports, go on a tour and arrange shopping, take a walk while admiring the tropical vegetation, and capture all this on a camera . </p><p>  November is attractive because it marks the transition to a high season, but prices, meanwhile, have not yet managed to soar to unimaginable proportions.  Therefore, the answer to the question of whether to choose Phuket for the November vacation can be unequivocally: yes. </p>
