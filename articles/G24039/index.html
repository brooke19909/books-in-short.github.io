Those who at least have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat an <span>electronic computer is, it</span> will be easier to understand this issue.  But the one who first encounters this abbreviation will have to learn a lot. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  Almost everyone has heard about computers, but few can imagine what it is.  As Wikipedia says, we have a complex of technical means.  Even such an interpretation can explain little.  In short, we are talking about a device or mechanism that is equipped with certain functions.  Among them there are logical actions, memorizing, indicative, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of solving computer problems" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968181.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Each of them is located on an electronic element.  The latter, in turn, are responsible for the automatic processing of information during certain processes.  By them are meant computational or informational tasks. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Before the stages of solving computer problems were formed, this term searched for itself.  Many people think that a computer is a computer.  But the last device has a wider functionality, and therefore is somewhat unfairly demoted. </p><p>  To be more precise, this machine is implemented as a computer.  To carry out all the processes, it uses electronic components as functional units.  Such a complex of technical means is distinguishable from others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, calculations are possible in another way.  This includes the mechanical, biological, optical, quantum version.  The computer also works on the principle of transporting mechanical parts, moving electrons and photons. </p><h2>  Oblivion </h2><p>  If today we talk about computers as a computer, then only in the past tense.  In fact, no one in everyday life uses it, and more often the term sounds from the lips of digital electronics engineers.  The machine may appear in legal documentation, and, accordingly, in historical reports. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main stages of solving computer problems" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968182.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the latter case, we are talking about computer technology, which was born in 1940-80. </p><h2>  Stages </h2><p>  Speaking about the stages of solving problems on a computer, a computer is taken for this machine.  That is, in our time it is programming that is mentioned and its stages.  This process means theoretical and practical processes that are associated with the creation of programs.  Their solution contains several stages, some of which do not need a computer at all. </p><p>  It is immediately worth noting that there is no clear algorithm for the sequence of actions.  There are some deviations that are specific to the tasks. </p><h2>  Task </h2><p>  The first step in solving problems with a computer is the statement of the task.  The programmer or engineer must collect all the information about the task.  Next, it will be necessary to formulate the conditions.  That is, you need to understand in what ways the goals will be achieved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of solving problems using computers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968183.jpg"></div>

That is, what we want to get as a result of some actions and calculations.  Next, we determine in what way we will get the decision, in what form and format.  At the end of this step, all existing data must be described.  Simply put, recall the school and the solution of problems in physics, when all available quantities, structures, types, etc. were indicated. </p><h2>  Analysis </h2><p>  The stages of solving computer problems lead to analysis.  This step should make the programmer consider existing analogues.  That is, to study the previously completed programming processes.  After you need to analyze hardware and software. </p><p>  At the second stage, one must not forget to form a mathematical model.  It is possible to find some more simplified ways to solve the problem by which the machine can perform calculations.  Further structure the data. </p><h2>  Algorithm </h2><p>  If we study the stages of solving problems on a computer briefly, then the development of the algorithm would rather go into one of the previously proposed stages.  In a more detailed step-by-step description, this is another important step.  Here you need to take care of the selection of processes associated with the algorithms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of preparing and solving computer problems" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968184.jpg"></div>

    <p>  An engineer chooses <span>an</span> algorithm <span>design method</span> to more accurately understand what stages await him.  And after that, deal with the form of writing the algorithm.  There may be many options.  Given the capabilities and technologies of our time, in addition to flowcharts, more complex forms such as animations are possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After at this stage, tests and methods for their implementation are considered.  Find reliable verification options.  In the end, you can design the algorithm itself. </p><h2>  Programming </h2><p>  The main stages in solving computer problems should definitely include programming.  In fact, the main step in the whole calculation.  You need to approach him responsibly.  First, the programmer chooses the language in which the software will be written.  After examines possible options for structuring and grouping the received data.  Here to <span>each his own.</span>  Someone can use improvised methods, someone can download special programs. </p><p>  Next, the algorithm is written in the language that was selected.  Everything here is generally clear and no problems arise if a professional does this. </p><h2>  Testing </h2><p>  After the work is actually finished, you need to check its performance.  For this, tests and debugging are mandatory.  First, parsing takes place.  Then comes the test to verify semantics and logical structure.  As practice shows, at these two stages errors are often identified that were committed by inattention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of solving problems using computers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968185.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Perform test calculations and verify the results.  Here you also need to be especially careful and qualitatively analyze the results obtained, since even the slightest discrepancies can harm the whole work. </p><p>  At this stage, it remains to adjust the program.  You can independently check each character, or use in-app applications to find inaccuracies.  Perhaps make changes to the structuring. </p><h2>  Check </h2><p>  The penultimate stage of preparation and solution of problems on a computer is conditionally optional, although recommendatory.  It is advisable not to miss it.  For this, it is necessary to analyze the results of solving the problem and refinements.  If during this stage there are any problems, it is better to repeat all the above steps to prevent any inaccuracies. </p><h2>  Support </h2><p>  The last stage can be considered not main, but additional.  It must be carried out as needed.  For example, modify the program if there are any additional requirements for it.  Perhaps the list will include a couple more tasks that can be easily added to the algorithm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of solving applied computer problems" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968186.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, the last stage means a report that is provided to the customer, or is done for yourself.  In the first case, it is needed so that there are no complaints to the programmer.  In the second case, it may be needed for further work with the project. </p><h2>  Brief work </h2><p>  The described stages of solving problems using computers are more detailed.  If the project is small, or does not require such pickiness, it is possible to use a shorter path. </p><p>  In this case, the statement of the problem and the construction of a mathematical model can be combined into one process.  But it will also have to first understand the objectives of the assignment, give the exact wording to him, consider the possible stages of the solution.  Understand in what form the results will be recorded and how they will be stored. </p><p>  After this preparatory stage requires a description of the object in mathematical terms.  So the specialist gets an idealized mathematical model, but on the whole gives a direction for solving the problem.  In order for the model to be correct, it is necessary to analyze similar solutions, technical and software capabilities, conditions for the existence of results. </p><p>  The second stage is the algorithm and its implementation.  A programmer often works on it, and a qualitative implementation depends on its classification.  The algorithm collects a ready-made mathematical model and a finite sequence of instructions.  All this can be realized through established methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of solving computer problems briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1968187.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Further, it will be enough to do ‚Äúpure‚Äù programming in order to realize all previously conceived actions. </p><p>  Well, the stages of solving applied problems on a computer are completed, as always, testing and support.  With the help of debugging, all technical, grammatical and algorithmic errors are detected.  Control tests correct them and bring the project into proper form. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the stages can be different and vary depending on progress and innovations.  It is interesting that the role of man and computer in this process can vary depending on tasks and capabilities.  It is also affected by the development of computer technology.  Not far off is the time when any stage will be automated and will not need human work. </p>
