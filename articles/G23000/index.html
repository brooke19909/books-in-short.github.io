  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yekaterinburg-Kurgan: features of a trip along the route</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The distance from Yekaterinburg to Kurgan is 370 kilometers.  They don‚Äôt fly at such distances, so you need to consider only the railway, bus and car options. </p><p>  Kurgan is not the most interesting city in Russia, it is worth visiting in transit on the way to Kazakhstan or just to replenish your collection of seen Russian regional centers. </p><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  Buses from Yekaterinburg to Kurgan leave from the northern bus station from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. and at 2 a.m.  Their arrival point is the Kurgan bus station, which is located next to the train station.  In this sense, Kurgan is similar to Petropavlovsk and Yekaterinburg and differs, for example, from Tyumen. </p><p>  A ticket from Yekaterinburg to Kurgan will cost from 700 rubles, therefore, the fare is about 2 rubles per kilometer.  The trip will take 6.5-7.5 hours.  On the way, the bus makes several short stops: in Kargopol, Kataysk, Dolmatovo, Shadrinsk. </p><p>  In the opposite direction, from Kurgan to Yekaterinburg, buses run from 7 am to 11 pm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station in Kurgan" class="if uuid-3204943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3204943.jpg"></div><h2>  Railway option </h2><p>  The railway connection on the branch between Yekaterinburg and Kurgan is not so active.  Trains run much less frequently than along the neighboring Trans-Siberian Railway (Yekaterinburg-Tyumen branch). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The train departure schedule from the station to Yekaterinburg is as follows: </p><ul><li>  00:18.  The fast train forming the Russian Railways follows from Moscow to Petropavlovsk.  Walks every other day.  It is almost 6 hours on the way.  His bus stops are similar, with a maximum of 5 minutes in Shadrinsk. </li><li>  04:52.  A rare trailer car from St. Petersburg to Petropavlovsk, 9 hours on the road. </li><li>  05:53.  It‚Äôs also a trailed car from Petersburg, but it‚Äôs already been 10 hours. </li><li>  18:50.  Convenient interregional train, only seats, 5 hours on the road. </li><li>  18:58.  Passing trains from Kazan to Tashkent and Almaty.  They travel 6.5 hours.  They rarely go.  Formed <span>by the railways of Uzbekistan</span> and Kazakhstan. </li></ul><p>  The cost of a train ticket from Yekaterinburg to Kurgan depends on the type of car, schedule of fares and various promotions.  Estimated prices are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Sedentary - from 725 rubles. </li><li>  Seated in an electric train - from 825 rubles. </li><li>  Reserved seat - from 1300 rubles. </li><li>  Kupeyny - from 1200 rubles. </li></ul><p>  In the opposite direction, from Kurgan to Yekaterinburg, the departure schedule is as follows: </p><ul><li>  06:47 a.m.  Daily interregional train. </li><li>  07:13.  Trailer car to St. Petersburg. </li><li>  10:45 a.m.  Rare passing trains of Kazakh and Uzbek formations. </li><li>  10:58.  Trailer cars to Petersburg. </li><li>  21:19.  The train from Petropavlovsk to Moscow, despite the long distance, it has sedentary cars. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suburban train" class="if uuid-3204941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3204941.jpg"></div><h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  The Yekaterinburg-Kurgan route can be reached in about 5 hours by car - it depends on the congestion of the route and the weather.  You need to exit on E-22 to Kosulino and there take the R-354 towards Kamensk-Uralsky.  After this city, the route leads to the Kurgan region.  You need to go to Kurgan through Kataysk, Dolmatovo and Kargopol. </p><p>  A more exotic option is also possible.  From Yekaterinburg you need to get to Tyumen on the highway E-22.  On the bypass of Tyumen will be a pointer to the mound.  This is where you need to turn off, then move to your destination through the district center Isetskoye.  Thus, a 530-km route will be obtained, but along the way you can call in Tyumen or, for example, at the Upper Bor resort near it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The central square of the Mound" class="if uuid-3204942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3204942.jpg"></div><h2>  Why go to Kurgan? </h2><p>  The city is not very interesting.  His museum fund is inferior to all neighbors (Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen), except Petropavlovsk, which is located in Kazakhstan. </p><p>  It is worth visiting the typical museums: local history and art, as well as the Museum of the Decembrists and Aviation. </p><p>  In the Central Park in summer you can ride the <span>train for the children's railway.</span> </p><p>  An ostrich farm with a contact zoo is located just south of Kurgan. </p><p>  From this little-known regional center you can go to the village of Chastozoozerye, which is interesting not only for its lakes, but also for the magnificent cathedral and monuments to Yesenin and Russia. </p>
