    <p>  Thanks to this service, everything will be easier to complete.  Electronic registration of a transaction at Sberbank - what is it?  This is a real estate registration process that involves submitting documentation online.

The procedure for submitting an application is simplified with it, and the terms are noticeably reduced.  Now this procedure is most in demand in Sberbank.  Now registration takes a day, according to representatives of Rosreestr, but, in fact, it still lasts from 3 days to a month.  In 2018, Sberbank plans to carry out the procedure in a day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who needs this? </h2><p>  In the lending business, the technical modernization of the tools used in issuing mortgages is important.

    <p>  Often, transactions for the purchase of real estate in a mortgage are carried out in different regions.  For example, residents of the North decided to purchase housing for children studying in Moscow or another large city.  In this case, there will be large transportation costs. </p><p>  The procedure for buying a home with a mortgage lasts from 14 days to a month.  To simplify the system for issuing and increasing transactions thanks to nonresident customers, the idea was supported by Sberbank, which controls over 50% of the mortgage market.  The organization invests a lot of money in IT banking. </p><p>  According to <span>reviews, electronic</span> registration of a transaction in Sberbank allows you to complete the procedure without unnecessary expenses.  The borrower only needs to perform it in his region, in the branch, where there is a mortgage center that provides similar services.  You only need to visit the bank once, and therefore you can not wait for the transaction to be registered. </p><h2>  Features of the procedure in Sberbank </h2><p>  According to reviews, electronic registration of transactions through Sberbank is more advanced than in other financial institutions.  The procedure is usually used for mortgages, but can also be used for clients without it.  Sberbank and Rosreestr have signed documentation that allows you to conclude transactions via the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The procedure is considered paid - 7 thousand rubles.  The price includes not only the conclusion of the transaction, but also the state duty paid at the time of registration of property rights.  This means that the entire amount will be equal to 7 thousand rubles for housing under construction and 8 thousand rubles - for finished housing.  After the process is completed, a registration of ownership will be made in the USRN. </p><p>  An advantage is the absence of waiting in lines.  In addition, many organizations are not required to attend.  The client needs to wait until he is provided with the documentation by e-mail.  In the hands of a person will not have physical documents, everything is made out in electronic form. </p><p>  The registered contract will be sent by e-mail.  The second file includes a digital signature.  Validation is carried out on the website of Rosreestr.  An extract from the USRN is also ordered in electronic form.  According to customer reviews, this service allows you to undergo the procedure without any unnecessary nerves. </p><h2>  What is needed? </h2><p>  No matter how the apartment is purchased - in a mortgage or for cash, during the processing of the transaction, the following documents must be prepared: </p><ul><li>  contract of sale; </li><li>  spouse's permission; </li><li>  statement. </li></ul><p>  Documentation is provided to the registrar.  In the absence of at least one paper, a failure occurs.  For registration to be completed, you need to know about the conditions of the bank for it.  Customer reviews of real estate confirm the elementary requirements. </p>

    <p>  Subject to all requirements, registration will be successful.  If there are any violations of the rules of the transaction, then they must be eliminated.  As can be seen from the customer reviews, with such registration, documents arrive fairly quickly. </p><h2>  Registration procedure </h2><p>  Since usually such a registration is needed by clients who apply for a mortgage, several cases should be considered: </p><ol><li>  With the provision of documentation for real estate, the borrower must indicate to the specialist that the procedure will be carried out in electronic form. </li><li>  Then an agreement is signed with the ‚ÄúCentral nervous system‚Äù of Sberbank and services are paid. </li><li>  The transaction date is selected and documents are signed. </li><li>  The employee sends the paper using a secure channel to Rosreestr. </li><li>  Based on the Federal Law No. 218, the transaction is registered. </li><li>  After the documents are ready, the contract of sale or DDK, as well as an electronic signature, is received by mail.  This completes the registration procedure, the client will be considered the owner of the property.  The authenticity of the <span>electronic signature is</span> verified on the public services portal. </li></ol><p>  This procedure is established by law.  After passing it, the client becomes the owner of the acquired property. </p><h2>  What is issued to the client? </h2><p>  Although the procedure is carried out remotely, the client receives documents confirming ownership of the property.  After receiving the title documents, you do not need to certify them with a notary.  The documentation will be valid, therefore, it allows you to dispose of the property at your discretion. </p>

    <p>  It should be borne in mind that a bank employee may refuse a transaction if there are no documents.  Therefore, if the client refuses, they should inform about the need to provide the necessary papers.  After this, the procedure resumes. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  To find out more detailed subtleties of the transaction, you should familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of electronic transaction registration in Sberbank.  Although the procedure for acquiring real estate with a mortgage is complicated, the registration of housing via the Internet has the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Not always the owner and the premises are located in the same city.  Previously, this was an obstacle to obtaining a mortgage.  Now everything is easier.  You can perform electronic registration from any city. </li><li>  It is not required to visit different organizations to draw up a contract.  You just need to contact a credit institution, submit documents remotely and wait for registration. </li><li>  After contracts are completed, ready-made documents are received by e-mail. </li><li>  This procedure is beneficial for those who have purchased housing on credit, as well as ordinary customers who have paid cash for real estate. </li><li>  Each client is provided with a manager who performs registration, and also advises on various issues. </li><li>  Customers can expect a reduction in rates.  On average, it is 0.1% less. </li></ol>

    <p>  But there are also disadvantages to electronic transaction registration in Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  The service is available only to citizens of the Russian Federation.  In the absence of citizenship, the transaction cannot be completed, the registration in the USRN will not be executed. </li><li>  The client must be of legal age as well as competent. </li><li>  If the previous owner purchased housing before 1998, then registration is carried out by generally accepted methods and in paper form. </li><li>  When selling part of the apartment, the service will not work. </li><li>  The documents will be in electronic form, which may cause difficulties in obtaining the necessary securities from government agencies. </li><li>  High cost of service.  In each region, it is different, but usually amounts to 7-10 thousand rubles. </li></ol><p>  The procedure is simple.  Given the reviews, it has already become popular with customers.  People value it for reliability and comfort.  Therefore, when buying real estate, you can safely use this procedure. </p>
