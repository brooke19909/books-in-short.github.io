    <p>  Welcome </p><p>  The water park in Abkhazia is quite a bit more than just a water park.  It is here so far in a single copy and is an innovation in the tourism infrastructure of the country.  In a sense, its construction on this shore marks a revival of the life of the entire Abkhaz tourism industry at a new modern level.  The luxurious coast of Abkhazia has been a favorite vacation spot of many generations of people.  But only the water park was not here in the old days.  And now there is a water park in Abkhazia and is ready to accept everyone who is looking for a thrill and who just wants to have fun.  All equipment of the complex fully complies with recognized international standards and safety standards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Constructively </p><p>  The water park in Abkhazia, in Gagra, consists of five freshwater pools and two with sea water.  Equipped with six slides of different heights and designs, for all tastes, from gentle to very steep.  The most popular among the public are spiral slides.  The coolest design is designed for fans of "extreme", visitors affectionately nicknamed it "kamikaze." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia Gagra water park" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/150775.jpg" width="506"></div>  The children's pool, the so-called "paddling pool", is filled with fresh, heated water, the level of which does not exceed half a meter.  A design decision in the form of a <span>pirate ship of the</span> Caribbean and other exotic accessories was well done.  Naturally, on land visitors will find a complete set of ordinary beach pleasures and entertainment.  So for those who came here to have fun, the water park in Abkhazia will leave the most positive memories.  There will be something to tell friends in the office on long Russian winter evenings.  What is still pleasant to please here is the price level.  They are quite acceptable and very low, like almost everything on the Abkhaz coast. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia water park prices" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/150773.jpg" width="504"></div>
