Such a versatile soldier.  Ideal for all of the listed criteria, a knit cap with an elastic band 2 by 2. It is this pattern that is the most elastic and holds its shape remarkably.  Even a beginner needlewoman will cope with knitting such a model, because it is enough to know <span>how the front loops fit</span> , the wrong ones and how to make the loops smaller. </p><h2>  The most fashionable hat </h2><p>  For several years now, not a single autumn-winter fashion show is complete without a mandatory attribute - beanie hats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beanie hat with 2-by-2 elastic band" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2161398.jpg"></div>  There are many options, but all designers love knitting a beanie with a 2-by-2 rubber band. These are both models that fit your head and loose hats-stockings.  Concise and with a variety of decorations: rhinestones, embroideries, pompons.  Beans are male, female and childish.  Such a hat can be harmoniously entered into any image: sports, casual, and even classic.  And most importantly, a beanie hat can easily be knitted independently.

    <h2>  Boring Bean Options </h2><p>  The apparent uniformity of the beanie hat dilutes many details.  A <span>knitted cap with a</span> 2 by 2 elastic band can have a lapel: single or double.  In addition, the crown of the cap is knitted in a variety of ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  classical crown rounded in shape of the head and adjacent to it; </li><li>  pointed peak in the form of a peak - made of denser threads that can hold a shape; <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with 2-by-2 rubber band" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2160258.jpg"></div></li><li>  soft cap-stocking: any shape of the crown, the main body of the cap is elongated, while the threads are soft and elastic; </li><li>  the cap is knitted in the shape of a rectangle without reduction, the loops on the crown are closed with one line - you get a kind of ‚Äúears‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  After you have decided on the style, you need to stock up on threads and corresponding knitting needles. </p><p>  What yarn is better to start knitting hats with 2 to 2 elastic?  The choice depends on personal preferences and seasonality of the product.  For a warm hat, you can take any wool yarn: mohair, wool mixture and other mixtures of natural and synthetic fibers.  The thickness of the thread is also any - the smaller the meters in 100 grams, the larger the cap will be, the better it will keep its shape.  For a cap with a slightly elongated crown with a head circumference of 50-56 cm, 100-150 grams of yarn should be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with a rubber band 2 on 2 circular knitting needles" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2158658.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When knitting hats with a 2-by-2 rubber band with knitting needles, which number is better to work with?  Their thickness should be half the number less than when knitting the same surface with the same threads (often the number of knitting needles for the front surface is often indicated on the yarn label).  Circular knitting yields a seamless fabric, but there are such features: </p><ul><li>  you need to constantly tighten the loops on the cable from needle to needle; </li><li>  it‚Äôs inconvenient to follow the beginning of the row, especially when decreases begin to form the top of the head (row markers to help). </li></ul><p>  In addition to straight knitting needles, hosiery for circular knitting is used, but their thickness varies in a small range. </p><h2>  Measurements and calculations </h2><p>  Whichever model you choose, you first need to determine the <span>size of the header.</span>  For this, the head circumference and the distance from the middle of the forehead to the beginning of the neck are measured.  This measurement is divided in half - it turns out the minimum height of the cap, which can be increased at will. </p><p>  The next step is to knit a 15 by 15 cm sample. For further work, the sample needs to be washed and dried in a horizontal position.  To determine the number of loops and rows in a centimeter, you need to slightly stretch the knitted fabric.  Another option: subtract 2-3 cm from the head girth measure and do not stretch the sample - as a result, a 2 by 2 knitting cap with a rubber band will slightly fit the head. </p><p>  The cap can be conditionally divided into three parts: lapel, cap body and rounding for the crown.  The straight part, without reduction, is equal to the height of the lapel and the desired length of the cap to the rounding.  The standard rounding is 5-8 cm and is carried out in different ways. </p><ul><li>  The reduction at the beginning or end of the segments into which the total number of loops collected was divided.  Wedges can be from 4 to 10. The number of loops dialed is a multiple of the number of wedges. </li><li>  Evenly cut loops without dividing into segments. </li></ul><p>  When working with straight knitting needles, in addition to the main loops, they are also edged.  When knitting caps with a 2 to 2 rubber band with circular knitting needles, the hem edges are not dialed.  Or one auxiliary loop is typed to mask the hole at the transition to circular knitting. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  A set of loops can be carried out by various methods: </p><ul><li>  classic set gives a hard inelastic edge; </li><li>  the Italian set of loops creates a stretch edge, very similar to the factory one; </li><li>  decorative typesetting edge, for example, with a thickening or Bulgarian conception. </li></ul><p>  Further the product is knitted according to the scheme: 2 front, 2 wrong.  If the lapel is provided for in the style, at its completion it is possible to knit all the loops with the front ones - in this place a decorative hem is formed on the back side, which simultaneously fixes the lapel. </p><h2>  Create a rounding </h2><p>  As described above, there are two ways to reduce loops. </p><ol><li>  Uniform contraction.  In the first row of decreases only the wrong loops are involved: one from each pair is knitted.  In the next facial row, pairs of facial loops are reduced.  The last row of diminution is knitted as follows: together purl and facial, or three together (l.,., L.) And one purl.  All loops are removed on the needle and tightened.  This method is often used in beanie caps with an elongated crown. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting caps with an elastic band 2 in 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2158717.jpg"></div></li><li>  Division into wedges.  When knitting the last row of a flat cloth, all loops are divided into groups according to the number of wedges of decrease.  The more of them, the more rounded the crown will turn out.  Loops need to be cut at the beginning or end of the wedge.  Another pattern will be obtained while reducing at the beginning and end of the wedge.  This option of reduction favorably looks on tight caps. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting caps with an elastic band 2 in 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2161174.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  In each case, the calculation of reductions will be individual, depending on the density of knitting, the thickness of the yarn, the features of the model. </p><p>  Subsequent actions: sew the edges of the cap with a <span>mattress seam</span> and hide the tips, if any, in a knitted fabric.  When stitching <span>caps with a lapel,</span> having reached the inflection line, transfer the work to the inside so that the connecting seam is inside the lapel.  Wash and dry the product in a round form, if not, then horizontally. </p>
