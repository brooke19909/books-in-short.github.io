This is Catania (Sicily).  Italy has always been of interest to travelers, so this province is very popular.  If you have not been to Catania, which amazes with the beauties of its nature, then you should definitely go there on your next vacation.  In the meantime, I want to tell you how and how this amazing city lives. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Catania (Italy) is the second largest Sicilian city, which lies right at the foot of Etna.  It was built by the volcano, from it and with a view of it.  It is unlikely that you know that most of this city was built precisely from the lava that erupted many years ago.  The dark color of the buildings blends well with the bright sunlight that covers everything around.  Thanks to Giovanni Battista, Catania (Italy) looks so unusual: black <span>houses in the Baroque style</span> combined with straight streets.  By the way, the patroness of the city is St. Agatha.  Her holiday is celebrated at the very beginning of February. </p>

    <p>  The Church of St. Nicholas looks a little strange, and therefore attracts the attention of tourists.  When it began to be exploited, it was not yet completed, and a bit later an earthquake destroyed most of the building, which remained unfinished.  Despite its unsightly appearance, the interior in the Baroque style strikes the eye of the person entering. </p><p>  The collegial basilica shows all the delights of Sicilian baroque.  The facade is crowned with a small bell tower, and between the first and second level there is an openwork balustrade. </p><p>  Ursino fortress was surrounded by a moat, but as a result of the eruption, earthquake and time, the landscapes changed a lot, and the city blocks surrounded the building itself.  Now there is a rich museum with collections of sculptures, paintings and ceramics. </p><p>  The Elephant Fountain on Cathedral Square is considered to be the main symbol of the city.  The figure of black stone rises above all buildings.  Mystical attributes are attributed to such elephant statues in Catania.  According to legend, they are able to pacify a turbulent volcano.  The fountain is located near the city hall, which is now called the Elephant Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Catania Italy Airport" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19537/421791.jpg" width="600"></div>
