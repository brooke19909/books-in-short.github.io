The reasons may be different depending on the political, economic and social situation.  What is the essence of dual power for Russia in 1917-1918? </p><p>  The case of the Russian Empire can be considered unique. </p><h2>  Overthrow of tsarism </h2><p>  The year 1917 in Russia radically changed the history of the state itself.  Russian Emperor Nicholas II left Petrograd on February 22, 1917.  The number of strikers on the streets of the city inexorably continued to grow.  February 24, there were already 90 thousand. </p>

    <p>  On February 25, the number of strikers already exceeded 250 thousand, which was a unique phenomenon for the history of the Russian Empire at that time.  The year 1917 in Russia will forever sweep away the current imperial power. </p><p>  Skirmishes between strikers took place in the crowd, which fueled even greater anger and sentiment against Emperor Nicholas II.  The next day, the tsar canceled the activities of the State Duma until April 1918.  In the city there were clashes between the military and the police, which led to the uprising of the Petrograd military regiment.  The military began to side with the strikers and protesters.  The causes and essence of dual power lie in the fall of the tsarist regime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of dual power </h2><p>  As a result of the overthrow of tsarism and monarchy in the former Russian Empire, a period of dual power began. </p>

    <p>  What is the essence of dual power?  What it is?  Dual power - this is when in the state in parallel and independently from each other there are two governing bodies.  So it was between the February and <span>October revolutions.</span>  With the help of the <span>February Revolution,</span> it was possible to overthrow Nicholas II, ruling at that time, from the throne. </p><p>  Then two governing bodies were formed: the Provisional Government and the system of Soviets.  Naturally, the two systems of government could not coexist peacefully in one state, and there were prerequisites for a clash.  In order to consider and understand the essence of the dual power of 1917 in Russia, it is necessary to proceed to the consideration of crises.  Two authorities lead to the struggle of the masses. </p><h2>  Fight and crises </h2><p>  After the February <span>Revolution, political</span> forces completely changed in Russia.  To understand what the essence of dual power is for this period of development of events, one needs to turn to political views. </p><p>  The position of the Mensheviks was opposed to the position of the Bolsheviks and the system of councils.  The Mensheviks are rich and <span>noble people of</span> Russia who did not want drastic political and economic changes.  They created their <span>Provisional Government</span> , headed by Kerensky, and believed that now was not the time of significant political and economic transformations.  The king is gone, now you need to calm down and think what to do next.  They were not supporters that Russia was ready for the transition to the socialist system.  They talked about the fact that this is impossible at this stage of its development and that it will take time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Bolsheviks, in turn, consisted of activists from the people and opposed their ideas to the opinion of the Provisional Government.  They believed that Russia was ready and could make the socialist revolution, which would bring only benefit to ordinary workers and peasants. </p><p>  This was followed by the April, June and July crises.  In the first two <span>crises, the Provisional Government</span> and the Soviets tried to find a compromise and agree.  In July, when it became clear that nothing would come of it, demonstrations of workers and supporters of the Bolsheviks began in Petrograd. </p><h2>  Revolution! </h2><p>  The Bolsheviks openly ignored the Mensheviks and did not understand what the essence of dual power lies in.  Meanwhile, the second revolution was brewing in society.  It was clear that a political compromise between representatives of the Provisional Government and the Soviets was impossible.  The Soviets and the Bolsheviks are one step ahead of the Provisional Government and begin July 4 demonstrations in Petrograd under the slogans "All power to the Soviets!", "Land to the peasants."  What is the essence of dual power for this period of time?  Dual power no longer exists. </p><p>  The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, acted successfully in the field of popular unrest and revolution.  They picked up precisely those slogans that the people wanted to hear from them. </p><p>  Despite the dual power in Russia, the land peasant question was not resolved.  Most peasants were left without their own land.  Lenin promised them land. </p>

    <p>  Workers in cities worked in difficult conditions and no one wanted to deal with their issues.  Lenin promised that the <span>working day of workers</span> would be reduced and wages would be increased. </p><p>  The interim government appealed for support to General Kornilov, who was the army commander.  He said he would help, and the protesters would not achieve anything.  Kornilov was a man of imperial views and did not welcome social and political changes.  The loyal and less radical position of the Mensheviks was to his liking. </p><p>  However, Lenin and the Bolsheviks received great support in the person of the masses and were able to bring their revolutionary campaign to the end by defeating the Provisional Government.  During the revolution, the army of General Kornilov sided with the protesters on the side of the Bolsheviks. </p><h2>  End of revolution </h2><p>  After the army took the side of the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks lost their last chance and hope.  It was the final victory. </p><p>  The Bolsheviks began to create their own councils and governing bodies.  Despite the fact that Lenin promised the peasants land, their question was still not resolved.  Moreover, during the life of Lenin, he was not resolved. </p><p>  The issue with the workers was also not resolved.  This caused outrage among the workers, but did not lead to riots, unrest and revolution. </p><p>  In the future after the revolution, the actions of the Bolsheviks will be aimed at reforming the economic component of Russia. </p>
