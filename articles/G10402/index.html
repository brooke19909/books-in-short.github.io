You will find the answer to all these questions in the article. </p><p>  Cannes <span>is</span> a city on the south coast of France, known to the rest of the world for its film festival, which takes place annually in this small town.  How did it happen that a small place lurking in the hills of Esterel suddenly became so popular. </p><p>  Correctly called the city <span>-</span> Cannes or Caen.  It is written in French <span>-</span> <em>Cannes.</em>  When the French pronounce it, they say a clean, not nasal sound "a".  The fact is that in France there is another Caen, which is written differently <span>-</span> <em>Caen, they</em> pronounce its name with the nasal "a".  This is a completely different place located in Normandy. </p><p>  Now you know where Cannes is located, in which country.  If in more detail, then Cannes are located in the <span>resort of Cote d'Azur,</span> in the Provence region, Grasse. </p><h2>  A little help </h2><p>  Cannes Square is small, only 19.62 km <sup>2</sup> .  At the place where the city is now located, there were ancient settlements of the Romans in 42 BC.  e., bore the name of Egitna.  But there is another historical theory that ligurs lived in this place in the II century BC.  e.  The territory often turned out to be a battlefield, many wanted to own this wonderful place on the coast of the Gulf of Naples. </p>

    <p>  Already from the X century, the name Cannes or Canua is found in historical documents.  Translated, this means height.  But there is another version that the city is named after the plant name of the same name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A small population of Cannes was fishing.  There was also a port on the shore that facilitated the development of trade with the inhabitants of the Lerins Islands.  Almost 74,000 people now live in the city. </p><h2>  Why has the city gained popularity? </h2><p>  In 1834, the English lord and former Chancellor Henry Peter Broome went to Italy, but having learned that there was an epidemic of cholera there, he decided to stop on the way in a small town.  He was so fascinated by this place that he changed his route and stopped to wait for the epidemic here.  He lingered much longer than planned.  Arriving at home, he talked a lot about the beauty of Cannes, and his family next year all came to see what really struck the Lord, who even built a mansion there.  Consider where Cannes are located on the map. </p>
