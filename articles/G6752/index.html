The strengths of the model include thoughtful design, Wi-Fi and applications that will always allow you to stay connected.  But no more than that.  For $ 99, the user receives a communicator with a low-resolution screen, dubious communication quality, a camera with a fixed focus and intermittent work.  All this emphasizes the budget status, although the Asha 503 is the most luxurious phone of the top three models, which also includes the 502nd and 500th.  Strange, but bright design compensates a lot and is the main reason for attracting customers.  If a simple phone with an excellent appearance is enough, then the Nokia Asha RM-922 will be a good choice.  But for those who are looking for a well-integrated budget smartphone, it is better to pay attention to an inexpensive model running Android or Windows. </p><h2>  Design and Build </h2><p>  The phone certainly has personality.  Perfectly smooth, with smooth plastic edges and right angles, the Nokia RM-922 looks frozen in a piece of ice.  The effect is most noticeable when viewed from above or at an angle when white, black, bright yellow, green, blue or red coating is visible from under the transparent plastic layer.  The dimensions of 102.6 x 60.6 x 12.7 mm indicate that the Nokia RM-922 is not very thin, but also not overly massive.  The device seems reliable and has a slight bend on the back surface, softening the sharp edges of the model.  It slips easily into your pocket and fits comfortably in your hand.  110 g of weight also comes at a time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The volume and power buttons are located on the right.  The micro-USB recharging port and headset jack are located on top, and a camera lens and LED flash protrude from the back cover.  To access the Micro-SD memory card slot, you need to remove the back panel (bottom), and you can get to the Micro-SIM cards after removing the battery. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Black color prevails on the front panel of the smartphone.  The display bezels are very wide, much larger than what is needed for a 3-inch QVGA LCD with a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels.  The reflective touch screen is difficult to read even indoors.  Increasing the brightness helps, but it affects the battery life. </p>

    <p>  It is impossible not to say about a very low pixel density of 134 dpi and displaying only 262 thousand colors (versus 16 million).  Text and images are a bit jagged around the edges.  Graphically saturated sites look like a caricature - the edges are pixelated, the colors are uneven and the noise is scattered across the screen like confetti.  It‚Äôs better to use mobile phone sites or improve image clarity by lowering download speeds.  Display quality is a consequence of the low price of RM-922.  The touchscreen is at least protected by Gorilla Glass, and Nokia offers a screen saver that allows you to see the time on a locked screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to user reviews, the 3-inch display is practically unsuitable for reading, closing tiny windows, and especially for typing using a five-row virtual keyboard.  Although the set is made very accurately, it is very disappointing.  The phone provides predictive input by default, but there is no automatic conversion to uppercase or punctuation.  To check spelling, this function must be activated in the settings. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  RM-922 runs on the Asha 1.1.1 platform, which the manufacturer calls the operating system.  But for those who are used to Android, Windows or iOS, Nokia OS looks like a return to the past - it is more an advanced phone than something else.  There is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 3.0, which can be accessed from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  Navigation is very simple.  Below the display is a single return button.  There are two main screens: on one are the icons, and on the other is an overview of social flow and activities. </p><p>  According to user reviews, a sufficient number of programs are installed on the phone, there is also an application store.  Available text editor, music player, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, email.  There is a calendar, calculator, notebook, voice recorder and FM radio.  You can manage files, launch games, chat and check the weather.  Nokia has installed almost a dozen games that, 3 minutes after launch, offer to purchase them. </p>

    <p>  Nokia‚Äôs Internet browser squeezes pages to save traffic, as it is a 3G phone.  According to user reviews, the application often stops working when connected over a wireless network. </p><p>  Since the Asha 503 RM-922 is mainly suitable for calls, the phone book is of great importance.  You can import contacts from a SIM or microSD card or other device.  The address book fields at first glance seem limited by photos, phone numbers, email addresses and date of birth.  However, you can add any number of other fields, including a custom ringtone, address, etc. The ability to add contacts from other accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, and VoIP services, is a nice addition. </p><h2>  Cameras and video </h2><p>  Some of Nokia's 5MP cameras allow you to take great photos.  Unfortunately, this model is not equipped.  Having a fixed flash does not correct the situation, and the tiny screen is not very reliable in determining whether the subject is in focus or not.  It also means that good pictures of moving objects cannot be achieved.  Even if you can make the right frame, the camera suffers from excessive graininess of the image, albeit with decent color reproduction.  You can adjust white balance, add effects, set a timer and select a photo resolution. </p>

    <p>  The video options are basically the same, although the highest resolution available here is limited by VGA (640x480 pixels), and the default resolution is 480 x 320. The recording speed of 19 fps is inferior to the standard 30 fps.  The video is made up of fragmented images with muted colors and blurry frames when motion is filmed, with lagging audio accompaniment. </p><h2>  Performance and battery life </h2><p>  Although Nokia does not cover processor speed, it is obvious that it is low-power.  Small delays accompany almost every action, from exiting the lock screen to downloading applications and even switching the screen orientation.  Asha 503 will require a lot of patience. </p><p>  Battery life depends on how the phone is used.  A 1200 mAh battery is located at the lower end of the scale and provides 4.5 hours of talk time on 3G networks (12 hours in 2G), and it lasts 35 days in standby mode.  According to user reviews, the battery provides an impressive 14 hours and 37 minutes of conversation. </p><p>  There is very little storage space, so the Nokia RM-922 comes with a 4 GB memory card.  Its capacity can be increased up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Connection quality </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the interlocutor's voice sounds warm and natural, but is accompanied by a soft, persistent crack.  White noise is a little distracting, but the volume is sufficient to increase it in a noisy environment.  At the other end of the line, the sound is loud, but a bit unnatural, as some high frequencies are cut off like many cheap phones.  The speaker sounds quiet, muffled and distant, if you keep it at hip level.  The voice of the subscriber becomes fuzzy. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Nokia is selling the Asha 503 RM-922 for about $ 99.  The unique and attractive design of the phone is its greatest advantage, but it has enough software installed that can satisfy fans of Internet surfing and social networks.  Features such as Wi-Fi, email client, FM radio are available, but users cannot recommend the Asha 503 because of its extremely poor performance. </p>
