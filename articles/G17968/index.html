The warm Adriatic Sea attracts beach tourists in the summer, and the rest of the year attracts many historical and natural attractions that are so rich in Italy.  Recently, domestic businessmen have also become more frequent in Rimini - the largest exhibition center in the region, Rimini Fiera, has opened in Rimini.  As for inexpensive housing, the Giamaica 3 hotel (Italy) is an ideal choice for all categories of visitors.  Thanks to the train station, located four hundred meters from the hotel, this place will be close and accessible to you.  Prices for this type of transport in a rather expensive country are simply touching.  You can go to Rome, Florence, Venice ... But let's go back to the description of the hotel.  We analyzed the reviews of Russian tourists to create a general portrait of this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477484.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Atmosphere </h2><p>  If you like huge noisy buildings and impersonal rooms, crammed with any glamorous luxury, then you definitely are not here.  Giamaica 3 * - a small family hotel.  He is held by a married couple - Michael and Natalia.  The hostess is Russian, so there should not be a language barrier for those who do not know Italian and English.  Natalia will explain everything, where and what is located in Rimini, advise the best beach, she is a very responsive and sincere person.  Here they react to respectful and decent behavior in exactly the same way.  But for some reason, our compatriots often believe that hotel servants are an object for treating their own inferiority complex.  The reviews say that the attitude towards the guests at the hotel is the most cordial, but the boor is quickly put in place.  The hotel occupies a three-story house, which reviews are called "purely Italian."  It has recently been renovated, changed plumbing.  But the building did not get an elevator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3 rimini" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477485.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel Giamaica 3 located </h2><p>  Rimini is a fairly large (by Italian standards) city.  But the hotel "Jamaica" has the most ideal location.  It is located in a quiet street of Antonio Garibaldi in the Viserba district.  Just fifty meters away is a bustling seaside boulevard and beaches.  The city center (as well as the main railway station) is four kilometers, or seventeen bus stops.  The hotel is twelve kilometers from Fellini International Airport.  But in order to go on an independent <span>trip to Italy, you</span> do not need to go to the main railway station at all.  Rimini Viserba Station is just 400 meters away.  At Marina Grande (the so-called seaside boulevard) there is no shortage of taverns, pizzerias and restaurants, and at the eighteenth stop (next to the hotel) is the Konad grocery supermarket. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you arrived in Rimini by train, then in the square in front of the main station there is a bus stop number 4. A ticket costs 1.20 –Ñ, but if you buy ten pieces at once, it will cost less.  The stamped ticket is valid for one hour: you can change lines, get off and get on the bus again.  To get to Hotel Giamaica 3, you need to get off at the 17th stop.  First you need to get from the airport to the railway station by train number 9. In the summer, shuttle buses are also allowed on this route, but they cost much more (13 –Ñ versus 2).  Many tourists arrive in Rimini to watch "Italy in miniature."  This collection of small-scale architectural masterpieces is located in the town of Ricone.  There goes the city bus number 8. <span>The bus stop</span> is located right at the gate of the hotel.  In just five minutes drive you will reach the Rimini Fiera Exhibition Center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3 standard" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  "Jamaica 3 *" - a mini-hotel.  It just has twenty three numbers.  However, they all differ in status.  There are the simplest guest rooms (economy), which attracts tourists to the budget hotel Giamaica 3. Standard Single room (for one person) is equipped with a color TV, telephone and air conditioning (for an additional fee), the bathroom has a shower.  Approximately the same conditions in Standard DUS, but there the room is more spacious.  The cheapest rooms (for three persons) are equipped with bunk beds.  But there are better rooms.  This room category is called Superior.  Bathrooms have a bidet and hairdryer, while the bedroom has a safe.  All rooms have hygiene products and a set of towels.  All guest rooms feature small balconies.  Half of the rooms overlook a small garden, while others overlook the San Marino Valley.  The rooms are decorated in a bright color palette, in a modernist style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3 Italy" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477488.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  Additional terms and payment </h2><p>  If you read the reviews available about the Giamaica 3 * hotel, you can find out that many are unhappy with the fact that at the time of check-in it is necessary to pay a city fee in the amount of 21 euros.  Central heating batteries in this part of Italy have a very vague idea.  The rooms are heated here with air conditioning.  To use it, you need to pay for this service - 4 euros per day or 3 per night from May 31 to September 5.  At other times, the price is reduced.  Wi-Fi is available in all rooms.  But to connect to the World Wide Web, you also need to pay 15 –Ñ (for the entire period of residence).  But the safe, unlike most hotels, can be used for free.  However, a deposit of 50 –Ñ is charged.  This is also not very popular with tourists.  The administration has its own requirements for a minimum stay.  In the season (June 29 - August 25) it is at least seven nights, at another time - three. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3 rimini reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price includes breakfast.  What do the reviews say about this meal in Giamaica 3?  Italy is used to starting its day with a cup of coffee or a cappuccino with a hot croissant.  Therefore, those who were used to seeing chicken dumplings at breakfast on the table, plus Greek mushrooms and mushrooms and cherry dumplings for appetizers, were somewhat disappointed.  Well, Rimini is not Poltava ... But in the <span>buffet</span> mode you can taste the real <span>Parma ham.</span>  Half board (lunch or dinner) is available for a fee.  This is a strictly standardized set of dishes on the menu, which includes the first, second and dessert.  In the tourist season you can buy All Inclusive.  It costs 11 –Ñ between 25.05 to 2.08 and from 24.08 to 28.09, and from 03 to 23 August - 13 –Ñ.  This amount includes drinks for lunch and dinner, as well as an additional bonus - the ability to use a <span>beach umbrella</span> and <span>deck chairs</span> for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews Giamaica 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477495.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services on site </h2><p>  Since the Giamaica 3 * hotel is small, it is easy to describe in a nutshell.  At the entrance, guests are greeted by a nice little terrace with sofas where it is good to relax in the sun.  After passing it, you find yourself in the lobby, where the reception is open around the clock.  To the right is the restaurant hall, from where it always smells deliciously of homemade cakes, and to the left - a bar and a fitness center.  The top two floors are occupied by rooms.  Among the services you can recall a free shuttle to the railway station and bike rental.  A playground has been built for children.  Upon prior request, a cot can be installed in the room for a baby up to two years old.  There is a small parking lot for 4-5 cars at the hotel (eight euros per day).  If desired, you can give clothes to the laundry.  If you leave Rimini in the evening, you can, having handed over the number, put things in a storage room near the reception. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The modern city of Rimini is fifteen kilometers of wonderful sandy beaches.  So, at least, reviews say.  Giamaica 3 is located just fifty meters from its private beach.  There you can rent two sunbeds and an umbrella for 10 –Ñ per day.  Sunset at sea is very convenient - no rocks, steep descent.  The beach is ideal for swimming with children.  The sea is very shallow, without waves.  There is a playground on the beach, all sorts of fun activities for kids are regularly arranged, participation in which is free.  Adult services include water activities.  But they are already charged.  There are many beaches on Marina Grande, most of them are paid.  But the mistress Natalya will always tell you which coast is the best place to relax.  Near the ferris wheel is a public free beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giamaica 3 reviews Italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Giamaica 3 (Rimini): reviews </h2><p>  After reading about what Russian tourists write, you can make yourself a misconception about the hotel "Jamaica 3 *".  This is a budget hotel, and it would be foolish to demand spacious rooms and a pool for such ridiculous money.  Yes, breakfasts are always the same.  But the statement that they give only coffee and one croissant is not true.  Firstly, breakfast is buffet style.  In addition to drinks (coffee, tea, cappuccino), there is always salami, ham, cheese, butter, granola, jam, many different fruits and delicious Italian pastries.  On Sundays, the property organizes musical evenings at the bar.  The rooms are kept in exceptional cleanliness, linen is changed twice a week, towels - daily.  The hotel is full of Russian tourists, which creates some inconvenience, but the soundproofing in the rooms is level.  Reviews suggest visiting the Barracuda fish restaurant nearby, as well as the Sweet line cafe. </p>
