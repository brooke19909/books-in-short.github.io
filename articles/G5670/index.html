    <h2>  Prelude </h2><p>  Already at the beginning of the century, the upcoming war was often discussed in Europe.  Neither politicians nor writers had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow large-scale it will be.  Even the military did not know about this.  Small military campaigns took place in Europe from time to time, but all of them ended rather quickly, because they were conducted, as a rule, against a weak enemy.  The spears could not withstand <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="47" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">machine guns</span> , the ancient cannons with powerful naval guns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the French, hatred of the Germans was growing, which arose in the 70s of the XIX century <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="30" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> after Bismarck signed an agreement according to which Alsace and almost all of Lorraine passed to Germany.  The ambitions of the Germans, meanwhile, grew in direct proportion to industrial development.  They had neither colonies, nor sea power, nor influence on Asian Muslims.  To gain a dominant position in Europe <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> this was the goal of Germany in the First World War. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  What were the goals and plans of the participants in the First World War?  This question is answered differently.  Thomas <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="8" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Woodrow</span> Wilson once said that looking for a reason that prompted the European powers to start a war in 1914 is useless. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="49" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Armed</span> conflict always breeds rivalry, and the logic of anti-war sentiment cannot smooth it out.  At the beginning of the 20th century, it manifested itself in different ways.  In France, irritation grew against Germany, annexing <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="50" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">its</span> lands in 1871.  The Germans looked with greater confidence toward the eastern border, cherishing territorial ambitions.  Nicholas II made plans for the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="9" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Balkans</span> .  Austria-Hungary tried to maintain its fragile imperial structure. </p><p>  What sentiments prevailed in Britain before the outbreak of World War I?  The goals of Germany in the upcoming <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="51" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">armed</span> conflict were known to political scientists.  British journalists and writers sounded the alarm: the naval power of Germany was growing rapidly. </p><p>  Kaiser dreamed in the naval power to equal Britain, which became for him one of the goals in the First World War.  The personnel of the German Navy was increased by 15 thousand officers and soldiers.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="10" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Churchill</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="70" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">suggested</span> taking a short break to build up military force, but the Germans did not support the idea.  This happened in 1912.  At the same time, Serbia won the war with Turkey, inflicting a severe blow to the prestige of the Germans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1913, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Churchill</span> again put forward a proposal to postpone the arms race.  But this time, Kaiser did not heed the advice of the British Prime Minister.  The German army at that time consisted of more than 600 thousand people.  What goals did the participants of the First World War pursue?  First of all, the satisfaction of insatiable territorial greed. </p>

    <h2>  July crisis </h2><p>  By this term in history it is customary to understand the largest diplomatic clash of European states that occurred in the summer of 1914.  In order to answer the question about the objectives of the First World War, it is necessary to understand what the so-called July crisis was. </p><p>  So, on June 28, a loud murder was committed in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="14" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Sarajevo</span> .  The Austro-Hungarian government responded with lightning speed.  Namely, it presented an ultimatum to Serbia, which contained a demand to find and punish those responsible for the murder of the Archduke.  The fact that the attackers are subjects of the Hamburg Empire, the investigation was able to establish quite quickly.  Politicians believed that Austrian sentiment could only be destroyed by force.  In their opinion, the Serbian authorities did everything to undermine monarchical influence on the Balkan Peninsula. </p><p>  Serbia had a huge impact on the Slavs who lived in Austria-Hungary.  Therefore, the authorities believed that any separatist sentiments constituted a threat to the existence of an imperial state.  The killing of the Archduke was used by the Austro-Hungarian government as an excuse for <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">armed</span> action against Serbia. </p><p>  In early July, the German government began to <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">seriously</span> fear that demands on Serbia would lead to the Russian Empire entering into <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="59" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">armed</span> conflict.  And this, in turn, would serve as the beginning of large-scale hostilities.  Fears came true.  On July 28, Austria declared war on Serbia.  This date is officially considered the beginning of the First World War.  Briefly, the goals of the powers that took part in it cannot be stated.  This topic is devoted to many historical works, documentaries. </p><p>  It is known that on July 29, the British Prime Minister proposed convening the heads of European states in order to maintain peace.  However, the rulers did not have the strength or desire to stop the impending catastrophe.  July 29, Serbia was threatened with artillery shelling.  The Russian Empire announced the mobilization of a huge population.  About six million people were drafted into the army.  Although there was no declaration of war on Austria that day. </p>

    <h2>  Negotiations between Germany and Russia </h2><p>  In order to avoid World War I, whose goals for Russia were rather gloomy, Nicholas II sent a telegram to the Kaiser.  With the German ruler, the Russian tsar was in friendly correspondence.  A telegram in which he asked to do everything possible to stop Austria-Hungary before it went too far, Nicholas II signed <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="22" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Nicky <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="23" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> .  Kaiser responded to the Russian Tsar in the same spirit, promising to influence the Austrians and encourage them to reach an agreement with the Russian Empire.  The answer to Nicholas II was <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="32" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="24" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Willy. <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="25" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> </p><p>  After the king received a telegram from the Kaiser, he replaced the general mobilization with a partial one.  Kaiser later advised Nicholas II not to enter into a military conflict, so as not to draw Europe into a bloody war.  By the way, the mobilization could not be canceled.  She already walked all over the country in full swing.  And soon news came to St. Petersburg that Germany was preparing for war.  July 30, Nicholas II signed an order for general mobilization.  The Russian public hoped this would stop the war. </p><p>  Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia demanding to stop the mobilization, which was refused.  Then she turned to France with a request to maintain neutrality.  But this time, a refusal was received.  Germany was confident that the Russian army, which the Germans considered heavy and awkward, could be defeated quite quickly.  But the opposing forces were too great. </p><p>  In France in those days about <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="60" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">three</span> million soldiers were already crowding in the barracks.  This indicated that while the German army was advancing <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">on Russia, a</span> crushing blow <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="61" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">would</span> overtake <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="61" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">it</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">in the west</span> .  Perhaps even defeat.  And therefore, one of the prominent German military leaders developed a plan according to which it was first necessary to defeat France, and then fall upon the Russian Empire. </p>

    <h2>  Members </h2><p>  Before telling about further events, it is worth once again, and already in a more concise form, to state the goals of the powers in the First World War.  Two warring camps into which the participants divided: the Fourth Union and the Entente.  The first <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is</span> Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire Bulgaria.  The Entente <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is</span> a union that Russia, France, and Britain have joined. </p><h2>  The objectives of entry into the First World War </h2><p>  Germany sought to establish dominance first in Europe, and then throughout the world.  This was well known in Russia, Great Britain, and France.  For several decades, the Germans were building up military power.  For Austria, the goals and plans in the First World War were not so large-scale <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">- to</span> establish control over the Balkans. </p><p>  Great Britain was haunted by certain lands of the Ottoman Empire, which by the beginning of the 20th century had significantly weakened.  In addition, England sought to seize the oil possessions located in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Mesopotamia</span> and Palestine.  The goals of <span>France in World War I</span> were as follows: weaken Germany, establish dominance in Europe and, of course, regain <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Alsace</span> and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="6" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Lorraine</span> . </p><p>  The Turks, who became allies of Germany, sought to seize Crimea, Iran and maintain control in the Balkans.  What were the goals of Russia in the First World War?  Like France, it sought to weaken German influence.  In addition, the Russian Empire needed a free passage through the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Dardanelles</span> and Bosphorus to the Mediterranean Sea.  And, of course, increased influence in the Balkans.  These are the goals of the countries in the First World War <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">- the</span> war, which until 1939 was considered the most terrible, bloody, large-scale in history. </p>

    <h2>  Year 1914 </h2><p>  Military action took place mainly in the French and Russian theaters of operations.  Battles were also fought in the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, China, Africa and Oceania.  Each <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">of the participants in World War I</span> planned to achieve <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">his goal in</span> just a few months.  No one then suggested that the conflict would drag on for four years. </p><p>  So, Germany, according to the plan mentioned above, planned to capture Paris within 39 days, and then immediately go east.  One of the famous sayings of the German ruler: <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="26" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Lunch will be in Paris, and dinner in St. Petersburg. <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span>  France intended to start hostilities with the return of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Alsace</span> and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Lorraine</span> . </p><p>  The path of <span>German troops</span> to Paris ran through Belgium.  On August 4, the <span>German army</span> captured the small state without much difficulty.  True, the Belgian army unexpectedly showed quite powerful, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="62" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">given</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="63" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">its</span> strength, resistance.  But this, of course, could not hold the enemy for a long time.  For the French, the invasion of Belgium came as a surprise, but they still managed to transfer their units pretty quickly. </p><p>  The French for some time had to not only abandon the plan to return the lands that had once been annexed by Germany, but also to retreat.  The German army was rapidly advancing.  The British retreated to the coast, the French in early September were already preparing a summer house in the capital.  However, the <span>battle on the Marne</span> ended in victory over Germany.  This event had a significant impact on the further course of the war. </p><p>  By the beginning of 1915, it became clear that Germany would not achieve its goals, and the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="65" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">armed</span> conflict, contrary to the wishes of all <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="66" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">its</span> participants, would be protracted.  The Germans captured Belgium and a significant territory of France.  They could not win the French within a month and go to Russia.  The war promised to be long, exhausting. </p>

    <h2>  Eastern front </h2><p>  In 1915, the retreat of the Russian army began.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="17" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Galicia</span> was lost.  Until mid-spring, groups of Austrian troops were concentrated here.  In early May, the enemy <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="67" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">delivered a</span> powerful blow to the Russian army.  The eastern front shifted towards the Russian Empire.  The withdrawal of Russian troops ended in late August.  In the second year of the war, Germany achieved significant military victories and seized enemy territory.  But the general goal was never achieved. </p><h2>  1916-1918 </h2><p>  On May 31, the Battle of Jutland took place.  There is still debate about who won it, Great Britain or Germany.  However, the events that took place in 1916 showed a clear superiority of the Entente.  In December, the German government proposed an alliance, but was refused.  Over the next two years, Germany made several more attempts to capture France, but not one of them was successful.  The revolution that took place in Russia in 1917 had a significant impact on the course of further events.  The Germans entered into a truce with the new state. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Not only the war itself was terrible, but also <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="68" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">its</span> consequences.  New borders were established, many years of conflict provoked.  The war changed the map of Europe.  Neither the Russian, nor the German, nor the Ottoman Empire existed now.  Nor was Austria-Hungary.  The German economy has greatly weakened.  The national humiliation experienced by the Germans led to revanchist sentiments that engendered fascism. </p><p>  After the war ended, the world community realized: henceforth, armed conflicts will be total.  The war led to the <span>militarization of the economy.</span>  Arms race - to obtain weapons that can destroy the whole world. </p>
