But when they first appeared, they made a splash.  They managed not only to remove dust from carpets, but also to wash floors.  A very convenient thing for apartments in which you need to clean very often.  The <span>Zelmer</span> ZVC752STRU washing <span>vacuum cleaner</span> does a good job.  Its main advantage is the price.  It does not cost as much as powerful solutions from Karcher.  Although there is German quality.  However, let us consider this interesting device in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="zelmer zvc752stru review" class="if uuid-3239553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239553.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  Let's start with the most obvious.  The design of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU (whose review we started) is classic, without any frills.  There is no giant bulging reservoir for water.  The case has a solid structure and discreet colors.  Most released models in white and blue colors.  And this is not bad, as these colors fit perfectly into any interior.  On the top of the vacuum cleaner is a control panel consisting of several buttons.  It is made in the shape of a rectangle of dark color.  Also on the panel there are LEDs that notify the user about a particular mode of operation of the vacuum cleaner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="zelmer zvc752stru reviews" class="if uuid-3239527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239527.jpg"></div><p>  Also on the top of the unit is a button to block the water supply and a convenient handle for carrying the device.  The water tank itself is located in the rear of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU vacuum cleaner (reviews of which we will discuss a bit later).  In order to get to the tank, you just need to raise the upper part.  Also, the unit is equipped with rather large wheels, which allow it to easily move on any surface.  Complete with a vacuum cleaner there are several nozzles, a telescopic tube and a shiny hose for connecting to the vacuum cleaner itself.  In general, this unit looks decent.  Almost all of its owners think the same way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  User reviews about the design of the device </h2><p>  Many owners of this miracle believe that it has a very nice and modern design.  Others believe that he has a classic look.  But almost everyone claims that the appearance of the vacuum cleaner is very successful.  It fits perfectly into the interior of any room and does not even need to be hidden in a closet.  Also, many were pleased with the low weight of the vacuum cleaner and its, one might say, miniature dimensions.  Thanks to this, it can be dragged from place to place without any problems.  Yes, and it does not require much space.  In the comments, many write that this is exactly what a washing vacuum cleaner should be for home use.  In general, even those who found some flaws of a different plan are satisfied with the appearance of the device and its dimensions.  But more on that later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="review of the vacuum cleaner zelmer zvc752stru" class="if uuid-3239557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239557.jpg"></div><h2>  Weight and dimensions </h2><p>  Zelmer ZVC752STRU, whose reviews are mostly positive, is one of the most compact washing vacuums on the market.  Its dimensions are only 34.8 x 49.2 x 35.7 centimeters.  It fits easily in any cabinet.  And in the corner he will not take up much space.  The vacuum cleaner also weighs not very much.  Only 8 and a half kilograms.  For a washing vacuum cleaner, this is an impressive result.  If you compare it with similar products, for example, from Karcher, then against their background this product really looks like a baby.  And this is good.  Since the giant monsters with a loud roar no one needs.  Their times are gone.  What can not but rejoice.  However, now it‚Äôs time to move on to the technical specifications of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner zelmer zvc752stru" class="if uuid-3239539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239539.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to a further review of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU vacuum cleaner.  And now we will consider the technical characteristics of the device.  To begin with, the volume of the aquafilter (reservoir) is 5 liters.  There is also a fine filter according to the HEPA standard (H10).  The vacuum cleaner is also equipped with an engine with a total power of 1600 watts.  This is quite enough for any type of pollution.  With such characteristics, he easily copes with cleaning carpets, floors, rugs and linoleums.  It is worth noting that the device also has a very convenient design.  It can be easily carried in one hand.  There will be no discomfort.  Also, its engine is not very noisy, which positively affects the comfort when cleaning with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="zelmer zvc752stru suction power" class="if uuid-3239555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239555.jpg"></div><h2>  Suction power.  Nuances </h2><p>  A key feature of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU is its suction power.  She is really great here.  The power of the engine itself is 1600 watts.  This means that it is with this power that debris is absorbed from carpets or other coatings.  Yes, there are vacuum cleaners and more powerful.  But they do not have such downforce.  If you hold the brush at the right angle, perpendicular to the surface, then it is almost impossible to tear off the floor.  This suggests that the suction power of this unit is quite high.  And it does not matter which cleaning mode is selected: wet or dry.  By the way, the suction power can be adjusted.  To do this, there is a special controller on the control panel, which is located on the body of the Zelmer ZVC752STRVU washing vacuum cleaner.  Suction power is the trump card of this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  User feedback on the operation of the vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  Now let's try to find out from the owners how the Zelmer ZVC752STRU works.  User reviews in this regard are for the most part positive.  Almost all owners of this miracle claim that he removes it very cleanly.  Many even claim that they only now understand what real purity means.  Also, users conducted an experiment and vacuumed floors that were just washed with a vacuum cleaner in the wet cleaning mode.  The result was shocking.  Almost always, the water became incredibly dirty.  People say that after cleaning with this vacuum cleaner, even breathing in the apartment has become easier. </p><p>  As you can see, most leave enthusiastic comments.  This means that the product is really high quality and works well.  However, some users found a drawback: the water lock button does not work properly.  Moreover, judging by the reviews, this problem is widespread.  Apparently, something is wrong with the design of the notorious button.  But there are no perfect products.  And one small flaw is excusable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner zelmer zvc752stru reviews" class="if uuid-3239542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239542.jpg"></div><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  We continue to consider this interesting washing vacuum cleaner.  And now we‚Äôll talk about functionality.  This vacuum cleaner has several cleaning modes.  You can choose wet cleaning or dry.  Moreover, there is no difference which surface is planned to be cleaned.  The kit has a special turbo brush that can improve the quality of cleaning.  There is the possibility of power regulation.  There is also an indicator that the tank is full of garbage.  It is located on the control panel of the vacuum cleaner.  In general, the device has pretty good functionality.  Especially when you consider its cost.  However, now you need to continue the review of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU vacuum cleaner. </p><h2>  Nozzles included </h2><p>  This unit is equipped with a certain number of nozzles.  Among them there is a brush for dry cleaning, the same nozzle for wet cleaning and a turbo brush.  There is also a special nozzle for wet cleaning of furniture.  There is also a brush for cleaning in inaccessible places.  However, Zelmer ZVC752STRU, reviews of which convince of the quality of the unit, is not suitable for wet cleaning under beds or sofas.  In this mode, it is necessary that the brush is always strictly perpendicular to the floor.  And in a limited space this will not work.  But you can try dry cleaning.  It will be no less effective, since the Zelmer ZVC752STRU vacuum cleaner (washing) has enough suction power for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="zelmer zvc752stru instruction" class="if uuid-3240416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3240416.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews about the configuration </h2><p>  Now let's see what users say about the delivery set of the vacuum cleaner and more.  To begin with, the owners of this device are impressed by the fact that so many nozzles come with the device.  Especially pleased with the presence of a turbo brush.  She copes with even the most hopeless cases in the cleaning process. </p><p>  Another feature of the Zelmer ZVC752STRU is the instruction manual.  Users claim that it is written in a simple and accessible language.  There are no problems with setting up the vacuum cleaner, nor with the control, nor with its disassembly.  Moreover, the instruction has a very adequate Russian language, which also plays into the hands of the manufacturer.  The owners of this vacuum cleaner also note that there is no need to prepare a special place for storing brushes and nozzles.  They fit perfectly under the body of the vacuum cleaner itself.  And this is a very good decision from the manufacturer.  And people note the high quality of performance.  All components are designed so that there is no doubt about their durability and reliability. </p><h2>  Should I buy this vacuum cleaner? </h2><p>  This is a very interesting question.  And the answer to it depends on how tired you are of the garbage in the house.  If you want everything to shine with cleanliness, then it is definitely worth buying a Zelmer ZVC752STRU washing vacuum cleaner.  User reviews make this clear.  This unit is ideal in terms of value for money.  It is able to easily cope with any type of pollution, is not very noisy and has a compact size.  The latter factor, by the way, is very important.  Indeed, for an ordinary apartment there is no point in acquiring a giant monster from another manufacturer.  This vacuum cleaner looks more attractive than its opponents.  And this is what makes potential buyers pay attention to it. </p><p>  As for the operation of the device, you could make sure that all owners of this device unanimously say that the vacuum cleaner cleans everything and everything.  And it does it very high quality.  It is able to find and remove dirt even on freshly washed surfaces.  This alone speaks volumes.  By the way, it is worth noting that this unit uses water very economically.  As for reliability, you can be calm about that.  The owners of this miracle claim that Zelmer has been serving them faithfully for more than a year.  And some have been using the device for five years now and say that not a single breakdown has happened during this time.  Therefore, if you need a high-quality, reliable, functional, compact and capable of much cleaning vacuum cleaner, then choose this model.  Disappointed will not stay. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the Zelmer ZVC752STRU washing vacuum cleaner: suction power, reviews about it, its technical characteristics, functionality and other features.  Summing up, I want to say that this device belongs to the category of the best.  And the price for it is quite justified.  There are cooler models on the market, but they are already designed for cleaning professionals.  And for home use, there is nothing better than Zelmer on the market.  This vacuum cleaner will serve faithfully for many years.  And its functionality will allow you to clean almost any surface in a high-quality apartment.  That is why when choosing a washing vacuum cleaner, you should pay attention to the products of this brand.  And specifically for this model.  You will definitely not have problems with this vacuum cleaner. </p>
