But it is no secret that many travelers prefer to go there also because of the excellent service, amazing food and luxurious hotel complexes like palaces.  Therefore, the topic of our today's article will be 5 star hotels in Turkey, as well as their assessment by Russian tourists.  They will talk about entertainment shows, food, beach vacations and other criteria for an unforgettable vacation in these resorts.  We will also characterize the three hotels that have the best travelers rating among luxury Turkish hotels. </p><h2>  Where are the best hotels of Turkey (5 stars) </h2><p>  Turkey has a fairly large number of regions that are at sea.  All of them are resort towns, which are surrounded by a picturesque coast, indented by bays, pine and cedar forests, sandy or pebble beaches.  They are washed by the waters of the Mediterranean, Aegean and Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara.  At any such resort - in Antalya, Belek, Kemer, Marmaris or Bodrum - you will find hotels designed to relax VIP clients.  They are real cities, from the territory of which you simply do not want to leave - well, except in order to go on excursions.  Now let's talk about the criteria by which tourists determine the rating of the best 5 star hotels in Turkey. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newatvs.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top 5 All Inclusive Turkey Hotels" class="if uuid-2350698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350698.jpg"></div><h2>  All Inclusive </h2><p>  In Turkey, it is very difficult to find a hotel devoid of an all-inclusive system.  It is ideal for those vacationers who prefer to stay at the hotel almost all the time.  After all, it includes not only breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks between meals, drinks, including alcohol in bars, but also the use of other services, in particular spa procedures.  The best hotels in Turkey (5 stars, all inclusive) have dozens of restaurants and bars with a varied cuisine.  And the quality of the dishes they envy even the most picky gourmets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the hotels that are famous for their ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, Russian tourists especially highlight the ‚ÄúRixos Lares‚Äù in Antalya.  It consists of eight-story towers connected by residential buildings.  Its free food system includes not only Turkish alcohol, but also drinks from around the world, and guests can visit Turkish, Asian and Italian restaurants. </p><p>  Good reviews also of the Dolphin Deluxe Resort Hotel in Alanya.  Four restaurants, a special children's menu, a free sauna, fresh water pools and a water park - all this brings a real pleasure to vacationers. </p><p>  And ‚ÄúSelge Beach Resort and Spa‚Äù in Side every day offers guests dishes from different countries.  His bartenders are pouring vacationers the drinks of world famous alcohol brands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.titanic.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star Turkey hotels for families with children" class="if uuid-2350713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350713.jpg"></div><h2>  For families with children </h2><p>  Many hotels in Turkey (5 stars) have special programs designed to entertain kids and teens.  This is done not only so that they have a good rest, but also so that parents get an opportunity to escape from raising children and can be left to their own devices.  While the kids are having fun, adults will also be able to ‚Äúcome off‚Äù.  Water parks and entertainment, attractions, playgrounds and entire children's towns, special children's restaurants and cinemas, mini-clubs for different ages, special animation and discos - your offspring will be occupied from morning to evening, and at night they will sleep like dead. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the reviews of tourists from Russia, the best of these hotels are hotels with water slides.  This is a form of relaxation where both children and adults will have fun.  The first places in the ranking are occupied by such complexes as Vog Vanguard in Kemer, Sherwood Breeze Resort and Beach in Antalya, Maritim Pine in Belek.  Some of these hotels are located on the territory of nature reserves, which gives the rest with children a health-improving character, thanks to the healing air with the scent of pine trees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="passion4luxury.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotels in Turkey for a romantic getaway" class="if uuid-2350721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350721.jpg"></div><h2>  For relaxing together </h2><p>  With all that Turkey loves children very much, there are five-star hotels there with the concept of child-free, that is, only for adults.  They are intended for those who want to be together so that no one bothers.  By the way, these hotels are chosen not only by young couples, but also by senior citizens.  The best hotels with this concept are considered Sensimar Belek Resort, Santopia Marmaris Imperial, Centido Golden Bay in Alanya, Commodore Elite Suites and Spa in Side, Noah Kusadasi Beach Club. </p><p>  But choosing such hotels, check also their orientation.  If peace and quiet are important to you, then you should avoid complexes with night clubs on the territory.  And, on the contrary, if you want dancing, parties and fun until the morning, then it is better not to settle in hotels where everything is intended exclusively for passive relaxation. </p><h2>  The best hotels with private beach </h2><p>  Many Turkish luxury resorts are located on the first line.  Russian tourists leave good reviews about Kew Premium Resort in Alanya.  The hotel has a small territory, the beach is sand and pebble, but it is famous for a variety of water sports - diving, surfing. </p><p>  But the most luxurious 5 star hotel in Turkey with a sandy beach is Vuage Sorgun in Side.  All of his rooms are in a bungalow, not far from the sea.  A strip of sand 600 meters long.  There are two piers on the beach.  On the territory of four pools, a water park.  Food on the system of "ultra all inclusive."  Here you can try not only Turkish, but also French, Japanese and Chinese cuisine.  The Paloma Yasmine Resort in Bodrum, with luxurious rooms with sea views, also offers one of the best sandy beaches.  In his restaurant you can order specific menus - fish, diet, for diabetics, vegetarian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abouttimemagazine.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Turkey 5 stars sandy beach" class="if uuid-2350728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350728.jpg"></div><h2>  WOW Topkapi Palace </h2><p>  According to Russian tourists, this hotel ranks first in the rating of hotels in Turkey (5 stars).  "Topkapi Palace" is not a complex, but a real palace for relaxation, which is located in Antalya.  It impresses travelers not only with its entertainment, level of service, luxury of rooms and exclusive dishes in restaurants, but also with its architectural solution.  This hotel is a copy of the real palace of the Turkish rulers of Topkapi, which is located in Istanbul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipdmcturkey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Turkey 5 stars" class="if uuid-2350734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350734.jpg"></div><h2>  Amara Dolce Vita </h2><p>  This hotel also takes first place every year in the <span>top hotels in Turkey</span> (5 stars).  It is located in Kemer, in a secluded place, far from the hustle and bustle that is characteristic of large resorts.  The hotel boasts the longest beach in the vicinity with a huge VIP zone and a marina and ship.  The dishes of its 12 restaurants, probably, include everything that only the cuisine of all countries of our planet is rich in.  8 pools (heated, with sea and fresh water) stretch along the coast, surrounded by a luxurious park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mia-tour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel rating of Turkey 5" class="if uuid-2352185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2352185.jpg"></div><h2>  Adam &amp; Eve Deluxe </h2><p>  This holiday complex is located in Belek, on the Mediterranean coast.  It is surrounded by pine forests and gardens.  Its rooms feature ultra-modern hi-tech style with mirrored walls, and the bathrooms have massage showers.  Yes, and the filling of the rooms is appropriate - huge TVs, folding chairs, the Internet.  There are 24 villas for VIP relaxation, which guests are served by butlers.  This hotel is appreciated by tourists for a variety of entertainments from which eyes just scatter.  This includes horse riding, diving lessons, and windsurfing, and even piloting an airplane.  The hotel has a golf course.  The huge spa offers lounges, a solarium for sunbathing, as well as Thai and Ayurvedic massages.  Seven restaurants offer not only delicious dishes, but also a variety of programs.  In one of them, the waiters are dressed like angels.  In the other you can lie on soft sofas during dinner, and in the third you can order the blind menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.catttour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotels Turkey" class="if uuid-2350739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2350739.jpg"></div><h2>  5 Star Turkey Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  Recently, picky Russian tourists have begun to appreciate the so-called ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù hotels, which are copies of famous architectural buildings or are located in palaces converted to modern comfort.  As a rule, in addition to reviews of gourmet cuisine and well-trained staff, as well as a variety of entertainment on site, travelers enthusiastically describe the picturesque corners in which such complexes are located, and the special flavor of their "Sultan" holiday.  An important role is played by the proximity to a wide well-groomed, preferably sandy beach, with a large number of comfortable sunbeds. </p>
