  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Many-sided vacation in the USA</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The United States is one of the largest and most prosperous states in the world, into which almost everyone seeks to get.  At the end of the 20th century, many people went there for their dreams, in search of a better life, which they were promised by the heroes of <span>American films.</span>  With the growth of citizens' incomes and the stabilization of the economic situation, tourists became more interested in vacation in the United States than permanent residence in it.  America is so diverse that it can satisfy the needs of almost every traveler.  Here you can spend several days on the best beaches, on the ocean, go to a dream factory, in Hollywood, win and suddenly get married in Las Vegas or watch the most famous productions of Broadway for the whole world. </p><p>  Those who prefer a <span>beach holiday</span> in the United States should spend it in <span>Miami, where</span> the best beaches of the Pacific coast are located.  This city has become a favorite destination of many celebrities, including Pamela Anderson, Gwen Stefani, Jeanne Friske and many others.  In Miami, surfing and diving are very developed.  Anyone can learn one of these sports.  Some tourists who come here prefer not to check into hotels, but to rent villas on the coast for a while.  Sometimes this significantly reduces the cost of housing.  Many stars who have been here at least once fall in love with the city so much that they immediately buy a house for themselves here. </p><p>  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in the United States without visiting Washington, its capital.  It is here that the world-famous American White House is located - the place where all the politics of America is going on.  Washington is a huge city with a huge number of museums, squares and monuments.  Most of all, New York attracts everyone - a city that many writers, singers and artists admired.  It is here that the famous symbol of America stands the <span>Statue of Liberty,</span> about which even those who have never been to the United States know.  Going to New York, you must definitely plan a walk in Central Park.  Today it is one of the largest parks in the world.  Its length is 4 km and its width is 800 m. Many artists were inspired by the nature of this place.  Central Park is a small island of wildlife in a huge metropolis. </p><p>  For those people who do not think rest in the United States without making purchases, you need to go to Los Angeles.  Here at Rodeo Drive is a huge number of boutiques of almost all fashion houses in the world.  The American fashion industry is more focused on ordinary buyers than the French, for example.  In US stores, you can buy interesting, high-quality items of famous brands, which cost much less than in other cities of the world.  A similar street in New York can be called 5 Avenue, which presents exclusively premium brands.  Another place, because of which last minute packages to the USA are so <span>popular, was</span> Hollywood <span>known to</span> everyone.  Millions of actors and actresses of different levels come here for their dreams.  This is a huge dream factory, where the wildest dreams come true.  Making a name for yourself here is very difficult, but the lucky ones who managed to get their <span>lucky ticket, the</span> whole world knows in person. </p><p>  Another city where almost all young people aspire is Las Vegas.  It is also called the city of sins, because it is here that you can lose everything in one minute, marry a stranger, have fun day and night.  In fact, Las Vegas exists due to the entertainment industry and human vices.  Many vacationers buy last-minute tours to the USA precisely because of the opportunity to save on tickets, so that later they can spend this money in the casino of Las Vegas.  America is one of the youngest countries in the world that has already become a role model. </p>
