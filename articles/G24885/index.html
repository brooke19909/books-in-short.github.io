Varieties of coins and their prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who start collecting coins should be aware that their value is not always limited to face value.  Such samples come across whose price can pleasantly please the owner.  For example, no one can immediately say how much it costs 5 rubles 1998.  To do this, carefully consider the coin. </p><h2>  First feature </h2><p>  All banknotes that are or were previously in circulation on the territory of Russia are made at two well-known <span>mints.</span>  One of them is located in the capital of our country - Moscow, and the other - in St. Petersburg.  Despite the fact that the appearance of each coin is predetermined and strictly approved, samples are used in everyday life that have some differences compared to other products.  It is these specimens that become the subject of lust for numismatists.  But even an experienced specialist will not be able to immediately determine, for example, how much is 5 rubles 1998.  To do this, he will first need to find out where a particular product was released.  As you know, in the work of each enterprise, minor failures sometimes occur.  Finished products in this case will not be considered defective.  But it will remain individual characteristics that will make it unique.  Take, for example, five-ruble coins made in 1998 in St. Petersburg.  In the case of standard coinage, they can now be sold for no more than two face values.  But there are coins on which the ‚ÄúSPMD‚Äù stamp, located on the obverse under the left paw of the eagle, is slightly lowered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In this case, the answer to the question of how much is 5 rubles in 1998 will be somewhat different.  Such instances can be sold for 500, and sometimes for 800 rubles.  This is a pretty solid bonus for a little inaccuracy. </p><h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  Before determining <span>how much it costs 5 rubles 1998,</span> it is necessary to have a complete picture of the appearance of the coin.  It is a round billet with a diameter of 25 millimeters, made of an alloy of copper and nickel.  This is a fairly common material for the manufacture of metal banknotes.  The coin edge is made in the form of alternating sections: smooth and grooved.  Each of them should be exactly twelve.  A total of 60 identical notches are applied to the side surface.  The product has a thickness of 1.8 millimeters with a mass of 6.45 grams.  On the obverse in the upper part in a circle in capital letters it says ‚ÄúBANK OF RUSSIA‚Äù.  In the center is a double-headed eagle with a mint mark under its paw.  Under it is clearly indicated the value of the face value and the date of issue.  Both inscriptions are separated from each other by a straight line with a small dot in the center.  On the reverse, slightly to the left of the center, a relief image of a digital value is applied, under which is the name of the currency.  On the right side is an ornament in the form of a curved branch with several curls. </p><h2>  Second feature </h2><p>  If you look closely at the coins made in St. Petersburg, you can see that some of them also have certain inaccuracies.  According to the approved drawing, the sheet located to the right of the number ‚Äú5‚Äù should fit snugly to the edge.  On some instances this does not happen.  Between the leaflet and the solid edging a small gap is clearly visible. </p>

    <p>  This could happen as a result of the displacement of the form.  Similar samples were released a little.  That is why any numismatist dreams of such a model.  What is the real value of such a coin of 5 rubles 1998?  The price usually ranges from 2.5 thousand rubles.  It all depends on the state of the instance.  If the product is perfectly clean and shiny, then you can even take 8 thousand rubles for it.  Such a figure of any person can make you think.  Indeed, such coins are still in circulation.  Each citizen can become their happy owner if he carefully looks at what money is in his hands. </p>
