    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive comments, there was a negative in the Dacha del Sol complex (4 * hotel, Anapa).  The reviews indicate the following points that would be good to fix: </p><ul><li>  the hotel really lacks its own spa center; </li><li>  Wireless Internet is working intermittently; </li><li>  as in many similar hotels, the staff for some reason refuses to include <span>pool heating</span> in cold weather; </li><li>  the road to the sea takes much more time than indicated on the official website of the hotel; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel has a private beach, for an extra charge, workers let outsiders into it, and therefore here you are not protected from crowds of vacationers and lack of free places; </li><li>  there is no first-aid post and any medical staff on the hotel‚Äôs territory, and therefore, in unforeseen situations, you simply can‚Äôt count on first aid; </li><li>  in some houses there are ants; </li><li>  during the summer season, accommodation prices are very high. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists are attracted to "Dacha Del Sol" (4 * hotel, Anapa).  The city is characterized by a huge number of hotels, but not all work on the all-inclusive system.  We can say that the level of service does not reach the Turkish and Egyptian resorts, but in general everything looks very worthy.  In addition to excellent food, it is also worth noting the presence of its own zone on the beach, where guests are given free not only sun loungers and umbrellas, but also drinks.  If you get hungry during the day, you don‚Äôt have to spend money on a restaurant, because snacks are provided between the main meals. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the "Dacha del Sol" complex (4 * hotel) is oriented specifically towards summer beach vacations, reviews suggest that in the hot season the prices for accommodation are very high.  That is why many people prefer to come here for the May holidays or in the fall.  It is also very convenient to get to nearby resorts from here, which saves you from having to pay extra for trips organized by the tour desk.  In general, this hotel will be just the perfect option for an active family vacation in incredibly comfortable and beautifully decorated bungalows. </p>
