What will happen to the bank?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Back in 1992, under the name "Vatan", a bank was created in Dagestan, which was subsequently purchased and moved to the city of Fryazino, Moscow Region.  Then he was renamed Mosoblbank.  In November 2011, the Central Bank of the Federation banned him from accepting deposits from individuals who are not shareholders of the bank for six months.  But this financial institution circumvented the specified requirement.  It gave each investor its own share, without explaining to anyone what was happening with Mosoblbank. </p><h2>  Start of problems </h2>

In January 2012, a large-scale audit began there, which helped to identify these frauds.  Subsequently, the bank continued to attract customer funds, offering them some of the most attractive rates.  In 2013, Mosoblbank, according to one of the reputable print media, was able to enter 30 reliable banks.

    <p>  But in early May 2014, the press reported that about 60 billion rubles had been withdrawn from accounts, fraudulent schemes were used for this.  Despite the fact that management sued in order to protect their reputation, problems with Mosoblbank have already begun.  On May 19, it became known that the CBR had decided on the need for intervention in the affairs of the bank.  Already on the 21st day of the same month, it was decided to conduct a procedure for its recovery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sanctions Bypass </h2>

    <p>  At the beginning of 2013, Mosoblbank was ordered to restrict activity ‚Äî it was not allowed to open new branches for three months, and activity with individuals and cash was limited for six months.  Despite this, the leadership of the financial institution created a special system, thanks to which two records were kept, there were two parallel balance sheets.  That is, all activity was hiding from the Russian Central Bank, and Mosoblbank‚Äôs problems could be hidden for a long time. </p><p>  As a result, this financial company was able to attract 100 billion from individuals into its accounts. True, only 1/5 of this amount was visible in the reports provided.  Finding out where the rest of the funds are is almost impossible.  Money was invested in utilities, clinics, and various enterprises.  The bank had almost 70 thousand square meters.  m of real estate in the capital and regions, large plots of land, mansions in the very center of Moscow. </p><h2>  Reasons for Remediation </h2>

    <p>  At that time, it seemed to many that there was no point in sorting out all the problems of Mosoblbank, it was much easier to revoke its license.  But the owners of this institution invested stolen funds in assets that are difficult to sell.  An agency engaged in the return of deposits of individuals would have to return to investors a fairly substantial amount in rubles - 100 billion, and it would hardly have been possible to compensate for it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  That is why, to save money, it was decided that it was better to sanitize Mosoblbank.  The revocation of the license was not able to solve all the problems.  But in the process of recovery, management was obliged to return the assets to a real balance. </p><h2>  Remediation Procedure </h2><p>  According to the decision of the Central Bank of Russia, ‚ÄúSMP-Bank‚Äù should be engaged in the recovery procedure for a problem financial institution.  He will be paired with a <span>deposit insurance</span> agency <span>.</span>  By the way, SMP-Bank was entrusted not only to the specified financial company, but also to Inresbank and Finance-Business-Bank.  The owners of all these institutions were the Malchevsky family. </p><p>  To carry out the recovery process, SMP Bank, which is owned by the Rotenberg brothers, planned a loan of 98.6 billion Russian rubles for a period of ten years.  According to the CBR plan, all problems of Mosoblbank should have been resolved after SMP Bank had enough shares to make key decisions. </p><p>  Of course, the sanator would like the liquidity of the bank to be better at the beginning of the recovery process, because the bank had a huge number of liabilities and dubious assets, the cost of many of which was overestimated.  But, on the other hand, SMP Bank had written guarantees from some former Mosoblbank shareholders that they had property that could cover part of the obligations. </p><h2>  The fate of customers </h2>

    <p>  Of course, having learned about the problems, investors became interested in what would happen to Mosoblbank.  Having invested at an attractive interest rate, they became afraid that they would not be able to return their contributions.  Most of all, the new shareholders began to worry.  When opening deposits, bank employees offered to buy shares of this institution, according to this scheme, about 3% of their total number was sold.  And 97% is owned by SMP Bank.  Citizens are most afraid of the fact that no one is required to redeem shares acquired by individuals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But ordinary investors have no particular reason for concern.  The problems of Mosoblbank are being gradually resolved, payments in this financial institution have already begun. </p><h2>  Business stop </h2><p>  The main reason why customers became interested in what is happening with Mosoblbank was the temporary suspension of payments and the issuance of deposits.  However, it did not last long; in June, operations were resumed.  True, many customers are unreasonably worried about the closure of a number of battery offices.  It does not matter in which branch of the bank the deposit was opened, the money will be returned in the corresponding attached divisions. </p><p>  Moreover, the client should not be bothered by the problems at Mosoblbank, they can choose any office that suits them (although it should be located within the same branch).  Each citizen, upon request, can change his place of service. </p><h2>  Activity regulations </h2>

Problems today, of course, still remain, but the recovery procedure will help this financial company stay on the market.  A special work procedure has been introduced in the bank, which stipulates how and in what amounts money can be issued to depositors.

    <p>  Thanks to the pre-agreed procedure for issuing deposits and limiting the amount of the daily payment, management wants to prevent panic and prevent citizens from withdrawing all available funds from their accounts.  Also, the problem bank has a list of documents that must be provided in order to receive the payment.  So the management wants to protect the financial institution under control from possible claims from dishonest citizens who want to take advantage of the critical situation in which Mosoblbank is now located.  The problems of 2014 affected many, because in total he has more than 300 thousand investors. </p>

    <h2>  Funding Procedure </h2><p>  The interim management of Mosoblbank says that money is paid at the box office on the day of circulation.  But in practice, it turns out that for payment it is better to leave a request and agree in advance on the amount and date of receipt.  A day you can get no more than 100 thousand. Larger amounts will be issued in parts. </p><p>  To receive a payment in rubles in the amount of up to 100 thousand, it is enough to present a passport.  In order to receive an amount in excess of the specified limit, you must provide the original contract that was concluded with the bank, and documents that can confirm the payment.  But in the event that the client wants to withdraw more than 700 thousand from the bank accounts, then he needs to prepare all the documents described above, submit an application and be ready to wait a few days.  Do not worry about what will happen to Mosoblbank, and think about why it does not give out the entire deposit at a time.  Large amounts are issued gradually, for receiving funds in full, you will have to come to the bank several times. </p><h2>  Features of activity in the crisis period </h2><p>  Taking into account the fact that the Central Bank made a decision to improve the specified financial institution, customers continue to actively use the services of the bank.  Fortunately for the sanatoriums, many did not panic and did not immediately rupture deposit agreements, thereby worsening the situation in which Mosoblbank is located.  The problems of 2014 did not affect the core business too much.  He also continues to attract deposits from individuals, however, interest rates have been revised downward by the new administration.  Also, since June, a commission for accepting <span>utility payments</span> in the amount of 1% has been introduced. </p>

True, the issuance of loans to legal entities has not yet been resumed, although settlement and cash services are carried out in the same volume as before the onset of the problems.

    <p>  In the future, the interim administration expects to expand the customer base of Mosoblbank.  Revocation of the license while continuing competent reorganization is not in danger.  The bank plans to improve the quality of services for various categories of both individuals and legal entities, increase the total volume of operations, reduce potential costs and increase its manageability.  But it is not planned to carry out the procedure of joining other structures or merging with other banks. </p>
