Phuket, aimed at guests of all ages, is famous not only for its wonderful nature and curious sights.  The resort, designed for a relaxed and active holiday, is also the territory of a wide variety of entertainment that will appeal to adults and children.  No one will call the life of tourists boring, because an exotic island takes care of its guests and does everything to diversify their leisure. </p><h2>  Tarzanka for tourists </h2><p>  Of course, being in a picturesque resort, I want to swim in the warm sea, sunbathe on a snow-white beach, get acquainted with unique architectural monuments, but the soul of a tourist requires fun and unforgettable impressions.  Entertainment in Phuket will appeal to everyone, and especially extreme lovers will like it.  Bungee jumping is an attraction for adults who want to tickle their nerves.  The so-called bungee attracts the local population and vacationers, who do not need to provide any information to jump into the abyss. </p>

    <p>  The most famous place where a 50-meter springboard is installed above a beautiful lake is located near the Kathu (Kathu) area and is called Jungle <span>Bungy Jump.</span>  Even a 13-year-old can jump down. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, extreme entertainment in Phuket is unsafe and can lead to the death of vacationers.  The second most popular venue was World Bungy Patong, where Thailand's highest springboard was located.  There were quite serious restrictions on age and weight at this attraction, however, after a tragedy with a tourist who collapsed to the ground from a great height, in 2015 the tower for jumping in Patong was demolished. </p><h2>  "Flight of the Gibbon" </h2><p>  Unusual entertainment in Phuket for people who are in good physical shape will make you forget a lot, because here they take care of a wonderful vacation and fun.  There are several picturesque parks on the island that allow tourists to make an exciting jungle flight on the ropes with experienced instructors. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúFlight of the Gibbon‚Äù is a unique attraction that many people compare in terms of adrenaline in the blood with a parachute jump.  The adventure tour is a tightrope flight among the dense jungle of Phuket.  At an altitude of about 40 meters, everyone will feel like a real Tarzan, quickly flying from branch to branch.  Tourists are waiting for cable bridges, rifts on special carts and vertical slopes, which are breathtaking.  But the most interesting is, of course, flights, and the longest will be 400 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is an exciting adventure, on the way of which there are stunning views of the sea and the colorful island of Phuket.  Entertainment for every taste will allow tourists to have a great rest from the city noise and enjoy the natural beauty. </p><h2>  Deep adventure </h2><p>  Guests of the first-class resort, who do not want to grill on the beach for days, choose an active holiday and go on a 30-minute trip on underwater motorbikes.  Tourists are always accompanied by experienced divers who help to navigate in depth.  Such underwater entertainment in Phuket is absolutely safe if you follow the briefing and the rules of diving. </p>

    <p>  The huge thematic FantaSea will immerse each visitor in the fabulous atmosphere of Thai legends.  The territory of the park, decorated with sculptures and colored with colorful lights, resembles magical scenes from ancient epics.  Luxurious palaces, fountains of bizarre shapes, transparent lakes will surprise children and their parents.  But the park‚Äôs main performance is a laser show with acrobatic stunts and aerial ballet, reminiscent of Cirque du Soleil and telling about the myths of Thailand.  Thirty elephants participate in the performance and perform amazing tricks that will delight guests arriving in Phuket. </p><h2>  Nightlife </h2><p>  Adult tourists who dream of getting to know the night resort go looking for adventure in the direction of Patong Beach, which is perpendicular to the ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù Bangla road, which lives from dusk to dawn.  An incredible number of bars and clubs with dance shows invite guests of the island to relax in an intimate atmosphere.  The transvestite show, which is very numerous in Thailand, attracts the attention of tourists even on a weekday, and the venues are crowded with curious foreigners who have come to take a look at something special.  This is a dubious, but very lively place that changes after dark.  According to tourists, adult entertainment at the resort does not know the prohibitions. </p>
