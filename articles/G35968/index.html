  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to disable ads on the "Android" in the phone: methods and instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most owners of personal computers, laptops and mobile gadgets believe that advertising is an evil that needs to be destroyed.  Some ten years ago, she was not so aggressive and did not climb from every site and application.  But someone decided that annoying blocks pop-up on the whole screen are the very ‚Äútrading engine" that the consumer lacked so much. </p><p>  In this regard, many users are wondering: "How do I disable ads on my Android phone?"  Owners of iPhones and iPads have this problem, fortunately, minimized, because Apple carefully filters aggressive spam and does not allow it in iTunes. </p><p>  There are not so many ways to disable ads on an Android device, but almost all of them imply knowledge of the platform, that is, they are intended for experienced users.  Here we are talking about a thorough study of OS files for the presence of virus code and its subsequent destruction. </p><p>  Well, for beginners and those who do not want to mess with system files and pick out viruses from the registry, there is a special software that allows you to remove ads on your Android phone.  Such programs start working immediately after activation and protect your mobile gadget from pop-up blocks, windows and other spam. </p><p>  In our article, we will analyze the programs that allow you to disable ads on your Android phone.  Consider the most popular, and most importantly, effective applications that have a large number of positive reviews from users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is immediately worth noting that such software allows you to disable and block, but not remove the adware virus from Android.  For this, you need to turn to complex products like Kaspersky, Doctor Web, and similar.  The solutions described below are precisely the blockers of windows, banners and other spam, and not a full-fledged antivirus that allows you to remove adware viruses from your Android phone. </p><h2>  Adblock Plus (ABP) </h2><p>  This is one of the most effective, and at the same time, popular products with lots of positive reviews.  It helps to completely disable ads on the Android phone.  The application is widely known as an extension for desktop browsers, but since 2012 a full version of the utility has appeared on mobile gadgets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neowin.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adblock plus" class="if uuid-2943716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943716.jpg"></div><p>  The application includes many filters, and very flexible.  So if you do not need full protection from advertising, you will need to configure AdBlock Plus on Android.  This part deals mainly with the fine-tuning of the proxy server.  For some users, mainly those who are in the "enemy camp" and engaged in the layout of banners, this will be very helpful.  In addition, not all advertising can be called aggressive, a small part of it can be really useful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Utility launch </h2><p>  The application interface is simple, clear and competently localized into Russian.  Therefore, there should not be problems with installation and activation.  In order to remove ads on the Android phone, just launch the application and move the slider to the ON position.  The utility will do the rest.  If you want to see ads approved by the Google and Yandex search engines, you can put a beacon on the line ‚ÄúAcceptable ads‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onhax.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adblock Plus for Android" class="if uuid-2943712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943712.jpg"></div><p>  After closing the main window, the application starts to work in the background.  The utility is not gluttonous to RAM and processor, but still owners of old and low-power devices experience some problems with the operation of the interface.  So if you have less than 1 GB of RAM, then it is worth looking at the utility easier. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that if you do not need a full-fledged blocker for applications, then you can use Adblock Plus as a plug-in for the browser.  This will significantly ease the load on the system resources of the mobile gadget.  In addition, the developer offers his own browser Adblock Browser.  It is less functional than the same Firefox or Chrome, but it will work for unpretentious users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Adguard </h2><p>  This application is no less popular than the previous utility, which allows you to completely block ads on your Android phone.  Adguard can be called a complete solution.  It includes not only a spam blocker, but also a firewall with an anti-phishing module. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slickdeals.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adguard utility" class="if uuid-2943717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943717.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main advantages of the utility is its flexibility.  The abundance of settings allows you to fine-tune each protection module, as well as apply individual rules to specific applications.  Here you can filter out any HTTPS connections and, if necessary, add sites to both white and black lists. </p><h2>  Features of the application </h2><p>  The program works both as a proxy server and as a local VPN.  The user chooses which algorithm is preferable for him, achieving the most high-quality and optimal traffic filtering for himself.  The utility allows you to disable ads on your Android phone completely.  That is, not only in applications, but in browsers and other OS management tools.  You will never again see the ubiquitous full-screen windows with Aliexpress on budget gadgets and other aggressive ads. </p><h2>  Utility launch </h2><p>  Installation and activation of the program does not take much time.  After starting, the utility will offer you its presets, where you will need to choose: block everything, check content on web pages or protect the gadget only from aggressive advertising.  This is very convenient if you do not want to mess with the settings and prefer one-click applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adguard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adguard for Android" class="if uuid-2943714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943714.jpg"></div><p>  But it‚Äôs worth clarifying that such complex products simply can‚Äôt be free, so you will have to pay a certain amount of money to use Adguard.  But buying a license is worth it.  Your mobile gadget will get rid of ads and other annoying spam forever. </p><h2>  Netguard </h2><p>  The developer positions his utility as a firewall for mobile devices running on the Android platform.  The application allows you to flexibly configure the rules for both incoming and outgoing traffic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quotes-quotes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="NetGuard Utility" class="if uuid-2943713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943713.jpg"></div><p>  With the latest updates, the product has an ad blocking feature.  The utility protects your mobile gadget from pop-ups, malicious links and prevents accidental clicks on aggressive banners. </p><h2>  Utility launch </h2><p>  To activate protection, just launch the application and move the slider in the "Traffic Filter" section.  For more advanced users, it is possible to create your hosts file and configure some individual rules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="NetGuard for Android" class="if uuid-2943719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943719.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the application consumes system resources to a minimum.  The utility works correctly even on ultra-budget devices with a small amount of RAM and low-power processors. </p><p>  As a fly in the ointment here is the finish layout of web pages after turning on the firewall.  Unlike the utilities described above, NetGuard simply removes ads, leaving empty space on the page instead.  But a completely free distribution license allows you to close your eyes to the shortcomings. </p><h2>  DNS66 </h2><p>  This small utility also acts as a firewall, using a local VPN to disable ads.  The application works with DNS protocols and filters traffic only when a connection is established.  This approach has its pros and cons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ghacks.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DNS66 utility" class="if uuid-2943715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2943715.jpg"></div><p>  A clear advantage of running the program through DNS is a significant saving in battery power.  That is, the application is activated and uses system resources, and with them the battery, only when your gadget is connected to the network. </p><p>  The disadvantage is the fact that the utility has to be activated every time again, after the gadget goes into sleep mode.  Also, the lack of Russian-language localization can be attributed to the disadvantages.  The latter can be found on specialized forums, but after installing the crack the program can crash and crash. </p><h2>  Utility launch </h2><p>  Something super complicated in the utility interface is not observed.  After starting the program, a start window with three sections will appear in front of you.  The main tool for ad blocking is the Domain Filters tab.  Here you can see the list of available filters, where each indicates the address of the ad server.  The color opposite each filter indicates its activity: green - used, red - no, gray - ignored. </p><p>  By default, only part of the servers is prohibited, but you can enable universal blocking by activating all the options presented.  For more advanced users, it is possible to add their addresses and rules. </p><p>  To activate the program, you must press and hold the power button on the first tab for some time.  After that, the system services of the utility begin to work and begin to block ads in your mobile gadget. </p><p>  The program is distributed completely free of charge, but periodically ‚Äúbegs‚Äù money for the development of the project.  The window with the donut pops up extremely rarely, so this approach cannot be called aggressive.  In all other respects, this is a very good ad blocker and firewall. </p>
