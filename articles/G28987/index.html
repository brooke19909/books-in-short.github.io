  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Management Systems Research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Management is successful only when its continuous and continuous development is ensured, when changes are introduced that ensure not only the viability of the organization, but also the accumulation of innovation potential.  The development of such a process is helped by the study of control systems.  As a result of such a study, the most effective options for constructing control systems are developed and proposed. </p><p>  If you rely only on experience, common sense and intuition, it is impossible to make the right decisions.  For proper management and decision-making, there is a need to study situations, conditions, problems and factors of the effectiveness of the managed organization, we need a reasonable choice of solutions from the possible number of options. </p><p>  Therefore, a comprehensive study of management systems helps to determine the right direction of development of the organization.  Each organization is in constant development, this process consists of solving many problems that follow one after another, possibly arising together.  This sometimes happens unexpectedly, sharp moments often do not leave time to think over situations.  If decisions are not taken on time, then for the organization this could turn into a crisis. </p><p>  Therefore, it is necessary to study management systems, which helps to carry out management with high quality <span>management decisions.</span>  The essence of such a study is to recognize problems and problem situations, and then determine their place in the general system of accumulated knowledge.  Then you need to identify the content, properties and patterns of behavior and their development. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After such an analysis, the study of control systems finds ways, possibilities and means in order to use already new knowledge about the <span>object of study</span> in the practice of resolving problems that arise.  Each study has a goal, <span>object and subject of research,</span> organization and methodology of its implementation, the results obtained, which should be able to implement them in practice. </p><p>  The study of control systems cannot be carried out separately from the <span>control object.</span>  Therefore, along with the management system itself, the managed system also acts as an object (corporation, association, firm, enterprise and others).  The fundamental element in the research process is a person, since it is his activity that determines the existence and further development of this system. </p><p>  The most comprehensive is the subject and parametric study of control systems, since it considers all possible objects and their interaction.  The subjects and parameters of control systems become for the researcher an aspect of the manifestation of the essence of this control system.  Usually these are the trends and problems that arise in the process of the enterprise. </p><p>  Problems are usually some real contradictions that need to be resolved.  These may be problems in the organization of management, mechanisms of motivation, professionalism of personnel, the use of computer technology and so on.  As a rule, as a result of the research, practical results arise.  These may be recommendations on the necessary change in some aspects of the functioning of the management system, on improving the quality and improving the practical activities of all personnel and the manager. </p><p>  Recommendations can be of economic, socio-psychological, organizational content.  They can relate to different areas: management motivation, information support, changing working conditions, quality of activity, competitiveness, main development trends and additional development factors. </p>
