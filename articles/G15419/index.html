Indeed, in large cities on the south coast in high season, prices are high, and sometimes there are too many vacationers.  It is difficult to believe that in such a popular holiday destination there are still sparsely populated and truly wild places.  Meanwhile, the village of Kuchugury of the Krasnodar Territory is one of them. </p><h2>  General information about the village </h2>
