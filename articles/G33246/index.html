Rather, it is unlikely to say where it is.  Some speculate that somewhere in the tropics.  And they will be right.  But this island is not just paradise.  Unlike Eden, from which man was once banished, Saint Kitts can be settled permanently.  For a certain bribe, of course.  In this article, we will tell you about the economic citizenship program operating in this country.  Yes, the small Saint Kitts with the even smaller islet Nevis is an independent state that is part of the British Commonwealth, led by the Queen of Great Britain.  It is easy to guess that the official language here is English, which simplifies the communication of tourists with the local population.  The currency is the East Caribbean dollar, consisting of one hundred cents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  The main island of St. Kitts and Nevis, a photo taken from the air, presents as two pearls in the vast expanse of the ocean.  Two pieces of sushi form a federation.  Moreover, Nevis has the right to freely exit from it.  Saint Kitts was called Saint Christopher until recently.  From this on the old maps one can also find another name for the state.  Saint Christopher and Nevis are the most dwarf states in the Western Hemisphere.  And the population in it is the smallest - fifty thousand people.  Below we will talk about the original way that the government of the confederation used to raise this figure.  Where is the state of Saint Kitts and Nevis located?  On a world map, you need to look for him in the Caribbean.  It is included in the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles (Windward) Islands.  All borders of this state are marine.  Saint Kitts and Nevis is adjacent to the same dwarf powers.  In the east, the islands border <span>Antigua and Barbuda,</span> in the north with the overseas territory of France, Saint Barthelemy, in the northwest with the special municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Sint Eustatius, and finally in the southeast with Montserrat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts and nevis islands" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344184.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The main island, St. Kitts, is located north of Nevis and is separated from it by the three-kilometer strait of The Narrows.  The state can be called mountainous.  St. Kitts stretches from south-east to north-west for thirty-seven kilometers.  Its entire area is divided by mountain ranges.  The highest point of the island (and the entire dwarf country) is the extinct volcano Ljamiuga (one thousand one hundred fifty-five meters above sea level).  In the southeastern extremity, the relief decreases and forms a flat plain occupied by salt lakes.  The coastline here is rough, teeming with bays and sandy beaches.  The neighboring island of Nevis has an almost round shape.  It is composed of rocks of ancient eruptions.  The highest point of this island is Nevis Volcano (almost a thousand meters above sea level).  The state is surrounded on all sides by coral reefs.  Therefore, tourists on the beaches can enjoy the tranquility of the turquoise lagoons. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  It is determined by the tropical latitudes in which the island of Saint Kitts is located.  The weather here is wonderful and practically does not change at any time of the year.  The islands can be safely called the dream of Eden.  The night temperature never drops below eighteen degrees, and on summer days it does not rise above thirty.  These are the most comfortable conditions for relaxation.  But do not forget about the second name, which bear the Lesser Antilles - Windward.  A dwarf state lies in the path of tropical hurricanes.  They do not happen every year and are most likely from August to October.  The rest of the time, warm trade winds blow over St. Kitts and Nevis.  The amount of precipitation does not depend on the season, but on altitude.  In the mountains of rains falls from 2000 to 3700 millimeters per year.  On the coastal plains, the amount of precipitation is half that.  As such, the "wet season" is absent here.  But most tourists prefer to come to rest on tropical islands in the winter - from November to April. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts island weather" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344189.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, his expedition, seeking India, did not colonize these islands.  England did it for them.  In 1623, she founded the first colonial settlement in the West Indies at St. Christopher.  The French also tried to "stake out" no man's land and founded their fort.  None of the Europeans asked the views of the local population: in 1626, the British and French troops staged a massacre together, destroying about four thousand Indians.  In this regard, the river, on the banks of which the massacre took place, is now called the Bloody.  In the north-west of St. Kitts, Fort Brimstone was preserved, from where the British seized land in the Caribbean.  This fortress is called Gibraltar of the tropical seas.  In 1783, France, according to the Treaty of Versailles, ceded all rights to the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis to Great Britain.  The state gained independence in September 1983.  But the Queen of Great Britain continues to be the nominal head of the country. </p><h2>  How to come to the dwarf state of the Caribbean </h2><p>  In the old directories, you can read that tourists from the CIS need a visa to be allowed on the island of St. Kitts.  This information is outdated.  In June, two thousand and thirteen, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a diplomatic achievement.  From now on, citizens of Russia can visit tropical islands without a visa.  However, the total travel time should not exceed three months.  However, you can extend the stay on the spot.  A Russian tourist needs to have a set of documents with him: a passport, the validity of which will not expire in the next six months, a <span>travel voucher, a</span> statement from your bank card account, which indicates your solvency, and return tickets.  The lion's share of tourists arrives and leaves the island by plane.  A certain amount must be paid in order to leave a hospitable dwarf state without problems.  When departing from the Golden Rock international hub, you will need to pay the airport tax (forty-one Caribbean dollars for each person over twelve years of age) and the environmental tax (4 EC $). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts island reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The island nation, located only two hundred and sixty square kilometers, contains everything that a tourist dreams of in the dreams of the tropics.  On the slopes of the mountains are plantations of cotton and sugar cane.  Even higher is the virgin jungle with vines, cinnamon and breadfruit, mango, tamarind, bananas, papaya, avocado.  In some places, the mountain peaks are covered with meadows.  The island of St. Kitts in the north is a hilly plain occupied by farmland.  On Nevis, especially in its western part, there are many coconut groves.  Monkeys live in the rain forests of the two islands, but there are no dangerous predators.  The screams of tropical birds announce the silence of the jungle, huge butterflies flutter everywhere.  The state-owned water area will certainly interest divers and fishing enthusiasts.  Although the coastal areas seem arid, overgrown with shrubs, there are many rivers and streams on the islands. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Saint Kitts is an island whose coast is covered with interesting black <span>volcanic sand</span> .  But on its southeastern outskirts there is a flat peninsula composed of oceanic sediments.  Therefore, the beaches here are golden.  The coast of the island of Nevis is the embodiment of dreams of relaxation by the tropical sea.  The resort areas of the dwarf state satisfy all requests.  St. Christopher (the island of St. Kitts) has a lot of entertainment - golf clubs, nightlife, casinos.  Especially famous for evening life is the capital of the state - the city of Baster.  On the island of Nevis, all conditions are created for a measured and relaxing holiday.  It is good to spend a romantic evening walking along the promenade, sunbathing in the shade of palm trees.  But if you wish, you can also find entertainment on Nevis.  Recreation facilities are concentrated in the main city and administrative center of the island - Charlestown.  The sea near the beaches is always calm and serene, because the coast is protected from storms by a wall of coral reefs.  Entering the water is gentle, which is safe for bathing children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts island" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  The backbone of the economy of the dwarf state has long been the export of sugarcane.  But in recent years, this industry has pushed tourism from the first place.  For foreign travelers, all conditions are created here.  Especially succeeded in appeasing vacationers to the island of St. Kitts.  Reviews of tourists claim that its entire coast is occupied by chic hotels and expensive magnificent villas.  Buying property in <span>an island nation is</span> easy.  There are no restrictions for foreigners, as in some countries.  The staff of the hotel complexes and restaurants are very kind and strive to fulfill any customer request.  According to reviews, they need to get used to their dialect of English.  Even the British do not always understand the locals.  St. Kitts chefs have fully mastered European cuisine, and Nevis culinary school gravitates to traditional local recipes.  The number of serious crimes on the islands is quite low.  But, tourists warn, pocket theft is common, so it‚Äôs better to keep valuables in a room safe. </p><h2>  Saint Kitts Island Tours </h2><p>  Of course, the sea and the beach are the main attractions of the dwarf state.  But there are others.  If you relax on the island of Nevis, do not be too lazy to climb the peak of the same name.  The height of this volcano is nine hundred eighty-five meters above sea level.  The reward for your work will be an incomparable view of the two islands.  And you can go down through the side vents of the Hurricane Hill or Saddle Hill volcanoes. Transport in the country is well developed.  There is even a narrow gauge.  Nevis also has an airport - Newcastle. </p><p>  For ecotourists, the island of Saint Kitts is of interest.  Its sights are not only natural.  Going on a trip to the Golden Rock Plantation Reserve and Brymstone Hill Fortress Park, you can see the old British fort.  There is a museum in its barracks, whose exposition tells the story of colonial history and the traditional way of life of the islanders.  On Nevis, you should visit the Historical Museum and the <span>Horatio Nelson</span> House <span>.</span>  Entertainment on the islands is unhurried yachting along the strait and lagoons, cycling, horseback riding.  The country has a casino, many golf clubs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint kitts island attractions" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344188.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  Events </h2><p>  The population of the dwarf state is the descendants of African slaves who inhabited the islands after the almost total extermination of the indigenous inhabitants - the Indians.  Therefore, the main religion is Christianity.  The colonial period made adjustments to the religion of local residents.  Most of them are Anglicans or Protestant Methodists.  But also a large number of Catholics.  Religion is associated with the main colorful events.  Saint Kitts island reviews recommend visiting during the Christmas season.  December 25th is celebrated very beautifully here.  And on the second of January the island hosts a colorful festival.  The beginning of Great Lent, Good Friday, the Resurrection of the Lord and Pentecost are also celebrated on a large scale.  Of secular holidays, the British Queen‚Äôs birthday, which falls on June 12, Liberation from Slavery (the first Monday of August) and Independence Day (September 19), should be mentioned. </p><h2>  St. Kitts Island: Citizenship </h2><p>  Many tourists, having arrived in this paradise country, simply fall in love with it.  But you can stay on the <span>paradise islands</span> forever, replenishing the fifty thousand inhabitants of the dwarf state.  When global demand for cane sugar fell, the government of Saint Kitts and Nevis launched a program with the eloquent title Citizenship through Investment.  Anyone who makes a voluntary contribution to the Sugar Fund of the country receives a passport of an island nation without any problems.  The amount of investment donations depends on the number of dependents in the applicant's family and ranges from two hundred and fifty to four hundred and fifty thousand US dollars.  A certain amount (but not more than ten percent of the main installment) will be required to pay various government fees and notarial deeds.  What gives citizenship of Saint Kitts and Nevis?  Firstly, this is visa-free entry to one hundred and twenty states.  Citizenship is inherited by children from parents.  You do not need to give up the citizenship of your country of birth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St kitts island excursions" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1344193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Citizenship through real estate </h2><p>  There is another way to obtain the coveted state passport.  The islands of St. Kitts and Nevis in the last decade have acquired elite housing.  On the banks and even on the shallow bottom of the lagoons, luxurious villas are being built on stilts that are just waiting for their buyers.  And you did not dream about your house by the sea?  And not some Barents or Laptevs, but the Caribbean?  If you purchase real estate worth no less than four hundred thousand US dollars, citizenship of Saint Kitts and Nevis will be a pleasant bonus for you.  This way, assure reviews, is more advantageous if you want to settle on the islands.  After five years, you can sell your property, but you will not lose citizenship.  But there is a great danger of losing money due to online fraud.  To prevent this, the government published on its website an official list of all dealers who have the right to make a purchase of real estate in St. Kitts and Nevis. </p>
