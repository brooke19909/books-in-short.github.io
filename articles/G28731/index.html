This is an amazing and hospitable country, which is one of the best resort and tourist centers in Europe.  The answer to the question ‚Äúwhat to see in Greece‚Äù has never been difficult.  There are so many attractions on the territory of the country that their inspection in full may take several years.  Monuments and interesting buildings are not only in large and famous cities, but also in small towns, as well as on countless islands.  Each corner of the country has its ancient monuments, eventful history, legend or myth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in greece" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/255258.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  The capital of Greek Macedonia is Soloniki.  It is the second largest city located on the northeastern shore of the Thesalon Bay of the Chalkidiki Peninsula.  Due to the fact that there are so many attractions in the country, it is important to know what to see in <span>Thessaloniki (Greece)</span> in the first place.  The main symbol of the city is the <span>White Tower</span> (Lefkos-Pyrgos), built by the Turks in the 16th century as a <span>defensive structure.</span>  It rises in the seaside park Zoo.  Its height reaches 27 meters.  Nearby, in a beautiful brick mansion, the Byzantine Museum houses a magnificent collection of frescoes, mosaics, prints and paintings, most of which date back to the early Christian period.  The Archaeological Museum, which holds unique items found during excavations of Sind's graves, is also considered no less interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in thessaloniki greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/255259.jpg" width="600"></div>

In Thessaloniki, the <span>triumphal arch of</span> Galeria, built in 297 BC, has been preserved.  The rotunda of Agios Eioros is also noteworthy.  The largest basilica of Greece is considered to be Agios Demitrios, whose construction dates back to the 6th century.  It is also located in Thessaloniki.  Here is one of the oldest structures of the city - the basilica of Akhiropiitos, whose building was built in the 5th century.  Continuing the sightseeing of this city, it should be noted the Latoma monastery with its tiny church, Osios David.  The construction of this complex dates back to the 5-6th century.  Its buildings are famous for their unique mosaics.  And the most amazing church in the city is Hagia Sophia.  It is one of the rarest examples of temple structures, which has no analogues in all of Europe. </p><p>  But the answer to the question "what to see in Greece" does not end there.  Continuing the inspection of Thessaloniki, one cannot fail to visit the original building, which is surrounded by a small cypress grove - the Panaya Chalkeon church, built in the 11th century.  A little to the west you can see the Dodeku Apostoli.  The building was built in the 7th century and is famous for its magnificent mosaics of the 17th century.  The most famous monument of the Ano-Poli district is Trigonion, or the Tower of Chains.  50 kilometers southeast of Thessaloniki is the Kokines Petres Cave, in which traces of the presence of prehistoric inhabitants of this territory were discovered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece island crete what to see" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/255260.jpg" width="400"></div>

What to see in Greece, once in Athens?  First of all, the majestic Acropolis with its unique temples and museums, where genuine masterpieces of <span>ancient Greek sculpture</span> are collected <span>.</span>  One cannot help but see the Parthenon temple, which is famous for its perfect and flawless contours.  It will be interesting to visit the graceful temple of the Ionian period - Erechtheion.  In addition, the city has many interesting museums.  The next city to visit may be Rhodes, where the Palace of the Knights is considered the most significant attraction.  In southern Greece, on the Peloponnese, it is recommended to visit the ancient Corinth, where the ruins of Sparta are located.  In the northwestern part of the peninsula is the famous Olympia, where the museum is currently located. </p><p>  There is another place that is recommended to visit without fail, getting acquainted with a country such as Greece - the island of Crete.  What to see here first?  5 kilometers south-east of Heraklion is the archaeological reserve of Knossos.  Here is a huge palace and a complex labyrinth.  It originally housed more than 1,500 rooms.  Only 800 have survived to our time. Tourists can visit the Grand Palace, the Minoan dwellings and the Upper Priest House.  60 kilometers from Heraklion are the ruins of the kingdom of Radamant.  For tourists, the palace, built in 1450 BC, is open.  It will be interesting to visit the gloomy and mysterious Dikteysky cave, which is associated with many legends. </p>
