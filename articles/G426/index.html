  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Israel, accessible to everyone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Israel is one of the most popular tourism destinations.  Here, in an amazing way, ancient history and world-class treatment centers are combined.  The healing <span>Dead Sea, the</span> mild climate, the attentive attitude to the guests of the country and the most interesting monuments of architecture make holidays in Israel unforgettable.  Pilgrims come here from all over the world to honor the memory of Jesus Christ, to kneel before the holy places, because this country is considered to be the cradle of life on earth.  The medical resorts located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea will help to cope with many diseases, defeat infertility, and restore the nervous system. </p><p>  Going there, you must definitely include in your route a visit to Jerusalem - the city where the 3 largest religions of the world were born.  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Israel without visiting the temples and tombs where the son of God rested.  During the Easter week, a huge number of believers come here to personally touch the blessed fire, to bow before the holy places.  In the world there is no such other country where the influence of religion on its history would be so strong.  The most popular places in Jerusalem are the <span>Wailing Wall</span> and Temple Mount.  It is from here that the pilgrims begin their Sorrowful path, which leads to the <span>Church of the Holy Sepulcher.</span>  Those people who prefer a beach holiday in Israel should pay attention to a huge number of hotels of different levels, located near the sea.  Today, spa tourism is very popular, capable of returning its fresh look to any person in a few days, relieving fatigue and helping to regain lost <span>peace of mind.</span>  Typically, such hotels are located on the shores of the Dead Sea, which can work wonders, literally bring people back to life.  Due to the hot climate, the unique composition <span>of the Dead Sea water, the</span> beneficial properties of therapeutic mud, the most effective procedures for weight correction, treatment of the skin, and the gastrointestinal tract are carried out here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rest in Israel among newlyweds is becoming increasingly popular.  Travel companies offer special tours for them, which include accommodation in a bridal room, an entertainment program, romantic walks on the sea, visiting the holy places that protect the marriage.  Most often, the newlyweds go to Tel Aviv by agencies, where the service sector is well developed and the accommodation becomes not only interesting, but also very comfortable. </p><p>  Almost everyone dreams of having a vacation abroad, but due to certain circumstances, not everyone can afford it.  In this case, last-minute trips to Israel come to the rescue, which are much cheaper than a long-planned tour.  Acquiring them is always a big risk because there is no way to get acquainted with all the conditions in detail, to foresee all the risks.  In fact, last-minute tours to Israel are a lottery for vacationers.  Going on such a vacation, the tourist does not fully know what awaits him in the host country.  In addition, scammers often offer such tours, who do not give a person time to think and send him completely to the hotel that was mentioned earlier.  So that such a vacation does not end badly, you need to choose a tour operator with a good reputation and extensive experience in this market, as well as carefully read all the clauses of the contract and discuss its details with a representative of the travel agency.  The best option would be to purchase extended insurance, which can cover all expenses in the event of an unforeseen situation.  Taking a little more attentive to the choice of tour operator and the tour itself, you can spend a wonderful vacation in one of the most beautiful countries in the world. </p>
