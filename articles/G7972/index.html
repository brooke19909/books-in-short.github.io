Now it‚Äôs not even clear how millions of subscribers around the world could use them.  Poor functionality, monochrome displays and an incomprehensible appearance.  But at the same time, such devices had a lot of advantages.  Among them - unsurpassed quality of communication and smart battery life.  In those years, Motorola devices were on the crest of a wave.  And now we will talk about a simple and strong phone "Motorola T190", which was very popular in due time.  And now there are those who decide that this gadget is better than many ‚Äúshovel-like‚Äù smartphones. </p>

    <h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  The Japanese company Motorola has been known since the beginning of the twentieth century.  Then she was engaged in the release of radio stations.  Then, the industry of all kinds of communications was mastered.  It was this office in tandem with Mitsubishi that launched the first mobile phone.  True, one cannot call it ‚Äúmobile‚Äù.  The device weighed a lot (due to a portable battery), and the coverage area was small.  Particularly well at that moment, companies were successful in <span>satellite phones.</span>  But they were also very bulky and not very reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the mid-nineties of the last century, Motorola was an influential player in the mobile device market.  While the ball was ruled by push-button ‚Äútubes‚Äù, the manufacturer‚Äôs business was going well.  But in the age of smartphones, the Japanese have lost ground.  They were able to release several decent and interesting devices, but that was all.  The company simply could not keep up with fashion trends and went into the red.  Bankruptcy soon came.  Relatively recently, the legendary brand was sold for a penny to the Chinese giant Lenovo.  By the way, many of the "heroes" of the 2000s suffered the same fate.  The legendary Finnish Nokia went the same way.  The more interesting it will be to consider legends from non-existent more companies.  One of them is Motorola T190. </p><h2>  What kind of phone is this? </h2><p>  The T190 was made on the basis of a more expensive product of the same company called T191.  They simplified it a bit, put the stuffing in a case of a little worse quality and put it up for sale already as a budget device.  In the early 2000s, this was a common practice with the giants of "mobile building".  So sinned and Nokia, and Siemens, and Samsung.  Why is Motorola worse?  But the phone was very successful.  The proof of this is its popularity.  Despite the rather miserable functionality and the absence of even the usual options for that time, the Motorola T190 phone could become popular.  Much was explained by its price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, not only the price was its advantage.  Even against the background of the ‚Äúflagships‚Äù of this year, this device could boast of unrivaled battery life.  Talk time lasted for five hours.  And in standby mode, he could calmly hold out for three days.  But that is not all.  Thanks to an external antenna, the signal reception quality was excellent.  That is what many liked.  Especially when you consider the realities of that time.  This refers to things that are happening in the offices of mobile operators.  It is not surprising that the Motorola T190 was the most adequate device at that time.  Year of release - 2002 - as it hints that the then monopolists of mobile technologies tended to take money for an empty place.  And only this phone had a price comparable to its capabilities. </p><h2>  Specifications "T190" </h2><p>  It will be difficult for a modern user to be surprised at the characteristics of the phone almost twenty years ago.  However, knowing this is helpful.  Motorola T190 supported GSM 900 and 1800 communication standards. No fancy 3G or LTE.  He had an external antenna for receiving a signal even at the edge of the coverage area.  The internal memory of the phone could accommodate only one hundred numbers in a notebook.  The number of SMS messages was also strictly limited.  The device had several pre-installed games (including the legendary "Snake") and was able to support screensavers (screen savers). </p>

    <p>  The phone had a number of polyphonic ringtones and the ability to vibrate.  Of the applications, there was only a calculator and a notebook.  There was not even a browser for the Internet.  Although, what is the Internet at that time?  There is nothing to say about such things as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and infrared.  The first two were under development, and the port was not assigned to a <span>budget phone</span> .  These are the main characteristics of the Motorola T190.  Photo and video cameras, too, were at that time the flagships.  And the technology of that time did not support high-quality pictures.  The monochrome screen with green backlight was very tiny in size.  This explains the battery life. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, there was no fashion for online stores then, but you can find reviews on the Web for this model.  Basically, this is the work of the "oldfags" who basically can‚Äôt tolerate new smartphones and madly love old technology.  Therefore, all reviews about "Motorola T190" are positive.  But the device really had almost no shortcomings, given the year of its release, its positioning and its cost.  For its money and status, it was an almost perfect phone. </p><p>  The owners noted the excellent quality of communication, the absence of unnecessary and unnecessary options, interesting appearance and good battery.  For those people who need the device just for calls, there is no better gadget than the Motorola T190.  The user manual, however, was deprived of the Russian language.  But the phone is so simple that it is not needed. </p><h2>  Who needs the T190 now? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the phone is outdated, it may be useful now.  Potential buyers of this gadget are older people.  They do not need new options.  They need a reliable ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  And Motorola T190 fits this role perfectly.  Also, it will appeal to those people whose work does not allow the use of new gadgets due to the increased danger to the latter.  It will not be good if the newest flagship for a bunch of dollars is killed in one working day.  But such a device is not a pity and break. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  A phone from the past can be useful now.  Devices such as the Motorola T190 can only be used for calls.  And in this case, not a single modern smartphone is hijacking them, because these devices provide unsurpassed quality of communication and do not require frequent charging.  Legends of the past can still serve the people. </p>
