The most profitable deposits for individuals in Sberbank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the article, we consider what interest on deposits in Sberbank is available. </p><p>  In times of economic instability, many people want to keep their money.  You can do this in various ways: to acquire values, hide money or invest them in an account with Sberbank.  This financial institution is the most popular among investors due to its stability.  In addition, the bank offers its customers a wide selection of deposits with various conditions, which allows you to choose the program that is most suitable for a particular person.  Making a contribution to one of the most reliable banks in the country, a person can not only preserve his savings, but also increase them by receiving interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposits in a savings bank" class="if uuid-2984708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2984708.jpg"></div><h2>  The most profitable deposits </h2><p>  It‚Äôs difficult to say exactly what percentage of the deposit in Sberbank is the most profitable, since each of the programs is designed for people of certain categories.  In addition, the investor must carefully study the conditions: the size of bets, the ability to withdraw funds or replenish the deposit.  Today there are several profitable programs with different conditions, among which each client will be able to choose the most profitable one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How many interest on deposits in Sberbank can be obtained is interesting to many. </p><h2>  Types of deposits </h2><p>  Clients, taking advantage of the corresponding offer, can realize the following goals: </p><ol><li>  If necessary, withdraw your savings. </li><li>  Keep savings in other currencies. </li><li>  Monthly replenish deposit. </li><li>  Monthly withdraw interest. </li><li>  Get a good profit due to new interest rates of the bank. </li></ol><p>  To make a deposit at Sberbank for individuals of any type, you will need to visit the nearest branch and provide an employee with a passport.  Then the specialist will draw up an agreement on the opening of the selected deposit.  It is always important to carefully read the document, in particular, those items that are indicated in small print.  After that, an account will be opened in the name of the depositor, where he can deposit the available amount of money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.empirenb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much interest on deposits in a savings bank" class="if uuid-2984703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2984703.jpg"></div><h2>  Contribution "Record" </h2><p>  Let's consider what maximum interest on a deposit in Sberbank can be obtained. </p><p>  This program assumes the ability to store money only in rubles.  To open such a deposit, the depositor will need to deposit at least 50 thousand rubles.  You can keep your funds in the account for this deposit from 7 months to a year and a half.  The bank offers its depositors up to 7.15% per annum.  If you take into account interest rates, then this type of deposit is one of the most attractive, so this is the program that offers the maximum interest.  Replenishment and withdrawal of funds is not provided.  Interest is accrued at the end of the deposit term. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Save Deposit </h2><p>  This contribution to Sberbank for individuals is a traditional product.  You can deposit funds on this deposit in rubles and other currencies, according to which the exchange rate is verified.  Replenishment or partial withdrawal of the terms of this program do not imply.  <span>You can open a deposit by</span> making at least 1000 rubles, 100 dollars.  If you invest in the bank from 400 thousand rubles, you can count on the interest rate of 5.15%, and capitalization provides an opportunity to increase the rate to 5.56%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vtb.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maximum interest on a deposit in a savings bank" class="if uuid-2984697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2984697.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit "Replenish" </h2><p>  It is a type of accumulative deposits, that is, a bank client can not only preserve existing savings, but, if desired, replenish them by making additional funds on deposit.  You can open an account for a period of 3-36 months.  In addition, you can deposit at least 1000 rubles into the account if the replenishment occurs in cash, but there are no restrictions for non-cash replenishment. </p><p>  Account capitalization allows you to count on 4.8%.  If such a condition is not interesting to the depositor, then he can monthly receive accrued interest on the account or card.  If the deposit is foreign exchange, then replenishment can be made in amounts from $ 100.  The interest on a foreign currency deposit in Sberbank of this type is 1.6%. </p><h2>  Contribution ‚ÄúManage‚Äù </h2><p>  If the depositor wants to periodically withdraw funds from the account or make additional payments, the offer of Sberbank ‚ÄúManage‚Äù will become the most suitable product.  However, it should be borne in mind that the minimum amount to be paid under this program is 30,000 rubles, and the maximum rate will be 4.44% subject to interest capitalization.  If you wish, you can make at least a thousand dollars, and the interest on a deposit in Sberbank in foreign currency will be 1.5%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinonegocio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interest on a deposit in a savings bank" class="if uuid-2984702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2984702.jpg"></div><h2>  "Savings account" </h2><p>  This program provides the ability to manage daily invested funds.  You can open such a deposit by making an unlimited minimum amount of money.  After that, the bank's client will be able to replenish the deposit and withdraw from it any amounts available on the account.  This type of deposit allows you to store not only rubles, but also euros, dollars.  Another advantage of the Savings Account is its unlimited duration.  Moreover, the client can expect to receive up to 0.01% when storing dollars or euros, up to 1.8% when storing rubles. </p><h2>  Give Life Contribution </h2><p>  Contribution to help children with cancer, hematological and other serious diseases. </p><ul><li>  Interest rate: 5.05% in rubles. </li><li>  Deposit term: 1 year. </li><li>  Not rechargeable. </li><li>  Without partial withdrawal. </li><li>  Minimum deposit amount: 10,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Every 3 months, Sberbank transfers to the Give Life charity fund an amount of 0.3% per annum of the deposit amount. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage of Sberbank is the possibility of online deposit opening (if the person is already a client of the organization).  Otherwise, the need to visit the bank remains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cbkg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online contribution" class="if uuid-2985798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2985798.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the increasing economic crises, many people prefer to keep their own savings in foreign currency.  It costs more and constantly rises in price, however, keeping foreign money at home is not a good idea; opening a deposit in a bank is the best solution, which will not only save money, but also increase it by earning interest.  However, it is important to remember that foreign currency deposits are characterized by certain features and some disadvantages.  Therefore, before opening and deciding in which currency, Russian or foreign, to invest money, it is worth carefully familiarizing yourself with all the conditions of the programs offered by the bank. </p><p>  We examined what interest on deposits in Sberbank is available. </p>
