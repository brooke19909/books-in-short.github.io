    <h2>  What documents are needed </h2><p>  To obtain a loan at any financial institution, the borrower must provide employees with a specific set of documents.  In general, it is standard, but sometimes the bank may request additional documents for a more thorough analysis of the solvency of the potential borrower. </p><p>  The standard package includes: </p><ul><li>  original passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  to request information about a client from the credit history bureau, the bank will need SNILS; </li><li>  less often, banks are asked to provide a certificate that will serve as proof of income (it can be compiled according to 2NDFL or the form of the bank). </li></ul><p>  Additional documents for obtaining a loan are: </p><ul><li>  TIN; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  certificate of ownership (real estate or vehicle); </li><li>  a copy of the work book certified by the seal of the employer; </li><li>  international passport. </li></ul><p>  If there is a last document, then it can be provided as an additional one, which will serve as confirmation of solvency.  However, it should be borne in mind that it should have marks on going abroad over the past six or twelve months. </p><p>  In the presence of these documents, it remains only to decide where to get a loan in Yekaterinburg. </p>

    <h2>  Types of lending </h2><p>  In order to finally decide where to get a loan in Yekaterinburg, you need to decide which type of loan you need to get. </p><p>  The most common and most sought after is consumer credit.  It includes cash loans, as well as the purchase of goods in retail chains in installments or at interest. </p><p>  No less popular are car loans and mortgages.  Most of these types of financing are secured by property.  They will be served by the living space acquired by the bank‚Äôs money or a vehicle.  All encumbrances will be removed only after the full repayment of the debt, and the property registered as a pledge will become the full property of the borrower. </p><p>  If a client needs to borrow a small amount of money, for example, intercept five or ten thousand before his salary, then he should contact microfinance organizations.  They specialize in issuing small sums of money to the population for a short period, from seven days to one month. </p><h2>  Overdue Loan </h2><p>  It‚Äôs a little harder to find a bank where to get a loan in Yekaterinburg with an overdue loan from another financial institution.  Of course, the decisive factor will be the delay in payment.  If it is no more than one month and has been once, then the banks will have few reasons for refusal. </p><p>  In cases where the borrower has several loans and he does not have the ability to make payments on time, then the best option would be to use the loan refinancing service. </p><p>  Good conditions and a favorable rate are offered to its customers by Rosbank and Alfa Bank.  Turning to them, the borrower can get a new loan to pay off the previous ones even if there are delays in payment obligations. </p><p>  Where to get a loan with an expired history in Yekaterinburg yet?  This can be done at the bank, on the card of which the borrower receives a salary.  In such cases, the lender is confident in the solvency of the client and checks the credit history in rare cases. </p>

    <h2>  Get a loan with bad CI </h2><p>  More difficulties will arise for those customers who need to get a loan with a damaged credit history.  It‚Äôs rare which bank does not check it.  Any credit institution does not want to lose their funds.  Issuing money to an unreliable borrower may not justify the risks, and therefore, the bank will not only not make a profit, but also lose its own funds. </p><p>  Even if the borrower finds a lender who will issue a loan, then the interest on it will be overstated. </p><p>  Most often, clients with spoiled CI turn to private investors or microfinance organizations. </p>
