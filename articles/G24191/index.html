Never use metal brushes and <span>abrasive powders.</span>  If the pollution is strong and does not lag behind the surface, you do not need to rub the bowl so as not to damage it.  It is better to pour a little warm water into the container and leave for a while.  If you have a dishwasher, then the bowl, wire rack and measuring cup can be washed in it. </p><p>  To clean the outer surface of the multicooker, you need to wait for it to cool completely, and also turn off the electric wire.  In no case do not use water to clean the device, because this can lead to serious malfunctions and breakdowns. </p>
