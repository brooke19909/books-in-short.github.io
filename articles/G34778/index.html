The operator declares that the main advantages of such a tariff plan are packages with free minutes and gigabytes.  Such favorable conditions naturally attract subscribers.  People are wondering how to switch to the Smart tariff on MTS.  However, you should not rush to give an answer.  The word "Smart" is not always understood as one tariff.  The mobile operator has a whole line of tariff plans. </p><h2>  Starting tariff "Smart Mini" </h2><p>  For newcomers, as well as for those people who are not too active in using mobile services, there is an inexpensive tariff from the Smart line.  Its name is Smart Mini.  The main parameters of this tariff plan: </p><ol><li>  A small packet of Internet traffic.  It makes you think about how to switch to the MTS Smart Mini tariff, as it allows you to communicate on social networks, send text messages through special applications, and check mail.  Sharing photos, listening to music and watching videos at this rate is not very convenient, because with this use of the Internet the traffic ends quickly. </li><li>  A small package of free minutes for making calls to all networks of the home region and MTS of Russia.  For calls to MTS numbers in the home region, unlimited is set. </li><li>  SMS package.  Its size allows you to send almost 5 messages each day. </li></ol><p>  This tariff plan is not available in all regions of our country.  For this reason, some subscribers may not seek an answer to the question of how to switch to the MTS Smart Mini tariff.  You can find out about the possibility of connecting in a specific region on the official website of the mobile operator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.insuranceproviders.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of tariffs &quot;Smart&quot;" class="if uuid-2633343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2633343.jpg"></div><h2>  Other tariffs of the Smart line </h2><p>  Each region has its own line of new Smart tariffs from MTS.  How to switch to any of them?  First you need to find out what tariffs from the line are available in the region.  For example, in Moscow, subscribers can connect Smart Mini, Smart, Our Smart, Smart Top.  Each subsequent tariff is distinguished by more significant packages of free minutes, SMS messages, Internet traffic.  In Moscow, the main parameters of these tariff plans are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Smart Mini - 350 minutes, 350 SMS, 2 GB. </li><li>  Smart - 550 minutes, 550 SMS, 5 GB. </li><li>  Our Smart - 1500 minutes, 1500 SMS, 25 GB. </li><li>  Smart Top - 3000 minutes, 3000 SMS, 20 GB. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, at each tariff, unlimited MTS numbers are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iloveqatar.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect Smart tariff from MTS" class="if uuid-2633345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2633345.jpg"></div><h2>  Archival tariffs from the Smart line </h2><p>  Sometimes subscribers ask a question how to switch to the MTS Smart Plus tariff.  Unfortunately, this is not possible now.  <span>The tariff plan has</span> been archived and is now unavailable for new connections and transitions.  Previously, it offered a small Internet package (5 GB in Moscow and the Moscow region), unlimited for MTS numbers, 1100 minutes for all networks and 1100 SMS messages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tariff archive of Moscow and the Moscow Region also contains Smart Zabugorishte.  Now it is also unavailable for connections.  When the tariff was valid, it attracted by favorable conditions of communication while in some foreign countries (Armenia, Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, etc.). </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-pomosh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archival tariffs from the Smart line" class="if uuid-2633358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2633358.jpg"></div><h2>  Switching to Smart tariffs using your personal account </h2><p>  For those who do not know how to switch to the Smart tariff on MTS, there is a very easy way.  You need to go to your personal account.  On his main page, the subscriber can see information about his number, balance, current tariff plan.  Below are 2 useful links - ‚ÄúChange tariff‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll tariffs‚Äù.  It is recommended to click on the first link when the choice is already made.  The second link can help compare current tariff plans and choose the most profitable and suitable one from them. </p><p>  The tariff change through your personal account is quick.  About a minute after completing all the necessary actions on the official website, the subscriber receives an SMS message about a change in the tariff plan.  Sometimes this procedure is delayed.  A similar situation occurs when technical work begins on the site or unexpected errors occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobsvjaz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS tariff connection in your account" class="if uuid-2633348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2633348.jpg"></div><h2>  Introducing a team to switch to Smart tariffs </h2><p>  Using a team is another answer to the question of how to switch to the Smart tariff on MTS.  The combination is always published on the official website of the operator.  It is important to know that each tariff from the Smart line has its own team.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  to activate the Smart tariff, dial * 111 * 1024 # and press the send call button; </li><li>  to connect Our Smart you need to send a similar combination from a mobile device - * 111 * 1025 #; </li><li>  the command to connect Smart Top is * 111 * 1026 #, etc. </li></ul><p>  On the tariff plans of the Smart line, you can still use one simple and convenient command - * 100 * 1 #.  This combination is provided to obtain information about the remnants of SMS message packets and minutes.  To find out about the amount of Internet traffic, it is recommended to go to your personal account on the official website of the mobile operator or in the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="careertrix.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A set of commands for connecting tariffs &quot;Smart&quot;" class="if uuid-2633353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2633353.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible to switch back from Smart tariffs? </h2><p>  Sometimes subscribers think about the reverse transition from the Smart line to their usual tariff plans that do not have a monthly fee.  Naturally, this can be done if the selected tariff plan is not among the archive ones.  The transition can be made through your personal account.  You can also use the commands: </p><ul><li>  Would you like to switch from ‚ÄúSmart Mini‚Äù tariff to ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù?  Then you need to enter the command * 111 * 8888 # and press the call button. </li><li>  The combination for the transition to the tariff plan "Per second" - * 111 * 881 #. </li><li>  The command to connect Red Energy is * 111 * 727 #. </li></ul><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that the question of how to switch to the tariffs of MTS Smart is extremely relevant for subscribers who actively use all communication services.  The tariff plans from this line allow you to freely communicate in a variety of ways (using SMS messages, and through calls, and via the Internet), without paying attention to your balance. </p>
