The power of the ruler in this era combined the features of the monarchy and the republic.  The head of state was called the princeps, i.e., the first among equals.  Thus, the democratic nature of his power was emphasized.  He was also considered a people's tribune, thus combining several functions and powers in his person. </p><h2>  Start of registration </h2><p>  Principle in Ancient Rome is a special form of government, the foundations of which were laid down by Julius Caesar.  However, the final creation of this state system dates back to the reign of his successor <span>Octavian Augustus.</span>  In the 1st century BC.  e.  republican institutions ceased to satisfy the needs of a greatly expanded power.  As long as there was a city-polis, the organs of democracy could effectively exercise control and management, however, when the empire began to form, these institutions could no longer cope with their tasks.  The principle in ancient Rome is a <span>transitional period</span> between the republic and the <span>autocratic monarchy.</span>  The fact is that Caesar did not dare to immediately liquidate the old republican institutions and created a replacement for him in the form of a management system that retained the features of the old administration, but at the same time helped to strengthen the power of the sole ruler. </p>

    <h2>  Republic features </h2><p>  Under the new system, the features of the old regime were preserved.  For example, public assemblies were still convened.  Under this concept in science denotes the gathering of all adult citizens to solve the most important political issues.  In the era of the old republic, several types of such assemblies gathered in the city: qualification, aristocratic and general, without any restrictions.  The principle in ancient Rome is the stage that this most important institution has preserved, but during this period they lost their significance.  Moreover, they observed corruption, bribery and even violence against council members. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Senate Status </h2><p>  This important governing body was also preserved, but from now on its powers were limited.  The function of its members was reduced only to approving laws that came from the head of state.  Thus, Ancient Rome began to look completely different.  The period of the principate almost completely changed its political appearance, despite the visible preservation of the old order.  Now the senate was just a collection of representatives of ancient patrician clans led by the emperor himself, who was called the first among them.  Under Diocletian, this governing body was turned into a city council, and under Constantine a second senate was created in the new capital, which was equal in rights with the old one.  Thus, one of the most important symbols of the old republic finally lost its leading importance. </p>

    <h2>  August Reforms </h2><p>  <span>The system of</span> principles in ancient Rome began to change at the turn of the 1st century BC.  e.  - 1st century AD  e.  It was with this ruler that the Senate turned from a legislative body into a legislative institution.  The fact is that the new emperor made every effort to demonstrate his commitment to the old regime in order to maintain his influence among the people and strengthen his status.  The right of <span>legislative initiative</span> rests with the magistrates.  The Senate retained judicial functions, although in fact all the main power in this area was retained by the emperor.  Thus, from ancient times, Ancient Rome turned from a republic into an empire.  The early empire (the principle was its first stage) still retained the appearance of the old democratic order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  New body </h2><p>  The ruler actually himself controlled all spheres of government, although in words he strongly emphasized the preservation of the significance of the senate.  However, the extent to which this governing body has lost its significance is evidenced by the fact that under Augustus a new deliberative body was formed - the Princeps Council.  His functions included the preparation of various projects, which were subsequently submitted to the Senate with a note on the approval of the plan by the emperor, which in fact meant the need for its approval.  This council was attended by elected senators, consuls and representatives of magistrates.  In the year 13 BC  e.  the structure of the body has undergone some changes in the direction of strengthening monarchical power, as some of its members received the status of life advisers to the ruler, and decisions received the force of law. </p><h2>  Senate Composition Changes </h2><p>  The political system of Ancient Rome during the period of principate underwent significant changes in the direction of increasing the powers of the emperor.  Augustus decided to reduce the number of senators, the number of which has increased greatly since the rule of his predecessors.  In the year 29  e.  he received the position of censor and removed about 200 people from this most important governing body.  This could not but undermine the position of the Senate, all the more weakened after its powers were cut.  The emperor after some time reduced the number of questors in order to prevent further replenishment of the senate. </p>

    <h2>  Other changes </h2><p>  In addition to these measures, August raised the property qualification to obtain the post of senator.  He also changed the quorum system.  From now on, a certain number of participants was established for each type of meeting, and high fines were introduced for the absence.  He also tried to improve attendance at Senate meetings, but he still could not achieve his goal.  But perhaps the most important change was that as a result of the abolition of the post of censors, the status of senators became lifelong.  This led to the fact that its composition ceased to change and be updated, which contributed to undermining its influence in Roman society and contributed to strengthening the power of the emperor.  The latter forbade them to leave the country, which also limited their activities.  So, under Augustus, the influence of the senate on foreign policy, governance and the financial sector weakened significantly. </p>

    <h2>  Strengthening Emperor Power </h2><p>  The era of principate in ancient Rome is characterized by a gradual strengthening of the positions of the supreme ruler.  He set up his own treasury and since then freely disposed of it without the participation of the Senate.  In addition, senators lost their former participation in the formation of the army.  For example, at the beginning of the 1st century AD  e.  in the provinces there was only one legion of the regular army, while Octavian could interfere in the appointment of commanders and their governors.  Principle and dominance in Ancient Rome are two stages in the history of the empire of a given state.  Both stages are characterized by a gradual strengthening of monarchical power.  The procedure for the election of magistrates has undergone a change.  At first, the ruler simply appointed his supporters to these posts, and he displaced persons disagreeable to him.  Then he began to nominate individuals, and the people approved of them.  It all ended in the fact that the emperor began to simply appoint magistrates, which undermined self-government.  However, plebiscites were retained - voting on bills. </p>

    <h2>  The Power of Augustus </h2><p>  At first, he sought to concentrate in his hands the most important posts and powers.  So, he has arrogated to himself the highest power in the provinces (the position of empires), as well as fairly broad powers in the capital (title of tribune).  Augustus was the first to join these two posts in his person, since the most powerful rulers before him used exclusively dictatorial powers.  The periods of principle and dominance in ancient Rome are two of the most important stages in the formation of an empire.  At first, the ruler became the sole ruler of the provinces.  He also held the country's most important consul post, being re-elected every year.  The Senate itself exempted the ruler from judicial control.  August used all the powers of the <span>people's tribune,</span> which gave him the right to introduce bills and veto early decisions.  Another important innovation that testifies to the strengthening of imperial power is the provision of the right to convicts to apply for pardon exclusively to the emperor, and not to popular assemblies, which was earlier. </p><h2>  The problem of succession </h2><p>  The negative side of the new status of the emperor was the question of the appointment of a successor.  Since the ruler was not the sole bearer of supreme power during the period of principle, he could not appoint a successor to himself.  This question with particular acuteness had already arisen under Octavian, who could not decide on a successor.  Initially, the main candidate was his nephew and son-in-law Marcellus.  However, he died, and after the death of Augustus, power passed to the stepson, the emperor Tiberius. </p>

    <h2>  Transition of principate to dominate </h2><p>  Gradually, the emperor‚Äôs power was strengthened so much that he completely lost the remaining powers of the Senate.  The principle was formed under Diocletian.  From now on, the emperor himself passed laws and appointed officials and other officials.  However, the survivals of the principal remained: the old institutions continued to function for some time.  First of all, this concerns the magistracy, which, however, from now on only turned into honorary titles and ceased to play a role in the political life of Roman society.  However, it should be noted here that, despite the establishment of the almost unlimited power of the emperor, the succession order was not approved until the end.  The problems of succession continued to persist.  So, the principle in the history of Ancient Rome is the most important stage in the transition from the old republic to the empire.  This transition was carried out relatively painlessly largely due to the skillful policies of Octavian, who throughout his reign managed to maintain republican traditions and at the same time strengthen his power. </p>
