  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microphone Amplifier in Modern Sound Recording</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many of us, when using a device such as a microphone at home or at work, never thought about the difficulties that manufacturers of this type of device faced with that amplify and transform your voice or <span>musical work.</span> </p><p>  It would seem nothing complicated.  For many of us, a microphone is just a small device that seems a lot smaller and easier to use than the same headphones or dynamic heads.  Starting from the first batches of microphones released from production lines (a <span>microphone amplifier</span> is a mandatory element <span>)</span> , no significant changes have occurred in their design.  Whether it is microphones for use, for example, in espionage, or for recording music, the principle of their operation remains the same: how to better convert <span>sound vibrations of</span> air into electrical vibrations that are understandable to most sound-reproducing systems. </p><p>  However, it is not so difficult to qualitatively convert sounds into electrical signals, it all depends on the elements of the microphone, such as a membrane, microphone amplifier, and the mechanoelectric part.  It turned out to be much more difficult to ensure high quality conversion of the received signal and, accordingly, to achieve its amplification, to make it understandable to the audience. </p><p>  The legendary rock group ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù, which focuses on the semantic load in its work, really faced such a problem as conveying the meaning of the work to the audience.  And when the audience heard the lyrics, he froze. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No matter what the microphone is made of, whether it is gold or platinum, from a technical point of view it is important which microphone amplifier converts the signal, through which filters the oscillations pass, etc.  Much depends on the acoustics of the hall, the skill of the operator of sound equipment and the art of the performer.  Agree, I would not want to encounter a previously widespread effect, when after a phrase uttered into the microphone, the result was a monophonic sound at the power limit of the equipment used, arising from the resonant effect when using the microphone. </p><p>  Today, most of the problems that existed at the dawn of the widespread use of microphones have been successfully solved by engineers.  Specialized amplifiers have appeared that allow you to increase the power of an <span>audio signal with</span> virtually no interference and give it to sound frequency amplifiers that work on sound-reproducing systems. </p><p>  Developments have appeared that are protected from most of the interference inherent in the original products.  <span>The industrial production of</span> such a component of the device as a microphone amplifier, at the moment can offer a wide range of various products, inaccessible to users, for example, 15-20 years ago. </p><p>  Despite the proposed variety of types of expensive studio amplifiers, the relevance of simple appliances has not become less.  Not every recording studio can afford to buy an expensive amplifier, in addition, in the conditions of a limited budget, a home studio also does not make sense the cost of an expensive device.  After all, a microphone amplifier is not difficult to assemble with your own hands.  There are videos on the Internet in which the process of self-production of this microphone element is described in detail. </p><p>  Microphones are used in various spheres of human life, from household to production.  In popular television series, we often observe how the hero calls the rescue services at the scene and, thus, saves the world from death.  I wonder how he would have done this without devices that use a microphone and microphone amplifier in their work? </p>
