For convenience, it is customary to use concepts such as megaworld, macrocosm and microworld. </p><p>  For a complete understanding of the meaning of these terms, it is necessary to translate the words into understandable vocabulary.  The prefix "mega" - comes from the Greek <span><span>ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ</span></span> , which means "large".  Macro - translated from Greek ŒºŒ¨Œ∫œÅŒøœÇ (macro) - "large", "long".  Micro - comes from the Greek ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ and means "small." </p><h2>  Different worlds of perception </h2><p>  Megaworld includes objects of cosmic dimensions.  For example: galaxy, solar system, nebula. </p><p>  The macrocosm is that space familiar to us, tangible and perceived in a natural way.  Where we can see, perceive ordinary physical objects: car, tree, stone.  It also has such familiar to us concepts as second, minute, day, year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what objects are characteristic for micro and macrocosm" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1527029.jpg" width="600"></div>  Interpreting in another way, we can say that the macrocosm is an ordinary world in which a person lives.

    <p>  There is a second definition.  The macrocosm is the world in which we lived before the advent of quantum physics.  With the advent of new knowledge and understanding of the structure of matter, a division into the macrocosm and the microworld occurred. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Quantum physics has</span> introduced man into new ideas about the world and its constituent parts.  She established a number of definitions, specifying which objects are characteristic of the micro- and macrocosm. </p><p>  The definition of microcosm objects includes everything that is at the atomic and subatomic levels.  In addition to its size, this zone of <span>objective reality is</span> characterized by completely different laws of physics and the philosophy of its understanding. </p><h2>  Corpuscle or wave? </h2><p>  This is an area where the laws standard for us are devoid of any application.  <span>Elementary particles</span> at these levels are purely in the form of a <span>wave process.</span>  Analyzing the claims of some scientists that the corpuscular (in translation means "particle") manifestation of elementary particles is inherent in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world, we can say that there can be no unambiguous vision on these issues. </p>

    <p>  To some extent, they are right from the perspective of the macrocosm.  In the presence of an observer, they behave like particles.  In the absence of their behavior becomes wave. </p><p>  In reality, the territory of the microworld region is represented by energy waves looped in rings and spirals.  As for our usual zone of perception, the objects of the macrocosm are presented in the form of a corpuscular (objects, objects) component and wave processes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Five different worlds </h2><p>  Today, there are five types of our world, including the previously mentioned three (commonly used). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the macrocosm is" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1527762.jpg" width="600"></div>  Let us consider in more depth all the components of our objective reality.

    <h2>  Hypermire </h2><p>  The hyper world is considered to be the first, but at the moment there is no concrete evidence of its existence.  Multiple Universes are hypothetically attributed to it. </p><h2>  Megamir </h2><p>  The following is considered the previously mentioned megaworld.  Megagalaxies, stars, planetary subsystems, planets, stellar system satellites, comets, meteorites, asteroids, diffuse matter of space and recently discovered "dark matter and its components" are reckoned to him. </p><p>  Linear space can be measured in astronomical units, <span>light years</span> and parsecs.  Time is in millions and billions of years.  The main force is the gravitational type of interaction. </p><h2>  Macrocosm </h2><p>  The third world is part of the real objectivity of the world in which man exists.  How you define the concept of the macrocosm and how it differs from other components of the universe is not complex.  There is no need to trouble one's own understanding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="macrocosm objects" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1527706.jpg" width="500"></div>  Take a look around, the macrocosm is all that you see, and everything that surrounds you.  In our part of objective reality there are both objects and entire systems.  They also include living, nonliving and artificial objects.

    <p>  Space is measured in micromillimeters, millimeters, centimeters, meters and kilometers.  As for time, it is measured in seconds, minutes, days, years and eras. </p><p>  There is mainly an electromagnetic field of interaction.  The quantum manifestation is photons.  There is also a gravitational type of interaction. </p><h2>  Microworld </h2><p>  The microworld is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmicroobjects and microstates.  It is part of reality, where objects are extremely small in size, of an experimental scale.  They are not available for observation with the ordinary human eye. </p><p>  Consider some examples of microobjects and microsystems.  These include: micromolecules, atoms that make up atoms (protons, electrons) and smaller elementary particles.  As well as quanta (carriers) of energies and the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù vacuum. </p><p>  Space is measured from 10 to the minus of the tenth power to 10 to the minus the eighteenth power of meters, and time - from ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù to 10 to the minus twenty-fourth power. </p><p>  The following forces prevail in the microworld: weak interatomic interaction, quantum fields - heavy intermediate bosons;  strong internuclear interaction, quantum type of fields - gluons and p-mesons;  electromagnetic type of interaction due to which atoms and molecules exist. </p><h2>  Hypomir </h2><p>  The last world is very specific.  There is today no more than theoretically. </p><p>  Hypoworld is a hypothetical world within the microworld.  It is even smaller in size.  It supposedly exists objects and systems. </p><p>  Examples of hypoobjects and hyposystems: a planckeon (everything smaller than Planck‚Äôs size is 10 to minus thirty fifth degree meters), a ‚Äúbubble singularity‚Äù, as well as a ‚Äúphysical‚Äù vacuum with supposed elements smaller than microparticles and the existence of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù hypoparticles is quite acceptable. </p><p>  Space and time are discrete, are within the limits of the presented model of the planckeon: </p><p>  - Linear parameters - 10-35 meters. <br>  - Plankton time - 10-43 seconds. <br>  - The density of hypomir is 1096 kg / m <sup>3</sup> . <br>  - Plankton energy - 1019 GeV. </p><p>  To the basic interactions in the microworld, perhaps in the future new forces of the hypomir will be added or they will be combined into one whole. </p><p>  In the process of understanding this world, scientists for complete understanding divided everything studied into areas, spheres, sections, groups, parts and much more.  This method allows you to clearly classify and understand the essence of the world. </p><p>  About six hundred years ago, any scientist was called a natural scientist.  At that time there was no division of science into any areas.  The naturalist studied physics, chemistry, biology and everything he came across. </p><p>  An attempt to understand and explore the world has led to a productive and effective separation.  But still do not forget that this approach was applied by man.  Nature and the world are integral and unchanging, regardless of our ideas about them. </p>
