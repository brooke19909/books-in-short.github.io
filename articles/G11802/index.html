Today this is perhaps the only state where the Russians are provided with the most comfortable, high-quality, affordable and, most importantly, safe rest.  Recently, it is our compatriots who have put safety at the forefront, trying to avoid crowded resorts. </p><p>  Nabeul <span>(Tunisia), reviews</span> of which are left by many tourists, can hardly be called a popular resort.  This is a very small town, the center of pottery, located just 16 km north of Hammamet.  Nevertheless, tourists come here every year who want to spend time away from the hustle and bustle. </p><p>  If you want to get acquainted with the culture and lifestyle of local residents, Nabeul (Tunisia) will be, perhaps, the ideal option for your vacation.  There are very few hotels here, tourists do not violate the usual rhythm of life of the local population, who continues to engage in agriculture and pottery.  This is attractive and a small town for travelers. </p>

    <h2>  Who will suit the resort </h2><p>  So, if you want to enjoy peace and quiet, the ideal option is Nabeul (Tunisia).  Reviews about the resort of real tourists only confirm that it is a quiet and peaceful place.  Some call it a Mediterranean tale.  Sights and entertainment are not so many that allows you to spend time in unity with nature.  Comfortable hotels offering budget holidays, chic beaches with a wide coastline, proximity to the cultural center of the country - all this makes Nabeul (Tunisia) an attractive place for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Nabeul is located between the two largest airports in the country: Tunisia and Andife.  There is another airport - in Monastir, but it is located at a considerable distance.  Whatever option you choose for yourself, a bus, train or minibus will help you arrive in Nabeul (Tunisia).  Traveler and tourist reviews recommend taking the number 102 shuttle bus serving the Tunis-Nabeul route.  The fact is that most tourists fly to this airport.  The bus runs with an interval of 30 minutes from 6:30 to 20:30 hours local time.  Travel time is 40-50 minutes, the fare is 5 <span>Tunisian dinars.</span> </p>

    <p>  If we talk about ordinary buses, you can get from the capital to Nabeul by bus number 140 or 104. In this case, the route passes through other cities of the country, due to which the travel time increases to 1.5 hours.  If you want to get acquainted with local trains, you can use them.  And, of course, a taxi is at your service. </p><h2>  Transport connection of the resort </h2><p>  If you are planning an independent trip, you probably want to know all about the intricacies of moving around the city and its environs.  It is convenient to get around the city by taxi.  Indeed, no matter how strange it may sound, a taxi is the safest and most efficient way to get from one point to another.  We advise you to be extremely careful and watch that the driver turns on the meter during the trip.  On average, the cost will be 3-5 dinars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is another subtlety that should be known to everyone who chose Nabeul (Tunisia) for their holidays.  Traveler reviews tell us that on Fridays, when active trade is developing in the city, taxi drivers ask for twice as much for each trip as on the other days.  A little trick: on Fridays, spend the first half of the day on the beach, but it is better to move around the city after lunch, at this time the excitement subsides, and everything returns to normal. </p><p>  Between Nabeul and Hammamet it is possible to travel by regular regular buses and fixed-route taxis.  You can always see the schedule at the bus station. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  <span>Tunisia, the city of</span> Nabeul in particular, has a Mediterranean climate.  That is, the winters are warm and the summers are quite hot.  Even in winter, the water temperature does not drop below 16 degrees, so you can absolutely safely choose this resort for your vacation.  The only thing is that in the winter there are quite severe cold winds here, so in the evening in the city, on the coast in particular, it is quite cool.  If your trip is planned for this time of the year, be sure to bring warm clothes with you. </p><p>  In summer, heat reigns, the average air temperature is 35 degrees, water - 27 degrees.  The sea breeze allows you to endure the sweltering heat, which is why the <span>climate of Tunisia is</span> often called comfortable and pleasant. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Nabeul are comfortable, they delight with a wide coastline, a gentle approach to the sea.  Almost all local hotels have their own beaches with sunbeds.  The cleanest sea, this continues throughout the year.  Local plants create a pleasant shadow from the sweltering summer heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The indisputable advantage of Nabeul is the presence of numerous wild beaches, allowing you to fully appreciate the unity with nature. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  As already noted, Nabeul can hardly be called the center of resort life in the country, so there are very few hotels here.  For the most part, these are modest, but rather comfortable hotels, located on the first and second coastlines, that is, almost on the coast.  All hotels, of which there are no more than 12 in the city, are arranged in a chaotic manner.  If you decide to take a walk from your hotel to the next one, your path will definitely go through urban residential areas, and it will be close.  Such is Nabeul.  Hotels are predominantly three-star; there are a couple of two- and four-star options.  You will definitely not find anything fashionable and luxurious here.  Let's talk about the most popular hotels in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Les Pyramides 3 * </h2><p>  So, <span>Les Pyramides 3 *</span> (Tunisia, Nabeul), reviews of which can be found in sufficient quantities on the Internet, is considered a popular accommodation option among tourists.  Consider all its positive and negative sides. </p><p>  To begin with, I would like to mention a few words about what service the Hotel Les Pyramides Nabeul (Tunisia) offers.  The reviews are rather controversial, but in general, most tourists say that the staff is quite polite and welcoming.  Upon arrival at the hotel, vacationers pretty quickly get the room keys, can relax and unwind from the road.  As for the rooms themselves, they are more than modest.  Beds, a cabinet with a mirror, a TV, a table, chairs on the balcony, a spacious bathroom - all that is necessary for the most comfortable stay.  Tourists will enjoy daily housekeeping and towel change.  The room offers views of the pool and the sea, you can enjoy it endlessly. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline, close to the sea.  There is clean white sand on the beach; entry into the water is comfortable.  The sea is clean, amazing turquoise hue.  The hotel provides sunbeds, and completely free of charge.  If you are not attracted to sea water, you can always take water treatments in the pool located on the hotel premises.  It is quite clean, large and spacious, the smell of bleach is almost inaudible.  Sun beds and umbrellas along it are free for all vacationers.  By the way, on the territory of the hotel there is a round-the-clock security service that prevents unauthorized persons from entering it. </p><p>  The hotel area is very small, but quite clean, well-groomed, many plants and flowers.  Tourists can choose for themselves several options for meals on the buffet system.  Breakfasts are rather scarce and monotonous, but lunch and dinner pleasantly surprise tourists.  In general, food is at the proper level; tourists will not have to visit local establishments to satisfy their hunger. </p><p>  The hotel’s animation is modest, sometimes competitions and tournaments are organized for vacationers.  In general, the hotel offers the most relaxed, quiet and relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Royal Lido Resort &amp; SPA 4 * </h2><p>  If you are interested in the most comfortable stay, your choice should fall in Tunisia (Nabeul).  "Royal Lido Resort", reviews of which are very positive - a hotel located on the first coastline.  All guests can enjoy the sound of waves and beautiful views.  The hotel is ideal for families with small children.  Guests of the resort are offered accommodation in one of the 309 rooms of the five-story building, as well as in comfortable bungalows located on the Mediterranean coast. </p><p>  The hotel attracts tourists with its rich animation program.  Given that there is not so much, or rather quite a bit of entertainment, in the city, the Lido Hotel (Nabeul, Tunisia) becomes the best option.  Reviews of him confirm that on its territory all vacationers will be able to take an active part in sports, animation programs, visit show discos, dances and many other entertainments organized at the hotel. </p>

    <p>  Tourists celebrate a magnificent beach with a gentle entry into the sea, which is ideal for families with children.  Here you can feel the unity with nature, there is an opportunity to escape from the city bustle, noise, enjoy the peace and tranquility.  Fresh water lovers will like the fancy-shaped pool located on site. </p><p>  The guests will appreciate the service, the attention of the staff to each tourist.  On the Internet, you can find reviews that tell about endless lines in the restaurant and rather meager food.  Admittedly, queues are formed only in the first minutes of the opening of restaurants.  We advise you to have breakfast, lunch and dinner 30-40 minutes before the restaurant closes, when all the hungry tourists have time to disperse.  You can not worry: the hotel staff always replenishes the food, so you definitely won’t stay hungry. </p><p>  The only drawback, perhaps, is the insufficient quality and timely cleaning of the rooms.  This is written by almost all tourists vacationing in this hotel. </p><h2>  Kheops 3 * </h2><p>  If you are looking for the most affordable accommodation option on the Mediterranean coast, pay attention to the hotel located in Tunis (Nabeul) - Cheops.  Reviews of real tourists about him fully justify the affordable cost of living, it is located on the first coastline. </p>

    <p>  Tourists are invited to stay in one of the 327 rooms.  In each of them, in addition to a full bed, a cupboard and a wardrobe for storing things, there is air conditioning, a TV, a minibar, a hairdryer, and a spacious bathroom.  For an additional fee, upon request, a safe is available at the reception, as well as wireless Internet.  Power is supplied by the All Inclusive system.  The territory is quite spacious, it has three pools with slides and one with heated water.  That is why the hotel is ideal for relaxing not only in summer but also in winter. </p><p>  What do those tourists who have already had time to relax in the state of Tunisia (2016) say?  Nabeul, reviews of which is often only positive, attracts its guests with hotels.  Cheops is located 100 meters from the sea.  Where there is a clean, well-kept beach with a wide coastline and deck chairs are more than enough.  The pools are huge, interesting, but the smell of bleach is noted by all tourists.  Good animation in the evening, as well as entertainment for children. </p><p>  The food is standard for Tunisia, quite diverse and of high quality.  Speaking about the shortcomings, I want to focus on cleaning the rooms themselves.  The furniture is old, the rooms are in need of repair.  I would like regular cleaning and more frequent change of towels and bed linen.  In general, this hotel makes budget and comfortable at the same time a <span>vacation in Tunisia</span> (Nabeul).  Reviews of tourists about this option are not the most positive. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Red peppers, tomatoes, local spices and citrus fruits are the pride of the local land.  Local housewives will be able to please all the guests of the city with dishes that you will not find in any other city in the country.  We strongly recommend at least once visiting a local restaurant or cafe and tasting a national dish - shorba soup with fennel or rice with gravy from orange tree flowers.  The dishes are very specific, but they become a reflection of life in this city. </p><h2>  The shops </h2><p>  It has already been noted that Nabeul is the center of the country's pottery.  That is why one should not be surprised at the huge jug decorating the square of the railway station.  Ceramic products are the pride of the city and its value.  That is why every tourist is simply obliged to purchase for himself something from ceramics in one of the local shops.  If you are not limited in time, we recommend that you visit one of the workshops and order a souvenir made according to your own sketches and decorated with the author's inscription. </p>

    <p>  The Archaeological Museum of Nabeul is a favorite attraction for many tourists.  It is quite small, but quite interesting.  Among the most valuable exhibits can be identified Punic jewelry, antiquities and even objects of the burial of Carthage. </p><p>  All tourists love to be photographed with huge jugs that embody the specifics of life in Nabeul.  One of them is located in the square in front of the railway station. </p><p>  And here is another attraction of the city - a private museum Dar Zaman.  The former provincial house was reserved for him.  Here everyone will be able to get acquainted with the life of the inhabitants of the 19th century, to appreciate wedding dresses, household items and furniture. </p><p>  We advise you to visit the chic orange groves located in the vicinity of the city, as well as vineyards.  The top of Cape Bon is decorated with a small fishing village called Al-Hawaria.  It has been preserved almost in its original form, therefore it is of particular interest to foreign tourists.  The fine sand here gives way to the magnificent grottoes, which have become a haven for numerous crustaceans. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Nabeul (Tunisia) is a small town located on the Mediterranean coast.  A small number of hotels, a minimum of entertainment do not make it unsuitable for a good rest.  Every year, tourists tired of the hustle and bustle and the frantic rhythm of the metropolis come to Nabeul.  The hotels here are not fashionable, but quite comfortable.  Each vacationer will have a unique chance to be alone with himself, enjoy the local beauties and views.  Be sure to get acquainted with the local cuisine, even if you are not a gourmet, as well as the lifestyle of the local population.  This will allow you not only to relax at sea, but also to replenish your tourist luggage of knowledge and get to know the country better. </p>
