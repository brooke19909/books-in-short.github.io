    <h2>  Heviz Lake </h2><p>  This warm mineral reservoir itself is located not far from another, no less famous Hungarian resort.  This is <span>Lake Balaton.</span>  Heviz <span>(Hungary), the hotels of</span> which we describe here, is a town specially built for vacationers.  About two hundred kilometers separate it from the capital.  A hot underground spring not only makes it possible to swim in the lake at any season and time of the year.  It is also therapeutic, because it has a small radioactivity and contains useful minerals and substances.  The source is so strong that the water in the lake does not stagnate at all and is completely renewed almost every day.  Around the reservoir, nature has created a special microclimate that only enhances the healing properties and the effect of treatment.  Therefore, Heviz hotels are mainly located in the immediate vicinity of the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heviz Hungary treatment hotels prices" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1481822.jpg" width="450"></div>

There is an opportunity to fly to the international airport of Balaton or Vienna and from there get to the lake by bus.  It is not very convenient to go to Heviz by rail, because the nearest station is in the city of Keszthely, and this is another fifteen kilometers to the desired location.  But the bus service between the station and the lake is simply impeccable.  In just half an hour you will get to the right place, and you will be met by the hospitable hotels of Heviz.  There are about three hundred and twenty of them on the lake.  These are different complexes - from chic palaces to unpretentious apartments.  But mostly these are four- and three-star class hotels.  True, there is one ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  We will understand this in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heviz Hungary Hotels" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1481843.jpg" width="500"></div>
