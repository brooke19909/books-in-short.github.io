    <p>  But luxury real estate is a broad category compared to club houses.  Therefore, the second category of housing has its own distinctive features, which will be described later. </p><h2>  A few floors and apartments </h2><p>  This is an important condition.  <span>A high-rise building</span> of 20 floors, no matter how elite it may be, cannot be a club house.  Even if it is expensive, prestigious with an upscale finish. </p>

    <p>  How to visually understand what a club house is?  This building has no more than 5-6 floors, and usually 3-4.  At the same time, each has 2-3 apartments.  The best option is the only apartments on the floor that occupy the entire floor.  Such housing provides maximum privacy in a big city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prestige of the area </h2><p>  What is a club house, according to developers?  They refer to such real estate small country mansions in which there are several apartments.  But housing should be located in an area with an impeccable reputation, excellent infrastructure and expensive land. </p><p>  The best place is considered the historical part of a large city, but real estate can be located in the forested part, near a reservoir or sea, far from shops. </p><h2>  Project exclusivity </h2><p>  The construction of the club house is unique, it is carried out according to an individual project.  At the same time, it takes into account not only the wishes of the builder, but also the features of the terrain, landscape and other nuances.  The property should be combined with the local landscape, and also look much better than other buildings. </p>

    <p>  The exclusivity of the project suggests that each apartment has its own layout, not like the others.  The buyer should receive several options, and the design does not have to be free.  Important thoughtful and convenient location of the rooms.  If the property is bought during construction, the future owner can decide for himself how many rooms will be, as well as determine their location.  It turns out that the project will be created based on his desires. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Quality building and finishing materials </h2><p>  This characteristic is related to elite housing, as well as the requirement for residential and commercial properties.  In the construction of club houses, natural, expensive materials are used, since buyers pay much attention to this nuance. </p><p>  If the finishing will be done by the owners themselves on the basis of their taste and imagination, the development <span>of the common areas,</span> exterior, landscape is done by the builder.  Moreover, everything should correspond to a high status. </p><h2>  Lack of commercial buildings </h2><p>  In many new buildings, the ground floors are occupied by shops, cafes, and beauty salons.  In a club house this cannot be, only apartments are located there.  The maintenance of the living space in such a building will be disadvantageous due to the small number of residents.  And the owners themselves are unlikely to be happy with the constant arrival of customers. </p>

    <p>  But nearby shopping facilities may be.  As real estate agents in the real estate sector testify, many buyers in such properties may have personal fitness trainers, as well as stylists. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Such a property should be as comfortable as possible.  Therefore, the infrastructure of the club house should be developed.  If in a standard new building the underground parking contains little space for cars, then for an elite object there are 2-3 places for a car.  Wealthy people live there, so having multiple vehicles is the norm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Concierge service must work in such real estate.  Adequate young people responsible for their post can work there.  There is also video surveillance around the perimeter and on each floor, parking security.  The infrastructure includes a sauna, although a separate apartment may have its own bathhouse, a swimming pool in the courtyard. </p><p>  Be sure to have recreation areas near the house, for example, a picnic area, a gazebo, a playground.  There may be a fireplace room, billiard room and smoking room.  Usually, residents choose what they would like to see in the house, for example, a yoga room or a movie theater. </p><p>  Whatever the layout of the clubhouse, communications are required, including cable TV, high-speed Internet, air conditioning, heating, and wells.  Although there are usually few floors, there must be noiseless elevators, and sometimes each apartment has its own elevator that leads from the underground parking. </p><h2>  Interests </h2><p>  To acquire an apartment is not enough to have many millions of dollars.  A feature of the club house is the selection of residents.  But this rule is not always respected by the developer.  To purchase real estate, you need to fill out a questionnaire, which indicates the place of work, business, as well as interests, hobbies, hobbies.  The questionnaire is checked by the owner of the building, with a criminal record and other negative facts in the biography, the buyer may be refused to purchase a home. </p>

    <p>  In some situations, apartments are purchased by relatives, business partners.  Often, an interview is required, in which not only developers, but also neighbors take part.  Sometimes, if apartment owners move and place their housing on the secondary market, new owners need the recommendation of one neighbor. </p><p>  This house is inhabited by people of approximately the same social class and income level, which makes this property attractive for people with high incomes.  This nuance is the main difference from luxury housing.  But often, developers neglect to fill out a questionnaire and interview.  Then the club house loses its status, it becomes simply elite. </p><h2>  suggestions </h2><p>  The first clubhouse was erected in Moscow, on the territory of the Golden Mile.  <span>Since 2000</span> , with the reconstruction of the site near Ostozhenka and Prechistenskaya embankment, such real estate was in demand.  Housing fits perfectly into the historical part of the capital, moreover, it meets the requirements of elite housing. </p><p>  Until 2008, such real estate was rarely seen on the open market.  Club house developers sold it through special agencies.  An example would be the Moscow house of Monolith Plaza, for which only members of the Monolith club had the right to acquire premises. </p><p>  With the crisis, demand for real estate decreased, but interest in it was high.  Therefore, the construction of buildings in the historical parts of the city has been preserved.  The most popular offers include houses on Plyushchikha, in Khamovniki.  Housing created on individual projects using Italian marble and precious wood.  Deals in Agalarov House and the Embassy House are in demand. </p><p>  In the capital, club-type houses are often found, which are not in new buildings, but in historical buildings.  These include the building on Varsonofevsky Lane, 4. This territory is closed, guarded, quiet.  The cost of an apartment in 5 rooms is more than 3 million dollars. </p><p>  A lot of real estate is located in the Central District, but there are other offers, for example, a three-story residential complex in Meshchersky.  In the Northern capital there are 10 such buildings.  The first clubhouse in this city is The Fifth Element. </p><p>  In St. Petersburg there is Stella Maris - 15 apartments located on the banks of Malaya Nevka.  The building has a marina.  Such real estate is on Krestovsky Island.  The price of housing in the Northern capital is slightly lower compared to Moscow projects, but it still reaches 1 750 000 rubles.  (30 thousand dollars) per 1 square.  m </p><p>  Many such houses are being built in Sochi.  In price and quantity, the city catches up with the capital.  But Sochi housing is a democratic option in the real estate market.  The selection of tenants does not take place there; everyone can purchase it.  The resort area is famous for "Ideal House".  But there are many apartments in the building - the number of storeys in it is variable (16-22), so the project does not fit the club house. </p><h2>  In Lyubertsy </h2><p>  The First Club House in Lyubertsy is a comfort class new building, which borders high-rise and low-rise buildings in one part and Oktyabrsky Prospekt in another.  The house includes 9 multi-level monolithic sections. </p>
