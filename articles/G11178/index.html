  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio setup: instructions and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before learning how to set up the radio, I would like to note the fact that all the actions that will be described in the article are designed only for users who first picked up this sound device.  The manual is very simple, and there is nothing supernatural in it.  An important condition for a well reproduced sound is the proper setting of the components.  It is important to understand the installation of equipment and the competent operation of the sound system. </p><p>  To make it easier to navigate in difficult terms, in the article we will configure the Pioneer radio, which is one of the simplest audio systems.  The model has the long name Pioneer DEH-1900UB and was released recently - in 2017.  Do not be scared if the name does not match the above.  There should not be any questions on setting up the Pioneer radio, because all models are similar to each other and have an identical menu.  The problem can only occur with processors that differ from their predecessors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thewirecutter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radio Setup" class="if uuid-2946282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946282.jpg"></div><h2>  Equalizer </h2><p>  The first thing I would like to consider is the equalizer.  It allows you to make the sound of music more even, increase and lower bass frequencies and helps to adjust medium or high radio waves.  But when tuning the sound on the radio, an important condition is that at first it is not the entire range that is regulated, but only some frequency bands.  Radio receivers differ from each other in these characteristics and can be of five types: at 80, 250, 800, 2500, 8000 Hz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equalizer setting </h2><p>  To adjust the equalizer, you need to go to the main menu and in the "Audio" section find the EQ item.  In it, by the way, you can choose the standard setting, if there is no desire to understand further.  For those who are determined to go all the way, there is a whole set of user modes inside this item.  You can switch from one to another both through the menu and through the joystick, which is installed next to the EQ. </p><p>  First of all, you need to configure the frequency parameters by first selecting this item in the menu.  Then, with a simple turn of the joystick, select your favorite equalizer frequency.  Then press the joystick again and adjust it to a position that is more suitable for the soul.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãwill range from -6, which means weakening, and to +6, which means amplification.  If you strictly follow the above points, you can make one of the frequencies louder and the other quieter. </p><p>  There are also radio receivers with a navigator and a touch screen, which will not only qualitatively adjust all the functions of the equalizer, but also provide additional comfort when following. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuning pioneer" class="if uuid-2946338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946338.jpg"></div><h2>  Musical preferences </h2><p>  There is no specific taste for equalizer settings.  Each person chooses certain modes by ear, depending on what kind of music or genres he likes.  But if there are doubts, then I would like to give some tips for tuning to a specific musical style: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  For heavy music, it is recommended to boost the bass frequencies to 80 Hz.  Do not overdo it, it is better to leave in the range from +1 to +3.  Rhythmic or percussion instruments should sound at approximately 250 Hz. </li><li>  For lovers of opera, the joystick on the radio should turn up to 250-800 Hz.  It is also worth noting that it is recommended that male voices be put lower and female voices higher. </li><li>  For lovers of electronic music, a frequency of 2500-5000 Hz is suitable. </li></ul><p>  At the end of the section, I would like to note that setting the equalizer is an important procedure, and with this tool you can fine-tune the sound, even with weak acoustic equipment in the car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tested.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radio tuning" class="if uuid-2946349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946349.jpg"></div><h2>  Frequency filter </h2><p>  Setting filters is just as important as adjusting the equalizer.  If we consider the high-pass filter, then, with proper tuning, it will be able to cut off the interfering sound frequencies that are supplied to the sound source.  The filters are configured because most machines have a small aperture on the sound amplifier, which makes the sound very poor even if you do not turn it on at full volume. </p><p>  To configure <span>a high-pass filter,</span> just go to the High-passFilter item and set the frequency to 50 or 63 Hz.  After setting it is recommended to go to the initial menu and check the result.  Checking is best done at a volume of 30. If the quality of the music being published does not suit you, then you can increase the border to 80-120 Hz.  But these settings are best done gradually, otherwise the sound will become even worse than it was.  Pioneer radios also have a frequency attenuation adjustment mode.  It has only two positions - 12 and 24 dB.  It is best to make a choice on the latter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radio pioneer" class="if uuid-2946331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946331.jpg"></div><h2>  Low pass filter </h2><p>  After setting up the internal speakers, you can start setting up the subwoofer, with which the radio works well.  For installation, you will already need a low-pass filter, which will help to dock the buffer and speakers. </p><p>  The operation of setting up the radio for the subwoofer requires attention.  After the bass has been removed from the <span>speaker system</span> , you can hear loud and high-quality sound.  Then, as mentioned earlier, you need to connect our subwoofer to the speakers.  To do this, go to the menu and select the section in which the buffer is configured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subwoofer in the car" class="if uuid-2946288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946288.jpg"></div><p>  The menu itself has three items: </p><ul><li>  Cutoff frequency.  If you look, then there is nothing complicated.  There is no definite value, but it is still recommended to set it in the range from 63 to 100 Hz. </li><li>  Volume.  There are no unnecessary explanations here, and the person himself has the right to choose which power suits him. </li><li>  The steepness of the attenuation of frequencies.  There is a slight resemblance to the equalizer, because they both have two modes - 12 or 24. As in the previous case, it is recommended to set to 24. </li></ul><h2>  Radio tuning </h2><p>  Whoever says anything, but the music downloaded to the USB flash drive may soon get bored and no longer cause the emotions that were at the very beginning of using the radio.  Many drivers still prefer to listen to radio broadcasts while on a trip.  If you take the Pioneer radio, then setting up the radio there is as easy as shelling pears.  You just need to select the desired band and specific stations. </p><p>  There are three ways to tune the radio: </p><ul><li>  Auto tuning.  To perform this simple operation, just find the BSM item in the menu and select automatic search.  After a few minutes, the radio will find the highest quality stations and offer to select them from the listed list.  If the list does not suit you, then you can lower the requirements, and then the radio tape recorder will reduce the frequency and choose lower-quality broadcast channels. </li><li>  Semi-automatic tuning.  While in the radio tuning mode, you need to hold down the "Right" button and wait a few seconds.  Then, a scan will occur on the screen of the radio, and the system will perform almost the same actions as with an automatic one.  The only difference will be that there is no need to adjust the frequency. </li><li>  Manual setting.  In this mode, it‚Äôs worth clicking the familiar ‚ÄúRight‚Äù button several times and switching to a specific frequency.  After that, all found stations will be stored in memory. </li></ul><p>  In total, about 18 radio stations that can be switched at the touch of a button can be stored on the radio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="michaelmowsblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radio Setup" class="if uuid-2946299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946299.jpg"></div><h2>  Demo Mode </h2><p>  After purchasing the long-awaited device, the user needs to learn how to reset the settings on the radio from the demo mode.  In general, it is intended for a preliminary demonstration of the operation of the device in the store, but this mode is in no way suitable for stable operation.  It, of course, can be used, but the constantly dimming screen and running information are unlikely to be a pleasure. </p><p>  The mode is disabled by the following technology: </p><ul><li>  You need to go into the hidden menu and turn off the radio, while simultaneously pressing a special button called SRC. </li><li>  move the joystick to the DEMO item and set the arrow to off mode. </li></ul><h2>  Date and time setting </h2><p>  Also in the settings menu, you can set the date and time.  There is a special function "Clock Settings", where you can use the wheel of the joystick to select a convenient display format and adjust the date and year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer setting" class="if uuid-2946354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107601/2946354.jpg"></div><p>  Drawing a conclusion on the article, we can say that you can do the tuning of the radio yourself, without resorting to the help of specialists.  Properly performed actions will give high-quality sound and excellent sound effect even on the cheapest equipment. </p>
