    <p>  The key to a good rest is the right choice of housing.  One of the most popular hotels for tourists is Himeros Club Hotel (Grand Beauty <span>Hotel) 4 *,</span> located on the outskirts of the southern part of the city.  A good combination of proximity to the sea, beach and historical places. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The resort complex is located in a remote location, 1 km from the beach and the sea, but this is not a problem, since a shuttle regularly goes there, and for some vacationers this distance seems quite accessible for a leisurely walk.  Antalya Airport is 50 km away.  All residents, however, will appreciate the proximity of the historical and architectural monument - the ancient Lycian city (Phaselis), the distance to it is only 13 km. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For guests on site, a spa is open, which offers its visitors relaxing and therapeutic procedures, including mud therapy.  Experienced staff will select a program that is suitable for all indications and organizes your leisure. </p><h2>  Who is the hotel targeted at? </h2><p>  Perhaps every traveler asks this question.  Before you go on vacation, without exception, everyone is eager to learn more about the place, traditions, chosen housing.  And this is absolutely correct.  The hotel must be chosen in accordance with personal needs (for two, family with children, for a relaxing holiday, and so on).  Only in this case can we count on comfortable conditions for everyone.  Hotel Himeros Club Hotel 4 *, having a fairly good infrastructure, is still focused on adults, business trips and only then on family vacations.  Certain conditions have been created for children: a branch in the pool, a playground for games, a mini club (for a fee), where for several hours they can do something interesting in the company of peers, as well as standard animation.  If necessary, babysitting is possible, but not for free. </p><h2>  Himeros Club Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  The most valuable thing in a vacation is impressions that remain for a long time.  Feel free to share them, including opinions about hotels and services, because they help future tourists and save them from unforeseen situations.  So in this case, the impressions were not up to par.  Most of the guests note that the declared four-star level has nothing to do with Himeros Club Hotel 4 *.  Comments relate to the level of service; staff are often rude.  In addition, the hotel rooms do not look the best, plumbing in poor condition. </p>

    <p>  The largest number of complaints was earned by the All Inclusive system, which is actively used in the hotel.  Tourists note that the choice of food was limited without any gastronomic delights, and sometimes just tasteless.  The poor quality of juices, presumably not fresh, but diluted from packets, as well as alcohol, was also noted. </p><p>  The main advice given by former guests of Himeros Club Hotel 4 * is to spend more time on the sea, beach, excursions, walks.  Well, you can get acquainted with Turkish cuisine and its main features in numerous restaurants and cafes nearby. </p><p>  According to the Russians, one should not expect too much from the hotel, it fully justifies the low prices and last minute tours.  Therefore, it will not be superfluous to think about how much you plan to spend time in it, if this is the minimum part of the day and night, then the option is quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Tourists recommend </h2><p>  A country with strong eastern roots and, nevertheless, European open and relaxed - this is Turkey.  Himeros Club Hotel 4 * has a good location, despite the somewhat remoteness of the beach (about 20 minutes walk by foot), you can easily get to many places of interest from the point of view of culture and history (as well as entertainment). </p>

    <p>  We will draw the attention of readers to two amusement parks.  To get to them from Himeros Club Hotel (ex. Grand Beauty) 4 * you can use public transport or a special transfer. </p><p>  Firstly, Moonlight Park, which has a large territory with a city beach and magnificent views of the blue sea and snow-white yachts.  It offers entertainment for children and adults: water slides, dolphinarium, cafes and restaurants, souvenir shops and just a pleasant walk in an interesting place. </p><p>  Secondly, Folklorik Yoruk Parki, which will literally immerse you in the life of Turkish nomads, explaining and telling everything at a clear and affordable level.  Add to this the picturesque views of the surroundings of Kemer.  Many travelers recommend it for an independent visit, guides are often silent about this place, but meanwhile it is necessary to devote not an hour or two, but rather all day. </p><p>  Well, actually, the city of Kemer itself.  He is quite young, but very colorful and interesting.  On it you can walk, ride, ride a bike.  The main thing is to get to know him and breathe in the aroma of Turkish coffee and sweet pastries on its streets. </p>
