But just think: every month you pay a tidy sum for that apartment that does not belong to you and will never belong.  It is much more reasonable to save on an initial installment, apply for a mortgage and, through monthly payments commensurate with the rent, gradually pay for your own apartment. </p><p>  Moreover, modern developers offer such a variety of excellent residential complexes that meet all the requirements that it will not be difficult to find something suitable.  LCD "Lyubertsy" ("Morton") is a new residential quarter, which, according to the developer, will provide its residents with the most comfortable living conditions.  It remains only to understand what appreciation the project is given by the equity holders themselves and those who have already managed to move in. </p>

Such an offer is simply impossible to refuse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Buses and minibuses leave from <span>Vykhino metro station</span> in the direction of the new complex every 10-15 minutes - the journey takes 10-15 minutes.  This is really one of the nearest complexes near Moscow.  In the near future, it is planned to build two more metro stations, which will be within walking distance from the complex.  And just then, apartments in a new area will significantly increase in price.  How do you like this investment? </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For real estate investors and potential buyers, the question often arises, they will attribute the Lyubertsky residential complex (Morton) to <span>Moscow</span> .
