Cape Verde</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Resting near Batumi, it is unthinkable not to make an excursion to the Batumi Botanical Garden.  Here you can visit all continents of the Earth as if in a day, because the plants of this unique place really gathered from all over the world.  Walking along the shady alleys or making your way along the garden paths barely visible in the grass, you feel an unusual unity with nature, enjoy the fabulous aromas of thousands of flowers, admire unusual plants that you can hardly see anywhere else live, and even touch them. </p><h2>  Batumi Botanical Garden on the map </h2><p>  This wonderful botanical garden is located just 8.5 km from the city of Batumi.  Nearby, literally in 2-5 steps, there is a railway station Zeleny Mys.  It was so named precisely because it is always green and delightfully beautiful.  Also called a local resort.  Nearby is the Georgian village of Mtsvane Kontskhi.  Once there was an all-Union health resort, dozens of sanatoriums worked, a <span>cableway</span> functioned <span>.</span>  Now the private sector and the wonderful Black Sea coast remain, on a hill near which the Batumi Botanical Garden is located.  Tourists love Mtsvane Kontskhi, because the conditions for a wellness vacation are excellent, and the prices are low.  Plus the fact that within walking distance there is such a unique attraction.  Almost all visitors to the garden always go down to the cape and plunge into the clear waters of the sea (of course, if weather conditions allow).  Cape Verde station is still operational. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden Opening Hours" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984016.jpg" width="575"></div>

The easiest way is by taxi from Batumi.  You can also take a minibus (bus) No. 31.  You can stop it right on the road, not even at a stop.  Ticket price is 80 Georgian tetri, although sometimes you have to pay 1 GEL (depending on where you got on a minibus).  Sometimes you can catch a minibus number 150. Some get to the place by regular buses going to the village.  But then you have to go on a bend and go to the garden along the railway track.  But there is free entry. </p><p>  According to tourists, the botanical garden can be reached by the morning train Makhinjauri-Kutaisi, which makes a stop on the Cape Verde platform.  She arrives here at local time at 8-00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Botanical Garden" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984015.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Operating procedure </h2><p>  The official botanical garden of Batumi has the following address: the city of Batumi, the village of Mtsvane Kontskhi.  Since 2006, it has become an independent institution.  Few people don‚Äôt know that the Russian scientist in geography and botany, Krasnov Andrei Nikolaevich, founded this most remarkable living attraction.  He began to collect the exposition of the garden in 1880, wanting to study how the cultures growing in different corners of the Earth in the subtropics of Georgia will feel.  The garden was opened to the public in 1912.  Thus, this wonderful botanical garden has been surprising and delighting visitors for 103 years.  Opening hours in the 2015th year - from 8-00 a.m. to 21-00 p.m. without holidays and weekends.  A ticket for an adult costs 8 GEL according to the latest data.  Children under 10 years old are admitted free of charge.  A guided tour here costs 30 GEL.  You can call and clarify information by calling 577 43 64 43. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Botanical Garden how to get" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984022.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Batumi Botanical Garden is striking in its large-scale size.  In length, he stretched for several kilometers.  On the main route there are benches, benches, gazebos and tents made of bamboo, which, by the way, has a whole plantation in the garden.  Many tents and gazebos are decorated with liana-shaped tropical plants that bloom seasonally or year-round.  Here you really feel like in a magical flower country.  Unusual floral aromas soaring throughout the garden create such an illusion. </p><p>  In addition to shops on its territory there are several artificial reservoirs in which live goldfish and turtles.  Some lakes have fountains and bridges.  It is impossible to list all the plants growing in the garden, because there are more than 2000 species of trees and shrubs alone.  And how many herbs and flowers, no one counted at all.  We can only say that in the garden palm trees and pines, bananas and junipers, bamboo and magnolias coexist.  Some trees are very old, with large hollows and thick trunks.  Many of them have roots sticking out of the earth, entwined in incredible patterns.  There are young trees of low-growing species, whose age is difficult to determine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Botanical Garden address" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984020.jpg" width="566"></div>

    <h2>  Gardening </h2><p>  Batumi Botanical Garden is loved by both adults and children, who are brought here on excursions by whole classes.  But here you can not only take a walk during the day, but also stay alive!  In the garden there are special places allocated for camping and picnics.  Therefore, those who have such a desire can come here with a tent.  This pleasure costs 15 GEL per day.  Tents can be set up 100 meters from the shores of the Black Sea under the canopy of tropical evergreen trees. </p><p>  All visitors to the garden are sure to take dozens of photos, and some shoot video.  But here, as a useful and tasty souvenir, you can buy a unique honey.  The garden has its own apiary.  Thousands of flowers from all over the Earth give the bees of this apiary nectar.  So honey is unique in its own way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Botanical Garden" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984024.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Those who already had the good fortune of walking in this botanical garden recommend taking water and food with them.  The only cafe is at the very end of the main route, and the food there is not very tasty. </p><p>  It is also advised to arrive at the botanical garden as early as possible.  Opening hours, although quite convenient, but the garden is so huge that it is very difficult to manage to see everything. </p><p>  Another piece of advice is to bring a bathing suit and towel with you, as the excellent beach is just around the corner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Batumi Botanical Garden" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/984025.jpg" width="522"></div>
