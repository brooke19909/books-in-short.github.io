What is its effect?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order for the relations that are developing in society to be regulated, regulatory acts that will determine their legal side are necessary.  They are usually called <span>sources of law.</span>  <span>Sources of law</span> are of several types.  The most common of these are laws.  This type of <span>legal act</span> is most common and familiar to many firsthand.  What is the law and how does it affect <span>social relations?</span> </p><p>  Each state uses laws as the main tool of the legal system.  The law can be described as a legal act that is developed by the state and serves to control relations in society, among civilians and institutions at various levels. </p><p>  We can say that the law contains general rules of law that are binding in each specific situation.  This interpretation is due to several reasons. </p><p>  If we turn to the sources of origin of the term, it turns out that the word "law" means the border or the limit of any action.  These are norms of behavior that are mandatory for everyone regardless of status. </p><p>  If we consider this value from the point of view of jurisprudence, then the "law" is understood, as a rule, which is a resolution of the highest authority. <br>  As a result of social relations, certain needs arise that are necessary for their regulation.  They are the basis for the development of laws that prescribe standards of conduct that are binding on all subjects of legal relations.  This is the expression of the needs of society in legal form as the will of the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are general concepts of what the law is.  The essence of legislative acts is that they apply to any case, and not to a single episode.  This is a mandatory way to regulate relations for all citizens and organizations. <br>  Distinguish between the material and formal concept of the law.  The set of <span>legal acts that</span> are developed by state bodies and are the same for all categories of social relations is called material law.  Such a definition includes a broad understanding of the word.  Here, the law acts as the primary source of law. </p><p>  The material concept of the law includes not only legal regulation within the state, but also international law.  International regulation of relations implies compilation of contracts in this case.  It also includes legal rules established by the European and other international communities. </p><p>  What is the law within a single state?  <span>These are normative acts</span> and documents that are developed by state authorities competent in this field. </p><p>  The formal concept of law has a narrower meaning.  These are legal acts that are developed by <span>legislative bodies.</span> </p><p>  Any legal state guarantees its citizens the observance of their rights.  Therefore, the legislative framework should cover all aspects of public life and be at the proper level.  All actions must take place on the basis of laws and exclude arbitrariness at all stages. </p><p>  Therefore, we can say that the rule of law is a whole system of legislative acts that cover the political, social, economic side of life and protect the rights and freedoms of citizens. </p><p>  Every citizen has a certain concept of what the law is.  But each of them must be sure that the authorities stand on the protection of his interests and those of other people.  Only in this case can the state be called legal.  Only then its legislative base is perfect and effective. </p>
