  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The village of Dzhubga. Beaches in Dzhubga</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dzhubga is a resort village in the Krasnodar Territory, popular among lovers of a relaxing family vacation.  There are few picturesque places, nightlife and historical sites.  The beach in Dzhubga is small, which, according to vacationers, is the main disadvantage of this Krasnodar resort. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the 60s of the XIX century, where the embankment and Dzhubgi beach are today, the village of Dzhubga was founded.  This settlement received the modern name in the 70s.  The sandy beach in Dzhubga appeared only in 1965 - it was then that the former village received the status of a resort village. </p><p>  In the middle of the last century, less than three thousand people lived here.  Today, the population of the village is 5600 inhabitants.  The main and perhaps the only attraction in Dzhubga is the dolmen located on the left bank of the river of the same name. </p><h2>  Quay in Dzhubga </h2><p>  In the photo, the beach of this resort village differs little from the beaches of any other seaside village.  The coastal zone is sandy.  In season, umbrellas and sunbeds are rented here.  It offers guests a variety of water activities. </p><p>  The length of the Central Beach in Dzhubga is 300 meters.  The promenade here is very small.  Along the beach of Dzhubga there are not a huge number of cafes, restaurants and clubs.  The most famous institution is Malibu.  In addition to this club, the sea has two dining rooms and a small restaurant with live music.  Underdeveloped infrastructure is a feature that authors of negative reviews about Dzhubgi beach often mention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the promenade in almost every house rooms are rented to vacationers.  Accommodation here is relatively inexpensive - a double for a season costs 2500 rubles.  In late September and early October, you can rent for just 1 thousand rubles a day in a house located very close to the sea (a five-minute walk). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central beach of dzhubga" class="if uuid-2884091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2884091.jpg"></div><p>  There are several beaches in Dzhubga.  Central is considered far from the best.  Firstly, the water here is very dirty in windy weather.  Secondly, the entrance to the water is rocky.  Despite all these shortcomings, there are a lot of people in season on the Central Beach.  Spacious and cleaner, according to reviews, on a small beach at the foot of the mountain, called locals "Hedgehog." </p><h2>  Autocamping "Sea wave" </h2><p>  There is a paid area at the foot of the aforementioned mountain, from afar that really resembles a hedgehog.  This hill, covered with deciduous forest, is located to the right of Central Beach.  Autocamping "Sea wave" is a wonderful place for lovers of secluded relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Hedgehog Dzhubga" class="if uuid-2884110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2884110.jpg"></div><h2>  Pension "Dzhubga" </h2><p>  The beach on the territory of this complex extends 140 meters in length.  Its width is 50 meters.  The boarding house itself does not work, but the entrance to its beach is open to all comers. </p><h2>  Inal Bay </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular resort places in the Tuapse district.  Inal Bay is often recommended as a wonderful place in Dzhubga, although it is located ten kilometers from the village.  Here the sea is clean, calm.  Many beautiful places for a photo shoot, which can not be said about Dzhubga. </p><p>  The beach in Inal Bay is pebble.  Along the coastal zone there are many tourist centers that form a small resort village.  The air here is healing due to fir and pine trees that border the bay.  However, there is a lot of people here during the season - in July, up to ten thousand holidaymakers rest in Inal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inal Bay" class="if uuid-2884098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2884098.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about holidays in Dzhubga </h2><p>  Some of this seaside village is called paradise.  For others, Dzhubga is the worst resort in the Krasnodar Territory.  In fairness it is worth saying that there are more positive reviews. </p><p>  Day and night, there is a large selection of entertainment.  The central beach is crowded, but only in the daytime.  There are few holidaymakers here in the morning and at sunset.  Dzhubga is a great place to relax with children.  In the center of the village there is a huge water park.  At the address Novorossiysk highway, house 88 is located Dolphinarium "Nemo". </p>
