And they do not always appear due to the extraction of any minerals.  But most often, after the completion of development, a quarry appears, which is later used as a recreation zone.  Such reservoirs are usually characterized by steep banks and clear transparent water. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  In the Etkul <span>district of the Chelyabinsk</span> region there is Lake Turquoise.  In this reservoir, clean water, its transparency reaches 7 meters, while the bottom is silty.  The average depth of the lake is 8-30 meters, but in the deepest places it reaches 96 meters.  The width of the lake is about 600 meters. </p><p>  But the most attractive thing in this place is fishing.  In some reviews, the quarry is described as a huge aquarium, where many species of fish are found. </p><p>  The water in the lake is mineralized.  At a depth of 6 meters and below, a stable temperature is maintained at any time of the year, which is kept at 4-5 degrees.  There are no additional ‚Äúsources‚Äù of food in the reservoir; recharge is solely due to precipitation. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  It is believed that earlier on the site of Lake Turquoise there was an underground cave.  After its collapse, water filled the gap, which caused the formation of a reservoir.  It now has the shape of a petal elongated to the north for 2.5 kilometers.  For some time, coal was mined here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Earlier (in the XVII-XVIII centuries) the lake was called the "bottomless", since no one could measure its depth. </p>

    <h2>  Resort area </h2><p>  To date, Turquoise Lake has been transferred to ‚Äúprivate hands‚Äù.  The main direction is fishing.  However, you can come here to relax with your family.  Near the lake there is a hotel, cafe, bath complex and barbecue facilities. </p><p>  The lake has perfectly clean beaches, sun loungers and mini-playgrounds for children.  Clear and clear water is a rarity for this climate zone.  Indeed, most of the reservoirs in the region are shallow, so swimming in them is almost impossible. </p><p>  In addition to equipped sunbathing areas, people can relax by renting a catamaran or boat.  If the sun is "tired", then you can walk around, because there are pines and birches. </p><p>  On the shore there are special bridges with water arbors, on which you can just sit and think about the essentials.  On the shore, you can rent a quad or jet ski. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  First of all, relaxing on Lake Turquoise is fishing.  The reservoir is a fish nursery.  Therefore, you can fish here only in the designated place.  And the created infrastructure completely disposes to it.  Near the coast there are many bridges, gazebos on the water, pontoons and simply equipped places for fishermen.  Fishing in this quarry is prohibited. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main distinguishing feature is not only turquoise water, but also the trout that lives here.  The largest grain specimens can reach a weight of 3 kg. </p><p>  Fishing in this place is paid.  For trout you will have to pay 350 rubles for 1 kilogram, and for pike or carp - 150 rubles.  All other types of fish are free.  In addition, fishermen will have to purchase a ticket that is valid for 12 hours, from 8 am to 8 pm. </p><p>  Of the other fish species on Lake Turquoise of the Chelyabinsk Region, you can catch: </p><ul><li>  whitefish; </li><li>  crucian carp; </li><li>  burbot; </li><li>  ripus. </li></ul><p>  You can fish in the pond in any season, summer and winter.  If fishing was unsuccessful, then here on the spot you can buy fresh fish. </p><p>  For those who hope for uncontrolledness, video surveillance works on the territory of the fisheries, so any attempt to poach is stopped immediately.  You can fish exclusively in designated areas. </p><p>  You can use any lure for <span>fishing trout</span> , as the fish is grown artificially.  This may be corn, meat and fish waste, shrimp.  Do not forget about the weather, although the fish is actually "home".  However, in adverse weather, the catch is usually not very large.  If you do not have complementary foods with you, then you can purchase it locally.  A glass of feed costs about 50 rubles. </p><p>  Fisheries do not work on Monday - this is a day off. </p>
