  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is a nobleman? This is a noble person with power and wealth.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the explanatory dictionary, the nobleman is a wealthy dignitary.  In other words, a person with special dignity or occupying a high position in the state.  The word itself came from the adverb ‚Äúvelmi‚Äù (‚Äúled‚Äù), which means ‚Äúvery‚Äù.  The second part of the notion of ‚Äúnobleman‚Äù is the verb ‚Äúcan‚Äù.  Having folded two halves, we get one who has great power. </p><h2>  Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  In ancient Egypt, a nobleman was considered close to the pharaoh - a noble man who helped manage the state.  Of course, it was a special caste that dealt with tax issues, carried out command of the troops and punished the guilty. </p><p>  The meaning of the word "nobleman" for ordinary Egyptians was the support of the pharaoh.  In gratitude, the ruler bestowed on his assistants magnificent houses, slaves, and servants.  Even after the death of the nobleman (this is confirmed by the found drawings) he had to be buried in a stone tomb.  The Egyptians believed that in the afterlife the pharaoh, along with his dignitaries, would continue to rule people. </p><h2>  The life of the rich Egyptians </h2><p>  The nobles wore clothes made of thin linen, which made it easy to tolerate the heat.  As in our time, the number of jewelry was considered an indicator of wealth and position.  Therefore, close to the pharaoh, before leaving the house, they put on luxurious necklaces, bracelets and rings made by the best craftsmen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobleman is" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/735347.jpg" width="365"></div>

    <p>  As for work, each nobleman had his own circle of duties entrusted to himself by the pharaoh.  This could be control over slaves in quarries, collecting taxes from artisans and farmers, resolving cases in court, or commanding troops on a campaign.  Such work was a matter of particular pride, so the nobles hired artists who painted the walls of the future tomb with colorful scenes from their real life. </p><h2>  Nobleman today </h2><p>  The meaning of the word "nobleman" has hardly changed in our days.  Under the <span>heads of state</span> there are close people - they represent the government, the judiciary and the <span>legislature.</span>  Like the nobles and their stretchers, they drive premium official cars and live in the best apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word nobleman" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/735351.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Has the meaning of the word "lord" changed much?  This is not an easy question.  Probably every citizen wants to be a wealthy person.  But what about liability?  Officials are obliged to work for the good of the state, to comply with the orders of the president, and most importantly, under no circumstances be associated with corruption.  The latter, as we know, is the biggest problem of modern nobles. </p>
