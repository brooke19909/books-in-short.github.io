Every day, tens of thousands of accidents, fires, injuries and other events occur that cause us a lot of trouble.  Of course, you cannot completely protect yourself from these troubles, but getting rid of the financial problems associated with them is quite possible.  For this, there are <span>insurance companies</span> offering their customers a wide range of services, covering almost the entire range of human activities. </p><p>  Today there are a lot of similar organizations in the Russian market, so it is very difficult to trust one of them.  Moreover, in recent years, cases of insurance fraud have become more frequent, and this also makes customers think several times before taking their money to the company.  If you also care about the choice of an insurer, then consider YuzhUralZhaso.  Reviews about this company prove that quite a lot of Russians trust it.  Most of them arrange insurance for their car here.  Since this topic is very relevant and quite acute, we decided to base the article on reviews about YuzhUralZhaso: on hull insurance, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, real estate and health insurance.  We will also consider this organization from the point of view of the employees working in it. </p>

    <h2>  Company History </h2><p>  Little is known about how the insurance company YuzhUralZhaso arose (reviews about it are often left not only by clients, but also by employees).  Typically, the CEO does not cover the topic of how the idea came up to organize a community of insurers that would correspond to the spirit of the times and provide a wide selection of products that adapt to the needs of customers at different periods of time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is authentically known that the company is registered <span>in Chelyabinsk.</span>  Here it is still listed, judging by the actual and legal address indicated in the documents. </p><p>  However, the largest offices of this organization are located in Moscow and St. Petersburg, where several hundred people are insured daily. </p>

    <h2>  Vehicles </h2><p>  In this area, the company works only with private individuals and develops products for them.  To date, three programs are in demand among our compatriots.  The first two allow customers to issue CTP and CASCO.  Moreover, the last service has a program that gives a chance to become the owner of the policy for half its cost. </p><p>  Also, drivers can simply insure the car against theft, fire and other troubles.  At the same time, if you need to have a certain transport to apply for a CASCO, then a regular insurance policy is issued for vehicles of any make and age. </p><h2>  Property </h2><p>  In this industry, YuzhUralZhaso has virtually no competitors.  Employees of the company have managed to develop several interesting products that allow you to take out insurance quickly and on special conditions. </p><p>  For example, express programs are very popular.  They are designed for home, apartment and summer house insurance.  Moreover, all documents are executed as soon as possible, and the manager, if necessary, can go to where it will be more convenient for you to sign the paper. </p><p>  Customers can also take out ordinary insurance or try the special product ‚ÄúDomovenok‚Äù.  It includes a whole range of services, which includes not only property insurance, but also the health of all family members.  This program has already gained popularity among customers of different ages, social status and affluence. </p><p>  Legal entities can issue a policy on the property of their company.  This service is considered standard. </p>

    <h2>  Mortgage insurance </h2><p>  This type of policy is well known to those who have ever issued a bank mortgage.  Borrowers know that a loan can only be issued if an insurance company takes part in the process. </p><p>  YuzhUralZhaso prescribes the following risks in the policy: </p><ul><li>  infrequent cases; </li><li>  illnesses; </li><li>  comprehensive damages in case of damage to the acquired apartment; </li><li>  termination of ownership. </li></ul><p>  The listed risks are standard and are included in the policy without fail.  If necessary, the policyholder can add a few more points. </p><h2>  Liability and cargo insurance </h2><p>  The first program is available to individuals and legal entities.  But cargo insurance can be issued only by the second category of customers.  The product provides for a policy for different types of risks.  Moreover, a legal entity can enter only one of them, some or all of them. </p><p>  Conveniently, YuzhUralZhaso offers customers engaged in transportation by their core business a policy that allows us not to insure each cargo individually.  Documents are drawn up for the whole year and all transportations are covered by insurance. </p>
