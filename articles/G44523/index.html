Behind such turns of speech are historical facts and events of the past, even real people.  These expressions are combinations of words that, individually, often mean very different things and have a different meaning.  Such turns are called phraseological units.  Sometimes they use proper names.  Often in our speech there are such turns: “Pandora’s box”, “Achilles heel” or “Tantalum flour”.  The meaning of phraseological units of this type can be understood only if one knows the events that led to the appearance of this expression.  Most of these revolutions are taken from ancient Greek culture. </p><h2>  Myths - the source of phraseological units </h2><p>  In ancient Greek culture, a huge layer of myths and legends about the acts of gods and heroes has been accumulated.  For many centuries they have been a source of lasting expression.  One of them is “Tantalum flour”.  The meaning of phraseology becomes clear if you know the mythology.  <span>The ancient Greek gods</span> lived on Olympus.  They had the same vices as people, they spent a lot of time in feasts and fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tantalum flour" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/519099.jpg" width="378"></div>  Mortals — children of gods and ordinary people — were sometimes invited to these meetings.  Phrygian king Tantalus was also honored with this honor.  He was the <span>son of Zeus</span> and the nymph Pluto, and the gods loved him, often invited him to Olympus and visited his magnificent palace.  He was very rich and lived happily.  Why is it that only the expression “Tantalum flour” has survived in history?  Its meaning will become clear if we study the further fate of this king.  Tantalum became arrogant, became proud and committed several unseemly acts for which he was punished by the gods.  He was thrown into Tartarus and subjected to terrible torment.

According to one version, he was so proud that he boasted a lot to people about his friendship with the gods and even revealed their secrets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flour tantalum the meaning of phraseology" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/519100.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  2. According to another opinion, Tantalus wanted to steal ragweed and divine nectar from Olympus in order to give them to people.  But since they granted immortality, Zeus could not allow this. </p><p>  3. The most common version of the appearance of the expression “Tantalum flour” is the killing of his son by him.  The gods often dined at his palace.  And once the king wanted to check the all-seeing of the gods and, having slaughtered his son, he served them a meal of his meat for lunch.  But the gods did not eat it, they loved Pelops, so they revived him, and Tantal himself was severely punished.  He was expelled to hell so that he would redeem his guilt through suffering. </p><h2>  Tantalum Flour </h2><p>  What were the tests of the former favorite of the gods in Tartarus?  He experienced excruciating thirst, terrible hunger and fear.  Therefore, the phraseological unit of “Tantalum flour” is not </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flour tantalum meaning" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/519098.jpg" width="288"></div>  very different from its original meaning.  The Phrygian king stood upright in clear water, but was very thirsty.  After all, when he wanted to get drunk, the water quickly left.  Many ripe fruits hung over Tantalus' head, but he experienced a terrible hunger.  After all, as soon as he reached out, the branches moved away from him.  In addition, he was in constant fear, because a huge rock hung over his head, about to collapse.  This is how the flour of Tantalum is described in myths.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The meaning of phraseology today </h2><p>  The punishment of the Phrygian king was so revealing and cruel that this story is instructive even now.  People consider Tantalum’s torment very cruel.  The meaning of phraseologism in modern speech is various experiences or torments caused by the inability to achieve a coveted and such close goal.  This is what they say about a person who is undergoing cruel torment, endless suffering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phraseology flour tantalum" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/519097.jpg" width="424"></div>  Often the expression "Tantalum flour" is used when there is a lack of some vital things - for example, food or sleep.  But sometimes this phraseological unit is used in relation to phenomena that are not very important, but of great value to a person.  It seems that just to achieve the goal, but it is impossible.  The expression "tantalum flour" can also be used in a figurative meaning to give speech an ironic meaning.

    <p>  Most phraseological units, originating in ancient Greek mythology, are used mainly in fiction and journalism.  The expression “Tantalum flour” is no exception.  Its significance to many people is incomprehensible, and in ordinary conversations it is almost never used.  But every cultured and educated person should know what it means. </p>
