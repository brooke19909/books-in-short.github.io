    <h2>  Complete set of flagship smartphone from Sony </h2><p>  The configuration of this device, in principle, is standard.  The phone itself has dimensions of 147 mm by 73 mm and a thickness of 8.2 mm.  In this case, the screen diagonal is 5.2 inches.  Its weight is 158 grams.  Among the documentation there is a user manual and warranty card.  The kit comes with a battery capacity of 3200 milliamps / hour and a charger.  Its resource at minimum load is enough for 5 days.  But with the active use of the device, this time will be reduced by more than two times - up to 2 days.  Separately, it is worth noting the <span>speaker system.</span>  In this case, it is fundamentally different from ordinary headphones.  The connector on it consists of 5 contacts (usually there are only 3).  The "trick" is that the speakers are equipped with additional microphones.  The signal from them goes to 2 additional contacts.  The smartphone itself analyzes and, if necessary, suppresses external noise.  As a result, you can listen to music or radio even on the bus, and extraneous sounds will be practically absent.  This innovation pleased the owners of the <span>Sony Xperia</span> Z2.  Their reviews confirm this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In appearance, Z2 is very similar to its predecessor Z1.  The difference is only in the size and diagonal of the screen.  In the previous model, the last figure was 5 inches, while in Z2 it increased by 0.2 inches.  At the same time, the new battery design allowed to reduce the thickness of the device to 8.2 mm.  Above and below the body are two speakers.  Such a constructive solution allowed to get high-quality stereo sound.  There are control buttons on the right side of the case.  The topmost one is turning the gadget on or off.  A little lower are the ‚Äúswing‚Äù volume.  At the very bottom is the camera control button.  Separately, it is worth noting the Sony Z2 case itself.  The review will be incomplete without this.  The body is made of metal.  All connectors are equipped with special plugs that allow it to provide a <span>degree of protection IP58.</span>  Due to this, this device can be immersed to a depth of 1.5 meters and make high-quality underwater pictures.  According to user reviews, the <span>Sony Z2 Compact</span> (a lightweight version of the flagship) will not be able to boast of anything like this.  The case of this model is plastic.  It is presented in three colors: white, purple and black.  Among the features we can single out the fact that a hot-plug flash card is provided.  There are 2 cameras on the phone.  One on the back of the case with 20 megapixels and backlight.  It allows you to make a video in 4K format, that is, in the highest quality that can be today.  The second is on the front side for making video calls.  The screen resolution is 1920 pixels in height and 1200 in width (almost HR di-quality, even a little better).  It supports up to 5 touches at a time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone stuffing </h2><p>  It's hard to find a better hardware stuffing than the Sony Z2.  The phone is equipped with the best hardware to date.  The central processor has MSM8974AB from Qualcomm.  It consists of 4 high-performance cores that operate at a frequency of 2.3 GHz.  For the processing of graphic information, the Adreno 330 chip is used. The RAM in this gadget is 3 GB, and the installed memory is 16 GB.  If this is not enough, then you can insert a flash card up to 128 GB.  Among the available set of communications, Wi-Fi, bluetooth and DzhiPS can be distinguished (it is possible to work in the GLONASS system).  Also, the device is able to function in all existing networks today, up to 4G.  There is support for playing audio recordings in MP3 format and listening to FM radio stations. </p>

    <h2>  Tablet Package Contents </h2><p>  By its configuration, the tablet of this series is similar to a smartphone.  Among the documentation there are all the same user manual and warranty card.  The tablet itself is with a charger.  Acoustics is not as advanced as a smartphone.  This is a regular 3-pin headphone jack.  And there is a lack of proprietary technology with 5 contacts, which is present in the Sony Xperia Z2.  Owner reviews confirm this and note the lack of a cover and a docking station among the drawbacks of the configuration.  They have to be bought separately.  Fortunately, the manufacturer took care of this in advance and offers many accessories of the same class.  So there is plenty to choose from.  Also there is no protective sticker on the glass.  And in this case it will not be superfluous.  Therefore, you also have to buy this component additionally. </p>

    <h2>  Underwater Tablet <span>Appearance</span> </h2><p>  The design tablet is very similar to a smartphone.  Only his size is much larger.  Still, its diagonal is 10.1 inches.  The case material is special plastic, which resembles in appearance a stripped-down version of the flagship Sony Z2 Compact.  This tablet is available in only two color options: white and black.  But the degree of protection is the same - IP58.  That is, with this tablet you can dive to a depth of 1.5 meters.  The following connectors and slots are located on top of the case from right to left: microUSB, SIM cards (if the communication module is integrated) and memory cards.  In the lower right and lower left corner there are 2 speakers that provide sound quality similar to that of a smartphone.  Around the perimeter, the screen is framed by a fairly wide frame.  This avoids false clicks.  Above the center of the frame is a 2 megapixel <span>front camera</span> for video calls.  On the back is the main camera of 8 megapixels.  For shooting in the dark, a flash is provided. </p><h2>  Stuffing 10-inch tablet </h2><p>  Very similar hardware stuffing for devices of the Sony Z2 line.  A review of all technical specifications only confirms this.  A processor from the same manufacturer, model MSM8974, with the same clock speed and the exact same number of cores.  RAM, as in the previous case, 3 GB.  But the built-in can be either 16 GB or 32 GB.  This parameter is model dependent.  If desired, this figure can be increased using an external flash card up to 128 GB.  According to the characteristics of the screen, the tablet is similar to a smartphone (that is, 1920 pixels by 1200 pixels).  It also supports processing of up to ten touches at a time.  The weight of the device is 240 grams. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Initially, the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù with serial number 4.2 was used as the operating system for this line of Sony Z2 devices.  Now there is an update to the latest current version of this OS under number 4.4.2.  Therefore, there should not be problems with software compatibility.  Still, we are considering premium devices from the legendary Japanese manufacturer. </p><h2>  Soft tablet and smartphone </h2><p>  The Sony Z2 line does not have a special set of applications.  This is a bare operating system.  And it has a standard set of applications.  At first glance, this seems to be a drawback.  But on the other hand, this is a plus.  The user gets the opportunity to install exactly what he really needs.  And this is the most correct decision.  Otherwise, an unpleasant situation often arises when the resources of the mobile device are occupied by preinstalled software, and the desired program has nowhere to be placed.  The only thing that is present in the initial version is a set of the most popular widgets.  But they do not take up so many resources of mobile devices, and the benefits of their availability exist.  For example, a weather forecast linked to a specific region.  He uses JiPS navigation to determine the location of the device.  And according to these data, the Sony Z2 gets a fairly accurate weather forecast. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Both the tablet and the smartphone of the Sony Z2 series have practically no analogues.  For example, a smartphone camera of 20 megapixels is beyond competition.  And the phone case, which allows full-fledged photography at a depth of 1.5 meters, is special.  In general, this is an ideal device for those who are accustomed to not denying anything to themselves and using only the best.  The only negative is the price.  It is the same for a smartphone and tablet - 670 dollars.  But good things are not cheap.  Therefore, it is not necessary to expect a lower cost of the flagship device.  And the rest is an ideal smartphone that in the next three years will cope with any task without any problems.  Similarly, you can characterize the second device from Sony - the Z2 tablet, which turned out to be as perfect as a smartphone. </p>
