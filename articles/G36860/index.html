  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern models of knitted tops</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is approaching, and in connection with this there is a great desire to take off warm clothes and dress up in something airy, seductive, openwork and cool.  Many knitters begin to create light clothes for the summer since spring.  Topical and popular at this time of the year are knitted tops.  They are versatile and comfortable in everyday wear, as well as in any type of employment. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  To create them, light, natural threads of cotton, linen, silk are often used.  But modern designers allow the introduction into new models of blended yarn containing a small amount of alpaca, cashmere or wool.  These additions do not allow the canvas to stretch and deform the picture.  Which, in turn, happens with patterns on knitted tops made of pure cotton threads.  To avoid stretching the product, it is better to use yarn with the addition of artificial fibers, such as viscose.  Cotton processing technology such as mercerization will also prevent the product from changing shape. </p><p>  Linen knitted tops are unique in that they maintain a constant body temperature.  They will not be hot in hot weather, and they are able to warm in cool weather.  Therefore, designers are recommended to have several tops and tunics made of linen yarn in the wardrobe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elisimarketi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted tops" class="if uuid-2516489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2516489.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of patterns </h2><p>  Light ornate patterns look elegant and organically on crocheted tops.  Only with this tool can you create a product using the technique of loin knitting.  This method is knitting a grid with the same squares.  By filling holes on the product, various patterns are formed in the form of flowers, birds, animals and other images. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For products made from yarn, there are many kinds of patterns that are knitted as a direct fabric, and increasing in width.  Such patterns make it possible to form flirts on tops in the collar zone or the lower part of the product.  What gives the image a touch of naivety and romance. </p><p>  "Pineapples" are considered one of the fashionable patterns.  Knitters often use them to create crochet tops.  Such openwork elements as ‚Äúshells‚Äù, ‚Äúfans‚Äù, ‚Äúleaves‚Äù, ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù, and ‚Äúmesh‚Äù deserve no less attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mamainastitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted top with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2516491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2516491.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting methods </h2><p>  Knitted and crocheted tops can be created in several ways.  Work can begin with a yoke, and then the whole product fits in a circle with no seams.  Another version of the model is created from two separately connected parts: the front and back.  Which are subsequently sewn along the shoulders and sides of the product.  Also, modern tops include styles associated with a single canvas with the formation of a neck in the middle part. </p><p>  Another option for knitting tops is the creation of individual elements, later combined into one piece.  Also in the models, asymmetry is welcomed both in patterns and in details.  For example, a strap on one shoulder, an insert of lace, one edge below the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megmadewithlove.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Top" class="if uuid-2516490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2516490.jpg"></div><h2>  What are knitted tops worn with </h2><p>  A number of modern products offered by designers have a shortened appearance.  Such styles give the owner femininity and romance.  Look spectacular with skirts on the floor, trousers of a classic cut or short jeans or knitted shorts.  Tops are combined with almost any clothing, allowing you to create many images.  The main thing is to choose the right shades of wardrobe elements that complement each other. </p><p>  Tops fit perfectly into any modern style.  Shortened models are worn during sports, combining with leggings or sports cut pants.  Having put on a mini-skirt with a knitted openwork top, you can visit an entertainment venue.  At work, it will be appropriate to wear models of seasoned style and plain knitting. </p><p>  Having picked up a ball of thread, a hook or knitting needles, as well as understanding how to knit an interesting openwork pattern, you can knit a unique and inimitable fashionable top for two or three evenings.  Moreover, a product created independently will always be appreciated by the admiring glances of others. </p>
