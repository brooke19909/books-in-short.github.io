Concentration camps</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, historical memory is a short-lived thing.  Not even seventy years have passed since the end of World War II, and many have a vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Auschwitz, or the Auschwitz concentration camp, as it is commonly called in world practice.  However, there is still a generation that has experienced the horrors of Nazism, hunger, mass extermination and how deep the moral decline can be.  Based on the preserved documents and testimonies of witnesses who know firsthand what the concentration camps of the Second World War are, modern historians present a picture of what is happening, which, of course, cannot be exhaustive.  It is impossible to calculate the number of victims of the infernal Nazism machine in view of the destruction by the SS men of documents, and simply the lack of thorough reports on the dead and killed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Auschwitz concentration camp" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30399/685440.jpg" width="600"></div>  What is the Auschwitz concentration camp? </h2><p>  A complex of buildings for the maintenance of prisoners of war, was built under the auspices of the SS by Hitler's directive in 1939.  Auschwitz concentration camp is located near Krakow.  90% of those contained were ethnic Jews.  The rest are Soviet prisoners of war, Poles, gypsies and representatives of other nationalities, which in the total number of those killed and tortured amounted to about 200 thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The full name of the concentration camp is Auschwitz Birkenau.  Auschwitz is the Polish name, it is customary to use it mainly in the territory of the former Soviet Union. </p><h2><br>  The history of the concentration camp.  Prisoner of War Content </h2><p>  Although the Auschwitz concentration camp is notorious for the mass extermination of the Jewish civilian population, it was originally conceived for several other reasons. </p><p>  Why was Auschwitz chosen?  This is due to its convenient location.  Firstly, it was located on the border, where the Third Reich ended and Poland began.  Auschwitz was one of the key trade hubs with convenient and well-established transport links.  On the other hand, the forest that was approaching closely helped to hide the crimes committed there from prying eyes. </p>

    <p>  The Nazis erected the first buildings on the site of the barracks of the Polish army.  For construction, they used the labor of local Jews who came to them in captivity.  At first, German criminals and Polish political prisoners were sent there.  The main task of the concentration camp was to keep in isolation persons dangerous for the well-being of Germany and to use their labor.  The prisoners worked six days a week, and Sunday was a day off. </p><p>  In 1940, the local population living near the barracks was forcibly expelled by the German army for the construction of additional buildings in the liberated territory, which subsequently had a crematorium and cells.  In 1942, the camp was fenced with a strong reinforced concrete fence and high-voltage wire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, such measures did not stop some prisoners, although cases of escape were extremely rare.  Those with similar thoughts knew that any attempt would destroy all their cellmates. </p><p>  In the same 1942, at the NSDAP conference, it was concluded that there was a need for the mass extermination of Jews and a "final solution of the Jewish question."  At first, German and Polish Jews referred to Auschwitz and other German concentration camps of the Second World War.  Then, Germany agreed with the Allies to conduct a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù in their territories. </p>

For example, Denmark was able to save its subjects from imminent death.  When the government was informed about the planned "hunt" of the SS men, Denmark organized a secret transfer of Jews to a neutral state - Switzerland.  Thus, more than 7 thousand lives were saved.

    <p>  However, in the general statistics of 7,000 people destroyed, tormented by hunger, beatings, overwork, illnesses and inhuman experiences, this is a drop in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãshed blood.  During the entire existence of the camp, according to various estimates, from 1 to 4 million people were killed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In mid-1944, when the war unleashed by the Germans made a sharp turn, the SS tried to transport prisoners from Auschwitz to the west, to other camps.  Massively destroyed documents and any evidence of a ruthless massacre.  The Germans destroyed the crematorium and gas chambers.  In early 1945, the Nazis had to release most of the prisoners.  Those who could not escape, wanted to destroy.  Fortunately, thanks to the advance of the Soviet army, several thousand prisoners were saved, including the children they were experimenting with. </p><h2>  Camp structure </h2><p>  In total, Auschwitz divided into 3 large camp complexes: Birkenau-Auschwitz, Monowitz and Auschwitz-1.  The first camp and Birkenau were subsequently combined and represented a complex of 20 buildings, sometimes several floors. </p><p>  The tenth block was far from the last in terrible conditions of detention.  Here they conducted medical experiments, mainly on children.  As a rule, such ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù were not so much of scientific interest as they were another way of sophisticated bullying.  Especially among the buildings, the eleventh block stood out, it caused terror even among local guards.  There was a place for torture and executions, the most negligent were sent here, tortured with merciless cruelty.  It was here that the first attempts were made to mass and maximize the "effective" extermination using the poison "Cyclone-B". </p>

    <p>  A wall for executions was constructed between these two blocks, where, according to scientists, about 20 thousand people were killed. </p><p>  Also, several gallows and incinerators were installed on the territory.  Later, gas chambers were built, capable of killing up to 6 thousand people a day. </p><p>  Arriving prisoners were distributed by German doctors to those who were capable of work, and those who were immediately sent to death in a gas chamber.  Most often, weak women, children and the elderly were considered disabled. </p><p>  The survivors were kept in tight conditions, with virtually no food.  Some of them dragged the bodies of the dead or cut off the hair that went to textile factories.  If a prisoner in such a service managed to hold out for a couple of weeks, they would get rid of him and take a new one.  Some fell into the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù category and worked with the fascists as tailors and barbers. </p><p>  Deported Jews were allowed to take no more than 25 kg of weight from home.  People took with them the most valuable and important.  All things and money left after their death were sent to Germany.  Before <span>this, the belongings had</span> to be disassembled and sorted out all the valuable things that the prisoners did in the so-called ‚ÄúCanada‚Äù.  The place acquired such a name due to the fact that earlier "Canada" was called valuable gifts and gifts sent from abroad to the Poles.  Work on Canada was relatively softer than overall in Auschwitz.  Women worked there.  Food could be found among things, so in Canada the prisoners did not suffer so much from hunger.  The SS men did not hesitate to molest beautiful girls.  Often rape occurred here. </p><h2><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="concentration camps" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30399/688471.jpg" width="587"></div>  The first experiments with Cyclone-B </h2><p>  After the 1942 conference, concentration camps began to turn into a machine whose purpose is mass destruction.  Then the Nazis first tested the power of the effects of Cyclone-B on people. </p><p>  Cyclone-B is a pesticide, a poison based on <span>hydrocyanic acid.</span>  Ironically, the tool was invented by the famous scientist Fritz Gaber, a Jew who died in Switzerland a year after Hitler came to power.  Haber's relatives died in concentration camps. </p><p>  The poison was known for its powerful action.  It was convenient to store.  The Cyclone-B used to kill lice was affordable and cheap.  It is worth noting that the gaseous Cyclone-B is still used in America to carry out the death penalty. </p><p>  The first experiment was conducted in Auschwitz-Birkenau (Auschwitz).  Soviet prisoners of war were driven into the eleventh block and poison was poured through holes.  For 15 minutes there was an incessant scream.  The dose was not enough to destroy everyone.  Then the Nazis fell asleep more pesticide.  This time it worked. </p><p>  The method has proven extremely effective.  Nazi concentration camps of the Second World War began to actively use Cyclone-B, having built special gas chambers.  Apparently, in order not to create a panic, but perhaps because of a fear of retribution, the SS men said that prisoners needed to take a shower.  However, it was no longer a secret for most prisoners that they would never come out of this ‚Äúsoul‚Äù again. </p><p>  The main problem for the SS was not to destroy people, but to get rid of corpses.  At first they were buried.  This method was not very effective.  When burning, there was an unbearable stench.  The Germans built a crematorium with the hands of the prisoners, however, incessant screaming and a terrifying smell became commonplace in Auschwitz: traces of crimes of this magnitude were very difficult to hide. </p><h2>  SS conditions in the camp </h2>

It had everything for the life of the military: dining rooms with plentiful good food, cinema, theater and all the human benefits for the Nazis.  While the prisoners did not receive even a minimal amount of food (many died in the first or second week of starvation), the SS men constantly feasted, enjoying life.

    <p>  <span>Concentration camps,</span> especially Auschwitz, have always been a welcome duty station for a German soldier.  Life here was much better and safer than those who fought in the East. </p><p>  However, there was no more corrupting human nature than Auschwitz.  The concentration camp is not only a place with good content, where the military was not in danger for the endless killings, but also a complete lack of discipline.  Here the soldiers could do whatever they wanted and to which they could go down.  Huge cash flows went through Auschwitz due to property stolen from deportees.  Accounting was conducted after the sleeves.  And how could one calculate exactly how much the treasury should be replenished if even the number of arriving prisoners was not taken into account? </p><p>  The SS men did not hesitate to take their precious things and money.  They drank a lot, they often found alcohol among the belongings of the slain.  In general, employees in Auschwitz did not limit themselves to anything, leading a rather idle lifestyle. </p><h2>  Doctor Josef Mengele </h2><p>  After Joseph Mengele was injured in 1943, he was deemed unsuitable for continuing service and sent as a doctor to Auschwitz, the death camp.  Here he had the opportunity to carry out all his ideas and experiments, which were frankly insane, cruel and meaningless. </p><p>  The authorities ordered Mengele to conduct various experiments, for example, on the effect of cold or altitude on a person.  So, Joseph conducted an experiment on the temperature effect, covering the prisoner on all sides with ice, until he died of hypothermia.  Thus, it was found out at what temperature of the body irreversible consequences and death occur. </p>

    <p>  Mengele loved to experiment with children, especially twins.  The results of his experiments was the death of almost 3 thousand minors.  He did forced sex reassignment surgery, transplanted organs, carried out painful procedures, trying to change the color of his eyes, which ultimately led to blindness.  This, in his opinion, was proof of the impossibility for the "unbred" to become a real Aryan. </p><p>  In 1945, Joseph had to flee.  He destroyed all reports of his experiments and, having executed fake documents, fled to Argentina.  He lived a quiet life without deprivation and oppression, without being caught and punished. </p><h2>  When <span>Auschwitz</span> crashed <span>.</span>  <span>Who freed the</span> prisoners? </h2><p>  In early 1945, the situation of Germany changed.  Soviet troops launched an active offensive.  The SS men had to start the evacuation, which later became known as the ‚Äúdeath march‚Äù.  60 thousand prisoners were ordered to go on foot to the West.  Thousands of prisoners were killed along the way.  Weakened by hunger and intolerable labor, the prisoners had to go more than 50 kilometers.  Everyone who was lagging behind and could not move on was immediately shot.  In Gliwice, where the prisoners arrived, they were sent in freight cars to concentration camps located in Germany. </p>

    <p>  The concentration camps were liberated in late January, when in Auschwitz there were only about 7 thousand sick and dying prisoners who could not leave. </p><h2>  Life after liberation </h2><p>  The victory over fascism, the destruction of concentration camps and the liberation of Auschwitz, unfortunately, did not mean the complete punishment of all those responsible for the atrocities.  What happened in Auschwitz remains not only the bloodiest, but also one of the most unpunished crimes in the history of mankind.  Only 10% of all those directly or indirectly involved in the mass destruction of civilians were convicted and punished. </p><p>  Many of those who are still alive do not feel guilty.  Some refer to the propaganda machine, which dehumanized the image of the Jew and made him the culprit of all the misfortunes of the Germans.  Some say that order is order, and in war there is no room for reflection. </p><p>  As for the prisoners of concentration camps who escaped from death, it seems that they do not need to wish for more.  However, these people were, as a rule, left to their own devices.  The houses and apartments where they lived were long appropriated by others.  Without property, money, and relatives who died in the Nazi death machine, they needed to survive again, even in the post-war era.  One can only marvel at the willpower and courage of people who have passed through concentration camps and managed to survive after them. </p><h2><br><br>  Auschwitz Museum </h2><p>  After the war ended, Auschwitz, <span>the death camp,</span> entered the UNESCO World Heritage List and became a museum center.  Despite the huge flow of tourists, it is always quiet.  This is not a museum in which something can please and pleasantly surprise.  However, it is very important and valuable, like an incessant cry from the past about innocent victims and a moral decline, the bottom of which is infinitely deep. </p>

    <p>  On the walls of the blocks you can see the inscriptions left by the captives.  To this day, in the gas chambers, traces of the nails of the unfortunate, dying in terrible agony, remained on the walls. </p><p>  Only here you can fully feel the horror of what is happening, see with your own eyes the living conditions and the extent of the destruction of people. </p><h2>  Holocaust in fiction </h2><p>  One of the works denouncing the <span>fascist regime</span> is Anne Frank's Asylum.  This book, in letters and notes, tells of a vision of a war by a Jewish girl who, together with her family, managed to find refuge in the Netherlands.  The diary was kept from 1942 to 1944.  Entries are interrupted on August 1.  Three days after this, the whole family was arrested by German police. </p><p>  Another famous work is Schindler‚Äôs Ark.  This is a story about the manufacturer Oscar Schindler, who, amazed by the horrors in Germany, decided to do everything possible to save innocent people, and transported thousands of Jews to Moravia. </p><p>  According to the book, the film ‚ÄúSchindler's List‚Äù was shot, which received many prizes from various festivals, <span>including 7</span> Oscars, and was highly praised by the community of critics. </p><p> The politics and ideology of fascism led to one of the most widespread catastrophes of mankind.  The world knows no more cases of such a massive, unpunished killing of civilians.  The history of misconceptions, which led to great suffering affecting the whole of Europe, should remain in the memory of mankind as a terrible symbol of something that can never be allowed again. </p>
