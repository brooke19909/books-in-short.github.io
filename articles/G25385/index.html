It is enough to have basic tools and a desire to create beautiful things for the interior of a room or as a gift to a loved one.  For any occasion, you can make interesting figures, pieces of furniture or toys from planks, branches or wood cuts. </p><p>  Crafts from wood are made from dry material so that the product does not subsequently crack.  To do this, the boards are brought into the room and kept for several days at room temperature so that they are used to a certain humidity.  You will also need the following tools: a saw and a jigsaw (manual or electric), a drill, a screwdriver, sandpaper No. 80, 100 and 240. Depending on the type of coating chosen, purchase acrylic varnish or paints, you may need carpentry adhesive D-3.  If you will make frames for a picture or photographs, then stock up with a miter box to cut the slats at the right angle. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several beautiful wooden crafts made by hand.  These are easy options that even inexperienced craftsmen can handle.  Step-by-step instructions for completing the work given for each product will help to do the job efficiently, quickly and without problems.  Photos of the samples will give a complete picture of how the finished woodwork should look. </p><h2>  Heart for valentines day </h2><p>  A hanging heart can be made as a gift to a loved one.  Although this holiday is considered Catholic, many young people do not miss the opportunity to celebrate Valentine's Day, because the tradition of congratulating loved ones is very pleasant, and all the girls like to receive gifts.  The guy will be able to please his girlfriend by handing her a pendant glued from cut tree branches.  Choose a wood with a bright core, such as walnut or juniper branches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart made of branches" class="if uuid-3003748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003748.jpg"></div><p>  To make a wooden craft, start by cutting the same size of pieces.  Their diameter may vary, but the length should be equal.  Be sure to peel each bite from the bark and wipe with sandpaper, first coarse and then fine.  Then assemble the heart by gluing together the individual parts with wood glue.  Insert a hemp rope in the center hole and tie a loop so that the craft can be hung on a hook.  Instead of a rope, you can use a red satin ribbon, tying it with a bow at the base. </p><h2>  Baby gift </h2><p>  All children love to play constructor.  This is an educational and educational game, therefore, such a gift can be given to both a boy and a girl.  It will take several bars of different widths.  Using a ruler, mark the pieces you want to cut.  Smooth cubes or bricks can be prepared with an ordinary saw, but round parts or arches are made with a jigsaw.  It is best to do the work on the balcony or on the veranda of a private house or cottage, as there will be a lot of shavings sprinkling on the floor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden educational toys" class="if uuid-3003751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003751.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to follow the safety rules when working with the tool, the wood block must be secured with clamps so that it does not move.  You only need to point the tool away from you, do not put your fingers under the knives and don‚Äôt put on clothes with long sleeves so as not to drag the fabric into the saw. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Parts after manufacturing must be carefully treated with sandpaper of different grain sizes several times until the surface becomes smooth and even.  After that, do-it-yourself wooden crafts are either simply covered with acrylic varnish, or painted in different colors. </p><p>  It looks interesting from the details of the designer cars and trains, which are assembled on the rod in the center.  It is cut out of a thin stick by hand with a sharp chisel and glued into the hole in the bottom part.  In addition, you can make a box of plywood for the set, so that the designer parts do not lie scattered, and the baby neatly stacks them in the chosen place on the shelf. </p><h2>  Snowmen </h2><p>  You can decorate a garden plot or the territory of a kindergarten before the New Year with such original snowmen as in the photo below.  In the autumn, old and dried trees often cut down utility services.  If you have a chainsaw, then you can cut several circles of different diameters but the same width from the trunk of a fallen tree.  To cut the tree easily into a snowman figure, you need to align the connection points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden snowmen" class="if uuid-3003743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003743.jpg"></div><p>  By the New Year, such wooden crafts can be assembled into long nails, glued with carpentry glue or twisted with screws.  You can decorate snowmen with thin strips of fabric, tying a scarf around them on the ‚Äúneck‚Äù.  Small details of the face and buttons are painted with paints.  And for the hat, cut a thin wide circle for the fields and a large saw cut for the cylinder.  Since the structure is temporary, it is possible not to additionally process it with sandpaper and not to paint with anything.  Even if snow does not fall on New Year's Eve, children and adults will be delighted with a snowman figurine made of wood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Christmas beauty from the branches </h2><p>  Recently, many refuse to buy spruce and pine trees sawn in the forest, preferring to protect nature.  They use either artificial trees or create wooden crafts with their own hands, as in the photo below.  It is enough to collect a number of dry even branches, get rid of the bark and cut them in order of increasing length.  You can lay out the rows of Christmas trees tightly, but you can at an equal distance from one another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freedb2.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree made of tree branches" class="if uuid-3003807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003807.jpg"></div><p>  To connect them, use a rope.  And in the branches drill holes in such a way that they are located one above the other.  After threading the edge of the rope into a branch, tie a knot on the bottom side so that the parts do not fall below. </p><p>  After the triangular shape of the Christmas tree is assembled, a star is attached to the top.  You can use a Christmas tree toy or make it out of thin sticks by binding.  It remains only to hang toys and a sparkling garland on the "branches". </p><h2>  Furniture for the cottage </h2><p>  From cuts of white birch you will get an excellent chair if you connect the parts together.  To do this, it is most reliable to use staples or long screws.  To make the structure strong, substitute the wire frame from below.  You can not remove the bark, since with it the stove bench looks more beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.listinspired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden bench" class="if uuid-3003808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003808.jpg"></div><p>  Using wood cuts, you can easily assemble any furniture - a table and a bed, stools or a stand for flower pots.  It is not necessary to additionally process the material, since such furniture is used either on the veranda or in the fresh air in the shade of trees.  Although it will not be long-lasting, it will still have time to please the people living in the house for a while. </p><h2>  Craft "Wooden Clock" </h2><p>  Despite the apparent complexity of making such a souvenir, it will be easy to cut the shape of the birds from the board.  You will need an electric jigsaw and a cardboard template.  First buy the simplest plastic watch.  They can be either round or square.  Draw them on a wooden plank to cut a hole along the contours.  Then draw a bird around the template.  If you don‚Äôt know how to draw, that's okay.  You can copy the contours from Internet sites, and then print the image on a printer.  It remains to cut the figure with scissors and outline on a tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cnccuttingdesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts wooden clock" class="if uuid-3003730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003730.jpg"></div><p>  Next, the wooden crafts with their own hands are carefully cut along the contours with a jigsaw.  Do not forget to make a hole for the watch itself.  They must be inserted tightly so that they do not have to be glued to the wood blank.  After trying on, temporarily set the clock aside and engage in surface treatment to a smooth state.  This is done with sandpaper of different grain sizes.  First, No. 80 is used, and then the surface is cleaned with small ones - No. 100 and No. 240. It is possible to varnish the craft or paint it in any color. </p><p>  For birds, the eyes are either drawn or created with a drill with a wide drill diameter.  To make the clock stand exactly on the surface of the table, the lower part of the bird is cut out flat.  Two semicircular coasters - ‚Äúlegs‚Äù from the bottom of the craft will look beautiful. </p><p>  In this way, you can cut out not only birds, but also figures of any animals, insects or objects, such as a house or cars. </p><h2>  Homemade Chess </h2><p>  If you like to spend time playing a game of chess, then make large figures for gatherings in the yard with your neighbors.  In order not to bring the board with you every time, draw it on a large saw cut of a tree, outlining the cells with paint.  The figures can be divided into dark and light using a stain solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picsnaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade chess" class="if uuid-3003791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003791.jpg"></div><p>  You can cut chess pieces in different ways, depending on the skills of the master.  This simple stumps of different sizes with scratched stripes, and sculptures of knights and horses, towers of the fortress and the magnificent prince. </p><h2>  Shelf of cubes </h2><p>  Looks great shelf made at different levels from the same cubes.  They are glued together with carpentry glue, having previously treated the surface with sandpaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.birchwoodcc.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shelf of cubes" class="if uuid-3003809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003809.jpg"></div><p>  On the back side, screw two metal loops and hang on the screws on the corner of the room wall.  On such an original shelf, you can place many beautiful little things. </p><h2>  Triangular shelves </h2><p>  We offer another interesting option for shelves for small items in the form of triangles.  They are made of thin wooden planks, cutting them at the right angle with the help of a miter box.  The planks are fastened with wood glue, and if you plan to keep something heavy on the shelf, you can additionally twist it with screws. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diyprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood decorative shelves" class="if uuid-3003811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3003811.jpg"></div><p>  The workshops presented in the article on creating wooden crafts are suitable for all occasions.
