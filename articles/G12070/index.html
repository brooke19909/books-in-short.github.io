From Yalta it is located 6 km to the south-west.  Around you can see a beautiful old park, the laying of which was carried out in the early 20th century.  The style is landscape.  The total area is 27 ha. </p><h2>  Recognized Quality </h2><p>  Lower Oreanda is a place that is known in many parts of the world for the treatment and recreation services that can be obtained here.  It was not deprived of the attention of the leaders of the party of the USSR, who followed the custom of coming here.  The kings of the Russian Empire were also treated here. </p><p>  Sanatorium "Lower Oreanda" looks quite expensive, solid and luxurious.  Here, I like not only the people's deputies of the country, but also representatives of the business elite from <span>neighboring countries.</span> </p>
