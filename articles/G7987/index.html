There are many reasons for this.  This is the purest sea, and the unusual air in which the aromas of the steppe and salt water are mixed, the Karadag nature reserve located nearby, and the opportunity to engage in extreme sports, fishing, and relaxing.  In addition, Koktebel is known as the place where the poet Maximillian Voloshin lived, and his dacha today is a museum where tourists constantly travel. </p><p>  The choice of hotels in a small village in which about 2 thousand people constantly live is small, so guests are offered to rent a boathouse.  Koktebel is a great opportunity to spend a vacation near the sea. </p><h2>  What is boathouse </h2><p>  The word "boathouse" means a boat garage in which watercraft are stored, repaired and even built.  In many Crimean cities and towns, they have long been converted into mini-hotels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="feo82.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koktebel - the land of boathouses" class="if uuid-3201035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3201035.jpg"></div><p>  In Koktebel, boathouses are located almost on a sandy and pebble beach.  Low buildings along the promenade, and the windows offer a wonderful view of the sea. </p><p>  Holidays in boathouses have their own characteristics.  On the one hand, the infrastructure of a small village is such that there is almost no nightly noisy life, as there are no luxurious restaurants and shops.  On the other hand, having arrived by car, you can go out, see the sights of the south-eastern Crimea, relax and enjoy the sea.  In addition, in August-September, Koktebel becomes the venue for major jazz festivals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to choose a boathouse </h2><p>  Having decided to give preference to a boathouse in Koktebel for the duration of your vacation, you should pay attention to such factors: </p><ul><li>  are there any cafes or shops nearby; </li><li>  availability of a bathroom in the room; </li><li>  one or two rooms; </li><li>  is there an open terrace, porch, patio; </li><li>  the presence of household appliances (refrigerator, microwave, kettle), air conditioning. </li></ul><p>  All this determines the cost of accommodation.
