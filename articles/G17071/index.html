    <p>  This is probably the most beautiful castle not only in Germany, but also in Europe.  It is located among the Alps, in the heart of beautiful Bavaria.  Neuschwanstein is a unique castle.  It was built by Ludwig II, who is better known as Ludwig Crazy.  The castle of Germany, Neuschwanstein, is the embodiment of his dreams.  After all, the king in his letter to the <span>German composer</span> Wagner said that this pearl of the Alps was built in the style of German brave knights, in the most fabulous place on the planet!  It became a museum and one of the most popular and favorite tourist corners after the death of Ludwig.  More than 60 million people from all regions of the world visited this fabulous castle ... </p>

    <p>  Is a cloud castle only in fairy tales?  Fortunately not!  Such a beautiful structure is not fiction, but reality.  The castle of Germany, Hohenzollern, built on a huge mountain (855 meters), is one of the best examples of German culture and architecture.  It served as the residence for <span>the Hohenzollern dynasty,</span> which occupied the throne of Prussia from the Middle Ages to the First World War.  This castle was designed on the initiative of Frederick William IV and combines the features of the Gothic and Renaissance styles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Eltz Castle</strong> </p><p>  Near a cozy quiet river Mossel near the town of Koblenz is a real medieval castle.  It was built in the middle of the XII century.  Eltz differs from other structures in that there have never been military battles.  Thus, the castle is a true representative of that era.  It is built on a two-hundred-meter high mountain spire and is surrounded by a dense forest and river.  The picturesque nature, striking lines and clarity of forms made it one of the most unique, beautiful and popular castles not only in Germany, but also in Europe.  In addition, the 34th generation of the Yelnz family still lives here. </p><p>  <strong>Levenburg Castle</strong> </p><p>  This castle of Germany is unique.  His project was conceived as a stylization of romantic medieval ruins.  Leo Castle arose as a result of love for the knightly era of William IX.  It is this building that experts rank among the most important historical monuments.  As a rule, Levenburg is mistaken for a neo-Gothic building.  Columns and towers, massive walls and beautiful nature amaze many tourists.  Unfortunately, during the Second World War the castle was badly damaged.  Now it has been completely reconstructed, and it appears before the modern generation in all its beauty! </p>

    <p>  A beautiful building on the river Rhine is famous for its history and beauty.  Stolzenfels was built in 1259 at the initiative of Archbishop Trier Arnold II.  There were often hostilities, so the structure suffered from destruction as well as the rest of the castles of Germany.  The map fell out so that during the long <span>Thirty Years War the</span> castle was often used as a cover, as well as a control point of capture by warring parties.  In 1689, it was almost completely destroyed and lay abandoned for about 150 years.  Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia restored Stolzenfels, and since 2002, UNESCO has ranked this medieval castle as part of the World Heritage Site.  All these castles are admirable, and if you have the opportunity to visit Germany, do not forget to look at each place and take a few photos.  German castles are more than history ... </p>
