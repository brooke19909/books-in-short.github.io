This also applies to the refrigerator.  Such a device has many parts, each of which performs its function.  Such a malfunction is quite common in modern devices when only one camera is working (refrigerator or freezer).  A similar problem arises not only in two-compressor devices that have an autonomous cooling system, but also in single-compressor devices. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the refrigerator does not work and the freezer works" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1604049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Why <span>doesn't the refrigerator work,</span> and does the freezer work?  Sometimes you can solve this issue yourself, without a repairman.  But if the reason lies in the failure of the cooling system, then you can not do without the help of a specialist.  Indeed, if a person does not have special knowledge, then it is unlikely that he will be able to cope with such a malfunction, which requires first of all professional diagnostics.  It should be understood that if the freezer functions smoothly, and the refrigerator does not cool at all, then this can indicate serious damage.  Today, there are several reasons why the refrigerator may not work in principle.  But for a complete understanding, it is necessary to have at least superficial knowledge of how such an aggregate functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Diagnose a problem </h2><p>  As a rule, it is almost impossible to immediately notice a breakdown.  After all, the indicator of temperature preservation is not the refrigerator itself, but the freezer, which works without interruption.  It becomes clear that the device does not work, only when the rotten smell of spoiled products begins to come from it, which certainly will not please any housewife. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why does not the refrigerator freeze and the freezer is working" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1604052.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Do not delay with solving the problem.  It is necessary to find out immediately why the refrigerator does not work, and the freezer works.  The first thing to do is to eliminate the most obvious causes of the malfunction. </p><h2>  Badly closed refrigerator door </h2><p>  From the inside and between the metal layers, as a rule, each manufacturer puts a rubber base.  Often a situation occurs when a hard object or even food debris can get under the rubber, which prevents complete tightness.  It is also recommended to check the rubber seal for mechanical damage.  This may be the reason why the <span>refrigerator</span> does <span>not freeze,</span> and the freezer is working.  If a significant defect is detected, the <span>seal is replaced.</span> </p><h2>  Room temperature is too high </h2><p>  A similar reason most often applies to models with a single camera, when the device is located next to a hot spring, and the cooling process is used to the maximum.  Under such conditions, soon the electronics of the device begin to malfunction in the program and cease to work properly.  This is the reason why the <span>refrigerator</span> does not <span>cool,</span> and the freezer works. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

It is also recommended to choose the time and thoroughly defrost the refrigerator throughout the day.  Then you need to turn on the main mode again and observe the operation of the device.  If the situation does not change, you will have to call the wizard.

    <h2>  Freon leak or mechanical damage to the cooling system </h2><p>  This is a fairly common <span>reason why the refrigerator</span> does not chill, and the freezer works.  The most common mistake that many consumers make is not to defrost the refrigerator, but to clean the ice with a sharp object.  In this case, it is worth remembering that sooner or later the help of a qualified specialist will be a must. </p><h2>  The temperature sensor of the refrigerator is out of order </h2><p>  Disruption of the sensor may be caused by drops of liquid or food debris.  Also, often this part ceases to function due to factory defects.  And not necessarily it will appear in the first days of work.  As a rule, only the master can diagnose such a cause of failure.  If the cause of the malfunction is why the refrigerator does not work, and the freezer is working, the user cannot be installed independently, it is better to hurry up with a specialist call.  Since during this period, the compressor runs to the limit, which can lead to new breakdowns of the device. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the refrigerator does not chill and the freezer is working" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1604048.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to statistics, most often the refrigerator stops working due to violations of the operating rules, and only then due to factory defects or component breakdowns related to their service life.  It is only possible to independently inspect the refrigerator for visible defects, and in other situations it is necessary to call a specialist as soon as possible. </p><h2>  What to do if the refrigerator has stopped freezing? </h2><p>  As soon as it became known about a possible breakdown, since the temperature inside the chamber began to increase significantly, it is worth doing the following: </p><ul><li>  Analyze and observe the behavior of the refrigerator in order to understand which compartment is still not working: a refrigerator or a freezer. </li><li>  Check the presence of strongly heating elements located next to the refrigerator.  This is especially important in the winter, when the heating system works in the apartment, which becomes the reason why the refrigerator does not work, and the freezer works. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Check if the gum located on the door is intact and there are no foreign objects or food crumbs inside it.  According to the masters, the wear of the rubber seal is the most common reason why the freezer in the Atlant refrigerator or the refrigerator does not work, since not always high-quality raw materials are used for manufacturing. </li><li>  Find out if the back wall of the refrigerator compartment is deformed by mechanical damage.  Check for rust on visible elements of the cooling system or other traces of the oxidation process. </li></ul>
