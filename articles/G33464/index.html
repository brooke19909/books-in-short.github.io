Against the background of most smartphones, the filling of this device looks rather modest, but its capabilities are quite enough for ordinary tasks: making calls, accessing the Internet, using GPS, transmitting data, and more.  The low price of the device makes it very affordable, which is the main trump card of the brainchild of a South Korean company. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

The smartphone is available in three colors: silver, blue and white.  As the material for the manufacture of the case, plastic was chosen, there is also a metal edging.  The design does not play and does not creak.

    <p>  There is a display on the front of the device.  Above it is a speaker for conversations, under it there are three central keys: one regular and two touch keys.  The physical button allows you to enter the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo menu, the touch button on the right is responsible for the ‚Äúback‚Äù action, and the left button brings up a small menu consisting of three items: ‚ÄúWish List‚Äù, ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the back is the camera lens and speaker.  On the left side of the device there is a rocker that adjusts the volume, on the right - the on / off key of the device.  At the top is a 3.5 mm headset jack, at the bottom is a micro-USB connector and a microphone. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the case is quite smooth and slides heavily in the hands, so it is best to purchase covers for the smartphone to protect the device.  A cover with a flip down will do just fine with this task.  In addition to aesthetic beauty, this accessory reliably protects the case from scratches and any physical damage: scuffs, cracks, etc. </p><p>  The overall dimensions of the model are 57.8 √ó 104.95 √ó 11.8 with a weight of 100 g. The device turned out to be very compact and easily fits in any pocket. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo screen reaches 3 inches with a resolution of 240x320 pixels - too modest even for a budget model.  PPI is 133 pixels per inch.  The display has a conventional TFT-matrix.  Viewing angles and brightness leave much to be desired: the screen fades in the sun, but even with ordinary lighting, its colors look pale and nondescript.  Watching pictures, photographs or videos on such a display will not be particularly pleasant, although the graininess is not striking in the eye.  Although the smartphone is a good fit, say, to view any documents, access the Internet or use important applications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  It would be naive to expect some impressive filling indicators from this budget apparatus, and yet it cannot be said that the characteristics are completely unacceptable.  The model runs on the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean platform and is equipped with a rather weak single-core processor with a clock frequency of 850 MHz, the core type is Cortex-A9.  Also upset is the low rate of RAM - only 512 MB.  Winchester provides the user with 4 GB of data storage, which can be expanded using microSD memory cards up to 32 GB in size.  The gadget is presented in two variations: Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo GT S5312 with two SIM cards and GT S5310 - with one.  In addition to the number of slots for SIM cards, these models are no different. </p><p>  With these <span>characteristics, the Samsung Galaxy</span> Pocket Neo slows down even with the usual use of the menu, what can we say about downloading applications or web pages.  A nice feature - the presence of multi-touch, however, recognizes the sensor with just two fingers and does not respond to touch in the best way.  However, this is enough to scale the page on the Web, increase or decrease the size of the GPS map, or play games that require the simultaneous use of two fingers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The device has a 2 megapixel camera.  This resolution is not enough to get even medium quality pictures.  Plus, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of autofocus and flash.  The camera menu has standard and unremarkable features.  With bright lighting on the street, you can make a good shot, which then will be tolerantly look on the small screen of the device.  However, for printing, as well as for scanning on a monitor or TV, such a photo will not work: the blurriness and blurryness caused by the lack of autofocus and a small number of pixels looks awful on large screens.  The developers cheated on the device with a flash, so taking a picture in the dark or in low light conditions will not work.  Fans of selfies and skype communication will be saddened by the lack of a front camera. </p>

    <p>  With all the drawbacks of optics, some consolation is the possibility of video recording, but the quality of such videos is extremely unsatisfactory, and the image itself is very slow: the low processing of the number of frames per second affects. </p><p>  Among other entertainment, the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo phone has a media player that can play mp3s and videos of various formats, but the quality of the video and sound is unlikely to leave the user satisfied.  For radio lovers, the gadget is equipped with an FM receiver.  For data transfer in the smartphone are provided <br>  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Wi-Fi hotspot and Blootooth 4.0 (A2DP).  There is also a GPS navigator, various Google services and support for 3G networks / </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Due to the weak filling, the device is able to work only with software that requires a minimum amount of resources from the system.  But even such applications sometimes slow down.  The gadget does a good job of working on the Internet, although some pages open for a long time.  Also, the filling allows you to effectively plan routes on the GPS navigator and use other functions. </p><h2>  Games </h2><p>  As for the games, even the owner of such a modest device as the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo GT S5312 will not feel a deficit in them, since every day developers release more and more entertainment with a variety of system requirements for gadgets of all categories.  The device launches 2D projects very well, although the graphics look too pixelated and not particularly attractive.  The device is also able to work with voluminous games that are not particularly demanding on hardware, but most of them will slow down and fail.  Hoping to launch top toys is not worth it at all. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo smartphone has a 1200 mAh lithium-ion battery.  At first glance, the indicator is very low, but it is worth remembering that both the display and the filling of the device do not differ in impressive characteristics, and therefore the device will last quite a while without recharging, even when working with applications, using the Internet and watching videos.  In talk mode, the gadget can work up to 6 hours, which is not such a bad result. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo, whose price fluctuates around 2500‚Äì3200 rubles, is a lightweight, miniature and affordable smartphone, quite suitable for undemanding users.  Despite all its shortcomings and meager technical characteristics, the device is capable of launching many useful applications, providing stable Internet work and high-quality data transfer.  Also, the device has a good ‚Äúsurvivability‚Äù, which is why it will have to be recharged quite rarely, which is a pretty significant advantage for business and busy people.  For those who prefer to use the phone as a full-fledged multimedia device, this device, of course, is not suitable, however, for minimalists in functionality, it can very well become a good assistant for a low cost. </p>

    <h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  User reviews about this device are very controversial.  Many lack screen pixels.  Although the display itself reaches only 3 inches, still a modest resolution of 240x320 is too small for normal operation. </p><p>  As for the multi-touch, almost all owners of the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo S5310 criticize it: in particular, a weak response is mentioned.  Some say that in the cold, the sensor may not work at all. </p><p>  As for the multimedia component, opinions differ.  Some believe that for such a price, a 2 megapixel camera is enough, and a music player produces songs in pretty decent quality.  Others criticize the low resolution of the optics, the lack of autofocus and the blurriness of the pictures taken.  They also consider the quality of the music player unacceptable even with good headphones;  mentioned low volume when using a headset. </p><p>  Owners complain about a poorly implemented keyboard.  Because of the small keys and display, typing is sometimes almost impossible.  However, it is noted that the T9 setting corrects this drawback. </p><p>  The design of the device to the liking of most.  The phone was assembled very high quality, and the developers did a good job on the appearance of the device, which is why it is great for users of various categories.  True, many say that the surface of the gadget is rather slippery, and it is best to use cases for a smartphone.  Another plus is the fact that fingerprints and possible scratches on the case are almost invisible. </p>
