  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Embroidery of flowers with ribbons: patterns, features and interesting ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Embroidering flowers with ribbons is a whole separate art, where the master requires not only the ability to sew, you need to arrange the material correctly, be able to alternate the thickness of satin ribbons, choose the shades and structure of the fabric strips.  Flowers in nature have a very different shape, which must be accurately conveyed in the picture.  Novice masters must first practice on simple colors, to understand how to give the necessary shape to the petal.  The stalk is often made of embroidery threads in ribbons with embroidered flowers, but there are options for making thread-like stems from thin green satin ribbons. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to start work, how to mark details of a picture on fabric.  The presented photographs and diagrams will help novice masters quickly understand the principle of the work. </p><h2>  A simple flower with many petals </h2><p>  Beginners are encouraged to learn the embroidery of flowers with ribbons from training exercises.  A simple flower, in which the petals grow from the center in different directions, is made of a thin ribbon, 0.5-0.6 mm will be enough.  The embroidery needle is taken with a wide eye.  You can make markings on the fabric, draw a circle in the middle with a simple pencil and put dots or small crosses at the ends of the petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon flower" class="if uuid-2524285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524285.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidery of flowers with ribbons begins from the center on the wrong side of the fabric.  The edge of the tape is perforated in the center, and the rest is then threaded into the ear.  Thus, you will not have to tie a knot, and the tape will not fall out of the hole.  A needle is inserted from the inside so that the point passes through the drawn circle.  A strip of tape is drawn through the hole and then, having measured the desired length of the petal, the needle is inserted into the middle of the tape from the outside.  After tightening, a small fold of tissue forms at the end of the petal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then work continues on all the other petals until there is empty space.  The number of petals depends on the thickness of the tape.  After the flower is made, the ribbon at the bottom of the fabric is tied in a knot and trimmed with scissors. </p><h2>  How to make hyacinth </h2><p>  Embroidery of flowers with ribbons implies the image of different colors.  It differs from other hyacinth manufacturing options.  This is an elongated flower with many small elements.  For embroidery take a thin satin ribbon.  Color can be taken white, yellow, pink, purple, lilac and even blue.  Thread the tape into the fabric and then pull it into the eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon hyacinth" class="if uuid-2524288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524288.jpg"></div><p>  The stitches are fine, at an angle.  First, the thread on the back is held upward on the diagonal, then from the right up to the connection point.  The next step in embroidering flowers with satin ribbons is a small stitch in the center from top to bottom at the top of the resulting corner. </p><p>  Further, in this way, work continues until the hyacinth reaches the desired height. </p><h2>  Schemes for the production of flowers and stalk </h2><p>  For beautiful embroidery of flowers with ribbons, it is necessary to learn how to make thin stems.  How to make the petals is clearly visible on the image diagram with a red ribbon, and the stalk execution pattern is shown green on the right. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew ribbons" class="if uuid-2524350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524350.jpg"></div><p>  You can practice on a piece of fabric with a thin tape, dressed in a familiar way into a needle.  The first stitch is done simply up the pencil-drawn line.  The next starts from the middle, while <span>the previous</span> stitch moves sideways.  On the scheme of embroidery with color ribbons, it is clear what should result. </p><h2>  Volumetric Petal Scheme </h2><p>  For making lush, voluminous flowers from satin ribbons, in addition to a needle with a wide eye, you will need a thin wand.  You can use a toothpick or a plastic stick to clean your ears (only first remove cotton swabs at the edges).  Marking on the fabric is done with a simple pencil, the center point of the flower is indicated and the extreme points of the petals are marked with crosses.  The fabric is not too thin, you can take a tape 1 cm wide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make embroidery elements" class="if uuid-2524347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524347.jpg"></div><p>  The tape is inserted, as usual, from the back of the fabric to a central point.  Then the loop stretches to the length of the petal, bends around the stick and folds in half, and the needle again stretches to the center of the flower.  The toothpick not only holds the fabric in position, but also evens out the material of the craft.  The central point is decorated with a bead or pebble so that holes in the fabric are not visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How do leaflets </h2><p>  In embroidery with ribbons of bouquets of flowers, not only petals and stems are used, but also many leaves.  Consider, using the diagram above, how to embroider sheets of a standard oval shape with pointed ends. </p><p>  Before you start, be sure to draw the outline of the part with a simple pencil.  Acting in the order of numbers from ‚Äúa‚Äù to ‚Äúd‚Äù, a beautiful, neat leaf will turn out from a thin ribbon of green.  In this way, you can create a more elongated version, for example, for willow. </p><h2>  Chamomile </h2><p>  The knowledge gained will help beginners to make a bouquet of daisies with embroidery on fabric.  You will need a white satin ribbon with a width of 0.6 mm, a green ribbon for leaves with a width of 0.8 mm and the thinnest ribbon of yellow or orange color, a needle with a wide eye and a thin stick to align the ribbon loops in the middle of each flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chamomile in many ways" class="if uuid-2524321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524321.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidery begins with a central circle of daisies.  Each tiny loop must be aligned with a toothpick.  The height of all elements must be the same. </p><p>  Then work begins on the white petals.  There is nothing complicated here, the fabric of the tape is simply stretched with stitches of the same length from the middle to the marked outer circle.  Thin stems fall down from each flower, and the gaps are filled with leaflets made in pair stitches from the middle of the strip to its edges. </p><h2>  Terry flower </h2><p>  To create such an original flower with embroidery you will need two types of satin ribbons.  Wide pink and thinner lilac strips of fabric.  A large flower is embroidered with stitches from the center to the edges.  Then along the outer edge of each petal is a fringe of thin tape.  From the back of the fabric, a needle is pushed through the edge of the petal and a very small stitch is drawn.  Then, with the help of a toothpick, a loop is made and the center point of the completed stitch is pierced with a needle and the fabric is tightened tightly.  Such curls on each petal need to be made at least three pieces.  A pebble or bead is sewn in the center of the flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="terry flower" class="if uuid-2524369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524369.jpg"></div><p>  The buds are made only from a thin lilac ribbon in the form of a semicircle.  Edges are made in a similar way.  Leaflets and sepals are made of green ribbon with simple stitches (from 2 to 3 pieces). </p><h2>  Gerberas </h2><p>  The petals in such embroidery alternate with burgundy and red.  Work begins on the central part, consisting of small loops.  In the manufacture of the middle for chamomile, the manufacturing technology has already been described, however, the difference from this from the previous option is that each loop is turned over to the opposite side before tightening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gerbera of two colors" class="if uuid-2524310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524310.jpg"></div><p>  Each element of the central circle is twisted and more voluminous.  Then the flower itself is sewn with stitches, however, the stitches are sewn from the outer drawn circle to the center.  Moreover, at the end, the tape bends inward again and the atlas fabric in the center pierces with a needle.  In order for the flower to have a larger volume, the stitches of the petals are not tightened tightly, but are looser. </p><h2>  How to start a complicated craft </h2><p>  If the work is quite simple, you can perform the necessary stitches by eye, that is, do not draw a pattern.  However, if there are a lot of details in the picture, they alternate with different elements, then you need to draw a future bouquet first on a piece of paper, and then transfer the image with a simple pencil to the main fabric for embroidery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for embroidery flowers" class="if uuid-2524326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524326.jpg"></div><p>  First, large parts are embroidered, then the voids are filled with small elements. </p><h2>  Picture "Wildflowers" </h2><p>  <span>Embroidering ribbons of a</span> large picture is a laborious task and requires considerable perseverance.  After creating the image layout, think over the color gamut of all the details, what thickness the tape will need for this or that element, how to fill the middle of the colors, which fabric to choose as the background. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="picture with flowers from ribbons" class="if uuid-2524276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2524276.jpg"></div><p>  After the detailed master-class for embroidering with color ribbons given in the article, even a novice master will be able to make such a picture as in the photo above. </p><p>  Since all the elements are made voluminous, then pick up a wooden or plastic stick to fix the petals of the desired size.  The leaves are made with simple long stitches. </p><p>  Try to create original crafts with your own hands.  Such a picture can be hung on the wall in the living room or presented to a friend for her birthday.  Good luck in your work! </p>
