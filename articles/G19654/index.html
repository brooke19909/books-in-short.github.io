  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mysteries of the Planet - Cambrian Period</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to official science, life on our planet originated about three billion years ago in the form of simple organisms - microscopic isolated rods, filamentous formations, spherical and polygonal unicellular algae.  These organisms could exist only in water and only in warm climates. </p><p>  In general, very few fossil remains from the Precambrian period have survived to this day.  Evolution seemed to be slowed down from the moment of the birth of life by three billion years, changing and improving only existing types of algae and microscopic organisms. </p><p>  However, 580 million years ago came a turning point in the history of evolution - the Cambrian period.  Its duration in the framework of the Earth‚Äôs life is short - 80 million years.  It was then that suddenly and almost simultaneously, an amazing variety of invertebrate species appeared.  More importantly, in a short time, living organisms were able to acquire a solid calcareous skeleton. </p><p>  The multiple biological forms of Cambria became the forerunners of all types of modern life, including humans.  This one-time and abrupt appearance of a variety of species is known as the Cambrian Explosion. </p><p>  Land at that time was an absolute desert, all life was concentrated only in water.  Earthly continents had a completely different location: for example, on the site of Greenland and North America, there was the mainland Lavrentia, south was the Brazilian mainland.  Arabia, Africa and Madagascar represented a single African continent, in the north was the Russian continent, separated by a deep strait from the Siberian and Chinese continents.  In the south was a giant Australian mainland, which subsequently broke up into India, Australia and a number of islands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Cambrian period, some modern mountains formed: the North Appalachian Mountains, the Sayan <span>Range, the mountains of</span> Chingiztau (Kazakhstan). </p><p>  Life bloomed rapidly in the water: trilobites, radiolarians, sponges, and brachiopods arose and settled.  Archeocytes appeared - multicellular animals, which were a cross between a coral and a sponge.  They were massively attached to the bottom of reservoirs, forming a kind of <span>coral reef.</span>  By the end of the Cambrian, they became extinct. </p><p>  Trilobites, primitive arthropods similar to modern woodlice, flourished especially during this time.  They had a flat disc-shaped body with chitinous armor, divided into 45-50 segments, and many legs. </p><p>  Closer to the end of the Cambrian, the first armored vertebrates, prototypes of fish, arose. </p><p>  So, without any transitional binder forms and intermediate species, from bacteria and simple unicellular organisms suddenly on Earth a lot of invertebrate and vertebrate species, prototypes of modern forms.  The Cambrian period represents a mysterious evolutionary leap in the history of the Earth. </p><p>  Most often, scientists attribute this revolutionary event to the critical accumulation of oxygen in the ocean in the air, as well as an increase in the washout of salts from land and an increase in the concentration of calcium and magnesium in water.  The chemical <span>composition of water</span> has changed so much that the organisms that live there have gained a ton of opportunities for species to change and form. </p><p>  It is also believed that around this time the Earth made a sudden revolution of almost 90 degrees, due to which there was a sharp displacement of all the continents, tectonic shifts and the formation of a modern relief of the earth's surface.  This also influenced the formation of new species and adaptations for survival. </p><p>  The Earth‚Äôs development periods met many disasters: for example, almost simultaneously and without exception, dinosaurs 65 million years ago disappeared.  And in the Permian era, for a short period, almost 95% of marine inhabitants died out at a time - it was 245 million years ago. </p><p>  But among all these mysteries, only the Cambrian period is distinguished by its creativity, and not the destruction of species.  Opponents of the evolutionary approach see the mystery of the Cambrian explosion as confirmation of the divine origin of modern life forms, including humans. </p>
