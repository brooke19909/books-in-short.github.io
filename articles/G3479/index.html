This primarily relates to automotive optics, which are based on <span>halogen lamps.</span>  This is an affordable and familiar light source, so not many people decide to find an alternative.  Nevertheless, xenon devices can be a good choice when changing headlights.  They differ in many advantages, including high radiation brightness indicators.  However, in its pure form, such lamps are rare.  And here it is important to answer the question of what is biksenon.  These are headlights with <span>xenon lamps that</span> can provide both low and high beam. </p>

    <h2>  Bi-Xenon device </h2><p>  The lamps are based on the device of classic xenon, so there is no ordinary incandescent filament in them.  This light source was replaced by electrodes, between which an electric arc-shaped discharge is formed.  Actually, it provides a bright glow, for which bi-xenon is appreciated.  The headlights contain an ellipsoidal flask with gas and metal salts.  This mixture is constantly exposed to pressure.  During operation, the lamp forms a beam of light, which surpasses standard halogen lamps in terms of radiation power.  For this reason, in some cases, the headlights are supplemented with special lenses or reflectors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since there is no incandescent filament, it is impossible to obtain a transition in the low and high beam modes when using ordinary xenon.  To understand what bixenon is, you should again turn to the reflector.  Thanks to its function, it is possible to use different light delivery modes.  The traditional design provides for the installation of two flasks in one base.  The reflector, in turn, plays the role of a curtain, the switching of which allows you to change the dipped beam to the main beam. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of Bi-Xenon </h2><p>  If we talk about technical and operational advantages, the first thing that is noted is a wider light beam compared to halogen, the supply of radiation with a warm spectrum, low power consumption and stability of the lens.  Bixenon significantly improves the quality of the glow in bad weather and at night.  Again, compared to halogen lamps, xenon practically does not produce heating.  As a result, car headlights do not overheat, and the dirt on the surface does not dry, which is convenient in the maintenance of optics. </p>

    <p>  In addition to savings in terms of energy saving, the owner can also expect to reduce costs due to the durability of the lamps.  Here we must remember what bi-xenon is from the point of view of the device.  This is a light source that does not have an incandescent filament, that is, the device does not burn out.  For comparison: the operational life of xenon headlights reaches 3000 hours, and halogen provides only 400 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bixenon disadvantages </h2><p>  The main part of the negative factors in the use of this type of lamp refers to low-quality devices, which were also incorrectly installed.  In such cases, there is a risk of blinding oncoming cars if the background illumination exceeds acceptable values.  External defects are also common, which nullify all the advantages of a lens.  Bixenon in this case can distort color reproduction, providing rainbow light.  This is a significant point, since the spectrum for car headlights is very important for perception.  For example, the predominance of blue and purple hues does not allow drivers to quickly adapt to areas with poor lighting.  And this, not to mention possible deviations in the direction of the light beam.  In proprietary optics, for example, the <span>electric arc is</span> oriented in a strict direction, providing stable and even light.  But, when planning to buy high-quality xenon, you should prepare for another unpleasant factor - high cost. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2>

    <p>  Lamps of this type are presented in different versions, distinguished primarily by structural nuances of execution.  The most common two-capsule bi-xenon.  In this case, the working element is not divided into two flasks to ensure two modes of operation, but into capsules enclosed in a lamp.  Such models are distinguished by precise focusing, high reliability and minimal mobility of component parts.  Two-bulb devices have already been considered as an example of an approach to enabling light switching.  This option is good as an illustration of what biksenon and its basic design are, but in practice it is not the best solution.  Firstly, the combination of flasks does not allow to achieve good focusing, and secondly, such lamps differ in large dimensions, which causes inconvenience during installation. </p><p>  There is also a hybrid version in which a halogen light source and a <span>discharge lamp are</span> combined <span>.</span>  Bixenon is implemented in this way: the first element is responsible for the passing beam, and the second - for the far radiation.  But according to users, this is the worst use of this type of optics, because the devices quickly fail due to differences in the operating parameters of halogen and xenon. </p><h2>  How to choose a lamp? </h2>

    <p>  The right choice involves taking into account two important criteria - the compatibility of the design of the device with the socket and compliance with voltage requirements.  As for the design, first of all pay attention to the standard of the cap.  This, for example, may be Bi-Xenon H4, which is widely distributed in Russia.  Also found are the sizes of the HB, <span>D2R, D2C</span> and others.  It will be useful to evaluate the quality of the compound.  This is a flask filling on a synthetic basis, which must comply with the standards of resistance to thermal expansion.  Now you can go to the voltage indicators, which in the case of Bi-Xenon vary from 8 to 18 V. This value depends on the ignition unit, through which not only the lamp will be lit, but its stable operation. </p><h2>  Manufacturers and prices </h2><p>  Today, Chinese manufacturers dominate the automotive optics market, so you should be careful when choosing your products.  The most high-quality models are offered by Osram and Hella.  These manufacturers work on the basis of Philips patents, so their original lamps should not cause doubts in quality.  In terms of cost, of course, these are not cheap products, but a long service life will be guaranteed.  In the highest segment, Bi-Xenon H4 costs about 2.5-3 thousand rubles.  Less attractive quality options are estimated at 1-1.5 thousand rubles.  Similar offers can be found in the line of the company Sho-Me, which is also widely represented in the domestic car market. </p>

    <h2>  Installing Bi-Xenon </h2><p>  First you need to remove the old halogen lamps.  After removing the headlight covers, disconnect the contacts from the glow element and pull them out.  Bixenon is installed in the appropriate socket and is fixed with a special spring.  But it is important to perform this operation so that the wires from the lamp pass through the spring and exit into the engine compartment.  Depending on the kit purchased, the installation of bi-xenon may require a hole in the plugs of the headlights to pass the cable through.  Next, a place is selected for the ignition unit.  The best solution would be a section that is protected from moisture and located as close to the headlights as possible.  The fastening of this module can be done with a special clamp or with adhesive tape.  After that, the lamps are connected to the ignition unit, which, in turn, is connected to the main electronics of the car. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Feedback from motorists using xenon is generally positive.  Drivers note pronounced indicators of brightness, as well as the stability of the radiation that forms biksenon.  The price of such optics, which averages 1.5-2 thousand rubles, of course, scares away many motorists.  On the other hand, clearly directed light at night and in detail distinguishable objects on the road in fog compensate for financial costs.  The main thing is to make the right choice of lamps during the purchase process and not miscalculate during the installation. </p>
