The accessory is developed on the basis of technologies that reproduce low-frequency resonating sounds, which provides excellent bass sound in musical compositions of any direction. </p><p>  High-quality low-frequency sounds can be reproduced thanks to the Advanced Vibe Structure technology used in Sony headphones.  It is based on a specially created acoustic volume inside the earphone that naturally amplifies low frequencies.  Thanks to this development, the company managed to create a lineup of Sony Extra Bass headphones, which are characterized by high quality, dynamics and purity of reproduced low frequencies and bass. </p><p>  For a complete immersion in music, comfortable headphones with high-quality and excellent sound are required.  The new generation of Sony headphones was developed taking into account these foundations, which were laid down in the accessory design concept: the MDR-XB generation is lighter, thinner and more compact, created using the highest quality materials.  Models of this series can be used both for leisure and for traveling: Extra Bass headphones provide the necessary level of comfort, quality and sound style even during long listening to music. </p>

    <h2>  Headphones MDR-XB450BV </h2><p>  The case of the model is completely plastic, but the original radial pattern on the cups and the difference in textures give the impression that metal was used to create the headphones.  Despite this, many users say that I would like to add real metal to the design. </p><p>  The wire bends easily and does not get tangled during operation.  The design and the curved shape of the plug allow you to connect headphones to any gadget.  A rather stiff headband often causes excessive pressure on the head while listening to music, so it is recommended to try on a model before buying.  However, the headphones are adjusted very quickly and easily, which allows you to adjust them to individual preferences. </p><p>  In the instructions for Sony Extra Bass headphones, their features are noted: inside one of the cups there is a compartment for two AAA batteries that power the gadget in vibration mode.  It is activated by pressing a special key on another bowl, next to which is the vibration intensity regulator.  Both elements are easy to grope. </p><p>  A rather original solution with batteries is very convenient, but it has its drawback: the batteries discharge very quickly.  Those who prefer to constantly use the vibration mode will have to carry extra batteries with them all the time. </p><p>  The intensity of vibration and bass is adjustable depending on the listening content.  It is desirable to reduce the effect for heavy genres with low frequencies, for pop music, on the contrary, increase it.  However, if desired, the model can be turned into ordinary headphones, completely disabling vibration mode. </p><p>  Headphones have a great bass effect, comparable to that in the sound of powerful car speakers.  Such features, however, are not for everybody: the fastidious music lover can find flaws in the rather high-quality sound of this model. </p><p>  For the cost of these headphones, you can purchase a more professional analogue from a professional point of view, however, vibration modes and emphasis at low frequencies allow familiar compositions to sound in a new way, immersed in the bright world of music. </p>

    <h2>  Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB450B </h2><p>  Fans of energetic musical styles and bright basses will enjoy this model of headphones - the effect of listening to music in them is magnificent.  Despite the fact that this version of the acoustic accessory is more targeted at the youth audience, it has a very strict and concise design, coupled with a non-detachable cable, and the headset for mobile gadgets is not supplied.
