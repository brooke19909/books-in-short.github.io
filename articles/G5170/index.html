They have a certain charge.  In another way, electricity is the energy that is produced by movement, as well as the lighting that appears after energy is received.  The term was introduced by the scientist William Gilbert in 1600.  When conducting experiments with amber, the ancient Greek Thales discovered that a charge was acquired by a mineral.  "Amber" in Greek means "electron."  Hence the name came from. </p>

    <h2>  Electricity is ... </h2><p>  Thanks to electricity, an electric field is created around current conductors or bodies with a charge.  Through it, it becomes possible to act on other bodies, which also have a certain charge. </p><p>  Everyone knows that charges are positive and negative.  Of course, this is a conditional division, but according to the prevailing history they continue to be designated. </p><p>  If the bodies are charged equally, they will repel, and if in different ways, they will be attracted. </p><p>  The essence of electricity is not only the creation of an electric field.  A magnetic field also appears.  Therefore, there is a kinship between them. </p><p>  More than a century later, in 1729, Stephen Gray established that there are bodies that have very high resistance.  They are able to conduct <span>electric current.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, thermodynamics is most concerned with electricity.  But the quantum properties of electromagnetism are studied by quantum thermodynamics. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  It is hardly possible to name a specific person who discovered the phenomenon.  After all, research continues to this day, new properties are revealed.  But in the science that we are taught at school, several names are called. </p><p>  It is believed that the first who became interested in electricity was the <span>philosopher Thales,</span> who lived in ancient Greece.  It was he who rubbed amber on his coat and watched the bodies begin to attract. </p><p>  Then Aristotle studied eels that hit enemies, as was later understood, by electricity. </p><p>  Pliny later wrote about the electrical properties of the resin. </p><p>  A number of interesting discoveries were assigned to the doctor of the English Queen, William Gilbert. </p><p>  In the mid-seventeenth century, after the term "electricity" became known, the burgomaster Otto von Guericke invented an electrostatic machine. </p><p>  In the eighteenth century, Franklin created a whole theory of the phenomenon, which says that electricity is a fluid or an intangible fluid. </p><p>  In addition to the mentioned people, such famous names as: </p><ul><li>  Pendant; </li><li>  Galvani; </li><li>  Volt; </li><li>  Faraday </li><li>  Maxwell </li><li>  Ampere; </li><li>  Lodygin; </li><li>  Edison </li><li>  Hertz; </li><li>  Thomson; </li><li>  Claude. </li></ul><p>  Despite their undeniable contribution, Nicola Tesla is rightfully recognized as the most powerful of scientists in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nikola Tesla </h2>

    <p>  The scientist was born in the family of a Serbian Orthodox priest in the territory of present-day Croatia.  At six years old, the boy discovered a wonderful phenomenon when he was playing with a black cat: her back suddenly lit up with a strip of blue, which was accompanied by sparks when touched.  So the boy first learned what "electricity" is.  This determined his whole future life. </p><p>  Scientists own inventions and scientific works on: </p><ul><li>  alternating current; </li><li>  on air; </li><li>  resonance; </li><li>  field theory; </li><li>  radio and much more. </li></ul><p>  Many associate the event, called the <span>Tunguska meteorite,</span> with the name of Nikola Tesla, believing that the huge explosion in Siberia was caused not by the fall of a cosmic body, but by the experiment conducted by a scientist. </p><h2>  Natural electricity </h2><p>  At one time in scientific circles there was an opinion that electricity does not exist in nature.  But this version was refuted when Franklin established the electrical nature of lightning. </p><p>  It is thanks to her that amino acids began to be synthesized, which means that life appeared.  It has been established that movements, respiration and other processes occurring in the body arise from a nerve impulse, which has an electrical nature. </p>

    <p>  Electricity is connected almost everywhere today.  Modern man cannot imagine life without him.  With the help of electricity, lighting is provided, information is transmitted by telephone, radio, television ... Due to it, such vehicles as trams, trolleybuses, electric trains, subway trains operate.  Electric cars appear and boldly declare themselves. </p><p>  If there is a power outage in the house, then a person often becomes helpless in various matters, since even household appliances work with this energy. </p><h2>  The unsolved secrets of Tesla </h2><p>  The properties of the phenomenon have been studied since ancient times.  Mankind has learned how to conduct electricity using various sources.  This greatly facilitated their life.  Nevertheless, in the future, people still have a lot of discoveries related to electricity. </p><p>  Some of them, maybe even already been made famous by Nikola Tesla, but then were classified or destroyed by him.  Biographers claim that at the end of his life, the scientist burned most of the records with his own hands, realizing that humanity is not ready for them and can harm itself, using its discoveries as the most powerful weapon. </p><p>  But according to another version, it is believed that some of the records were seized by US intelligence.  The history of the US Navy destroyer Eldridge is known, which not only had the ability to be invisible to radar, but also moved instantly in space.  There is evidence of an experiment after which part of the crew then died, the other part disappeared, and the survivors went crazy. </p><p>  One way or another, it is clear that all the secrets of electricity have not yet been revealed.  Therefore, humanity is morally not yet ready for this. </p>
