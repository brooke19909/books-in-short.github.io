Conditions for obtaining a loan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no secret that, applying to a bank for a loan, a potential borrower expects a positive decision on the application.  But, having faced lenders at least once, citizens come to the conclusion that obtaining a loan can be a problem.  Someone has difficulties with work or the wrong age, and someone managed to sin with a previous loan.  Which bank will give 100 percent credit in this situation?  In fact, there are organizations that are ready to meet customers in any circumstances. </p><h2>  Can a bank give a 100% guarantee of issuance? </h2><p>  Any bank that deals with lending to the population, expects to get their money back.  Moreover, with interest accrued under the agreement, because the creditor must also earn on his services.  Therefore, the solvency and responsibility of the future borrower - this is what is primarily important for the financial organization. </p>

    <p>  In this regard, few people can tell the future borrower where to get a loan so that they give.  If any lending institution unconditionally issued loans to anyone who wishes, regardless of age, employment, or other criteria, banks would no longer exist. </p><p>  The principles by which a financial institution makes a decision depend on the particular lender.  Dependence is also observed on specific lending programs.  So, express credit for the minimum amount does not carry much risk for the bank, and the probability of default is covered by the wild interest rate and insurance programs that can be paid immediately upon receipt of money.  In such circumstances, there is a chance of being unaccounted for and a bad credit history.  Which bank will give a loan in this case?  We will find out a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What factors guarantee a positive decision in any bank? </h2><p>  If the borrower manages to prepare for a loan in advance, he will not be too interested in the question of which bank will give a loan 100 percent.  Credit organizations present potential customers with requirements that are sufficient to meet: </p><ul><li>  the presence of originals of identity documents (passport of the Russian Federation and an additional document); </li><li>  certificate of income from the place of work (some banks allow not only 2-personal income tax, but also alternative options); </li><li>  contact persons to whom you can reach and inquire about the client; </li><li>  positive credit history. </li></ul><p>  In addition, specialists will definitely pay attention to other personal data of the client, which will testify to its stability and reliability.  If the borrower is married, does not change his place of residence or permanent residence for a long time, has not changed his job for a long time - most likely, responsibility can be expected from him. </p>

    <p>  If the borrower meets all of the above criteria, he has nothing to fear.  Most likely, the decision on his application will be approved, moreover, they will offer the most favorable conditions.  If the client has the opposite circumstances with which he came to the bank, then we will move on to the next paragraph of the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Which bank will give a loan 100 percent? </h2><p>  Despite the high demands of most lenders, it is still possible to identify several large financial organizations that are ready to meet almost any requirement.  Of course, these banks also have their limitations, but first of all, they relate to the age of the future borrower and his employment. </p><p>  The highest percentage of approval can be seen in banks: </p><ul><li>  "Russian standard". </li><li>  "Renaissance". </li><li>  Tinkoff </li><li>  Home Credit. </li><li>  "Trust". </li><li>  "Alfa Bank". </li><li>  "Orient Express Bank". </li></ul><p>  These credit organizations offer a fairly wide range of interest rates - from 15 to 75% per annum.  In these banks, there are chances for obtaining a loan from those customers who have some problems with their credit history.  The presence of open arrears, unfortunately, in any bank will be a 100 percent guarantee of failure. </p><h2>  Can I get a loan to the unemployed? </h2><p>  Which banks give loans to non-working?  To answer this question, you need to understand the very concept of ‚Äúunemployed‚Äù.  Citizens who are of working age and good health, but are not officially employed, have little chance of getting a loan.  The fact is that recently, the bank's security services have access to the data of the pension funds of the Russian Federation, and if necessary, the unemployed citizen and his real income are easily calculated. </p><p>  Another thing is pensioners.  Some financial institutions are ready to meet retirement age borrowers who only have a pension as permanent income.  Such institutions include a very large organization - Gazprombank.  In addition to loyalty, the applicant can count on preferential credit conditions.  Of course, if the credit history is all right. </p>

    <p>  Where to get a loan to the unemployed, in whose credit history sinners have appeared?  You can apply at Renaissance, Alfa-Bank or Sovcombank.  In these organizations, pensioners and other unemployed citizens will not be required a lot of certificates, but the interest rate, to put it mildly, leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  How much can you expect </h2><p>  Many borrowers who understand that their chances of a positive decision from the bank are small, ask themselves: ‚ÄúHow much can you take?‚Äù  Of course, there is never a lot of credit, but you will have to count on the minimum amount. </p><p>  This is especially true for unemployed customers.  In these cases, you rarely have to rely on an amount in excess of 200 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the generosity of the bank is directly proportional to the interest rate.  This is due to the degree of risk of the entire event for the lender.  So, at Gazprom, a pensioner can count on a rate of 11%, but at the same time no more than 50 thousand rubles will be able to get his hands on. </p>

    <p>  Those working citizens who, for various reasons, doubt their credit history and turn to banks with a high level of loyalty, for example, Tinkoff, are entitled to expect amounts up to 300 thousand rubles.  But even if the future borrower can provide 2-personal income tax and confirm his income, he should count on an interest rate of at least 39-47%. </p><h2>  Microfinance Organizations </h2><p>  There are several types of borrower stories at the <span>Credit Bureau</span> .  So, according to the classification of BKI, the bad or bad credit history is considered not the worst option.  Which bank will give loans to borrowers with a bad credit history?  It turns out that if in the first case the client had any chances, then the road is closed with bad loans to large financial organizations. </p>

    <p>  Microloans come to the rescue.  Microfinance organizations are ready to provide loans even to the most unreliable borrowers.  But you should be careful with MFIs - not all of them are legal.  Before applying for a microloan, you should make sure that the MFI is legitimate. </p><p>  One of the significant drawbacks of a microloan is a high interest rate, too small loans and short terms.  But there are situations in which you do not have to choose. </p><h2>  How to increase the chances of getting a loan </h2><p>  What if the applicant is not ready to apply to the MFI, and does not rely too much on obtaining a loan from a large bank?  Some experts advise increasing the chances of getting a loan by submitting online applications to several credit organizations at once.  Perhaps a lucky ticket will be issued to the borrower somewhere. </p><p>  But the best guarantee of an unhindered loan is a responsible attitude to previous debts and to their own employment.  Which bank will give 100 percent credit in this case?  Almost any! </p>
