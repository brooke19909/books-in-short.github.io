There was a division of the whole people into powerless serfs and powerful rulers.  In fact, there were practically no other layers of the population, there were only some privileges regarding certain groups: white settlements and <span>black-mowed peasants.</span>  However, not always belonging to one or another privilege had a positive effect on the <span>standard of living of the</span> people.  About how the position of the nobility changed in the 17th century, and will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the position of the nobility changed in the 17th century" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/780449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for change </h2><p>  The fundamental reason for the change in the <span>social status of the</span> nobility as such was the introduction of <span>serfdom</span> on the basis of the <span>Council Code</span> of 1649.  Strengthening the status and significance of this title occurred due to the merger of all non-free people into serfs. </p><p>  Every year, the differences between the nobility and the nobility blurred, and over time, they almost disappeared.  The entire elite was called sovereign people, and the position in society was valued solely due to the position held. </p><p>  How did the position of the nobility in the 17th century regarding the existing possessions and estates?  At that time, all the noble estates, according to the decree on the abolition of localism, turned into hereditary estates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Privileges of Black-Mowed Peasants </h2><p>  The life of peasants was not easy, even the status of black-cows did not contribute to any improvement in the quality of life.  People belonging to this category of the population had the right to use land allotments as members of the communities, everyone could get a land allotment (wtih) for use, but this was not always good. </p><p>  Since the position of the nobility changed in the 17th century, many serfs found themselves in a better position, living in the shadow of their masters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian nobility" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/780447.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Privileges of White Settlements </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, white settlements were territories in the Russian city where servicemen lived: dragoons, white-landed Cossacks and infantry soldiers.  They were on the lands of spiritual and secular feudal lords.  The basis of the economy in such cities was various crafts.  People belonging to this segment of the population were exempted from the so-called tax (taxes to the state treasury). </p><p>  At the same time, the population of white settlements did not have the opportunity to escape from oppression, however, like the peasantry, which constantly revolted.  But since the position of the nobility changed in the 17th century, these riots were not supported by the elite layers and quickly faded.  Often enough by force. </p>
