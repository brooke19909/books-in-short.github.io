    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Barcelona Zoo opened its doors in 1892.  Animals from the private collection of the banker Lewis Marty, who kept animals in one of their estates, settled in it.  The man decided to sell his pets.  The mayor of Barcelona, ​​Manuel Porcar, agreed to purchase animals and place them in the Citadel Park, in a place that was empty after the World Exhibition in 1988 and belonged to the local municipality.  The creators of the wonderful zoo replaced the traditional iron grilles with plexiglass ceilings and ditches with water, which was a progressive solution for that time.  Visitors immediately appreciated this unusual innovation, which allowed them to observe the habits of animals without interference. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The zoo has all the conditions for people to feel as comfortable as possible in it.  Aviaries surrounded by water are located on both sides of the route so that some of them can be viewed from two sides.  In order to move around the zoo with a breeze, you can use the three-wheeled electric car, which is rented to everyone.  This service is often used by visitors with children. </p><p>  The zoo in Barcelona is famous for the fact that it contains animals of almost all climatic zones of the planet.  In a wonderful Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and mild winters, all pets get along perfectly. </p>

    <h2>  Variety of animals </h2><p>  You can enter the Barcelona Zoo from two sides.  The main entrance immediately impresses visitors with its unusual appearance.  Here is a round glass aviary with a <span>small panda.</span>  She spends most of her free time from hibernation on the branches of a large tree.  At the opposite end from the entrance is the skeleton of a huge whale. </p><p>  From the side of the <span>Arc de Triomphe</span> there is a second entrance to the zoo.  If you turn right from this entrance and move to the very center of the park, you can see dwarf hippos.  The aviary with these rare animals can be viewed from both sides, so on the way back you can admire them again.  In the same part of the zoo you can find an aviary with young wild cats.  Little tigers?  cheetahs and panthers run all day and chase a <span>rugby ball.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next is the habitat of giant parrots.  The upper and left part of their enclosure is tightened with a net, but the holes in it are so large that sparrows and other small birds easily penetrate and steal food from parrots.  Not far from this place is a pond on which <span>black swans</span> swim <span>.</span>  Nearby is an aviary with a dwarf panther. </p>

    <p>  At the Barcelona Zoo, visitors can see other rare and amazing animals: Madagascar lemurs, bears, fur seals, Arctic <span>penguins, African</span> and Indian elephants, large hippos, giant turtles, kangaroos, EMU ostriches, and many others. </p><h2>  Primates </h2><p>  Primates occupy a special place in the menagerie's collection.  To the right of the second entrance to the Barcelona Zoo is a monkey.  Here is an impressive collection of these interesting animals.  Many of them are endangered.  The star and symbol of the zoo is a white gorilla named Snowball.  This monkey was found in Spanish Guinea in 1966.  Curious people from all over the world gathered at the only white gorilla known in the world.  Snowball lived in a separate enclosure with four black females.  All of them gave birth, but, unfortunately, there were no white gorillas among them.  Snowball died in 2003.  The zoological park has a museum dedicated to this unique animal. </p>
