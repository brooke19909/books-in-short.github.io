    <h2>  About the city district </h2><p>  About 17 kilometers north-east of the Russian capital, the city of Ivanteyevka was built.  The population of this urban district is small and amounts to a little more than 70 thousand people.  G. Ivanteyevka is completely buried in the forest.  This is clearly visible on the map.  Right behind the LCD "Iskra" forest open spaces.  Residents of those apartments that overlook the forest can constantly breathe fresh air. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Ivanteyevka is an urban district located in the north-east of the Moscow region.  The distance from Moscow to the city is about 20 kilometers.  The <span>residential complex itself</span> is located almost in the center of Ivanteevka on Tsentralny proezd street, house 17. The house is near the road, so owners who move on their own vehicles will not experience any inconvenience with the entrance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  With this, no difficulties will arise, and it does not matter on which transport the trip is planned: in a personal car, minibus or electric train.  If you choose public transport, then from the metro station "VDNH" to the city can be reached by bus number 316. </p><p>  Quite often, literally every 15-20 minutes, electric trains depart from the Yaroslavl station in the northeast direction to the Ivanteyevka-2 station.  The journey time between the indicated railway stations is approximately one hour. </p>

    <p>  And it‚Äôs quite easy to get to the Iskra residential complex by your own car.  It is enough to drive about 20 kilometers along the Yaroslavl highway and turn onto Ivanteyevskoye.  Then - to the right, on Zavodskaya street.  The residential complex itself is located right on the road. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The developer Stroykapital designed the described residential building as an 18-story 4-section building.  In addition, the complex was supplemented with a landscaped surrounding area, fenced and guarded.  In total, the construction area is approximately 5 thousand square meters.  Due to its architectural features, the object is the highlight of the area.  LCD "Iskra" (Ivanteevka) was designed individually.  At the same time, the landscape features and views of the already built-up areas of the city were taken into account in the calculations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The complex was erected using monolithic-brick technology, with a facade lined with porcelain tiles.  As in many new buildings not only in Moscow, but throughout the country, the basement is reserved for technical rooms.  It also houses social infrastructure facilities.  In addition, the last, eighteenth floor is made with panoramic glazing.  The facility is equipped with freight and passenger elevators. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  It includes the location on the basement non-residential floor of various social services.  This is a pharmacy, shops, beauty salons, a children's center and legal advice.  In addition, in order to ensure the safety of residents, the territory of the complex is fenced and guarded by a specialized service. </p><p>  And even more so, the Iskra residential complex will not leave its smallest tenants without playgrounds and sports grounds.  In the courtyard there are objects of small architecture and recreation areas for those older. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  Due to such a favorable location of the residential complex Iskra, Ivanteevka offers the services of its residents the entire developed infrastructure of the city.  Almost all social facilities that are necessary for a comfortable life are accessible to residents of the complex.  Nearby are several schools, kindergartens, clinic, library.  There are banking institutions, a cinema.  Thus, those who have changed their place of residence from the capital to the Iskra residential complex will not have to radically change their habits or abandon their existing lifestyle. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  It is because of it that many residents of the metropolis change their usual apartments for housing in new buildings.  After all, not everyone can live in a huge city, breathe exhaust fumes.  Therefore, the trend has become fashionable to sell residential real estate in the capital and move closer to nature.  Here, everyone already chooses for himself: whether he wants to live in a country house or wants to maintain urban living conditions.  But in any case, moving to new buildings in the region is an opportunity to live in the fresh air and breathe the smell of the forest, and not the exhaust fumes of cars. </p><p>  This fully applies to the LCD "Iskra".  Reviews of its residents, of course, are not always positive.  But now, when the complex has already been fully commissioned, the owners of the apartments have already made repairs and settled in them, it is becoming more and more satisfied with life in Ivanteevka.  In most cases, the decisive role is played by a favorable environmental situation.  The city itself and the residential complex in particular are surrounded by greenery. </p>

    <p>  Getting to the building is relatively easy.  At a distance of less than a kilometer is the Ivanteevka-2 railway platform, where you can catch an electric train to the Yaroslavl station.  Those who have their own car will need only twenty minutes to get to the complex along the Yaroslavl highway.  Needless to say, the developer chose the very right place for the construction of the structure. </p>
