  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a skirt with your own hands?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A skirt is a very beautiful, feminine and beloved article of clothing by many.  The variety of existing shapes, materials, colors of skirts is impressive.  Surely, most women at least once in their life thought about whether it is possible to sew a skirt with their own hands.  Anyone who has at least minimal experience in cutting and sewing will say that this is not so difficult.  Of course, an amazing work of art will not work, but skirts that have even the simplest cut can be very beautiful. </p><p>  There are three basic cut skirts: straight, wedge and conical.  The first cut is the basis for most styles of skirts.  It is enough to make a pattern of a straight skirt once, and you can subsequently, changing it, invent the most unthinkable styles.  But straight cut is also the most difficult.  To master it, you need to master at least the initial skills of cutting and sewing.  In order to <span>build a drawing of a straight skirt,</span> it is necessary to take many measurements in addition to the standard girth of the waist and hips.  However, if you are not afraid of difficulties, you can find many instructions for making patterns and sew a skirt with your own hands to the envy of your friends.  The process of cutting and sewing, in essence, is very exciting.  To facilitate the task, you can search for ready-made patterns - they are also quite specialized magazines and the Internet. </p><p>  If there are no cutting and sewing skills at all, and there is not enough time to master a new craft, but you want to sew a skirt with your own hands, you can choose the simplest cut - conical.  This is the so-called skirt-sun, with a wide hem, flying in all directions.  The pattern of such a skirt is so simple that any woman can make it.  This is a circle with a hole in the center.  The hole is usually cut to the size of the waist.  By the way, if the question arises of how to sew a summer skirt, you can not think too long: the sun skirt made of bright lightweight fabric will look great and attract attention in any situation.  As a basis for a <span>conical skirt,</span> you can also choose a square piece of fabric.  Then the uneven bottom edge of the skirt will create a very interesting effect.  In general, skirts can be sewn from anything, even from many old shreds, and trimmed with any materials.  The main thing is to show imagination. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can even sew a skirt from old jeans.  The biggest plus in this method is that there is no need to make a pattern.  After all, if the jeans are perfect in size, the skirt sewn from them will sit no worse.  It is enough just to cut the jeans to the required length and then dissolve the seams that are not necessary for the skirt - step and middle.  From the rest of the material, wedges should be inserted in the right places.  This is the easiest option, but if you have enough imagination, you can come up with many others.  In this case, experiments are only welcome.  By the way, if jeans that are not suitable in size are taken as the basis, they can always be sewn for yourself. </p><p>  Having come to the decision to sew a skirt with your own hands, you need to remember some rules that you should always follow.  Firstly, when sewing a skirt, it is impossible to do without taking at least basic measures - grasping the waist and hips.  When measuring the length of the product, it is better to ask someone you know to help yourself - by measuring the length on yourself, you can accidentally grab the excess from the hem.  Secondly, when creating a pattern, you always need to add a few centimeters to the freedom of fitting and be sure to leave seam bottom allowances. </p><p>  A beautiful skirt with your own hands is quite real.  The complexity of the style depends on the imagination, skills and the availability of time for the seamstress.  The most important thing is that in this way you can create an unusual, exclusive thing taking into account the features of your own figure, spending a minimum of finance and having fun.  After all, creating something with your own hands is a very creative process that makes you feel like a creator. </p>
