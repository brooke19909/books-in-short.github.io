    <h2>  Thailand in January: weather </h2><p>  If we talk about the vagaries of nature, then in the first month of the year, no surprises are expected.  At this time, there is no longer suffocating heat or heavy rains.  In general, precipitation in January is rare, if a little rain happens, then, as a rule, at night.  Therefore, it is very comfortable to relax here in almost all resorts, while in other months of the year in some regions the sun can shine brightly, and in others it can be poured all day long. </p><p>  The reason is that the territory of this country is stretched from north to south, therefore, in the provinces of Kamphenphet, Lampang is somewhat cooler than on the coast of the South China Sea.  For example, in Chang Mei at night it can be only +4 degrees Celsius, but during the day the temperature still rises to +28 gr. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the capital of Bangkok, January is considered the coldest month.  However, even at night the temperature there is rarely below +21 degrees, and <span>during the day tourists</span> can enjoy the bright sun and languish from the thirty-degree heat. </p><p>  Swim in the sea, where water, like <span>fresh milk,</span> will be able to those who are going to visit Southern Thailand.  In January, the weather in Phuket and Koh Samui rarely drops below +31 degrees and there are practically no cloudy days.  At the same time, a fresh breeze blows at night, which makes the rest more comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays </h2><p>  The sea and the sun are wonderful, especially when you arrive in Thailand in January.  But in this country there is something to do besides a beach holiday. </p><p>  Thais are a very cheerful people, and, like many representatives of the countries of Southeast Asia, they love holidays, vibrant shows and festivals.  For example, in addition to the European New Year, they celebrate Thai, Songkran, in April and Chinese in March.  Locals treat tourists very well, therefore they organize bright spectacular events for them.  In addition, the hotel management makes sure that the New Year's Eve in their institutions is memorable, and arrange lush banquets. </p><p>  On the second Saturday of January, a traditional Thai holiday is celebrated - Children's Day.  It is usually accompanied by entertainment for kids and adults, vibrant shows and carnivals. </p><p>  Going to Thailand in January (see reviews below), in the north of the country, in <span>Chang May,</span> you can see an unusual festival of umbrellas, and in Pattaya - even more unusual bed races.  In addition, theater troupes and circus groups from Europe and Australia come to Thai resorts in winter with tours.  As you can see, tourists who decide to come to Thailand in January will not be bored.  In addition, this country itself is rich in sights and magnificent landscapes, not to mention the markets, which are an enchanting sight. </p>

    <h2>  What sights to see </h2><p>  Thailand is a country with a unique ancient culture, so unusual for European perception that any monument or temple seems exotic. </p><p>  Tourists are offered a variety of excursions - both thematic and sightseeing.  Their cost ranges from 30 to 50 dollars. </p><p>  The most attractive in this regard, of course, is Bangkok - a city that is visited by almost everyone who comes to Thailand.  Rest in January there allows you to visit incredibly beautiful <span>Buddhist temples</span> and monasteries, including the world famous Wat Trai Mit - the temple of the Golden Buddha. </p><p>  Lovers of Buddhist culture can also see the most interesting Sinai temples, and nature lovers can visit national parks.  For example, <span>Nong Nooch</span> Park <span>, a</span> crocodile farm and a stone park in Pattaya or Khao Sok Nature Reserve in Phuket. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Those who like to bring interesting souvenirs from their trips or things needed in the household will have unforgettable shopping in Thailand. </p><p>  Firstly, Christmas and New Year discounts are still valid at this time, and you can find anything in local stores, including items from well-known brands. </p><p>  Secondly, in Thailand, as in any country in Southeast Asia, there are magnificent, colorful markets, which are also largely oriented towards tourists from Europe.  Here you can buy souvenirs, jewelry, and leather goods of exotic animals, and gourmets who decide to amuse themselves with exotic fruits will be delighted. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited Thailand in January primarily note fine weather and minimal rainfall.  In addition, almost all of them admire the amazing beauty of the natural landscapes and a variety of cheap fruits. </p><p>  It can be argued that if you start questioning those who visited Thailand in January, most often the reviews will sound like ‚Äúreally liked‚Äù or ‚Äúwe are wildly delighted‚Äù.  And this is not surprising, especially when you consider that, having returned from Thailand, you will have to get into the conditions of a harsh Russian winter. </p><p>  Human life is too short, so you should not spend it on the acquisition of unnecessary things that will eventually be thrown into the trash.  Better to travel and enjoy the knowledge of the world.  If you agree, then at least once spend the New Year holidays in Thailand to feel like in a real paradise. </p>
