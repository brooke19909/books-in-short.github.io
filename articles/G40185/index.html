Calangute is a town famous for its beautiful coast.  The hotel is located very close to the beach.  Calangute Beach is just 300 meters away. A convenient walking trail leads to it, and for most tourists, daily short walks do not cause much trouble. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that this is a public beach.  On the other hand, there is not a large concentration of tourists here, so you can relax while enjoying the beauty of nature and some degree of privacy.  Of course, you need to pay for renting a sun lounger and an umbrella, but beach towels can be obtained at the hotel free of charge (subject to return, of course). </p><p>  On the shore there is a water recreation center where you can rent water transport or devices for swimming under water.  Tourists get a lot of pleasure when water-skiing, bananas, boats.  It is possible to surf and even sail. </p><h2>  Can I count on an additional service? </h2>
