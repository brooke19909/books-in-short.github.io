    <h2>  Briefly about the resort </h2><p>  Before we talk about the hotel, let's see what the city of Hurghada is like.  A map of Egypt will tell you where this famous resort area is located.  It is divided into two parts: the "old" city with attractions and architectural monuments and the "new" city with a large number of modern hotels. </p><p>  It so happened that in many ways the quality of service and service in hotels depends on the location of the resort.  Everyone knows that European hotels are fundamentally different, for example, from Turkish, despite the same category and stardom.  Naturally, in "older" buildings, accommodation will cost less than in recently rebuilt hotels.  Before an exciting trip, be sure to take a look at the year the hotel was founded. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hurghada from year to year gathers millions of foreign tourists on its beaches.  Many are attracted to the magnificent climate of the resort, because here you can relax all year round.  A varied excursion program, clean beaches, coral reefs - all this attracts travelers from different countries. </p><p>  Hurghada hotels are located throughout the city, the best <span>hotels of Egypt (5 stars) are</span> built along the coastline, some are near artificial lagoons. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel complex operates on an all-inclusive basis.  This nutrition program is very convenient, but its effect extends to certain types of foods.  In Jasmine Palace Resort (Egypt), all alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are included in the price. </p><p>  The hotel has a main restaurant, where all breakfasts, lunches and dinners are held.  The pool bar serves light snacks and fruits.  BaySide Beach Bar offers pizza at certain times.  For those who have visited the Asian restaurant Al Bushra for the first time, a free dinner is offered, but you need to reserve a table in advance.  On site there is an Asian restaurant LAsiatik, where for a fee you can try oriental dishes. </p><p>  Opposite the main restaurant is a hookah room.  There is a lobby bar and a Dunes bar until 24:00, where you can get free drinks. </p><h2>  Opportunities for children </h2><p>  A vacation at the Jasmine Palace Resort with children will become less troublesome for parents, as there is everything necessary for entertaining young travelers on the territory: an outdoor heated pool in the winter, animation programs and playgrounds. </p><p>  Children from 4 to 12 years old can attend a special children's play club, which is open daily from 10:30 to 16:00 local time.  <span>Babysitting services are</span> paid separately. </p><p>  The restaurant does not have a separate children's menu, but there are special chairs. </p><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  Over the past ten years, tours to Egypt have become the most popular for Russians.  Hotels that tourists choose most often have a high star rating (from 4 to 5).  Most likely, this is due to the adequate cost of rest.  The average price of a trip to the Jasmine Palace Resort for two with accommodation in a standard one-room suite will be 36,000 - 40,000 rubles for 7 nights. </p><p>  Before buying a tour, it is worth noting the fact that rooms with garden views are much cheaper than others.  For example, the same ticket to a room with a view of the pool will cost from 40,000 - 45,000 rubles. </p><p>  The bonuses of the hotel, the so-called compliments from the hotel, affect the price of the tour: a meeting of the newlyweds with fruits and champagne, a birthday present (cake) and presents for regular customers (fruit basket).  To receive bonuses you must provide the relevant data: </p><p>  - A copy of the marriage certificate, if you are newlyweds; </p><p>  - a copy of your passport if you had a birthday; </p><p>  - data on previous visits, if you are a regular customer. </p><h2>  Travel recommendations / reviews </h2>

    <p>  Tourists recommend visiting this hotel, but are advised to pay attention to some nuances: </p><p>  - you should definitely take slippers with you, since swimming without them is dangerous for your health - you can hurt yourself on the coral bottom.  If you haven't brought along an extra pair of shoes, don't be discouraged.  There is a special store on the beach where you can buy everything you need; </p><p>  - the entrance to the sea is gentle, but the depth is shallow.  To swim in full growth, you must walk about 200 meters.  Some complain that the water in the sea is dirty; </p><p>  - they clean the rooms efficiently, but sometimes they forget to bring new toiletries or clean towels.  It is better for staff to remind themselves more often, because the tip size does not affect the quality of cleaning; </p><p>  - the air conditioner does not have a remote control in the room; </p><p>  - not enough chairs in family rooms; </p><p>  - the central beach bar is far from the sun loungers; </p><p>  - there is no pier by the sea; </p><p>  - There are almost no children's entertainments (water slides, etc.). </p><p>  Many guests were pleased with their stay at the Jasmine Palace Resort.  Tourists note the convenient location of the hotel complex, a varied menu in restaurants, informative and interesting excursion programs.  Some <span>animators</span> rated the <span>work of the animators as</span> ‚Äúthree points‚Äù, however, staff and show programs change periodically.  Tourists from Russia are pleased with the presence of Russian-speaking staff and channels in Russian, including children's ones.  There are always free sun loungers and umbrellas on the territory, there is plenty of space, so tourists do not have to crowd around the pool.  All numbers correspond to photos.  Tourists also speak well of the supermarket, which is located near the complex.  There you can always buy fresh vegetables and locally produced goods at affordable prices. </p><p>  Most vacationers are advised to choose this hotel if you are planning a calm and measured vacation.  The hotel often spends elderly guests and families with children.  For those who love discos and noisy parties, Jasmine Palace Resort is not suitable. </p>
