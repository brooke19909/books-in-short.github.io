    <h2>  Irkutsk: city districts </h2><p>  Irkutsk is divided into two parts by the Angara River.  These zones are called the left and right banks.  They are connected by bridges called Old, New and New, as well as hydroelectric power stations.  Such strange names were formed for a simple reason: people did not think that after the construction of the New Bridge others would be built, which would also need to be called somehow.  That is why the transition, which was opened in 2010, had to be called the Newest.  Officials attempted to correct the awkward situation.  But only a new name has taken root for the Newest Bridge, which is now called Academic. </p><p>  The city is divided into four districts.  These are Leninsky, October, Right-Bank and Sverdlovsk.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement is more than three hundred square kilometers.  It has more than 800 streets, the total length of which is more than 700 kilometers.  The city of Irkutsk, the districts of which also combine villages, has a center right at the intersection of the two oldest main streets: Lenin and Marx.  Nearby is the main square, as well as the Duma.  Around the center is <span>the Angara River,</span> which forms two embankments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Differences between the two shores </h2><p>  So, the city is divided into two banks.  Right is a historical and administrative center.  It houses the buildings of the regional and city administrations.  Here is located most of the shopping and business centers, the airport and the bus station.  The left bank combines <span>sleeping areas</span> and industrial facilities.  The path from one side to the opposite takes little time.  For this reason, many people live on one shore and work on the other. </p>

    <h2>  Kuibyshevsky and Kirovsky districts </h2><p>  In the central part of the right bank are these two areas.  They are the most beautiful in the whole city.  It is here that theaters and museums, historical buildings, as well as several clubs and cinemas are located.  The streets are decorated with a large number of flower beds and green spaces, as well as interesting sculptures.  There are many equipped squares, some of which have fountains.  At every step you can find catering establishments or restaurants.  Many of them are inexpensive. </p><p>  In Kirovsky and Kuibyshevsky districts there are a lot of shopping centers and shops.  There are also buildings of almost all higher educational institutions of the city.  For the reason that there are often foreign tourists in these places, all the signs on which the street names are written are fully translated into English.  There are also shields with instructions and maps showing directions to all interesting places.  Irkutsk, whose areas do not contain many attractions, still attracts travelers.  And just in these two zones they are most often. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oktyabrsky District </h2><p>  This area is not related to the central part of the city.  But here passes the largest street in the city - Baikalskaya.  She greatly revives the area.  There are also the interchanges of the Newest Bridge, the public transport traffic on which is closed.  You can only ride a taxi or private car.  But soon that will change. </p>

    <h2>  Sverdlovsk district </h2><p>  Young people prefer to settle in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, since housing is more affordable here.  It consists of neighborhoods, each of which has shops, schools and kindergartens.  There are even several universities.  Of the total number of microdistricts of the Oktyabrsky district, Akademgorodok stands out, which appeared earlier than the rest.  But still he is considered one of the most calm and prosperous.  Akademgorodok is very cozy and picturesque due to the large number of squares and groves. </p>

    <h2>  Leninsky district </h2><p>  It includes two areas: Irkutsk-2, as well as Novolenino.  The villages that became part of this zone at different times are connected to them.  Irkutsk, whose areas are quite calm, still has not very good places.  Many believe that in Leninsky there are a lot of so-called Gopniks.  Therefore, it is not recommended to appear here again.  Recently, however, young families have been willingly settling here.  Leninsky district is a decent distance from the city center, but public transport runs well. </p><h2>  City features </h2><p>  Irkutsk, whose neighborhoods and streets are very beautiful, has one feature: if you take a taxi and ask to get to the city center, then most likely the passenger will be dropped off near the market.  The thing is that the bazaar and the streets around it are the center of the city.  And the market is the transport hub of Irkutsk.  All in all, this is not the best place to go in search of attractions.  But here you can always buy fresh food and catch a bus traveling anywhere in the city. </p><p>  Irkutsk, city districts, its streets are located on small hills.  One of the highest points is the mountain, which locals call the Peak of Love.  This place plays the role of an observation deck, since it offers a very beautiful panoramic view of the city of Irkutsk.  Areas from a height are visible at a glance.  But soon, due to the fast pace of construction of houses, this place has already ceased to be so exciting. </p><p>  Some areas of the city are similar to each other.  They are close to the center.  They were built at high speed to quickly solve the problem of housing shortages for citizens.  These are the most ordinary sleeping quarters in which all the houses are multi-unit and are built on the same type.  Housing in them costs less than in the city as a whole.  Nearby are forests.  This is convenient, since you do not need to go anywhere in order to spend time in nature. </p>

    <h2>  Private sector </h2><p>  The main feature of the city is its private sector.  If in most modern settlements their own houses are only on the outskirts, here they are everywhere.  Even in the center.  Here, wooden houses located in the midst of multi-storey buildings are not uncommon.  So, passing through the center of Irkutsk, you can hear dog barking or cries of roosters.  And if you look into the gap in the fence, you will see a garden there. </p><p>  Residents of wooden huts do not want to agree to resettlement, as they well understand that an apartment in a multi-storey building will not cost as much as their house, located on the main street of Irkutsk.  The climate, by the way, is cold here.  For this reason, the question is often asked: Does Irkutsk include <span>areas of the Far North?</span>  They are united, rather, by the region, and not by the city itself. </p><p>  So, Irkutsk, the districts of the city, the list of which is not so large, was considered in this article: these are Kuibyshevsky, Kirovsky, Leninsky, October and Sverdlovsky.  This place can be chosen both for travel and for settlement.  One has only to take into account the low temperature in the cold season. </p>
