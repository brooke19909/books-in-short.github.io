The Golden Mile, which will be discussed in the article, is an adornment of this city.  So, at least, tourists speak out who had the opportunity to spend a vacation there.  Our article is based on traveler reviews.  Anapa is famous for its health resorts.  In the local sanatoriums with the help of local mineral water and mud they successfully cure a large number of ailments.  Only here living conditions in health resorts often leave much to be desired.  Therefore, some tourists stay in guest houses, such as the Golden Mile, and buy a termo - a treatment program in a sanatorium.  So the mini-hotel with a swimming pool is suitable not only for those who came to taste the beach pleasures, but also for tourists who have arrived for recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Mile Anapa" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Golden Mile </h2><p>  This guest house is located in the first resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãa city like Anapa.  The Golden Mile, Kirov, 21 - this is the address of a small private hotel.  Reviews say that this area is known in Anapa under the name "Lighthouse".  Yes, this symbol of the city rises very close to the Golden Mile.  And next to it there is a pump room of mineral water, the medical and diagnostic center ‚ÄúDi-Luch‚Äù and sanatoriums - ‚ÄúRus‚Äù and ‚ÄúNadezhda‚Äù.  It is very convenient for those who came to Anapa to improve their health.  You can get a range of cosmetic services at the Maria Spa.  Kirov Street is quiet, shady.  But nearby there are many grocery stores (some of them work around the clock), cafes, restaurants, a small market.  To the nearest beach, according to reviews, to go about five minutes.  Also close to the inn is the park named after Thirty Years of Victory with attractions.  Nearby is a beautiful promenade.  In close proximity is the water park "Golden Beach". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guesthouses Anapa Golden Mile" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502225.jpg" width="475"></div>

This is a modern building with three floors.  The main entrance, perhaps, will disappoint a tourist who is accustomed to the luxurious facades of Turkish or Egyptian hotels.  An ordinary brick house, on the upper floors there are balconies, massive blindly locked gates for entry and passage.  However, when you find yourself in the patio, you are embraced by the joyful mood of the vacation.  Twisted ladders lead to the upper floors.  Each of them has its own terrace for relaxation with a table and armchairs.  And in the backyard is a small pool.  It is surrounded by a solarium with sunbeds and a canopy.  There is a dining room on site.  The mini-hotel has its own parking, available for guests arriving by car.  As tourists assure, the whole territory is very beautiful, well-groomed.  There are shops, flower beds.  The territory is under video surveillance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa the Golden Mile of Kirov" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502228.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  Pool and beach </h2><p>  The Golden Mile Hotel (Anapa) provides its guests with a free use of a small reservoir of clean fresh water.  The dimensions of the pool are four by four meters.  Tourists who visited the mini-hotel at the beginning and at the end of the season (May and September) assure that the water is heated to a very comfortable temperature.  The pool is surrounded by a sunbathing area.  There is also a canopy for fans to relax in the shade.  Kirova Street in Anapa is located on a peninsula.  Therefore, the Golden Mile guests have a choice of beaches.  Nearby, three hundred meters away is the pebble beach "Small Bay".  First, there is a steep descent along the stairs, but if you go further along the promenade, you can go to the sea along a gentle path.  This beach is well equipped, there are sunbeds, a solarium on the pier.  But tourists recommend not to be lazy and go even further, to the sanatorium "Rus".  This beach is also pebble, like the Small Bay, but there are cleaner and more services.  In Anapa, there is no shortage of sandy coasts.  But reviews warn: during the unrest of the sea, the water there becomes muddy. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The administration of the Golden Mile Inn (Anapa) does not oblige tourists to pay for meals.  But she also provides organized meals.  On the territory of the inn there is a dining room in which a qualified chef works.  There are many food outlets nearby.  On the promenade is not a problem to find a restaurant or cafe.  However, most tourists preferred to have a meal at the hotel.  Prices are low there.  Those who rested in the summer of 2016 say that breakfast cost 200 rubles per person, lunch - 280, and dinner - two hundred and twenty.  In addition, dining in the guest house was caused by the quality of food.  The dishes are delicious, cooked at home.  Of course, this is not a buffet.  Dishes are served according to the general menu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest house golden mile anapa reviews" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502224.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  What they say about food at the Golden Mile Hotel (Anapa) reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists, having previously booked only accommodation or accommodation with breakfast, changed their mind on the spot.  In the morning, it began to smell so delicious with freshly baked buns that the question involuntarily arose: why go somewhere to look for where to drink coffee?  For breakfast, give pancakes, omelettes, cereals.  There is always delicious homemade cakes.  For lunch, be sure to give soup (kharcho, borsch), the second, a drink.  The portions are large.  Dishes are not restaurant.  Carpaccio and salmon are not given there, but homemade meatballs with mashed potatoes are guaranteed.  The dining room is clean, smart, service fast.  For food prices in Anapa, staying at a hotel is cheaper than anywhere else. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Even if you paid only for accommodation, you can always use the electric kettle and microwave, which are at the reception.  Upon request, you will be given free use of an iron and ironing board.  All rooms have fast wi-fi.  For young guests every Friday from eight to half past nine in the evening there is an entertainment event.  But the tourists call the best hotel service the transfer.  You will be met at the airport or at the railway station and delivered directly to the Golden Mile guest house (Anapa).  Reviews claim that prices (four hundred and five hundred and fifty rubles, respectively) are lower than those of taxi drivers in the resort.  Many couples traveling with a child have booked a double room.  Placing in a folding armchair or sofa cost in this case only five hundred rubles per day.  And children under five years old enjoy 60 percent discounts on accommodation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest House Golden Mile Anapa reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502237.jpg" width="600"></div>
