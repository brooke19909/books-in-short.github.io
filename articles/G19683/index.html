    <p>  After staying at the guest house, many guests generally have positive impressions.  The hotel is new, with good repair and good furniture.  It is clean, comfortable and completely unpleasant.  Each room has a shower and toilet.  You can watch your favorite shows on vacation, as each room has a flat-screen TV. </p><p>  On the ground floor there is a kitchen with a full set of dishes and appliances.  Guests can cook their own home food at any time. </p><p>  The path to the beach takes only 10 minutes by walking.  The Mamaika district is famous for its silence.  There are no discos and other noisy establishments.  Mostly families with children have a rest.  So at night you can sleep peacefully.  Thirsty for active entertainment, you can go to the city by minibus number 30, running every 5 minutes. </p><p>  Some disadvantages are also available.  Rooms are cleaned only once a week.  Near the hotel there is a church with a bell tower.  Bell lovers can interfere with sleep lovers. </p><p>  What do vacationers who choose other guest houses (Mamaika, Sochi) say? </p><h2>  Reviews about the neighborhood </h2>

    <p>  Not without reason Mamaika received the status of the gate of the Olympics.  It is very clean, despite the fact that the area is constantly being built up.  It is very convenient to stay here for those who come by car.  The area is located at the entrance to Sochi.  It has everything you need for a relaxing holiday.  Beaches are one of the cleanest in Sochi.  Those who like outdoor activities and noisy parties need to look for a more suitable place.  Nearby attractions with great desire can be reached on foot.  But public transport in the form of minibuses will take you to them much faster.  Despite the proximity of the Olympic center, it is very quiet and not crowded.  Guest houses can always provide comfortable accommodation at good prices.  We can safely say that this area is one of the best places to stay in Sochi. </p><p>  Guesthouse "Paradise of the Sea" (Sochi, Mamaica), for example, can become a worthy refuge for tourists during their stay at the resort.  It is simply immersed in tropical vegetation, and the windows of its rooms offer gorgeous views of the sea coast and mountains. </p>
