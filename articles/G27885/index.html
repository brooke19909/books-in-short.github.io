After all, it was here that the Winter Olympic Games were held.  However, unlike the planet‚Äôs population, the inhabitants of the former USSR are well acquainted with this city.  The reason for this is its excellent geographical position, which allows you to relax here all year round.  On one side, Sochi is surrounded by mountain elevations.  On the other hand, the gentle waters of the Black Sea wash it.  Therefore, it is not surprising that tourists who conquered the Abkhaz mountains in winter hurry to bask on the soft beaches of the resort in the summer. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment near the hotel </h2><p>  Adler hotels on the beach include many establishments that differ among themselves in terms of occupied territory, the categories of rooms provided, the range of services, cost of living and other factors.  Many upscale hotels have their own pools and private beach.  Others rent trestle beds and umbrellas.  Thirdly, we are always happy to offer childcare services and games rooms.  For example, the three-star hotel Aphrodite.  This establishment is located near the resort town.  The latter, in turn, daily entices guests with a variety of entertainments, such as a water park, dolphinarium, oceanarium, all kinds of attractions for children and their parents, a healing spring with mineral water and much more. </p>

    <h2>  Morning goodies and discounts for kids </h2><p>  Many Adler hotels by the sea offer their customers breakfast as a bonus.  Such institutions, for example, include the Flamingo, Berth, Adelphia and others.  All these hotels are happy to accommodate their guests in rooms of various categories and different prices.  Each hotel has <span>a discount system</span> for children.  For example, in an institution called Adelphia, children under seven years old can live for free.  However, they are not allocated a place and breakfast.  Also, for children under twelve years of age, the cost of food is halved. </p>
