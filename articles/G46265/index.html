Marble Canyon - a unique natural monument made by human hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of Karelia, which is part of the Northwestern Federal District, began to be inhabited by humans since time immemorial - immediately after the Ice Age, and therefore has a rather rich history.  But the real treasure of this region is the purest northern nature.  Numerous lakes, swamps, streams and rocks at all times attracted here true connoisseurs of pristine beauty.  In these places there are many picturesque corners, but perhaps one of the most famous places for which Karelia is famous is the Marble Canyon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelia Marble Canyon" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/283881.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>History of the Marble Canyon</strong> </p><p>  Located just twenty kilometers from the Finnish border, near a village called Ruskeala, this canyon has been known since the 17th century, when marble began to be mined here.  At first it belonged to Sweden, but subsequently passed to Russia.  Local marble, characterized by a rich palette and variety of varieties, was very popular among St. Petersburg city planners.  Therefore, during the reign of Catherine II, Ruskeala marble was mined for the construction of many famous metropolitan structures.  This natural material was used to decorate St. Isaac's and Kazan Cathedrals, the Hermitage and the <span>Mikhailovsky Castle</span> and other buildings.  At a later time, it was mined for the internal design of the stations of the Leningrad Metro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the <span>Soviet-Finnish War of</span> 1939, all the <span>technical documentation</span> was destroyed by the retreating forces <span>,</span> and the quarry itself was flooded.  After the Great Patriotic War, all attempts to restore the extraction of marble failed, and this idea was abandoned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelia marble canyon how to get" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/283880.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Marble Canyon today</strong> </p><p>  Currently, the Marble Canyon located in the Republic of Karelia is a quarry flooded with clean water (transparency about 20 m).  With 460 m in length and 100 m in width, it is unique in that under the water layer there is a whole system of underground workings, consisting of many tunnels and drifts, which are interconnected by vertical shafts.  Its depth is about 50 m, and in galleries it can reach more than 100 m. </p><p>  In the nineties of the last century, the Government of the Republic of Karelia declared the Marble Canyon an object constituting a cultural heritage, and in 2005 Ruskeala Mountain Park appeared in these places.  Entrance to the territory of the mountain park is paid.  Attention to those wishing to explore the <span>Marble Canyon of Ruskeala</span> (Karelia): the prices here depend on the age category of visitors and on the type of excursion (with or without a guide). </p><p>  In the park you can take a tour around the flooded quarry, as well as the existing workings that have been preserved nearby, go boating or dive into the underground labyrinths with scuba gear.  The pedestrian trail laid around the quarry has specially equipped viewing platforms from which you can endlessly admire the beauties of local nature. </p><p>  In addition, in the vicinity of Ruskeala, you can see the Italian quarry, the existing Evangelical Lutheran temple, as well as Ruskeala waterfalls and Ruskeala failure, visit the 18th-century cemetery with tombstones made of local marble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marble canyon ruskeala karelia prices" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/283879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Karelia.</strong>  <strong>Marble Canyon.</strong>  <strong>How to get there</strong> </p><p>  You can get to the <span>Marble quarry</span> both from Petrozavodsk and from St. Petersburg.  Buses and fixed-route taxis run from the northern capital to the village of Sortvala and back.  You can also take a train to Kaalamo or Sortvala Station. </p><p>  But the most convenient way to get there is by car.  The distance along the highway from St. Petersburg is about 300 km, and from Petrozavodsk - 250 km. </p><p>  This man-made object is rightfully considered one of the most interesting places that Karelia is so famous for.  The marble canyon, which appeared as a result of human intervention in nature, not only did not disturb the <span>ecological balance,</span> but even made the local landscape a little more beautiful. </p>
