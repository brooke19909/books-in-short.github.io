  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Old Russian culture, the sources of its occurrence and development paths</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Slavs are a huge group of peoples occupying vast territories in Europe and Asia.  These include Poles, Czechs, Bulgarians, Serbs, Croats, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others.  Each of these ethnic groups has its own history and culture.  This article will focus on the culture of the Eastern Slavs, Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians. </p><p>  The Old Russian state began to form in the second half of the 9th century.  These were extraordinary and difficult years.  The Slavs, who inherited the religion, life and customs of their ancestors, lived in harmony with nature, worshiped the gods of nature and phenomena, such as <span>the sun god Dazhd-god, the god of</span> Thunder and Lightning Perun, the <span>god of the wind</span> Stribog and others.  People lived simply, were mainly engaged in agriculture, cattle breeding, and in forest zones hunting and gathering.  To protect themselves from the enemy and to conduct their activities more successfully, they created disparate communities, all important matters in which were decided by the council of elders or veche. </p><p>  To create any buildings, people, especially those who lived in the forest strip, used a tree.  I must say that the skilful and talented Russian people created parts of wooden houses that were unique in artistic design, carved platbands, similar to thin lace, decorated skates of roofs and shutters with intricate patterns.  Plots were taken from the Russian epic or were closely intertwined with people's ideas about nature and natural phenomena.  The culture of the Slavs included oral narratives, legends and epics, passed from mouth to mouth.  Often they were sung by special gusli singers or storytellers who narrated in a chant.  According to one source, the Slavs did not have written language, only nodular writing existed.  But other sources claim that writing was still there.  It was based on the ancient Greek alphabet, and it was on it that the famous Veles book was written.  The debate about the authenticity of this cultural monument has not subsided so far, but be that as it may, the book existed.  Religious rites of the Slavs are also interesting, including chants, round dances, and various sacrifices to their gods, even human ones.  That was the foundation of ancient Russian culture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the second half of the 9th century, drastic changes began to take place in the life of the Slavs.  The death of Prince Svyatoslav was the beginning of a power struggle between his sons.  Oleg dies at the hands of his brother Yaropolk, who, in turn, is killed by illegitimate Vladimir.  Having become the sovereign ruler, he seeks to win the love of the people and stop civil strife, thereby strengthening the ancient Russian state.  Raised on the dogma of paganism, Vladimir first sacredly follows this religion, erects a pantheon of gods familiar and revered from childhood on the Kiev temple, even legitimizes human sacrifices. </p><p>  Such a policy absolutely does not suit the Byzantine Empire, strong at that time, which had long since ended the original gods and converted to Christianity.  In order for Vladimir to prosper in the future, Vladimir needs cooperation with his powerful neighbor.  Under the pressure of circumstances, the prince renounces the faith of his ancestors and adopts Christianity.  This stage was a turning point.  The culture of the ancient Russian state, having received the fresh breath of a new, hitherto unfamiliar culture, begins to change and transform. </p><p>  Changes affected absolutely all areas.  In Christianity, open-air services do not take place; for this, temples are being erected.  In the temples there is always painting.  To conduct church services, various church books are needed.  All this required new knowledge and new technologies.  Old Russian culture began to develop immediately in many directions.  In the cities began the construction of temples.  Some of them were built in the old way, from wood, but under the guidance of Greek masters, Russian architects learn the art of building structures from stone.  A vivid example of this is the Church of the Tithes and <span>St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, St. Sophia Cathedral in</span> Novgorod, Trinity <span>Cathedral</span> in Pskov and many others.  The art of icon painting, mosaic and mural painting is being mastered.  Plots were mainly taken from church writings.  Princes and important events in the life of the people were also depicted.  Simultaneously with the construction of stone temples, the construction of stone walls, palaces and noble houses began to develop.  Now unique patterns and carvings were made of stone, but were as skillful and unusually beautiful as before in wood. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cadres were needed to serve in the new churches and for the enormous enlightenment that was conducted among the population, who for many years remained in the soul of the Gentiles.  Therefore, the construction of monasteries began rapidly.  Old Russian culture owes much of its development to the monks, who at that time were considered the most enlightened layer of society.  The first monks arrived all from the same Greece.  But local theologians quickly adopted knowledge and soon themselves carried the word of God to the people.  The most famous of them are <span>Kiev Hilarion,</span> Novgorod Luka Zhidyata, Pechersky Theodosius, as well as the monk Nestor, who wrote his "The Tale of Bygone Years", Nikon and others. </p><p>  Along with architecture and theology, writing and typography developed.  Some scholars believe that <span>writing in Russia</span> appeared with the adoption of Christianity, when two brothers, Cyril and Mythodius, who arrived from Thessaloniki, created the alphabet on which the first church books were written.  Other researchers are of the opinion that their Cyrillic alphabet is just an improved Glagolitic that existed before the advent of Christianity.  Proof of this is the inscription found in Preslav on the Glagolitic dating from 893, while Vladimir was baptized only in 988.  Nevertheless, since the end of the 9th century, many Greek books, Jewish and Syriac texts, for example, Alexandria about Alexander the Great, chronicles of Amartol and Sinkell, Esther, and many others, have been translated into Russian.  Old Russian culture is rich in domestic unique literary creations.  One of the most famous is the ‚ÄúWord about Igor‚Äôs regiment‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúThe Life of Boris and Gleb‚Äù, ‚ÄúKiev Pechersky Patericon‚Äù, ‚ÄúWalking‚Äù of Daniel the Father Superior and others.  So, along with church books, biographies of princes and military leaders appear, tales of glorious and inglorious campaigns, epics and myths are recorded. </p><p>  In addition to literature, architecture and church painting, all crafts received a new direction in development.  Jewelers create unique in beauty and complexity decorations, potters dishes, which are decorated with interesting ornaments, Russian folklore develops. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the culture of Russia is that, having gained new knowledge and new forms in <span>art, the Russian</span> people did not deviate from their traditions, thereby bringing their unique flavor to architecture, painting, music, and all crafts. </p>
