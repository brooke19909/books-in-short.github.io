In total, on the Kamchatka Peninsula, only the largest exits of thermal springs are about 150. </p><p>  Twenty kilometers from the city of Yelizovo are wonderful baths.  This place is located near the Pinachevsky field of hydrogen sulfide waters.  A dispensary equipped with several hydrogen sulfide baths has been built here. </p><p>  These sources were called Zelenovsky Lakes. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.2881507" data-lng="158.34882830000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/4/6/5/18465.png"></div><h2>  Kamchatka </h2><p>  In other regions of the country, hydrogen sulfide water is formed during the interaction of organic sediments with sulfur-containing rocks with the mandatory participation of biogenic factors.  In the case of Kamchatka, such conditions of formation are absent.  However, there is a widespread release of hydrogen sulfide of volcanic origin, but here the conditions for the formation of therapeutic sources are not very favorable.  Today, only 4 groups of sources are known - the Pinachevsky, Ozernovsky, Sivuchinsky and Drankinsky, where, along with hydrogen sulfide in their waters, there are other components that are useful in treatment. </p><p>  In the Paratunka River Valley, 3 groups of hot springs stand out.  They come to the surface 70 kilometers from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and represent the core of the Paratunsky recreational zone.  In the village of the same name, which has turned into a large balneological resort, there are Nizhne-Paratunsky springs, in the vicinity of which recreation centers, guest houses and hotels are built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another of the most popular and affordable in Kamchatka are the keys located at Yelizovo - Zelenovsky Lakes.  This place is also one of the most visited in Kamchatka.  The therapeutic effect is mainly achieved due to the content of hydrogen sulfide and radon in the water. </p><p>  Many Kamchatka springs are used by people for health improvement or just for pleasant spending time of rest.  Relaxing in the water is an incomparable pleasure, especially in the winter season.  And after taking such baths, the sensations become simply fantastic.  Especially for the course of treatment, they rarely come to hot springs, however, plans for many tourist routes in the Kamchatka Territory include their visit. </p><p>  More detailed information about these places is presented later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photogoroda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Elizovo" class="if uuid-3261717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3261717.jpg"></div><h2>  General information about the city of Yelizovo </h2><p>  The village is located on the banks of the river.
