By creating beautiful, unique, exclusive things with your own hands, getting a huge amount of positive emotions both from the process of creativity and from the final result.  Here knitting, for example, allows you to create an <span>openwork jacket with knitting needles, patterns and description of</span> which can be very, very different, and get new things to any wardrobe. </p><h2>  Jackets, sweatshirts, cardigans </h2><p>  People knit things from time immemorial.  Scientists have found that already in Ancient Egypt, such a kind of needlework as knitting was developed.  And the jacket, familiar to everyone, comfortable, homely, comes from there.  Modern fashion actively operates with all kinds of clothing models, combining them with each other, offering unusual solutions for a particular wardrobe item. </p><p>  It is often very difficult to understand the difference between similar types of clothing.  For example, what is the difference between a <span>sweater, jacket,</span> cardigan?  This question cannot have an absolutely unequivocal answer, there are only some nuances that actively disappear under the onslaught of the imagination of fashion designers.  For example, an openwork jacket with knitting needles, the patterns and description of which you especially liked, can not always be considered that type of clothing, but will more closely correspond, for example, to a cardigan. </p>

    <h2>  Jacket Features </h2><p>  A jacket is not a wardrobe item that is too distinctive from other similar types of clothes.  If you try to find the differences of the jacket, then it should be something like a coat, since the word "jacket" has its roots in French and means "jacket" in translation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But models of jackets are the most different variations: with a collar and without a collar, with buttons with a double-breasted or single-breasted fastener, with a zipper, fitted and straight, short and long, with different styles of sleeves.  The only and, perhaps, the most remarkable version of the jacket will be a model invented by the legendary female fashion designer Coco Chanel.  Her variation on women's clothing, called a jacket, is a shortened tweed jacket, with a rounded neckline, no collar, with patch pockets, buttons, and a length to the thigh line. </p><p>  The silhouette of this model can also change - the length of the sleeves and the length of the shelves, the number of pockets - 2 or 4, buttons or zippers.  But still, it is the Chanel jacket that remains the most recognizable among all.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is an elongated jacket or a short one, but it is not difficult to knit such a model with knitting needles, even with lace, even with jacquard, or even with interlocking loops. </p>

    <h2>  Highlight Jacket </h2><p>  Learning to knit is not difficult.  The maximum diligence and diligence, the ability to read patterns and correctly see the loops in the drawing - this is the basis of beautiful work on knitting needles or crochet.  A variety of models of jackets can be created using yarn and knitting needles.  They can be summer, light, and can be very warm, voluminous. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, an openwork jacket with knitting needles.  Schemes and job descriptions to choose from a huge number of models is not difficult.  But for this you need to decide what the pattern and cut of the jacket should be.  An extended jacket may have different lengths.  It can sink both to the middle of the thigh and reach almost the ankle.  A short jacket can also be knitted in various ways. </p><p>  Openwork on knitted clothes can be very complex, multifaceted, although in some things simple paths from holes look very nice.  Knitting pattern holes are made with the help of yarn: </p><ol><li>  Knit five stitches, make 1 crochet, 3 stitches together, make 1 crochet again. </li><li>  All loops need to be knitted purl. </li><li>  All loops are facial. </li><li>  All loops are purl again. </li><li>  Repeat from 1 to 4 rows. </li></ol><p>  If the yarn overlay is displaced, for example, by one loop in each 5th row, the track will be inclined.  From the yarn and 2 loops knitted together, the vast majority of lace patterns are built, which are ideal for making a summer jacket. </p>

    <h2>  Basics of Knitting </h2><p>  Although knitted things are universal, yet they for the most part should correspond to the size of the one who wears them.  Therefore, when knitting, one should adhere to either the already developed description, which indicates the number of loops and rows of the figure for all the details of the clothes, or to develop such a scheme independently, in accordance with the features of a particular figure.  The latter is a rather laborious task.  Therefore, choosing <span>knitting an openwork</span> jacket with knitting needles, you should choose the size, knitting needles and yarn that are indicated in the description as accurately as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The simplest jacket </h2><p>  There are many ways and patterns to knit an openwork jacket.  Schemes and description of models will tell you in detail how to cope with such work, and you will surely get a beautiful and high-quality result.  One of the simplest models is a shortened jacket with lace straps.  For this model, you will need yarn in which a 50-gram skein contains 115 meters of thread, number 4 knitting needles, a button or an air clasp.  The size of the finished jacket is 44. </p><p>  So, we knit a short jacket, back: </p><ul><li>  For the back you need to dial 112 loops.  Then knit 10 cm with the front surface, adding 1 loop at the edges. </li><li>  Make another such increase at a height of 4 cm = 116 stitches. </li><li>  After 10 cm, at a height from the set edge of 24 cm, it is necessary to close for the armholes of the sleeves in each second row 1 time 5 loops, 2 times 2 loops, 4 times 1 loop.  On the knitting needles will remain 90 loops. </li><li>  When the height of the armhole reaches 21 cm, remove the middle 22 loops from the pin, and finish off both shoulders separately as follows: on the edge of the neck, cut 2 times 2 loops and 1 time 1 loop, knit evenly to the end of the back. </li><li>  At the same time, the shoulder should be knitted: on the side of the armhole in each 2nd row, close 3 times 7 loops and 1 time 8 loops of the shoulder.  Knit the second shoulder similarly. </li></ul><p>  For the shelf: </p><ul><li>  Dial 43 loops, knit, making increases, as on the back, only one edge. </li><li>  At a height of 21 cm from the bottom, begin to knit the neck as follows: reduce 1 loop in each 4 rows 7 times, then in each 6 row 8 times. </li><li>  I knit the sleeve out the same way as on the back, starting from a height of 24 cm from the edge of the product. </li><li>  Tie the shoulder line as follows: at the height of the armhole of 21 cm, in each 2 row close 8 loops twice.  The second shelf fits in the same way. </li></ul><p>  Sleeves: </p><ul><li>  We start with a set of 60 loops.  Knit with front stitch, adding 1 loop on each side in each 5 row, until 86 are on the knitting needles. </li><li>  With a sleeve length of 21 cm, begin to knit the okat: on both sides, in each 2nd row, close 1 time 5 loops, 2 times - 2 loops, 18 times - 1 loop, 1 time - 2 loops and 1 time - 3 loops. </li><li>  After 15 cm of okat of the sleeve, the remaining loops must be closed.  Both sleeves are knitted equally. </li></ul><p>  To assemble, lay out all parts on a flat surface, moisten slightly and allow to dry.  Then all sew them together.  To decorate on the left and right shelves, you need to tie an openwork strip by typing loops on the knitting needles along the edge of the product.  You can knit, for example, with the pattern suggested in the photo. </p>

    <p>  <span>You can, if you wish, crochet a lace border, and if knitting is still being mastered and complex patterns are a problem, you can buy a suitable lace lace 6 centimeters wide at the store and sew it with threads matching the color.</span>  <span>Sew a button and buttonhole or air clasp at the level of the beginning of the neck.</span> </p><h2>  Light and smart jackets </h2><p>  A jacket is a universal thing in the sense that it can be both winter and summer, for thin women and for ladies in the body.  In addition, a properly knitted jacket can correct the flaws of the figure - a full waist and hips, short stature. <strong> </strong>  Summer openwork jackets can hide from the sun, and can warm in a cool evening.  The most important thing is to choose the right yarn for the job. </p><p>  For sunny hot days, yarn made from natural cotton or linen is best.  But on a cool evening, you should take a jacket from thin mohair or angora with you for a walk.  Moreover, if you knit such an openwork jacket with knitting needles, thin threads, it will be airy and warm. </p>

    <h2>  Openwork simple and complex </h2><p>  The pattern for fluffy yarn should not be made too complicated, it will still be poorly visible.  For such a product, lace rapports simple in pattern, repeating through the same number of rows and loops, are most suitable.  You can use lace here as a trim, and in this case, the jacket can be worn in a cool autumn, without scaring the surrounding body, passing through the fluffy holes of the picture. </p>

    <p>  The yarn is even and smooth, silky, allows you to use a complex pattern in the product.  Openwork in this case will consist of repeating motifs or it will be built throughout the panel of the shelf, back or sleeve.  This case requires the exact following of the drawing of the scheme, because the lines of the armholes, sleeves, and necks should be included in the openwork pattern with its crochets, double and built loops. </p>

    <h2>  Knitting needles </h2><p>  Knitwear can serve for a very long time, be a decoration of the wardrobe, if properly looked after.  Care comes down to washing, drying, ironing and storage.  Wash knitted items in warm water with gentle detergents, best with your hands.  If machine washable, then things should be put in a special bag. </p><p>  Dry such clothes in a straightened form, gently squeezing in a clean towel or sheet.  Openwork jacket can be ironed with steam, holding the iron on weight, or with the help of a steamer, from the wrong side.  It should be stored by carefully folding it and placing it in a bag with a sachet of moths.  Hang it on the shoulders is not worth it, as the canvas will stretch and deteriorate.  So a knitted openwork jacket with knitting needles, the patterns and description of which are chosen to taste and executed with care and zeal, will bring a lot of pleasure at any time of the year in any setting. </p>
