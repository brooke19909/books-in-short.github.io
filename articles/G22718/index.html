This not only allows you to have fun, but also develops logical thinking skills, the ability to analyze the situation, count points, as well as attention, perseverance, memory, because you need to not only be able to correctly add points to each player, but also learn the rules of the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/247064729527822408/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Games for Two" class="if uuid-2229169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2229169.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs also convenient to take <span>playing cards</span> with you on vacation: to nature, to the sea, to the train.  They occupy a minimum of places, and give the maximum pleasure from the game.  In the article, we will consider several interesting card games for two.  Some of you may already know, and some will meet for the first time.  Try to master new options for the game, remember the long-forgotten games of your childhood. </p><h2>  "Witch" </h2><p>  Before starting the game from the deck you need to get one of the ladies.  After shuffling, the cards are distributed equally among the players.  The last unpaired goes to the one who handed out.  "Witch" is the scariest card, of course, this is the queen of spades.  When playing a card game for two, the players immediately understand who got it, but this does not matter, the situation can change dramatically after the first move. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alixbranwyn.deviantart.com" data-author=": Alix Branwyn, " data-source="https://alixbranwyn.deviantart.com/art/Queen-of-Spades-279213797"><img itemprop="image" alt="card games for two 36 cards" class="if uuid-2229204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2229204.jpg"></div><p>  To begin with, each player searches for paired cards and sets the pairs aside.  For example, two tens, two aces, two jacks.  Only single images remain in the hand.  In such a card game for two, the rules are as follows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first player holds his cards in his outstretched shirts to the second player.  He draws from the fan one of the cards, any, as he wishes.  If he formed a pair, he immediately sets it aside. </p><p>  Then comes the turn of another player to draw a card.  A witch may also get caught.  The player who has the Queen of Spades left is losing. </p><h2>  "I believe - I do not believe" </h2><p>  This is one of the most fun card <span>games for two.</span>  You can play in a big company.  All cards are dealt to the players.  The goal of the game is to collect all available fours of cards, for example, if a player has 4 sixes in his hands, he gets rid of them, putting them aside.  The winner is the one who quickly stays empty-handed. </p><h2>  How to play? </h2><p>  The first move is made by the player who was the dealer.  He puts 1, 2, 3 or 4 cards in the middle of the table, ‚Äúshirts‚Äù up, and announces what kind of cards these are, for example, 2 ladies.  Another player looks at his cards and realizes that he cannot have two ladies, since he has three on his hands.  Then he replies: "I do not believe!"  The first player takes the cards back.  The move is transmitted.  The main intrigue is that you can deceive your opponent in every possible way, throwing up completely different cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.theory11.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://store.theory11.com/products/tycoon-playing-cards"><img itemprop="image" alt="card games rules 36 cards for two" class="if uuid-2230144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2230144.jpg"></div><p>  For example, six and eight are laid out on the table, and the player says that he posted two aces.  You can believe him, even if you know that he is cheating.  In this case, the second player puts his one or two cards, then announces that he also put two aces.  Now it‚Äôs the turn to doubt the veracity of the first player.  The opponent can say: "I do not believe!" </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you turn over the cards, everyone sees that there really are two aces, then the player takes the whole buy to himself.  In this case, he can really get aces, collecting all four cards, he lays them aside.  The one who first got rid of all the cards wins. </p><h2>  "Drunkard" </h2><p>  This is a favorite card game for two for children.  All cards are dealt in half.  They take turns taking one card in the middle of the table.  The opponent must lay out his own, without looking at its face value, and holding all the cards in the pile ‚Äúshirts‚Äù up.  The one whose card is big wins.  The largest card is an ace, then a king, queen, jack and ten.  The rest correspond to a numerical value. </p><div class="photo" data-original="giftsforcardplayers.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://giftsforcardplayers.com/how-can-i-clean-my-playing-cards/"><img itemprop="image" alt="card games for two rules" class="if uuid-2229180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2229180.jpg"></div><p>  If two identical cards are dealt, then a "dispute" begins.  First, the player puts another ‚Äúshirt‚Äù up on each of his cards, then the second, but already on the side on which the value of the card is visible.  The one with the top one is larger takes all 6 cards.  An ace may lie inside.  There is already someone lucky. </p><p>  The one with the most cards wins.  You can play such a card game for two with 36 cards for a long time, since the situation is constantly changing, then one player has an advantage, then another.  All cards that are won as a result of moves are put in a pack from the bottom. </p><h2>  "Clabor" </h2><p>  This card game for two is considered analytical, since you need to think over the moves in advance, take risks or pass, depending on the face value of the cards that the player got after the deal.  They play it up to 501 points.  Before the start of the game, you need to prepare a pencil and a piece of paper, draw a table and write down all the points won in the game.  After each move, they are summed up and the total number of points is displayed.  The winner is the first to score 501 points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cognitiveinvesting.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://cognitiveinvesting.com/2012/12/18/what-makes-investing-difficult-to-learn-part-2/playing-cards/"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting card games for two" class="if uuid-2229188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2229188.jpg"></div><p>  Six cards are dealt to each player, three more are on the table in front of the players.  The rest are put in a deck and a trump card is set, as in the game in "Fool".  The cost of the pictures is as follows: ace - 11, ten - 10, king - 4, queen - 3, jack - 2, trump jack "male" - 20, trump nine "manela" - 14. If you come across a trump king and queen ("bella" ), then the cost of this pair is 20, the last, that is, the last trick is 10, if the player gets any three cards in a row, for example, 9, 10, jack or queen, king, ace, then the cost of such a set (‚Äútertz‚Äù) is 20 , but there‚Äôs also fifty dollars - it‚Äôs 5 cards in a row, as in the photo above - 50 points.  But if you are lucky and get 7 consecutive cards - this is a "club", that is, you automatically won the game. </p><h2>  Rules of the game </h2><p>  You also need to know that before the start of the game, all small cards up to nine are postponed.  After the first 6 cards are dealt, the player assesses his chances of success and looks at how many extra points he is able to score, and announces that he is playing or passing.  If the second player also refuses to play and says: ‚ÄúPass!‚Äù, Then the first one has a chance to win.  He can declare his trump card and play on.  After that they take the remaining three cards to their pack.  The game begins. </p><p>  Go on one card.  The opponent must answer with a big card of the same suit.  If not, then go trump card, if there is not it, then you can discard any unnecessary card, such as nine.  She is worth nothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life-games.net" data-author=": " data-source="http://life-games.net/index/durak_perevodnoj/0-172"><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Games for Two Adults" class="if uuid-2229167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2229167.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the player to receive reward points for the cards, you must take at least one trick.  If you did not succeed, then the glasses burn out.  If the winner is not the player who played, but the one who said: ‚ÄúPass!‚Äù, Then all the points go to the opponent. </p><p>  If a player has ‚Äúbella‚Äù or ‚Äútertz‚Äù in his hands, but sees in advance that he will not take a single trick, he does not declare them, that is, prize points are not considered to the opponent who won the game, they have the usual cost, like simple cards. </p><p>  But if you want prize points to be counted, you must announce during the course that you have these sets of cards and present them by showing them to your opponent at the beginning of the game. </p><h2>  Point (or 21) </h2><p>  One of the most popular card games for two adults is considered to be the "Point", otherwise called "Twenty-one."  This is a simple game, the rules are simple, a lot depends on luck.  One player holds a deck of cards and gives out one opponent.  He counts the points.  He needs to score the number of points close to the number 21. It is better to score less than sort out.  If, as a result of the count, the player realizes that he has gone through the cards, then he must definitely say that.  Then the opponent automatically wins. </p><p>  If you are lucky, and when calculating, you get exactly 21 points, then you also become a winner.  If you have, for example, 20 points, but your opponent has 18, then you won.  There is one more feature.  If two aces have fallen, then this is also a victory, although the points are too much.  This is called the "banker's point." </p><p>  In the article, we talked about the rules of card games for 36 cards for two.  Play with pleasure! </p>
