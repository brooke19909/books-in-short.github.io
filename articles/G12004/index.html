According to the highest law, this format of government power was to replace the Congress of Soviets that had functioned earlier, and with it the Executive State Committee.  The Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation was elected at the end of 1937.  It included nearly 1,200 deputies representing their republics and regional administrative units.  The term of office of this first convocation in connection with the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War was the longest in the entire history of the existence of this body.  The next election took place only in February 1946.  The cadet of the deputy corps lasted four years; after the 1974th meeting, it lasted five years.  The last convocation of the government council, elected in 1989, was dissolved ahead of schedule in connection with the formal abolition of the state status of the Soviet country.  Those citizens who were twenty-three years old at the time of the ballot could be elected here.

    <p>  Government functioning </p><p>  The higher government <span>education of the Soviet Union</span> consisted of two absolutely equal chambers.  They were the so-called Council of Nationalities, as well as the Council of the Union.  Both of these chambers equally possessed the rights of <span>legislative initiatives.</span>  If, on the same issue, disagreements arose between them, the issue was considered by a special commission formed on an equal footing from representatives of the chambers.  At the head of this rather bulky authority was the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.  He was already elected to the Council at the beginning of each of his cadences at a joint meeting. </p>

However, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (for example, such famous personalities as Kalinin, Brezhnev, Andropov, Gorbachev), the Secretary of the Presidium, its members and deputies, were surely present here.  Actually, it was the Presidency that held the supreme right of ratification, denunciation and other acts in the system of international relations.  Of course, with the approval of the Supreme Council.
