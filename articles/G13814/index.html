Review of life "on the volcano"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Somewhere in the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea,</span> almost at the <span>Gulf of Naples,</span> sung by poets and artists, there is a small island created by <span>volcanic eruptions.</span>  Ever since the time of Julius Caesar, it is famous as a resort that can restore youth and give beauty.  To get there, you must first fly to or arrive in Naples, and from there sail by ferry.  There are several cities.  Even its capital is Ischia.  The review of tourists who have visited here makes us understand that it is in this city that a beginner should settle in to begin acquaintance with the sights.  After all, the capital (of the same name with the island) is divided, as it were, into two halves.  One of them is called Ponte, and the second - Porte.  History has left its mark on literally every corner of this island.  The former luxury of Rome and the traces of Saracen power, the threat of eruptions and Mediterranean color - all here await guests and tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ischia review" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/265279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Ischia.</strong>  <strong>Review of active vacationers about attractions</strong> </p><p>  History buffs are advised to visit the local archaeological museum of the capital, where you can see many interesting exhibits dedicated to the antiquities of the island.  However, the most worthy and popular place for tourists, of course, is the castle of the Kings of Aragon.  This huge complex is barely crowded on a tiny cliff near the main island.  Now you can get there on the bridge.  By the way, the name of the second half of the capital, Ischia Ponte, is connected with this place.  And in another district of her, near the port, there are many beautiful and cozy restaurants and free (which is rare for Italy) beaches.  The castle is very picturesque, and its fortresses and walls seem to climb sharp stones.  In the summer you can visit the beautiful botanical garden "La Mortella".  Of course, it is very small, this <span>island of Ischia.</span>  The reviews of the people who examined it, however, tell us that there is another curious garden, which also must be visited, Ravino, with exotic plants and living sculptures created from cacti.  It is even more attractive for tourists, especially those who come with children.  You can make real Italian shopping on the main shopping street of the capital - Via Corso Vittoria Colonna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Ischia.</strong>  <strong>Feedback from tourists about the local volcanoes and their health benefits</strong> </p><p>  Of course, there are fire-breathing mountains on this island.  As many as three - Epomeo, Trubotti and Monte Vezzi.  They are low, but woke up in the sixteenth century.  However, vacationers write that it is these formidable volcanoes that are the main reason that tourists come to the island.  Indeed, because of their ‚Äúlatent‚Äù activities, it is warm at any time of the year.  And of the useful substances, which are many in the local clay and frozen magma, Ischia is famous for cosmetics and therapeutic rubbing, which treat diseases of the joints, back and nerves.  And of course, Ischia is also famous for the thermal waters.  A review of the local saunas allows us to highly recommend them for a visit.  By the way, they have gained immense popularity in Italy since the 16th century thanks to the discoveries of Calabrian physicians.  Some of these waters - for example, the source of Nitrodi - are even considered miraculous.  In general, there are even whole thermal parks with many services and medical complexes.  Especially good are the "Gardens of Poseidon" with eighteen pools of different temperatures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ischia hotels reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/265288.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Where to live: Italy, Ischia</strong> </p><p>  Hotels, reviews of which, as a rule, are not bad, are located both in the capital and in small towns.  If you want to travel not only around the island, but also to the nearby <span>regions of Italy,</span> then it is better to settle in Ischia Port.  In this case, a bonus will be not only the immediate proximity to the sea and restaurants (local odes with fish and rabbit should be written in a separate ode), but also with ferries.  They regularly depart from here to Naples, Sorrento and Capri.  And if you want a budget holiday, it is better to take a hotel in the center of the main city.  You can get there inexpensively and even with half board.  Moreover, hotel food is in no way inferior to restaurant food, and even cheaper. </p>
