    <h2>  Sosnovy Bor: history </h2><p>  When a settlement was founded on the territory of a modern city is unknown.  However, in 1676, a village called Ustia was already indicated on the map of Ingermanland, compiled by A.I. Bergenheim according to Swedish travelers.  Much later, the village of Kalische appeared nearby.  Both settlements were unremarkable, except for the proximity to the magnificent pine forest. </p><p>  By 1956, the USSR Council of Ministers decided to build the LenGRES-16 thermal power station in the region of the Kalishche railway station.  A program was also developed for launching up to 4 nuclear plants until 1960, including in the Leningrad Region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1956, the first survey party arrived in Ustya, and in 1958 a workers' village began to be built.  At the same time, when developing his plan, they tried to inflict minimal damage to green spaces, therefore, in many microdistricts, huge trees grow for hundreds of years right in the courtyards.  Over time, it grew and was called Sosnovy Bor.  The status of the city was assigned to him in 1973, and at the moment this settlement covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã72 square meters.  km, and 67.6 thousand people live there permanently. </p><p>  When asked what to see in Sosnovy Bor, locals usually call it the most interesting sights. </p><h2>  Naval museum </h2><p>  If this is your first visit to Sosnovy Bor, it is better to start sightseeing when you go to the old part of the city.  For example, at ul.  Afanasyev, 50 is a village hut, which once belonged to the veteran of the Great Patriotic and Finnish Wars P. Ya. Yakkonen.  It houses an exposition of a small museum dedicated to the history of these places in the 19th and in the 20th century.  In this case, the main emphasis is placed on the disclosure of the theme of the participation of local residents in the wars of past centuries.  In the museum there is a monument to the defenders of the Fatherland, which annually hosts events dedicated to the Great Victory Day. </p>

    <h2>  Malaya Koporskaya Fortress </h2><p>  Sosnovy Bor (adult attractions see above) pleases children with other unusual entertainments.  For example, in the courtyard formed by houses N 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 on Leningradskaya Street a children's town was built, stylized as an old kid‚Äôs.  It consists of several stone turrets and an iron slide, along which the kids get into the pool. </p><h2>  Koporskaya fortress </h2><p>  Everyone who visits these lands is recommended to visit a unique monument of Russian defensive art, located just 24 km from Sosnovy Bor.  Koporye fortress was founded in the 13th century and was repeatedly rebuilt and strengthened.  It is well preserved, and today you can see powerful walls and towers 20 meters high.  By the way, against the background of the Koporskaya fortress some scenes of Three Musketeers were filmed. </p>

    <h2>  Fort Krasnaya Gorka </h2><p>  Although the city of Sosnovy Bor, the sights of which can be seen in the photo above, is quite young, several objects built at the beginning of the last century have been preserved on its territory and in the vicinity.  For example, you can visit Fort Krasnaya Gorka there.  It was built in 1915.  In World War I, it was mined, but it was not blown up.  Therefore, during the Finnish campaign, the guns of the fort took part in the artillery attacks of <span>the Mannerheim line.</span>  The fortifications were also useful during the Second World War, when during the defense of the Oranienbaum bridgehead the headquarters of the Soviet command was organized there.  By the way, little people know that after the revolution, fort officers rebelled, which was crushed by a detachment of Red Army soldiers led by Joseph Stalin. </p><p>  Now you know why Sosnovy Bor is interesting.  The history and sights of the city are also known to you.  And if, despite the border zone regime, you find yourself in those parts, you can see them and also relax on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. </p>
