  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Finnish park, Pskov - attractions and modern entertainment in the city center</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>Pskov</span> Finnish <span>Park</span> is located on the left bank of the Pskov River, between Militseyskaya Street and the pedestrian and Engineering bridges, actually in the center.  Reconstruction work carried out not so long ago put this recreation area on a par with the Children's Park. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Work on the arrangement of the recreation area began in the 80s of the last century.  The architectural part of the project was done by a Finnish specialist.  And this is not at all accidental.  Pskov has a Finnish twin city, Kuopio.  This is due to the fact that earlier the Finns built up this part of the city.  Therefore, the Finnish park of Pskov has the second name ‚ÄúKuopio‚Äù.  There is a similar recreational area in the Finnish twin city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pln-pskov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View at the Geldtovaya bath" class="if uuid-2316870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2316870.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights and beautiful views </h2><p>  There are many ancient buildings left in the park.  The most valuable are the remains of fortifications preserved from the Northern War, which began in 1700.  There are remnants of a civilian building - Cook Mills. </p><p>  Walking along the paths of the Finnish park in Pskov, you can enjoy the beauties of the city.  From the banks of the river offers a magnificent view of the Kremlin. </p><p>  Vacationers are attracted by a beautiful wooden fence near a dilapidated building.  But earlier, she was protecting the Geldotov bath, where Gorbachev and Lenin, even Peter I himself, were steaming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The park has many viewing platforms, from which a beautiful view of the church, the Gremyachaya Gora complex and the dam opens.  While walking, you can enjoy the aroma of pine needles, because there are planted pine and spruce. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pln-pskov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Playground &quot;Ship&quot;" class="if uuid-2316864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2316864.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern entertainment </h2><p>  Pskov Finnish Park is a place for families, there are many benches and footpaths.  For sports enthusiasts, bike lanes with a total length of 1,500 meters are organized. </p><p>  A huge platform was built for the children under the name ‚ÄúShip‚Äù.  There are a lot of swings on the territory, the nest-swing is very popular.  But be sure to take all the children to the river, where you can feed the ducks. </p><p>  In addition to feeding birds, in summer you can ride on catamarans or boats to the Gremyachey tower.  For the safety of little vacationers, life vests are issued.  The cost of renting swimming equipment is quite affordable and unchanged since 2012. </p><p>  There is a rope park on the territory, it is located near the recreation center "Snowfall".  You can rent bicycles or rollers at this center.  And in winter you can rent equipment for ice skating or skiing. </p><p>  In the park, you can celebrate a solemn event by renting a gazebo with barbecue and buying on the spot coals for cooking barbecue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pskovgorod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view of the park" class="if uuid-2316874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2316874.jpg"></div><h2>  Landscaping 2017 </h2><p>  In October last year, the Transfiguration project was launched, within the framework of which the Pskov Finnish Park became the so-called experimental site.  The project involves the revival and popularization of an ancient craft - stone carving.  After all, this craft in Russia is almost lost.  Stone figures created by craftsmen from the capital began to appear on the territory.  All are made from local limestone.  To date, 5 figures have been created, although the masters themselves admit that 2 of them are not very successful, therefore they will be redone.  The organizers of the project assured that if the public appreciates the work of craftsmen, then such creations will appear in other parks and squares of the city. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.8223089" data-lng="28.348365400000034" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/4/8/1348.png"></div><h2>  Opening hours and how to get </h2><p>  To take a walk and take a photo in the Pskov Finnish Park, you can come at any time of the day.  However, to rent equipment or gear, you should know the mode of operation: </p><ul><li>  on weekdays - from 15 to 22; </li><li>  on weekends and holidays - from 11 to 22. </li></ul><p>  To get to the park, you can simply walk on foot from the center or from the Hippodrome Street public transport stop.  Park address: 8 Gremyachaya street. </p><p>  From the bus station and railway station you can get to the park area by buses No. 11, 15, 1, and 17. You need to get off at the Summer Garden stop, and then walk a bit along Sverdlov Street in the direction of Vorovsky Street. </p><p>  Coordinates for the GPS navigator: 57.8216978592822, 28.3470191806555. </p><p>  If you need to relax or just walk, breathe fresh air away from the hustle and bustle of dust, then be sure to come to Kuopio Park. </p>
