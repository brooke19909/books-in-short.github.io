Then more! </p><h2>  The perfection of Korean architecture is 300 meters high! </h2><p>  This hotel can probably be considered one of the very first wonders of the world in the world.  And this is no coincidence, since it is the tallest skyscraper and reaches an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 400,000 square meters.  Its name comes from the first name of the capital of North Korea - Pyongyang-Rugen, which means ‚ÄúWillow capital‚Äù in Korean. </p>

But the construction of this miracle of three hundred meters in height on the territory of the Korean People‚Äôs Republic was never carried out.  And to finish, according to the project, its construction was supposed in 2013.  That is why the Rugen Hotel is called the <span>unfulfilled dream of</span> Korean communism.

    <p>  This hotel, as mentioned above, was planned to be built in several cities of the Korean People's Republic, but the construction was completed only in its capital Pyongyang. </p><h2>  Project </h2><p>  The R√ºgen Hotel in Pyongyang completely overshadows the whole appearance of the city, if you look at it from afar, and is a truly architectural excellence in every sense of the word. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The building is a three-section R√ºgen hotel, its area, as already noted above, is almost 400,000 square meters, which is comparable with 67 football fields. </p><p>  At the very top of the R√ºgen hotel there is a conical structure consisting of eight floors, where its guests could dine in 7 revolving restaurants. </p><p>  The project could become a world legend, analogues of which are no longer anywhere.  And this was considered almost the main task of Korean architects - to prove to the whole world that they are able to achieve such heights in construction technology. </p>

Here you will spend an unforgettable vacation! </p><p>  Hotel "Rugen" (Pyongyang, DPRK) - the most powerful building in the world, although not completed in the project, but it is worth it to talk about it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today it is a building frozen in construction, but if any of you have visited or plan to visit the DPRK, in any case, it will not pass by it. </p><h2>  Suspension of construction </h2><p>  The construction of the building stopped in 1992, although its launch was planned in 1989.  This global world project was to open for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. </p><p>  The construction was discontinued due to problems associated with a lack of financial resources, as well as a lack of building materials, many of which were simply substandard. </p><p>  For the construction of the hotel, it was planned to spend about $ 300 million of investments after it became clear that the construction would have to be frozen. </p><p>  However, while this issue was in <span>limbo,</span> a more familiar structure was built on the banks of the Tendongan River, which, of course, was incomparable with the planned project, and its construction took much less cost. </p>

Unfortunately, all the efforts, time and money spent on the construction by architects and initiators, led only to a shattered dream.

    <p>  Thus, only the main part of this legendary building was built, but the windows, communications and all necessary equipment were not brought to a victorious outcome and installed.  In addition, it turned out that the eight-story conical top was built of low-quality materials, which meant that the R√ºgen hotel was forbidden to be put into operation by all rules. </p><h2>  About the hotel </h2><p>  In some ways, the construction that was completed, according to Japanese media, absorbed about 2% of the gross product of the People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, and many media, despite its record in all respects, consider it the most disgusting in the whole world.  But here, as they say, there are so many people, so many opinions. </p><p>  Despite the fact that some even called the hotel "R√ºgen" a "forgotten hotel", it has become perhaps the most popular attraction in the world.  And many tourists came to North Korea just to see the hotel with their own eyes. </p>

    <p>  So, despite the fact that this project turned out to be only a dream of North Korean communism or a truly brilliant idea incomplete to the end, the hotel still received great recognition and admiration throughout the world.  The possible completion of the building was announced in 2008, and at that time laid the foundation for laying a roof previously built from low-quality materials.  According to the planned plan, as many as one hundred thousand rooms were to be built inside the hotel, but the construction was not fully implemented, because only 3,000 were created. </p><h2>  Construction completion </h2><p>  It would seem that after the freezing of construction, all dreams will remain utopian.  And so it was before the onset of 2013.  Modern architects nevertheless decided not to abandon the idea and continue the construction of the ancestor initiators to the end. </p><p>  In 2013, the project was finally brought to its logical conclusion.  Initially, one of the international travel companies, which later planned to launch the hotel as a full-fledged tourist attraction, was trying to finish the construction. </p><p>  She did not want to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the world legend, but her ardor quickly disappeared, which is why she had to leave the project due to pressure on the possibility of implementing this idea from the United States of America. </p><h2>  "The Shard of Science Fiction" </h2><p>  Hotel "Rugen" (North Korea), according to one of the Italian scientists, a place that can be called a fragment of science fiction. </p>

    <p>  This unprecedented height skyscraper is criticized to this day by many media, but despite this, the majority opinion does not depend on this criticism, even that the project was completed after such a long time.  After all, no one has thought to this day that construction will resume.  And in modern times, North Korea, by its general condition, was already able to bring it to the end, given that a variety of new technologies were subject to its development.  For the most part, the hotel, by the way, is criticized by Japan. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the project was brought to an end, it was never put into operation.  It has remained a local <span>Korean attraction,</span> in which, alas, tourists can no longer relax. </p>
