This phenomenon is difficult to explain, because the cost of trips to Spain, Greece or Cyprus is comparable to that in Kemer, Antalya or Side.  In the reviews, our travelers say that Turkey has become for them "native" and "cute." </p><p>  Kemer attracts travelers with its clean pebble beaches with a more transparent Mediterranean Sea, pine trees and mountains, as well as comfortable hotels.  If you believe the reviews, Belport Beach Hotel 4 *, is considered very popular not only among Russian but also among German tourists. </p><h2>  Features of the resort area </h2><p>  Conventionally, Kemer can be divided into two parts.  The first is designed for a quiet and peaceful family vacation, the second is built up with entertainment clubs, disco bars and is popular among young people and beach party lovers. </p><p>  The main criterion according to which travelers choose Kemer among other resorts in Turkey is its proximity to the international airport, a large-pebble beach, a clean and transparent Mediterranean Sea even near the coast (the water does not become muddy from bathing, as on sandy beaches), mountainous terrain with numerous pine trees that grow here almost on the rocks.  The "Stone Belt" extends throughout the Antalya coast. </p><p>  In addition to the main city (Kemer), this resort area includes villages.  The plane usually flies to the airport of Antalya.  The first town that enters the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKemer along the route of the transfer is Beldibi, then tourists will find a stop in Goynuk and in Kemer itself.  Next is the small village of Kirish, followed by Camyuva and the extreme - Tekirova.  All settlements differ from each other in price categories, infrastructure, each has its own unique zest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beldibi area: description, location, hotel base </h2><p>  The international airport is just 15 km away.  This criterion is a priority for tourists who do not want to bore themselves with an additional long transfer after the flight.  The village is located west of Antalya and is divided into the first, second and third districts. </p>

    <p>  The hotel staff will be happy to help tourists make an excursion trip, advise a more suitable route.  It is definitely worth a trip to the church of St. Nicholas.  Interesting trips are offered to the ruins of the ancient settlement of Phaselis, where there are ancient <span>ramparts,</span> defensive structures.  Not far from Beldibi there is an interesting resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGoynuk, where you can wander around the lovely shops, see the Canyon and the Lycian Way.  Tourists enjoy a sightseeing tour of Antalya, during which it is expected to visit waterfalls, inspect the architectural monuments of the old city, etc. </p><h2>  Water activities </h2><p>  Most of all tourists are attracted, of course, by the Mediterranean Sea.  Therefore, the main water activities of Belport Beach Hotel 4 * are concentrated here.  They practice riding a "banana" here - this fun is suitable for people of any age and complexion.  An alternative to banana is a plate.  The principle is the same.  Both that and another quite often turns over, but it does skating even more fun and exciting. </p><p>  A more extreme form of water rides is parachuting.  Takeoff takes place from a boat that develops maximum speed.  As a result, you can climb to a height of about 100-150 meters.  Tourists say the experience is breathtaking. </p><p>  Many are renting jet skis.  On such a scooter, they carefully pick up speed so as not to hurt swimmers.  Then (at a distance of 300-500 m from the coast) it is already possible to accelerate well.  Maneuvering is quite difficult, but you quickly get used to the technique.  Another option for entertainment on the beaches of Beldibi is water skiing.  It is important to be able to maintain balance and balance the body correctly so as not to fall. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  The best way to choose the right hotel is to carefully read the reviews, but draw your own conclusions.  Often comments can be embellished, this reduces the reliability.  You need to understand that a lot is written on emotions. </p><p>  So, what deserves the Belport Beach Hotel 4 * reviews?  Generally positive.  The complex consistently receives from 4 to 5 points out of 5 possible on many sites.  It happens that the rating decreases slightly, but then returns to its position.
