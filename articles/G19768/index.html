Since the country is now in crisis, there are few of them.  But the need for money is not reduced.  Therefore, people have to look for ways out.  And most often, unfortunately, this is a loan.  In order to borrow money from a bank, a potential client must meet a number of requirements.  Usually this is age, length of service, statement of income.  But what should young people do who have problems with many of the above?  There is a way out for them too.  And this is a credit card.  From the age of 20 it is quite possible to get it. </p>

    <h2>  About conditions </h2><p>  Everyone knew that the main line of loan products has always been available only from the age of 21.  But then the requirements were tightened and set a minimum age of 23 years.  Which is logical: by this time, you can certainly accumulate work experience.  This will even work for a person who got a job only after graduation.  Particularly stringent are the requirements for people who are interested in mortgages, long-term loans to buy a car or investing funds. </p><p>  But there is still a credit card.  With 20 years to get it really.  This applies to male clients, girls can go to a bank or credit institution even at the age of 19.  A potential cardholder must also have at least one guarantor.  You will also need a document that confirms the financial solvency of the client.  A certificate in the form of personal income tax form 2, a certificate of receipt of a pension, a scholarship, etc., and proof of seniority (at least 3-6 months) are suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tinkoff </h2><p>  And now you can talk in more detail about where a credit card is issued from the age of 20.  The first bank that is worth noting is Tinkoff.  It allows you to issue a Platinum reel even remotely by sending a request via the Internet.  And then the courier will deliver it directly to the client‚Äôs house. </p><p>  The limit on the Platinum card (Master Card payment system) is 300,000 rubles.  For annual service, a person pays 590 p.  And the decision to approve the application is made on the day of the appeal.  Interest rate - from 24.9 to 34.9 percent per annum.  A fee of 2.9% + 290 rubles from the top is charged for withdrawing money.  For Platinum owners, there is a grace period of 55 days (that is, interest is not charged).  And, most importantly, the minimum age for issuing a card is 18 years. </p><p>  Everything looks pretty attractive.  But there are some nuances.  So, for example, getting a card with a limit of 300,000 rubles at once will be difficult.  The Bank will first establish a ‚Äúceiling‚Äù of 4,000 p, then - at 10,000 p, and then - at 15,000 p.  And this can be understood.  The bank should know how solvent the client is.  And when he is convinced of this, the credit limit will be increased (at the request of a person). </p>

    <h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  This is another popular financial institution in which a credit card is issued from the age of 20.  It is called "100 days without interest."  And the main "highlight" of this credit card is the longest grace period.  What, however, you can guess by looking at the name of the card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The limit is 150,000 rubles, maintenance costs 1,290 r / year.  Interest is quite high - from 26.99% to 33.99%.  And the commission for withdrawing money is 6.9%.  A person can get a credit card upon reaching the age of 18.  It is available both without a chip and with it.  By the way, there are cards that work not only on the "Master Card" system, but also on the "Visa". </p><p>  The bank has a high interest rate, but there is some nuance.  And it consists in the following: the more information a person provides about himself, the higher the probability of obtaining favorable conditions.  And yet - to the received card a person will be able to get three more.  And there is an option to set separate limits for each of them. </p><h2>  Touch bank </h2><p>  The European financial institution OTP Group is known for its remote bank called Touch Bank.  And he offers his potential customers to get a credit card from the age of 20.  And this idea is not bad.  After drawing up a debit card and using it, a person will have the opportunity to use the borrowed funds of a financial organization. </p><p>  The limit is half a million rubles.  There is no need to pay for the service, and the decision on extradition is made on the day of appeal.  Even for withdrawing funds from the card, no commission is charged.  Moreover, a client who owns such a card can use an ATM in any country in our world. </p><p>  <span>The grace period, by the</span> way, lasts 61 days.  And the interest rate starts at just 15.9% (the maximum is 36.9%).  This is one of the most profitable offers on the Russian market.  In addition, the system credits bonuses to the client on the account in the amount of 9% on the balance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Vanguard </h2><p>  One cannot fail to note the attention of this joint-stock commercial organization, talking about banks that give credit cards.  20 years is not a minimum in the case of Vanguard.  Here you can fill out an application at 19. The Bank offers its customers a World Railbonus card, which, when paid, can be used to accumulate miles, which can then be very profitably spent on the purchase of railway and air tickets.  The calculation is as follows: one mile = 30 rubles.  And also ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äù pleases its customers with the accrual of thousands of miles once a year. </p><p>  The card limit is half a million rubles, maintenance costs 1000 r / year.  The application is approved within 3-7 days from the date of its submission.  Annual interest rates range from 21 to 30%.  And the grace period is 50 days. </p><p>  By the way, Avangard is one of the few banks in which a credit card from the age of 20 on the passport is a reality, not a fiction.  Even from 19, to be more precise.  And no more documents are required - just a passport.  Ideal option for students, especially for those who study outside their hometown - miles will definitely not be superfluous.  By the way, if the average monthly cost of a client is 20 tons, then in the future he will be able to issue a <span>Priority Pass</span> card <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  "Credit Bank of Moscow" </h2><p>  This is another organization that gives potential customers the opportunity to get a credit card.  20 years is not a problem.  Indeed, in the "ICD" the established age minimum is adulthood.  That is 18 years old. </p><p>  The limit is 300 tons, maintenance costs 850 rubles a year.  The interest rate varies from 24 to 33%.  To issue a single card from the ICD, only a passport is needed.  An application can be submitted online or at the bank‚Äôs office.  By the way, the above mentioned limit is a minimum.  A person can determine it for himself.  The status of ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù is a limit of 300 tons.  "Gold" - 500 tons  And "Platinum" - <span>800 tons</span> .  The cost of annual maintenance, as well as percentage bonus accruals, will depend on the chosen status. </p><p>  Also, this credit card from 20 years without inquiries gives its users other advantages.  After the first purchase, it is awarded 250 points.  Then they also accumulate.  100 rubles is 7 points.  Savings can be spent on buying airline tickets or paying for hotel reservations. </p><p>  There are many advantages.  But for such a wide range of pleasant features you need to pay with your responsibility.  One day of delay costs 1% of the total debt. </p>

    <h2>  Card from Gazprombank </h2><p>  This organization also makes interesting offers to young people.  She has her own credit cards.
