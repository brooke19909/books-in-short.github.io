The smallest quadrocopter in the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The quadcopter is a kind of square-shaped helicopter, which is controlled by a radio remote control.  Any model is unstable in the air, which is why it requires mechanical control.  It is carried out using a huge number of radio circuits hidden in the computer center of a radio-controlled object.  Total, we have a small device, flying, able to please many radio enthusiasts.  Today, more about drones. </p><h2>  Small quadrocopters: what are they for? </h2><p>  But what if the quadrocopter is reduced in size so that before us is not a huge colossus, but a modest and small square?  Yes, it is possible!  And manufacturers of quadrocopters came to this conclusion in January 2015. </p>

    <p>  Thus, we have a small object that performs the same functions as a large quadrocopter, but less overall, which is of great benefit.  But just what does it give, besides the pleasure of controlling a real helicopter? </p><p>  Children and even adults with such cravings will be happy to receive even the smallest quadrocopter in the world.  The scope of their application is different, but the most common practice is to attach a camera to a flying device. </p><h2>  Quadcopters and camera </h2><p>  The only thing people have dreamed about for a long time (at least this is one of their most cherished dreams) is to look at the world from a bird's eye view or simply create a funny and interesting effect for any video clip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Previously, drones were inaccessible to ordinary people, but now almost everyone can buy quadrocopters.  At the same time, large models are very expensive (about one hundred thousand Russian rubles).  Whether it is their little brothers, whose average price ranges from two to five thousand rubles! </p>

    <h2>  Elements of small drones </h2><p>  <span>The smallest quadrocopter</span> with a camera must have a number of elements, according to which the buyer will make his choice.  Therefore, when you select a device, pay attention to the following symptoms: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a mount for the camera; </li><li>  relay method; </li><li>  if it is a quadrocopter, not intended for shooting, do not forget to learn about control methods; </li><li>  the presence of "entertaining" elements (such as the ability to do tricks and glow). </li></ul><p>  If you be careful when choosing an aircraft, you can buy a device that will last more than one year and will delight you and your loved ones. </p><h2>  Quadrocopter Helix S1102 </h2><p>  One of the most successfully implemented models on the modern radio market is the world's smallest quadrocopter Helix S1102.  It is easy to operate, instructions for use are attached directly to the box with the device itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

In general, the operation of such a device does not require much knowledge in the field of aircraft modeling.  Helix is ‚Äã‚Äãsuitable even for young children who just want to play with a flying toy.

    <p>  The smallest quadrocopter in the world, among other advantages, can perform tricks (as, by the way, the SKEYE model) and glow, while its price practically does not exceed 2000 rubles.  As you can see, not every drone is designed specifically for shooting, because there are also simple radio models, which are already fun to operate.  By the way, Helix S1102 is just one of those! </p><h2>  Quadrocopter Mini Nano </h2><p>  The smallest <span>quadcopter Mini</span> Nano does not have the ability to record and, logically, does not have a camera mount in its device.  But this does not mean that its functionality may end there.  Not at all, because in this case the drone can be used as a regular toy. </p><p>  The smallest quadcopter manufactured by SKEYE weighs only 12 grams and does not have large dimensions.  Because of this, there may be problems with the perception of the device by the wind.  Simply put, getting into a strong storm, such a small device runs the risk of being simply carried away. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the quadrocopter (the smallest in the world) is capable of doing various tricks, for example, spinning in place.  Unfortunately, the charge of such an apparatus does not last long, only 8 minutes, but charging does not take much time.  In addition, it is possible to pre-purchase several sets of batteries.  The main thing is to ensure that the quadrocopter does not fly away from you and is not lost! </p><h2>  Take control with your iPhone </h2><p>  The smallest quadrocopter can sometimes be perceived as an accessory for the iPhone.  In order to carry out radio control from your device, you need to download and install the Flight program in the Apple app store, after which you can control the flight, simply by pressing the buttons on the screen. </p>

    <p>  The smallest quadrocopter controlled from the iPhone is no different from devices controlled by the remote control. </p><h2>  Can I assemble a drone myself? </h2><p>  When there is a problem with the battery life (probably you are not too happy with the battery life), or you are not happy with the size of the memory card you are recording to, then there is reason to work on improving the device.  Fortunately, for this it is enough to have only a little knowledge in the field of radio engineering, so as not to break anything.  However, if you do not possess such skills, you can contact the service center, where experts will help you. </p><p>  In general, the smallest quadrocopter does not have a complex device, and, of course, its body can be unscrewed with a conventional screwdriver if you want to know how everything works.  After this, you need to pay attention to the details that are directly responsible for one or another part of the device and, if possible, replace them with more functional counterparts. </p>

    <p>  However, even if you successfully replace any part of the quadrocopter, there is still a risk that the device will no longer fly due to the incompatibility of the installed elements! </p><h2>  Recommendations when buying a small drone </h2><p>  Of course, if you come to the radio store and say that you want to buy a quadrocopter, you can be fooled by slipping a regular radio-controlled helicopter.  It also happens that specialist consultants have been working in this area not so long ago, therefore they have not yet managed to fully understand this technique and, of course, do not quite understand what you are asking them. </p><p>  That is why when choosing a quadrocopter there are certain recommendations that must be observed in order not to be in an awkward situation and not to create problems for yourself or a negligent consultant.  No one will forbid you to point out a mistake to him, but you should not make a scandal out of it. </p>

    <p>  So, what do you need to pay attention to to buy the smallest quadrocopter with a camera and not fall into the dirt face? </p><ul><li>  As mentioned above, you should not be fought at a small price.  It is very likely that you are offered a regular radio-controlled helicopter, and not the smallest quadrocopter.  It is necessary to check whether there is a mount for the camera on the flying vehicle. </li><li>  If possible, test the quadrocopter.  The smallest drone, for example, can be launched right on the spot.  When going to the store, take a camera with you and read the instructions to know exactly how to mount. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you are familiar with the product‚Äôs functionality and what device it has in the store, you can determine whether you intend to purchase the device.  One way or another, you must remain careful and not throw money away. </p>
