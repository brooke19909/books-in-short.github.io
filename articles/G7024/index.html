    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Melissi Beach Hotel is an elegant high-rise building surrounded by magnificent green territory with an abundance of trees and beautiful bright colors.  Many tourists claim that in the hotel you can find a lot of entertainment for yourself and your children, and if necessary just relax in silence, because the hotel complex is simply riddled with tranquility, which is why it is ideal for families with small children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Melissi Beach Hotel was built a long time ago, like most hotels in Cyprus.  However, in 2002 the hotel complex was completely renovated, its main building is particularly notable for its modern interior and technological innovations.  Here, tourists will find spacious, clean rooms with amenities that can compete in luxury design with five-star luxury hotels. </p><p>  On the territory of the Melissi Beach Hotel are several swimming pools, restaurants, bars and other infrastructure facilities, which are so necessary for a vacation.  In addition, the hotel complex operates on an all-inclusive system, which our compatriots loved so much in Turkey and Egypt.  The opportunity not to think about finding a suitable restaurant in the city makes this hotel extremely attractive for families with children of any age.  Moreover, absolutely comfortable conditions are created for kids here. </p><h2>  The location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the popular resort town of Agia-Napa, founded near the most beautiful beaches of Cyprus.  This resort is fully tourist-oriented, so here everyone can relax at their discretion.  Some tourists prefer nightlife, which starts at eleven in the evening and lasts until dawn.  At this time, Agia-Napa has many nightclubs and restaurants where you can dance, have fun and taste delicious local drinks. </p><p>  But other travelers choose a more measured rest, filled with trips to the sea, walks in shops and trips to the sights of the island, of which there is an abundance around the resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Melissi Beach Hotel 4 * is located only seven hundred meters from the city center.  They can easily be overcome in ten minutes on foot.  This location is also very appealing to tourists who do not want to spend a lot of money on transport to move around the city. </p><p>  From the airport, the Melissi Beach Hotel 4 * is separated by forty kilometers, the main international gateway of Cyprus is located in the city of Larnaca.  From it to the hotel complex that interests us, it is only twenty to thirty minutes by taxi or minibus, which can be provided upon special request by Melissi Beach 4 * in Ayia Napa. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located on the first coastline, so you can walk to the sea via an asphalt path, breaking no more than two hundred meters.  Near the hotel there are two of the most beautiful beaches in Cyprus - Pantachou and Gliki Nero.  Vacationers can spend time on any of them.  If you can‚Äôt spend your vacation without visiting a couple of attractions, then the location of Melissi Beach 4 * (Ayia Napa) will allow you to realize what you want without going on a tiring trip around the island.  For example, not far away, within walking distance, is the Ayia Napa aqueduct.  Tourists come here very often to capture themselves against the backdrop of this monumental ancient structure.  Also, hotel guests can easily reach the beautiful secluded beach of the Greek Gulf, considered the pearl of the treasury of the sights of Cyprus. </p><p>  It can be said that the location of the hotel relative to the resort and its infrastructure makes the Melissi Beach Hotel (Cyprus) quite convenient for all categories of tourists and can satisfy any needs of vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your vacation in the hotel we are describing, you can be sure that you will not get bored here.  After all, vacationers have plenty of opportunities to have fun and have a great time. </p><p>  Naturally, tourists spend most of their holidays by the pool.  There are two of them in the hotel.  The first many experts and ordinary guests consider the most beautiful in Cyprus.  It has the appearance of a lagoon and a very bizarre bowl, so swimming here is quite interesting.  For kids there is a separate section where you can frolic in shallow water. </p><p>  If you find yourself in Cyprus in the cold season, when temperature does not allow swimming in the open air (Ayia Napa is so unfriendly in the winter months), then rest will not be a disappointment for you.  The hotel staff is ready to help their guests feel all the delights of a holiday on the sea coast.  After all, the hotel also has an indoor pool, where the water is usually heated.  Therefore, resting here will be quite comfortable even in the cold season.  At the pools, guests can sit on sun loungers and under umbrellas.  It is absolutely free for all hotel guests. </p><p>  For those who adhere to a healthy and active lifestyle, Melissi Beach Hotel 4 * is ready to provide a lot of opportunities to support yourself on vacation in great shape.  The hotel has an excellent modern gym, where you can engage in any period of time from nine in the morning to eleven in the evening.  Tennis fans will be delighted with the tennis court.  It is in the open air and has a very comfortable coating.  It is best to visit a tennis court in the afternoon, when it is in partial shade.  If you are still not sure that you can do a great job with a racket, then you will have table tennis, which is more popular among tourists.  The volleyball court also attracts the attention of vacationers, here in the evenings there are often international teams randomly formed from vacationers. </p><p>  The fair sex will be able to spend time with benefit in the spa center, where they will have the opportunity to make their own program from a rather extensive list of procedures, including visits to the sauna, jacuzzi, massage and various anti-aging treatments. </p><p>  If you are planning a business event at the Melissi Beach Hotel, it can be held in the conference room.

They will take upon themselves all organizational issues, and you will only have to exercise control over the implementation of orders. </p><p>  A small gift shop and car park are located on site.  Many tourists in Cyprus rent a car and travel independently to different resort areas of the island, so they need secure and free parking near the hotel complex. </p><p>  Guests can spend time in the three bars of the hotel, which are very conveniently located on site.  The most visited is the beach bar, and the second most popular is the pool bar.  There are always many guests enjoying the great taste of soft drinks. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  All tourists note that the hotel perfectly catches Wi-Fi.  It can be used almost everywhere in the hotel complex, but the most stable signal is in restaurants and in the lobby.

By the way, all employees speak several languages, so you will not have problems with understanding here.  Next to the reception is a tour desk where you will find several interesting tours in Cyprus that will best reveal the history of this beautiful island and its people. </p><p>  In the evenings, the hotel hosts an animation program, it changes daily, so vacationers are never bored.  Entertaining events are conducted by highly professional animators, and live music is always playing in the bar. </p><p>  All guests can use free beach towels, they are usually laid on a lounger by the pool or taken with them to the beach.  They are issued to each guest and changed by maids like ordinary towels as they become soiled. </p><p>  In order not to accumulate dirty clothes, vacationers can use the laundry and dry cleaning services.  For a small additional fee, the maids will wash and iron your clothes, which will completely remove this concern from you. </p><p>  For a surcharge of two euros per day, hotel guests can use the in-room safe.

    <h2>  Number of rooms: a brief description </h2><p>  The number of rooms in the hotel allows us to consider it a large hotel complex.  They are located in two buildings.  One hundred eighty-three rooms are located in the main building.  They are the most equipped and updated in the hotel.  About seventy meters from the main building are apartments, there are thirty-eight.  It is worth noting that they just do not have enough repairs and design.  Tourists often complain about shabby furniture and a musty smell in the rooms.  Therefore, when booking a hotel, pay attention to what room you are promised.  After checking in, changing it will be quite problematic. </p><p>  The hotel is represented by two main categories - deluxe and apartments.  We will talk about them in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Deluxe rooms </h2><p>  All of them are located in the main building and are spacious and bright rooms, designed for three or more guests.  Sometimes the rooms consist of two rooms, they are ideal for families with several children. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe deluxe does not exceed thirty square meters, the windows overlook the sea, courtyard or garden.  All apartments are decorated in calm, earthy tones and marble flooring. </p><p>  In each room there is an air conditioning and heating system, satellite TV, a telephone with a city exit and a radio.  The bathroom necessarily has a hairdryer and an individual set of toiletries, which are constantly replenished during cleaning.  The rooms have a minibar and a balcony or terrace. </p><h2>  Apartment in annex </h2><p>  These rooms are no different from deluxe in their equipment, but here in quality of design they are significantly inferior to them.  The apartments have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty square meters and are characterized by frayed furniture and not very working appliances.  Many guests claim that deluxe rooms fully correspond to rooms in five-star hotels, but apartments in an additional building barely reach the "three rubles".  Therefore, from here, most tourists try to move as quickly as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Children at the hotel </h2><p>  They love kids at the hotel, they even have special children's animations for them.  Therefore, if your child is over five years old, then you can safely go to this hotel complex.  Here, every evening, the animators will arrange a real show with magic tricks, dances and funny songs. </p><p>  From the age of five, kids can be left in the kids club.  There are several Russian-speaking animators who honestly do their job.  With children, they draw, sculpt from clay and even bake pizza.  No child will want to leave here. </p><p>  If your kid likes to spend time actively, then he will like the sports playground, where various facilities for children are installed.  Here you can play in the sand and build a magnificent castle. </p><p>  Parents who have no one to leave their child with in the evening will be interested in a babysitting service.  Of course, it is paid separately.  However, it allows adults to go to a nightclub or restaurant without worrying about their child. </p><p>  On request, cots are available in the rooms, and the restaurant provides waiters with a special menu and a convenient highchair.  Therefore, you can safely come to the hotel with very young children. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel has a roomy restaurant with sea views and a cafe where you can eat during the day.  Most tourists are advised to purchase vouchers with an <span>all-inclusive meal plan.</span>  This will significantly save your budget, because in Cyprus it is quite expensive to have lunch and dinner in restaurants. </p><p>  If you choose such a system for yourself, you will get an almost round-the-clock opportunity to eat.  Judge for yourself: </p><ul><li>  breakfast runs from half past seven to half past ten in the morning; </li><li>  dinner lasts three hours from twelve thirty to fifteen thirty; </li><li>  dinner begins at six thirty and ends at ten in the evening; </li><li>  appetizers are served in the cafe in two stages - between breakfast and lunch, and also after lunch to dinner; </li><li>  cold snacks can be tasted from ten to eleven in the evening; </li><li>  kids from ten in the morning to ten in the evening can please themselves with delicious ice cream; </li><li>  alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are available to guests from morning to twelve in the morning. </li></ul><p>  Keep in mind that you should not enter the restaurant hall for dinner on your own, the waiters will definitely take you to a seat at the empty table. </p><h2>  Ayia Napa, Cyprus: hotel ticket prices </h2><p>  The cost of the tour at Melissi Beach Hotel depends on what season you decide to relax here.  Naturally, in the high summer season a ticket will cost you much more than, for example, in the fall.  In addition, early booking is typical for Cyprus, so good options are already sorted out by March. </p><p>  In July, a couple can relax in a hotel departing from Moscow for one hundred and fifty thousand rubles.  This price includes air travel, weekly accommodation and all-inclusive meals for two people. </p><p>  But in early October, such a tour will cost you only eighty thousand rubles for two.  However, keep in mind that the air temperature does not rise above twenty-five degrees Celsius, although sea bathing is still pleasant and comfortable. </p><p>  In February, when the temperature does not rise above seventeen degrees Celsius, and sea bathing is no longer possible, the cost of the tour drops to a record sixty to seventy thousand rubles in seven days. </p><p>  There are a lot of different hotels in Cyprus, however, the reviews of our compatriots about the Melissi Beach Hotel make it possible to consider this hotel complex to be a good place to relax and enjoy the sights of the island. </p>
