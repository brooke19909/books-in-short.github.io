But this is not so.  The money does not lie on the card, but on the bank account, the number of which is assigned to each plastic card.  Simultaneously with the issuance of the card, bank employees open an account for the client, to which they will continue to receive funds - in the form of scholarships, pensions, salaries or transfers.  How to find out the account number of a Sberbank card to transfer money to its sender?  All methods will be described below. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of "card account number" </h2><p>  A card account is necessary for the bank to perform various operations with monetary funds, including those related to both receipt and expenditure of them.  For example, it can be cashing out and replenishing funds on a card or transferring to another person, settlements with utilities, making purchases through shops (including through online stores), paying off loans and other services provided by banking institutions. </p><p>  And what is a <span>bank account?</span>  This is a special number that includes twenty numeric values ‚Äã‚Äãand is assigned to a specific client.  It is necessary for banking structures to keep track of all <span>cash flows</span> on customer accounts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The client has the right to manage the money at his discretion.  He can replenish accounts or withdraw funds when he wishes and as many times as he needs.  In addition, one person may have several active bank accounts, and not in one, but in several financial organizations. </p><h2>  Why is it important to know the card account number? </h2><p>  A bank card holder from Sberbank may be required to: </p><ul><li>  for the possibility of making a money transfer within the same banking institution or between different financial organizations; </li><li>  to transfer funds from abroad; </li><li>  for settlements with utilities, as well as other transfers in favor of any organization. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the account number of a sberbank card account details" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/780722.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Ways to get data on the card account number </h2><p>  Here we will consider the main approaches, <span>how to find out the</span> <span>personal account of</span> a Sberbank card, instructions and recommendations.  So, you can get data on the map: </p><ul><li>  in the contract for banking services; </li><li>  at the bank branch; </li><li>  calling the hotline; </li><li>  at an ATM or payment terminal; </li><li>  using the Sberbank-online service. </li></ul><p>  You will find a description of each of these methods on how to find out the card account number (Sberbank) in this article. </p><h2>  Approach 1. In the card service agreement </h2><p>  Almost every relationship between the bank and the client is fixed by the contract, and card issuance is no exception.  Having signed an agreement with Sberbank to accompany the card, the client receives the second copy in his hands.  It compulsorily indicates a twenty-digit bank account tied to the card. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, along with the card, a bank employee issues an envelope with a PIN code, you can also find card details there.  This is the easiest way to find out the account number of a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Approach 2. To the bank branch </h2><p>  A personal visit to a branch of Sberbank is also the most affordable and time-saving way to find out the account number of a Sberbank card.  But it is worth emphasizing the fact that you need to visit the office where you received the payment card.  This is due to the unusual structure of Sberbank of Russia.  Surely few people know that the bank includes several small banks, which themselves consist of regional branches.  And each department has information regarding the customers they serve. </p><p>  So, you have come to the department that accompanies your card.  You need to go to the operator who, on the basis of your passport and card, will print the account details. </p>

    <h2>  Approach 3. Call the hotline </h2><p>  How to find out the account number of a Sberbank card using a telephone?

A call center specialist will require you to provide your <span>personal data</span> - full name, date of birth.  You will also need to name the code word that you set when filling out the questionnaire.  If the code word was forgotten, then in this case you will have to dictate your <span>passport data.</span>  After you have completed the identification procedure, the operator will dictate the details of the card to you.  In this way, you can find out the account number of not only your card, but also of another person, if you know his name, date of birth and passport information. </p>
