This flower from ancient times personified the winner.  Such a tradition originates in France, it was with these flowers that men went to war, and they received them from their beloved.  Women waited for spouses and grooms from the battlefield intact.

The paper does not have to be corrugated.  You can take a simple napkin or a regular colored sheet.  If we talk about the color of cloves, then red is perfect for Victory Day, but the flowers can be white, and yellow, and orange, and any other color.  It all depends on the choice of the needlewoman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple clove option </h2><p>  There are several easy ways to make a flower out of paper.  In the first case, everything will look as follows. </p><p>  How to make a carnation from corrugated paper with your own hands?  Master class for beginner needlewomen: </p><ol><li>  A strip having a width of 5 cm is cut from red paper (or any other). As for the length, it corresponds to the length of the paper. </li><li>  Several cuts are made with a distance of 0.5 cm between them. </li><li>  A piece equal to the length of the stem of the flower is cut from a coil of wire. </li><li>  A strip of paper is wound on the wire in several layers, which must be glued. </li><li>  The stalk is wrapped in green paper. </li><li>  For greater resemblance to a real flower, it is recommended to make several leaves also of green paper, stick to the stem. </li></ol><p>  What other options for doing do-it-yourself cloves from corrugated paper? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Paper-Carnation"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself carnations from corrugated paper" class="if uuid-2313906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2313906.jpg"></div><h2>  How else can you make a clove </h2><p>  This method is very simple.  Both children and adults will understand it.  To work, you need a set of the following tools: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper, one sheet of which will be the main color (which is planned to make cloves) and the second green to make leaves and stems; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  adhesive thermal gun; </li><li>  threads. </li></ul><h2>  DIY making corrugated paper carnations step by step </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY corrugated paper clove" class="if uuid-2313879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2313879.jpg"></div><p>  Everyone who saw a carnation probably knows that there can be several flowers on one branch.  And therefore, to make the craft look more real, it makes sense to prepare several flowers at once.  So, to create one clove you need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Cut into several strips with a width of 2.5 cm and a length of approximately 5 cm. </li><li>  A petal is cut from a strip. </li><li>  Then stretch the workpiece and make small cuts along the edge. </li><li>  To get a beautiful flower, you need about 10 petals, the splendor of the bud depends on their number. </li><li>  Fold the prepared petal in the shape of an accordion, repeat with the rest. </li><li>  Each must be tied with a thread so as not to crumble. </li><li>  After all the petals are collected, the central part of the flower can be considered complete. </li><li>  Then you will need to make a few more petals to form the outer part. </li><li>  The length of the workpieces - as in the previous version, only the width must be reduced by half. </li><li>  Petals are also cut and stretched. </li><li>  It is important not to forget to make small cuts on the top of the workpieces. </li><li>  Petals are procured in an amount of 10 pieces. </li><li>  External petals are fixed in a circle of the core of the flower. </li></ol><p>  Do-it-yourself clove of corrugated paper is almost ready. </p><h2>  How to collect a flower </h2><p>  The steps for collecting a flower are as follows. </p><ol><li>  First you need to make sepals.  For this part of the craft, you will need green paper, from which a strip is cut. </li><li>  Then the edges are cut in the same way as when working on a flower. </li><li>  The upper part is slightly stretched, and then a depression is made. </li><li>  The workpiece must be twisted so that a cup is obtained. </li><li>  The flower is inserted into the sepals and fixed with glue. </li></ol><p>  Next is the stem.  We act like this: </p><ol><li>  The strip is selected such a length that is necessary for the crafts (selected individually), and a width of about 1.5 cm. </li><li>  The workpiece is twisted with a tube, and the edge is fastened with glue. </li><li>  The flower joins the stem. </li><li>  If it was planned to make several flowers, then each one will need sepals. </li><li>  In order for the structure to hold firmly, all parts are seated on glue. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="hubpages.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://hubpages.com/art/Crepe-Paper-Crafts-Make-Crepe-Paper-Flowers"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself carnations from corrugated paper" class="if uuid-2313926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2313926.jpg"></div><p>  Well, what flower without leaves?  Make them very simple.  From green paper, blanks are cut with pointed ends about 0.8 cm wide. They are attached to the stems.  The result is a beautiful carnation of corrugated paper with your own hands. </p>
