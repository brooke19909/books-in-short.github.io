The more ancient the settlement, the more interesting it is, the more legends, legends and myths surround those times that are unknown to modern man.  One of the most <span>ancient cities of Russia</span> is the pearl of the Golden Ring - Yaroslavl. </p><h2>  Basic information </h2><p>  Modern Yaroslavl is, first of all, a center of tourism, an <span>old Russian city, the</span> history of which dates back to the millennium.  Until now, the year of foundation of Yaroslavl has been the subject of discussions between historians and archaeologists.  Excavations on the banks of the Volga are ongoing, which provides new information for thought.  Officially, the year of foundation of the city of Yaroslavl is 1010. It was on the basis of these data that the 1000th anniversary of the city was celebrated in 2010.  Today it is a large trade and transport hub, due to its geographical location.

    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The base of Yaroslavl is the bank of the Volga, more precisely, the ‚Äúarrow‚Äù, the high coastal cape.  <span>Kotorosl River,</span> formed by the connection of the river.  Veksa and p.  The mouth flows into the Volga on the East European Plain, in its central part.  The Volga region in the Yaroslavl region is rich in water resources, 240 rivers and small rivers, merging with each other, form an extensive network that was used to deliver various kinds of cargo.  The rivers Veksa and Kotorosl formed part of the great Volga route and connected Lake Rostov, Klyazma, Oka with the Volga.  This water system was called the path from the "Varangians to Arabs", it allowed to maintain trade relations with the Arab East, Scandinavia, Khazaria.  The development and settlement of the Volga began to play a large role in the development of relations with neighboring states, thanks to these premises, the foundation of the city of Yaroslavl became possible and necessary.  This was the first settlement of the Slavs on the Volga.  The Kotorosl River was the only waterway connecting the western part of Russia with Rostov.  For many centuries, before the construction of the railway, the main waterway between Yaroslavl and Rostov was the main one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The place of foundation of Yaroslavl was not chosen by chance: if you study the topography of the area, you can see that it is difficult to choose a more convenient location for the fortifications.  The settlement was reliably closed on three sides by natural barriers.  The Volga and Kotorosl cut off the city from the main territory of the plain, the Bear Ravine (previously one of the channels of the Kotorosl River flowed through it) was impregnable for attack from a third party.  The defenders of the fortress had to fortify the only accessible way to the city.  In fact, the ‚Äúarrow‚Äù was an island in the middle of a body of water. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The year of foundation of Yaroslavl is still the subject of controversy.  Settlements on this place existed before.  But the prerequisite for the emergence of a fortified point was constantly expanding trade relations.  The use of the Volga as the main waterway of the region led to the fact that a large number of merchants equipped their ships with rich goods and launched along the river.  At the most convenient points on the banks of the rivers there were small settlements of robbers who robbed merchant ships.  On the arrow located between the Volga and Kotorosl, there was just such a fortification.  From the point of view of <span>military strategy, the</span> place was ideally suited for robbers, and for the squad guarding the borders of the principality.  When settling and strengthening this territory, the settlement was given the name Yaroslavl.  The history of the founding of the ancient city is connected with the Prince of Kiev Yaroslav.  In the first centuries of its development, the city was originally a fortified area that made the great route to Rostov safe.  Therefore, the year of foundation of Yaroslavl as a "fortification" is still a mystery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Based on archaeological excavations, it can be argued that on the territory of modern Yaroslavl there was an ancient settlement dating from the 1st millennium BC - the era of the beginning of the <span>Iron Age.</span>  But at this place there were earlier settlements that date back to the III-V centuries.  The foundation of the city of Yaroslavl is the X-XI century, up to this point the Volga region was inhabited by Finno-Ugric peoples.  The gradual migration of the Slavs to this territory begins from the VIII-IX centuries.  However, many archaeologists emphasize that the colonization took place without violence.  The Slavs peacefully coexisted with the Meri people, and for some time the tribes practically united.  In the year of the foundation of Yaroslavl, the banks of the Volga were quite densely populated, there is information about several villages whose inhabitants were engaged in fishing and crafts. </p>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Around each ancient settlement, there are many stories.  This is due to the lack of specific information, information comes from legends and annals, which are more like fairy tales and contain a lot of fiction.  Yaroslavl in this sense is no exception, the ancient history of its occurrence leaves considerable scope for imagination.  With confidence, many archaeologists and historians can only talk about the foundation of Yaroslavl by Yaroslav the Wise.  This is indirectly confirmed by the name of the city.  Many archaeological finds dating back to that time do not deny this version, but the monastery archives are the main source of this statement.  The date of foundation of Yaroslavl, the place and its founder are described in the manuscript of the archbishop of Yaroslavl Samuel Mislavsky that has come down to us.  The manuscript was published by priest Lebedev in 1877 and was repeatedly analyzed by historians.  She came out under the title "The Legend of the City of Yaroslavl."  The text really contains an ancient tradition and was written in the XII-XI centuries.  According to the researcher Voronin N. N., the content of the ‚ÄúTale‚Äù was updated several times, but the facts reached the contemporaries in an undistorted form.  There is also a number of other documents, the study of which continues to this day, for modern scientists this is a very interesting question - the foundation of Yaroslavl.  Versions and legends are not very diverse, all of them directly or indirectly point to Yaroslav the Wise as the founder of the city.  Therefore, one should study his historical image in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Yaroslav the Wise </h2><p>  The Grand Duke of Kiev was born in 978.  Father immediately after the birth of Yaroslav gave him the Rostov lands to reign.  The foundation date of the city of Yaroslavl is 1010, it was during this period that the prince ruled the Rostov lands.  It is difficult to say anything definite about this time of his life: the data has not been preserved.  A reliable annalistic mention of Prince Yaroslav begins in 1010, and it is associated with the creation of a fortified city on the banks of the Volga.  The further fate of the prince is connected with Novgorod, where he was from 1011.  After the death of his brother Vysheslav, Vladimir (the father of the brothers), bypassing the eldest of his sons, puts Yaropolk in Novgorod, which at that time was a serious military and commercial center.  The Novgorod squad was second only to Kiev, and the status of Novgorod as a city was significantly higher than Rostov.  Yaroslav will go the hard way to the title of Grand Prince of Kiev, who will unite the Russian lands and win the recognition of his people by wise and enlightened rule.  The nickname ‚ÄúWise‚Äù Yaroslav Vladimirovich will receive only in the XIX century, the descendants will appreciate his role in the formation of a single and powerful Russia.  Its role in the formation of the city of Yaroslavl is almost undeniable, but also permeated by legends and legends.  To this day, two main versions have come up, which are worth dwelling in more detail. </p><h2>  The legend of the foundation of Yaroslavl </h2>

    <p>  Twelve years have passed since the baptism of Rus, but many settlements remained pagan.  On the banks of the Volga, at the confluence of the Kotorosl River, the ancient settlement Medvezhy Ugol was located.  According to the annals, people lived there evil, "filthy faith", that is, pagans.  They worshiped the idol of the <span>god Veles</span> (Hair).  Not far from the settlement was a sanctuary in which a sacrificial fire burned and there were wooden figures of idols.  The inhabitants of the Bear Corner also worshiped animals, among which the bear occupied a key place.  In a certain hairy den, sacrifices were made to pagan gods, it is possible that they are human, which is why the inhabitants of the settlement are described as evil people.  The main occupations of the residents of the Bear Corner were cattle breeding, hunting and fishing, and they received the main income from robberies of merchant ships sailing along the Volga.  According to legend, the prince, at that time Rostov, Yaroslav sailed along the Volga with his squad.  He saw the residents of a local settlement robbing merchant ships and came to the merchants to help.  They thanked the prince, and the locals, seeing the power of the Rostov squad, agreed to recognize him.  At the same time, the Bear Corner did not completely submit to Yaroslav; pagan rituals continued to be performed there.  Yaroslav appreciated the convenient location of the settlement, from the point of view of the protection strategy of Rostov and the lands around it, so he decided to baptize the inhabitants and build an outpost on the site of the Bear‚Äôs corner.  He returned with a retinue and numerous church ministers, but the settlers were not going to so easily abandon their gods, whom they had been praying for centuries.  As soon as the prince entered the settlement, a ‚Äúfierce beast‚Äù and a pack of dogs were let down on him and his retinue.  A huge bear acted as a beast - the supreme deity was settled.  Yaroslav killed a bear with an ax, and the dogs did not attack any of his entourage.  From this moment, the prince ordered to cut down trees and build fortifications on the "arrow".  Later, from this outpost grew Yaroslavl, named after its founder. </p><h2>  Second version </h2><p>  The Dyakovsky settlement the Bear Corner submitted to Yaroslav the prince of the Rostov lands, was baptized, but the sacred pagan beast (bear) began to take revenge on its inhabitants.  He wandered around the vicinity of the settlement and killed people who turned away from idolatry.  Prince Yaroslav hunted near Rostov.  Upon learning of the misfortune of the inhabitants of the Bear Corner, he hastened to help.  Yaroslav himself came to grips with the beast and defeated him.  The fortification on his orders was fortified with ramparts and moats.  And in the city itself the first Orthodox church was built - the Church of Elijah - named after St. Elijah by the date of the construction (August 2).  To the place of the alleged foundation of Yaroslavl, to this day lies a stone, which, according to historians, once served as part of the foundation of the church. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl, foundation stone </h2><p>  On the Volga embankment is one of the most visited attractions of the city, which attracts not only many tourists, local residents believe in the magical powers that are endowed with this historical rarity.  The foundation stone of Yaroslavl is fanned by ancient legends and traditions, it is believed that the history of the city began from this place.  The first fortifications appeared behind it, new churches and houses were built.  The guides say that if you look closely at the stone for a long time, then the imagination itself will draw pictures of antiquity: Prince Yaroslav with his retinue, builders, craftsmen and hunters, the people who built this city.  Residents of Yaroslavl attribute to the stone miraculous properties.  According to them, he has a special magnetism and can heal diseases.  Numerous tourists throw coins, believing that their wish will come true.  And this is not surprising: the stone lay on this place even before the foundation of the city, it blows from antiquity and a fairy tale. </p><h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  The year of foundation of the city of Yaroslavl is 1010, respectively, all stages of the history of the development of the Russian state left their mark in it.  A special place among the ancient monuments is occupied by the architecture of the city.  It is appreciated by lovers of antiquity and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  If we study the historical center of Yaroslavl, we can conclude that it is a solid architectural monument, which has been preserved thanks to competent adaptation to the modern life of the city.  The total number of monuments of history, architecture, art, archeology available in the city is more than 700 units.  Among them are temples and churches, ancient buildings, museums, monasteries, parks and sculptures.  Of course, a special place among them is occupied by the monument to the founder of the city, Yaroslav the Wise.  The city also immortalized all the great people who contributed to its formation and development.  There is a monument to <span>Fyodor Volkov,</span> Nikolai Nekrasov, the Demidov pillar. </p>
