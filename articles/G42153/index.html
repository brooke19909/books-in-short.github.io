    <p>  Alaska is part of the territory of <span>North America,</span> discovered by the Russian expedition in 1732 under the direction of Gvozdev and Fedorov.  Alaska, by right of primary discovery, was the property of the Russian Empire.  Initially, the development of Alaska took place by private individuals, and then by a special company in the person of the Russian-American government.  Alaska's area at that time was 586,411 square meters.  miles  Only about 2,500 Russian people and 61,000 Eskimos and Indians lived on this territory.  Alaska brought its income as a result of the fur trade.  Somewhat later, it became absolutely obvious - the costs of maintaining and defending the territory would significantly exceed its income.  In this regard, the question arose about the <span>sale of Alaska.</span>  The United States, to <span>whom Alaska</span> was later <span>sold</span> , inevitably spread throughout North America, and obtaining Alaska was only a matter of time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alaska sold" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10463/82588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alaska was sold to the United States of America in a written contract, which was signed in the spring of 1867 in the city of Washington.  The entire contract was signed in 2 languages: French and English.  An interesting point is that the Russian language was not in the contract as such.  The question of how much Alaska was sold for has a clear answer: for 7.2 million green notes.  Consequently, for every square kilometer they paid 4 dollars 72 cents.  In addition to the entire US territory, all types of real estate, archives of all colonies and historical documents were also assigned.  Further, the agreement was submitted to Congress, after which on March 3 the ratification of the agreement took place.  In view of this procedure, no one had any doubt who sold Alaska - everything was signed and approved. </p><p>  It should be noted that not the entire Senate of the United States spoke in favor of signing the treaty - some suggested that this purchase would become burdensome for the government, because the <span>civil war</span> had just ended <span>.</span>  There is also a certain list of interesting facts that have a place to be.  For example, the final deal between the United States and Russia was never made because the ship on which the money was transported to Russia sank.  Some journalistic publications claim that the land was not sold, but leased for a period of 99 years.  After signing the agreement, a gold mine was discovered in Alaska, which at times paid off the purchase of this territory by the Americans.  In any case, questions about who sold Alaska should no longer arise.  Difficulties and many questions raise details of the contract.  Some Russian officials of that time categorically did not approve of such a sale, and to this day there are such people. </p>

    <p>  You can argue about this for hours, but the fact remains that Alaska was sold to the United States as far back as the 70s of the 19th century, and asking for the return of land is currently at least unreasonable.  Alaska is a territory rich in deposits of valuable <span>minerals,</span> but at the same time difficult to develop and protect from the Russian Empire. </p>
