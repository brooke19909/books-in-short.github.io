It will delight its owners with a sufficiently powerful battery.  The battery capacity in it is 4,400 mAh. </p><p>  In principle, such a capacity is not a record.  However, for an apparatus of a similar thickness (and it is 9.5 millimeters), this is very, very good.  Here, the Highscreen company, for example, has established itself as smartphones with a larger battery capacity, which, respectively, run on autonomous power for a longer time.  One of her offspring has a battery capacity of 6,000 mAh.  However, it is worth noting that the same model has a thickness of one and a half centimeters. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  If someone had experience with the W6610, he will immediately notice the external similarity between her and the V387.  Both devices have almost the same body shape.  Two faces - both upper and lower - are somewhat curved.  In this case, the lateral faces have a rounded shape.  It is worth noting that the corners of the smartphone are also arranged.  It is due to the fact that the outlines of the device are smooth, and the edges are not sharp, the device conveniently lies in the hand, without digging into the palm of the hand. </p><p>  Even though the battery capacity is relatively large, respectively, and its dimensions are impressive, the dimensions of the smartphone itself make up a pretty nice picture in all three planes: 144 mm long, 74 mm wide, 9.6 mm thick.  At the same time, the Philips Xenium V387 mobile phone has a weight of 171 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the smartphone market, the device is available in black and white colors.  In any case, no matter what color you buy the device, you will find a set of removable back covers.  For example, in some cases, the black Philips Xenium V387 smartphone comes with a yellow removable cover.  It is worth noting one point: these covers can be quite elastic, but even so they did not lose their strength. </p><h2>  Front and side view </h2><p>  The front panel has a small edging.  It is made of plastic (glossy) and decorated in black.  Kant helps protect the display from damage if the Philips Xenium V387 smartphone is left on a rough surface. </p><p>  The side faces are also made of plastic, but already semi-gloss.  Plastic was also used in the manufacture of the back cover.  From above they are covered with a small relief pattern. </p><h2>  Strength </h2><p>  In the address of the reliability of the screen, device users in most cases leave neutral reviews.  Philips Xenium V387 black has an oleophobic coating.  There should be no problems with the operation of the screen, since the finger glides smoothly over the coating, and fingerprints can be erased from the protective glass without any effort. </p><p>  In the center of the device, at the top, there is a speaker.  It is covered with a dark metal mesh.  The speaker volume is impressive, but the quality of the signal transmitted through it leaves much to be desired.  The fact is that there are not enough high frequencies, but low, on the contrary, enough, as they say, for the eyes.  Well, or for the ears, as in our situation.  Due to this, the interlocutor‚Äôs speech will be a little difficult to make out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sensors are located to the left of the speaker, and the front camera to the right.  At the bottom of the front face there are buttons that are applied with paint.  Although the buttons have a backlight, it is still not enough. </p><p>  The bottom end accommodates a microUSB input.  There is also a primary microphone.  The input for the wired headset 3.5 mm is integrated into the upper end.  The volume control buttons are located on the left side, and the power on and off button is on the opposite side.  A little higher than it there is a lever, due to the use of which the device can be switched to energy saving mode. </p><p>  The reverse side accommodates the main camera recessed inside the housing, as well as a flash to illuminate the subject in the dark.  You can remove the panel without any problems, just prying it off the recess located on the left side.  Having removed the cover, on the left you can see the slot designed for using microSD-type flash cards.  On the right, there will be SIM card slots. </p><p>  It is worth noting the excellent build quality of the Philips Xenium V387.  Reviews say that the phone does not crackle or make other sounds even when compressed, and its back cover, up to the battery, does not bend under any circumstances. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The diagonal of the display in this device is 5 inches, while it has a frame.  Its size in the upper part is one and a half centimeters, while from below it reaches 18 mm, and on the sides - 5.5 mm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In terms of high-quality display, the Philips Xenium V387 Black model will not please users with anything special.  The reviews clearly demonstrate that even at high resolution, which is 720 by 1280 pixels, the picture loses contrast with the slightest tilt of the screen.  The phone is simply not able to reproduce the yellow and purple hues.  More specifically, the matrix has an IPS look. </p><p>  But in terms of sensitivity, the manufacturers did their best: the smartphone can respond immediately to seven touches at various points on the surface.  The touch screen is particularly sensitive. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  In the introduction, we have already said that with such a thickness, the smartphone‚Äôs battery has a fairly good capacity.  The Xenium line, which has superior devices in terms of energy efficiency, includes the Philips Xenium V387.  Reviews on self-contained power distinguish the model from other smartphones. </p><p>  If you believe the data provided by the manufacturer, then in standby mode the phone can lie up to 1442 hours.  At the same time, talking on it without stopping is possible all day.  And this is not said in a figurative sense: 25 hours of continuous work are allotted for telephone conversations.  Well, Philips Xenium V387 distinguished itself with its autonomous power.  Reviews of his work confirm this fact. </p><p>  Speaking in more detail about this factor, about 65 hours are allotted for continuous listening to audio files.  But at maximum screen brightness and high resolution, high volume, you can watch movies for 13 hours.  In terms of energy use during the game, the smartphone can please you with 6 hours of work.  This is very, very good. </p><p>  Charging is possible both using the AC network, and by recharging from devices that have a USB input.  For example, from a personal computer or laptop.  In the case of using the electric network, the phone can be charged in 3 hours, while it takes three times more time to fully charge from a PC. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about cellular networks, the model works in the ranges of 2G and 3G.  Bluetooth version is 4.0.  As mentioned earlier, the phone connects to devices that have a USB 2.0 interface.  Wi-Fi supports b, g, and n standards.  Philips Xenium V387 still does not have special communication capabilities, reviews say that sometimes Wi-Fi in the a standard is not enough. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  RAM has a capacity of 2 GB immediately.  Small ‚Äúlags‚Äù, ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and other inaccuracies in the operation of the operating system are somewhat mitigated by the use of this size RAM.  In addition, the operating system is installed without any unnecessary shells, which allows the user to provide almost 1.5 GB for personal needs. </p><p>  In terms of long-term memory, the model will also please potential and real users.  Its volume is 16 GB.  4 of them are reserved for the operation of the system, but even 12 GB for personal use is quite enough.  If it is ‚Äúcramped", you can separately buy a memory card.  The maximum supported volume is 32 GB. </p><p>  Well, here, as in energy efficiency, the success of the Philips Xenium V387 Black is obvious.  Reviews in terms of memory do not contain almost a single minus. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  As you know, the device has two cameras.  The main one has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  Additional is also not bad, its resolution is 2 megapixels.  There is a cold flash on the back.  Photo resolution can be about 3264 by 2448 pixels.  Depending on the quality of lighting, the frame rate when shooting video falls in the range from 16 to 30. At the same time, the shooting resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels. </p><p>  However, despite such technical specifications, the quality of the pictures taken is not very high.  In most cases, the problem lies in detailing photographs if the light level drops.  In this case, you may notice noise.  We can say that the solution to the problem will only be the modernization of the module. </p><p>  The front camera should appeal to those who use the Philips Xenium V387 phone.  Reviews about her are neutral, because she removes, although decently, but does not belong to the wide-angle view. </p><h2>  Performance </h2>

    <p>  The device is based on a Taiwan-made MediaTek chip.  The processor has 4 cores that operate at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  The clock speed of the graphics accelerator is 400 MHz. </p><p>  The ideal gaming device is not the Philips Xenium V387 smartphone.  Performance reviews show that in games with the highest graphics for mobile devices today (and these are games like Dead Trigger 2), ‚Äúfriezes‚Äù, ‚Äúlags‚Äù and so on can be observed.  However, they do not occur so often, and ordinary games can be played with interest. </p><h2>  Philips Xenium V387: owner reviews.  Conclusion </h2><p>  Currently, this model of smartphone is quite acceptable in terms of technical supply.  Ordinary users can find smartphones for themselves that are more optimal in terms of price-quality ratio, but active users may well purchase this device. </p><p>  Due to the large-capacity battery, they will be able to spend more time on the Internet, actively ‚Äúsurf‚Äù web pages, listen to music and watch videos.  The side should not go around and a large screen diagonal.  Due to this, reading the text will not be so difficult, and the eyes will begin to strain less. </p><p>  Most users note a good and convenient design of the model, and in the minuses they record only not quite high-quality color reproduction and not very high quality of the pictures taken, since the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the camera implies better photos. </p><p>  The price of a smartphone is 10 500 rubles, which, in principle, is acceptable by today's standards. </p>
