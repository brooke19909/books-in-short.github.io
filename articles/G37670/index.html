Working with a specific breed of wood, carvers are able to produce truly unique objects: sculptures, furniture, household utensils and much more.  In the article, we consider the types of volumetric woodcarving, what tools are needed for this.  You will also find step-by-step instructions for making a box using this technique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twistedsifter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood carving volumetric figures" class="if uuid-3105163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105163.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of thread </h2><p>  The following wood carving techniques are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  volumetric; </li><li>  through; </li><li>  embossed; </li><li>  deaf; </li><li>  waybill; </li><li>  contour line; </li><li>  curly; </li><li>  flat; </li><li>  propyl. </li></ul><p>  Volumetric or sculptural carving involves the manufacture of sculptures, large pieces of furniture and the exterior. </p><p>  Through thread is often called openwork and slotted.  The technique is characterized by the removal of the background on planar patterns.  Often this method is used to decorate window shutters, cornices and furniture.  In cases where end-to-end processing is attached to a wooden base, such a job is called an invoice. </p><p>  Relief carving is considered one of the most complex.  It can be divided into bas-relief and high relief.  Varieties, in turn, require high skill in wood processing and the presence of a wide variety of cutting tools.  Most often, it is decorated with wooden furniture and interior elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Blind carving is an equally sophisticated woodworking technique.  Sometimes even experienced craftsmen cannot imagine the scale and volume of work performed. </p><p>  A flat or flat-relief carving is a pattern applied to a wooden base with a sharp tool.  Such work can be entrusted even to a child, subject to adult supervision.  As a rule, only wood species that are not stratified, for example, linden or chestnut, are applicable as a material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="browpicz.pw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric wood carvings photo" class="if uuid-3105154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105154.jpg"></div><h2>  Volumetric equipment as aerobatics </h2><p>  Everyone is able to comprehend the art of wood cutting, but not everyone is able to master volumetric techniques.  In order to acquire the necessary knowledge, you need to have an experienced mentor, desire, free time and talent.  Mastering the skill of carving volumetric figures on wood makes it possible to realize your wildest fantasies, recreate masterpieces of art, sculptures, compositions and many other objects.  Not only one knowledge of this technique, the master at the same time should be an artist, sculptor and creative person.  The process itself is highly accurate and meticulous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twistedsifter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood carvings" class="if uuid-3105148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105148.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing and getting started with wood </h2><p>  Volume carving for beginners may seem like a complicated technique.  But do not despair, because skills are honed with experience.  The main thing is to know where to start. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The principle of preparatory work is based on the correct selection of tree species.  For example, large elements are easier to cut from soft woods (pine, poplar, linden), since they are more malleable and, conversely, it is better to stop on solid wood (maple, oak) to cut small details. </p><p>  Another important stage of preparation is the execution of the sketch.  It can be depicted schematically, molded from plaster or clay, printed on a printer.  It is important to remember that without a sketch, the result will be less accurate. </p><h2>  Tools for work </h2><p>  The volumetric technique of working with wood is rather non-standard, respectively, and the tool should be suitable.  These are familiar knives with chisels, and special machines.  To work at home, you will need such tools for volumetric woodcarving: </p><ol><li>  Sandpaper of all fractions. </li><li>  Knives of various modifications, sizes and shapes. </li><li>  Hand router with a wide range of nozzles. </li><li>  Chisels of different types. </li><li>  Needle files. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume carving for beginners" class="if uuid-3105153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105153.jpg"></div><h2>  Volumetric wood carving techniques </h2><p>  During work, the master uses various methods of planing and wood processing, among them there are several basic, applicable for all types of wood carving: </p><ol><li>  "Push".  Used to remove edges and bevels, especially if they are perpendicular to the wood fibers.  Work is carried out with one hand or holding the blade with the fingers of the second hand. </li><li>  Reception for removing a thick layer of wood in the direction of its fibers.  The knife is captured with one or both hands, while the tip is directed towards itself.  With a strong pressure on the chest, a slice is made.  If it is necessary to remove a large layer, but there is not enough room for maneuverability, pressure on the hands is carried out by the body. </li><li>  ‚ÄúFor yourself‚Äù - cutting technique, when the blade is directed towards the left hand, and the movement is towards the thumb. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="diy.wikireading.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutting techniques" class="if uuid-3105126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105126.jpg"></div><h2>  What material to use? </h2><p>  For wood carvings, it is recommended to use softwood such as maple, alder, linden and aspen. </p><p>  Linden is especially distinguished because of its uniformity, ductility and ductility when carving.  Aspen and alder are used a little less.  Before working with aspen, it is advisable to steam it for two to three hours and then stand in the shade for about a day.  After drying, the beam on which the cracks appeared is treated by cutting the ends. </p><p>  Wood should not have any flaws in the form of rot, cracks, voids. </p><h2>  Work Technique </h2><p>  Volumetric wood carving (photos of works are presented in the article) is performed as follows: </p><ol><li>  First of all, the contours of the future product are applied to the timber and unnecessary parts are cut down.  They do this with the help of a chisel, then they work out the basic outlines of the figure with it. </li><li>  After that, they begin to work with a knife and rasps of various sizes, giving a smoother outline.  The actions are careful and soft, the thinnest layer of wood is planed.  The sculpture is painted with a cutting tool, which leaves grooves on it.  The lines imitate the facial features of a person, feathers of birds, animal skin, horse mane, veins on plants and other elements. </li><li>  All sections are made small, treating the surface from all sides.  If it is planned to make holes in the sculpture, they are cut at the final stage. </li><li>  It is desirable to moisten hard and dry wood during the cutting process. </li><li>  The master polishes the finished product with sandpaper or leaves it unchanged. </li><li>  Then it is left to dry.  In the case of cracks, they are filled with wedges, taking into account the direction of the wood fibers. </li></ol><h2>  Wooden casket: sequence of work </h2><p>  To perform volumetric woodcarving on a casket (product photo is presented below) you will need: cutting tools, pencil, casket blank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zensationuk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood carving volume box photo" class="if uuid-3105162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3105162.jpg"></div><p>  The work is carried out in stages: </p><ol><li>  First of all, round the corners of the workpiece. </li><li>  Then, a pattern is drawn around the entire perimeter of the casket so that the lid and the lower part look harmonious. </li><li>  Volumetric cutting is performed, special attention is whitewashed on small details. </li><li>  Each item is carefully skinned. </li><li>  The box is covered with several layers of varnish. </li><li>  Velvet is cut out and pasted inside. </li></ol><p>  To master the technique of wood cutting is better with the most simple and small figures.  In the process, each carver acquires his secrets of mastery, understands how best to perform this or that element, how it is more convenient to hold the tool, and so on.  The main thing is no need to be afraid.  Feel free to realize your dreams. </p>
