  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning to knit. How to knit slippers? Unusual, warm and beautiful.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any things that we knit with our own hands for dear, beloved people, or for ourselves, give a special warmth.  After all, we create them with love and care in order to give them to a certain person.  It is these things that give extra comfort to our home and the comfort of everyday life.  Of course, not all of us can do it ourselves, but many people can do such an activity as knitting.  For example, if you know how to handle knitting needles and yarn at least a little, you can easily knit <span>slippers with knitting needles</span> for your whole family. </p><p>  Someone may say that such an activity is suitable only for grandmothers, and it is they who should know how to tie slippers beautiful and warm.  But should our grandmothers only take care of their relatives?  Of course not.  <span>Knitting slippers with</span> knitting needles is not so difficult.  It is only at first glance it seems to us that everything is so incomprehensible.  And such works do not take much time.  But what a beauty you end up with!  And your family will be very pleased with such a manifestation of care. </p><p>  So, let's figure out how to knit slippers.  There are many varied options.  Some of them will be quite accessible to everyone, and only experienced knitters can handle some.  Today I will talk about the simplest of them.  Any woman who knows how to dial loops and knit the simplest shawl pattern can handle knitting these slippers.  That is, the most common facial loops.  Now let's find out how to tie slippers - footprints. </p><p>  For many, it will probably be a discovery that from a simple rectangle you can make very interesting, unusual and very attractive slippers.  Knitting the whole fabric is <span>handkerchief viscous,</span> although, if desired, can be done with the <span>front surface</span> and any pattern.  We take the most ordinary knitting needles of size 3 - 3.5 mm, we select the yarn of the desired thickness.  Next, calculate the loops.  This is done quite simply.  Take a measuring tape and measure the circumference of the foot.  Measure should be in a circle, starting from the thumb to the tip of the little finger.  It should not be completely measured, since the canvas is stretched and slippers will turn out a little more.  The resulting number of centimeters must be multiplied by two, since when knitting exactly this size in the finished product, usually two loops are obtained per centimeter of the fabric. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So how <span>to knit slippers?</span>  We collect on the knitting needles the calculated number of loops and knit with any pattern 12-13 cm. Then we make the edge trim.  This can be done with knitting needles or crochet.  It turns out a fairly long rectangle with a curly edge.  Now the main thing remains - to collect slippers.  To do this, take the canvas and mark the middle.  Fold one half of the rectangle in half towards the center and sew along the bottom.  Fold the second half at an angle of 90 degrees so that the side edge is connected to the bottom, and the curly edge lies on the opposite side of the rectangular blank.  Flush the bottom, slightly rounded in front.  The second slippers should be knitted in the same way, but sewn to the other side, so that the curly edge is on the outer sides of the product.  Although it is quite possible to do the other way around, and let the tied edges run along the inside.  Here, who more like it. </p><p>  This is the easiest option on how to tie slippers yourself, with your own hands.  It turns out a very original, unusual and very interesting product.  You can show imagination and knit certain patterns, or just make a canvas from multi-colored stripes.  This option can be created even from the remnants of yarn.  You can sew on <span>knitted flowers</span> or embroider them with beads.  There are an incredible number of design and decoration options.  But these cute slippers will perfectly warm your legs on cold evenings.  You can decorate them not only with various decorative elements, but also sew on the outsole, then they will become not only especially beautiful, but will also last a very long time.  These slippers are perfect for a gift to your loved ones.  They will certainly appreciate such attention and care. </p>
