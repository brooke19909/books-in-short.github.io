The first science city of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, it is quite obvious that only with the development of innovative technologies will Russia be able to take its rightful place in the global economic market.  This will also allow our state to restore and maintain the status of a great power. </p><p>  Yes, Russia is rich in exported natural resources (including gas and oil).  However, the products of their primary processing are not the foundation of economic power, sometimes making the country dependent on more developed states.  That is why a speedy transition from an economy oriented to fuel and energy resources to the innovative development of all spheres of the national economy is required.  And this is only possible with the stimulation of intellectual and research activities in the field of energy and transport, machine and instrument making, aviation and space industry. </p><p>  An innovative breakthrough is also needed in medicine and education, bio- and information technologies.  How to achieve this?  Activation and stimulation of a powerful intellectual and scientific-technical potential through the development of Russian science cities. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  Such a concept as "science city" appeared in Russia only in the early 90s of the last century.  And at its initial stage it was of a collective nature.  In the list, in which there were science cities of Russia, cities and towns were united that had similar development problems.  This included a special type of settlement.  City-forming in them were scientific-production and other organizations directly related to the development of the scientific and technical sphere of the national economy.  What were the prerequisites for the creation of such settlements? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The science cities of Russia were distinguished by such a powerful concentration of intelligence that they allowed to create, and then maintain, much-needed strategic parity in the most important military areas.  In addition, by creating such settlements, the state managed to achieve the highest level of research in a number of areas. </p><h2>  Geography of science cities </h2><p>  Currently, there are seventy settlements on the territory of our country, the main purpose of which is the development of innovative areas.  Cities-science cities of Russia are located in the resettlement zone. </p><p>  Almost half of this list can be found on a map of the Moscow region.  These include Zelenograd, which by administrative affiliation is part of the capital. </p>

The list with their largest list is in the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions.  In third place in the concentration of such formations is Western Siberia.  On its territory there are six science cities.  You can find them on a map of the Altai Territory, as well as Tomsk and Novosibirsk Regions. </p><h2>  The composition of science cities </h2><p>  Most of the settlements that concentrate their intellectual potential are cities.  More recently, two villages have received the status of "city-science cities of Russia."  The list of such entities was added to: </p><p>  - pos.  Chernogolovka, located in the Moscow region; <br>  - pos.

But this is not all the science cities of Russia.  Their list has been replenished by the academic towns of large scientific centers of the Far East and Siberia.  By their administrative affiliation, they are urban areas. </p><p>  The diversity of the population of science cities is also different.  In the largest of them more than two hundred thousand inhabitants are registered.  This list includes such a science city of Russia as Biysk.  Large scientific entities with the same numbers include Dzerzhinsk and Zelenograd. </p><p>  How many science cities in Russia are in second place in terms of the number of people living in them?  There are eight such entities.  Moreover, most of this list is located in the Moscow region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most often, the science city of Russia is a settlement in which from 20 to 100 thousand inhabitants.  Such a population is found in almost half of all scientific entities. </p><p>  The smallest city-science city of Russia is Primorsk, located in the Leningrad region.  Its population is just over six thousand people. </p><p>  The number of people living in science cities in the status of <span>urban-type settlements varies.</span>  So, the population of the village.

This is due to the entry of such entities into large cities.  Specific data is only about the Novosibirsk Academgorodok, because this scientific education is located in the Soviet district of the administrative center.  At the beginning of 2001, 130.9 thousand people were registered here.

    <h2>  Extension of the list of science cities </h2><p>  At present, it is difficult to calculate the total number of research centers that are engaged in the implementation of modern technologies in the national economy.  The fact is that there are ZATOs ‚Äî closed administrative-territorial entities called ‚Äúmailboxes‚Äù.  Their active declassification began in the first half of the nineties of the last century, but even today not all of these centers are known to the general public. </p><p>  To expand the list, which includes cities of science cities of Russia, can also some settlements that have powerful scientific and technical potential.  For example, relatively recently, a similar thing happened with Gatchina, located in the Leningrad region.  This settlement, with a population of 82.3 thousand people, was considered a science city because of the St. Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics located on its territory. </p><p>  The list of such entities may include: </p><p>  - Angarsk, located in the <span>Irkutsk region (population</span> - 264 thousand people); <br>  - Glazov (106.8 thousand inhabitants), located on the territory of Udmurtia. </p><p>  An electrolysis plant engaged in uranium enrichment operates in Angarsk.  Glazov can rightfully be considered the founder of the Ural nuclear industry.  This status is assigned to the city because of the Chepetsk Mechanical Plant, which produces metal uranium. </p>

    <p>  But this is far from a complete list of cities and towns that are candidates for inclusion in the list of science cities.  So, today the issue of including Petrodvorets in the list of such entities is being considered, because this settlement is the most famous and largest museum city in the world. </p><h2>  Status Assignment </h2><p>  In November 1997, the President of the Russian Federation initiated the state policy on the development of scientific centers.  It was during this period that the Decree ‚ÄúOn measures for the development of science cities as cities of high technology and science‚Äù was signed.  It was then that the very concept of such an education was defined, carrying out innovative, scientific and technical activities and conducting various kinds of experimental development in priority areas for the country. </p><p>  The first science city of Russia, which officially received such a status, is the city of Obninsk, located in the Kaluga region.  This happened in May 2000. A year later, the city of Korolev (Moscow Region) was officially called the city of science.  In December 2001, this status was assigned to Dubna. </p><h2>  Specialization of science cities </h2><p>  Cities involved in innovative and scientific-technical developments conduct their activities in various directions.  So, in one row are the classical scientific settlements (Borok, Dubna, Troitsk) and academic towns.  Cities with an impressive scientific and production base (Reutov, Khimki, Zhukovsky) stand out separately.  The science cities of the atomic complex (Sarov, Ozersk, etc.) also belong to them.  In a separate group of such formations are cities in which tests of manufactured equipment are conducted (Plesetsk, Mirny, Dmitrov-7, etc.). </p><p>  However, the main scientific cities of Russia and their specialization are complex.  Such centers of intellectual thought conduct various kinds of scientific research, covering a wide range of areas.  However, all of them are united by one specific feature.  Among the huge number of areas of activity, two or three main ones can always be distinguished.  Such science cities are called multi-oriented. </p>

    <p>  In classifying science cities by their specialization, an intermediate group is also distinguished.  It includes such entities in which scientific development is carried out in a number of areas, but only one of them is the main one, and the rest is only additional or accompanying the main activity. </p><h2>  <span>Space Research</span> and Aircraft Engineering </h2><p>  The most widespread research organizations involved in the development of space and aviation needs.  How many science cities in Russia carry out activities in this direction?  There are 25 such centers in the country, with the majority of them located in the Moscow region.  Among them are cities that have played a special role in the scientific and technological development of the country. </p><p>  So, the leader of the domestic aircraft industry is Zhukovsky.  Its population is 95.1 thousand people.  This science city serves as the leading center of our country in which the design and testing of aircraft is carried out.  Here are the world-famous Gromov Flight Research Institute, as well as the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.  Zhukovsky. </p><p>  The city of Korolev, with a population of 132.9 thousand people, is also a space science specialization.  The main enterprise of this education is the Energy Corporation.  This is the country's leading aerospace developer of many space programs, including Energy-Buran.  But not only this is famous for Mr. Korolev.  On its territory there is a cosmonaut training center. </p><p>  Another science city adjoins the Queen.  This is the Jubilee with a population of 27.7 thousand people.  On the territory of this entity are research institutes involved in the development of systems for the space-rocket complex. <br>  A science town with a similar specialization is Star City.  Its population is 5.5 thousand inhabitants.  This formation is a village on the territory of which cosmonauts prepare for manned flights. </p><p>  In the western direction from Moscow there is a closed science city.  This is the city of Krasnoznamensk, in which 29.4 thousand people live.  Back in the late 40s of the last century, the Central Communications Center was opened on the territory of this entity, which today is the Main Center for Testing and Control of Space Flights. </p><p>  One of the most famous science cities specializing in space research is such cities as Mirny and Znamensk.  They are located near the cosmodromes Plesetsk and Kapustin Yar. </p><h2>  Centers of Radio Engineering and Electronics </h2><p>  Science cities that specialize in these activities in these areas are allocated in a separate group, since the research conducted in them is unique.  There are three such entities in Russia in total.  Two such cities - Fryazino and Zelenograd - are located in the Moscow region.  The third - Pravdinsk - in the Nizhny Novgorod region. </p>

The history of this city, which currently has 207.8 thousand inhabitants, began in 1958. It was then that the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision to begin construction of the satellite city of the capital.  The location for this administrative entity was located near the Kryukovo station.  Already in the first ten years of its existence, eight large institutes were built in the city, at which pilot plants were built, engaged in a variety of developments, including in the field of microelectronics.

    <h2>  The development of the nuclear complex </h2><p>  Among the scientific cities of Russia there are also those that specialize in scientific research, and are also involved in the application of the technologies developed by them in the fields of nuclear chemistry and physics.  A special place in this list is occupied by ten atomic cities.  At one time, such cities were created thanks to the introduction of the atomic project in the USSR.  The foundation for the creation of such science cities was laid back in 1943. It was then that Laboratory No. 2 appeared in Moscow, dealing with the tasks of creating nuclear weapons.  Today it is a large, highly developed scientific center called the Kurchatov Institute. </p><p>  In the future, the development of the Laboratory required the creation of a number of organizations located in significant territories where it was possible to locate scientific-production and testing complexes.  To solve this problem, ten enterprises were built.  All of them were far from settlements, as well as highways and railways (away from "extra eyes"). </p><p>  The most famous science city of nuclear physics in Russia is Sarov.  It is located in the European part of the country, on the area occupied by the <span>Mordovian reserve.</span>  The number of residents living in it is 84.9 thousand people.  Over the years, this science city bore such names as Yasnogorsk and the Kremlin, Arzamas-75 and Arzamas-16.  And only in 1994, after a referendum, the city began to be called so: Sarov. </p><p>  What science city specializes in nuclear physics in Russia?  In addition to the above, it is worth indicating the city of Zarechny.  It is also located in the European part of the country, in the Penza region. </p><p>  There are five more atomic cities in the Urals.  These are Snezhinsk, Ozersk and Trekhgorny located in the Chelyabinsk region, as well as Novouralsk and Lesnoy in the Sverdlovsk region.  Three cities specializing in nuclear research are located in Siberia.  These are Seversk in the <span>Tomsk Region,</span> Zelenogorsk and Zheleznogorsk in the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory.</span> </p><p>  What specialization of what science city in Russia is nuclear physics?

This is Obninsk - the first science city in Russia to receive such a high status.  It is located southwest of Moscow, one hundred and twenty kilometers from the capital, and today its population is 107.8 thousand people.

    <p>  The construction of Obninsk began in 1946, when, on the basis of a boarding school and an orphanage, it was decided to erect a secret object "B".  Research in the field of nuclear physics was conducted not only by Soviet, but also by German specialists invited to the Laboratory under contract.  Later, a Physics and Energy Institute was created in Obninsk, and in 1954 the world's first nuclear power plant began its work here. </p><h2>  Agricultural Problem Solving </h2><p>  The science city of agricultural specialization in Russia is the city of Michurinsk.  This status was given to this settlement located in the Tambov Region relatively recently - 4. 11. 2003, on the basis of the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation.  The same document also approved the main areas in which the only Russian science city of agrarian specialization should conduct its activities.  Among them are the following: </p><p> -      ,   ,  ,    ,     ,    ; <br> -        ,   ,       ; <br> - -  ,         ,    ,    ; <br> -          . </p>
