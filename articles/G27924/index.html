  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most famous physicists and their contribution to science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Physics is one of the <span>fundamental sciences</span> that allows people to learn more about the fundamental laws of planet Earth.  Every day, people don‚Äôt notice how they use the benefits that have become possible thanks to the work of numerous scientists.  If it were not for their dedicated work, a person would not be able to fly in an airplane, cross oceans on huge liners, and even just turn on an electric kettle.  All these dedicated researchers have made the face of the world what modern people see it. </p><h2>  Galileo's discoveries </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1659610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42514/1659610.jpg?1537209981"></div><p>  The physicist Galileo is one of the most famous.  He is a physicist, astronomer, mathematician and mechanic.  It was he who first invented the telescope.  With the help of this device, unprecedented for that time, it was possible to observe distant celestial bodies.  Galileo Galilei is the founder of an experimental field in physical science.  The first discoveries that Galileo made with a telescope, saw the light in his work "Starry Herald".  This book was truly a sensational success.  Since Galileo‚Äôs ideas were largely contrary to the Bible, he was haunted by the Inquisition for a long time. </p><h2>  Newton's biography and discoveries </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1659604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42514/1659604.jpg?1537209981"></div><p>  The great scientist who made discoveries in many areas is also Isaac Newton.  The most famous of his discoveries is the <span>law of gravity.</span>  In addition, the physicist explained many natural phenomena based on mechanics, and also described the features of the movement of the planets around the Sun, Moon and Earth.  Newton was born on January 4, 1643 in the English town of Woolstorpe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After graduating from school, he entered college at Cambridge University.  Physicists who taught in college had a great influence on Newton.  Inspired by the example of teachers, Newton made several of his first discoveries.  They mainly concerned the field of mathematics.  Next, Newton begins to conduct experiments on the decomposition of light.  In 1668 he received a master's degree.  In 1687, Newton's first serious scientific work, The Beginnings, was published.  In 1705, the scientist was awarded the title of knight, and the <span>Queen of England</span> , who ruled in that era, personally thanked Newton for his research. </p><h2>  Physicist: Maria Curie-Sklodowska </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1659602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42514/1659602.jpg?1537209981"></div><p>  Physicists around the world still use in their work and the achievements of Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska.  She is the only female physicist to have been nominated for the Nobel Prize twice.  Marie Curie was born on November 7, 1867 in Warsaw.  In childhood, a tragedy occurred in the girl's family - the mother and one of the sisters died.  While studying at school, Marie Curie was distinguished by her diligence and interest in science. </p><p>  In 1890, <span>Marie Curie</span> moved to her older sister in Paris, where she entered the Sorbonne.  Then she met with her future husband - Pierre Curie.  As a result of many years of scientific research, the couple discovered two new radioactive elements - radium and polonium.  Shortly before the outbreak of war, a <span>radium institute</span> was opened in France <span>,</span> where Marie Curie served as director.  In 1920, she released a book called Radiology and War, which summarized her scientific experience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Albert Einstein: one of the greatest minds of the planet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1659601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42514/1659601.jpg?1537209981"></div><p>  Physicists all over the planet know the name of Albert Einstein.  His authorship is the theory of relativity.  Modern physics relies heavily on Einstein‚Äôs views, despite the fact that not all modern scientists agree with his discoveries.  Einstein was a Nobel Prize winner.  During his life, he wrote about 300 scientific papers on physics, as well as 150 papers on the history and philosophy of science.  Until the age of 12, Einstein was a very religious child, since he received his education at a Catholic school.  After little Albert read several scientific books, he came to the conclusion: not all the provisions in the Bible can be true. </p><p>  Many believe that Einstein was brilliant since childhood.  This is far from the case.  As a schoolboy, Einstein was considered a very weak student.  Although even then he was interested in mathematics, physics, and also the philosophical works of Kant.  In 1896, Einstein entered the Faculty of Education in Zurich, where he also met his future wife, Mileva Marich.  In 1905, Einstein published some articles, which, however, some physicists criticized.  In 1933, Einstein permanently moved to the United States. </p><h2>  Other researchers </h2><p>  But there are other well-known names of physicists who have made no less significant discoveries in their field.  These are V.K. Roentgen, and <span>A.D. Sakharov,</span> S. Hawking, N. Tesla, L. L. Landau, N. Bohr, M. Planck, E. Fermi, <span>E. Rutherford,</span> M. Faraday, A A. Becquerel and many others.  Their contribution to physical science is equally important. </p>
