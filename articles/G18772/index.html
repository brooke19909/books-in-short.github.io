After a few years, you can safely call it a brand.  Every year, the Chinese release several new products that are becoming popular around the world.  Last year, Honor 4C occupied this place of honor, this year - Highway Honor 5C. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the box with the smartphone "not a lot."  Many complain about the lack of an already beloved OTG cable.  However, documentation, a charger, and a USB cable are available.  Also somewhere else inside is a ‚Äúclip‚Äù for removing the card tray.  Otherwise, no additional "buns" such as bumpers, films and other things did not get into the box. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway honor 5s specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405441.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Honor Highway 5C phone replaced the Honor 4C.  It was assumed that the changes would concern the technical component, but it wasn‚Äôt there.  Outwardly, the novelty is little similar to the previous "brother" and generally resembles a "distant relative."  The manufacturer worked hard on the design of the Highway Honor 5C smartphone.  Specifications, reviews and photos only confirm this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The smart turned out to be far from the Huawei family, therefore, looking at the screen, the brand can hardly be recognized.  On the front, they covered everything with glass, in which they made a hole for the earpiece and front camera.  Also nearby are light and proximity sensors. </p><p>  The remaining elements are classically arranged for this model.  At the top there is a place for headphones and an additional microphone.  A hole for the USB cable is located on the bottom end in the center, and on both sides of it is the main microphone and the main speaker. </p><p>  The power button and volume rocker are on the right side of the case.  On the left is a SIM card slot and a memory card.  By the way, here you can use either two SIM cards, or put microSDHC in a universal slot, while using the services of one telecom operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway Honor 5s specifications" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The back of the smartphone looks very beautiful.  The device received a metal back panel with plastic elements.  Above in the center is the main camera, next to it is a small flash window.  The version of the model for Asians also acquired <span>a fingerprint scanner,</span> for Europeans this option is for some reason unavailable. </p><p>  Highway Honor 5C received positive reviews from owners regarding the design.  This is no wonder.  The smartphone really turned out to be bright and stylish.  It seems to have the features of other flagships, but remains unlike any other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  Ergonomics of the device at the highest level.  Despite the fact that it is considered a budget option, externally and tactilely, it is not inferior to the world flagships.  The case turned out rounded, so the smartphone is comfortable to hold in your hand.  The screen is medium in size, so it‚Äôs easy to use with one hand. </p><p>  The metal on the back is pleasant to the touch.  The phone is lightweight and compact enough to just fit in jeans.  In general, the use is very convenient and presentable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor Highway 5s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405437.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A high resolution </h2><p>  The screen turned out to be of high quality for Highway Honor 5C.  Specifications, reviews and photos confirm this.  The display has 5.2 inches, which with a resolution of 1920x1080 gives a wonderful clear picture.  In addition, for the lack of pixelation is responsible for the air gap and a high density of dots per inch - 424. </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãon the TFT-IPS screen, so the picture is moderately bright and saturated.  Although there are inaccuracies with the transfer of white.  Here it is quite cold, so for those who really get in the way, there is a manual adjustment of color temperature. </p><p>  Regardless of the slope has a "Highway Honor 5C" excellent review.  The same can be said about brightness, which works correctly on a bright sunny day and at night.  By the way, regarding the comfort of using the display, it is worth mentioning LTPS technology.  Saturation does not drop even with the most powerful external light source, thanks to polycrystalline silicon and double GFF lamination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All technologies used do not make the sensor less sensitive.  He responds well to commands, but problems with phantom clicks were not observed.  The sensor, by the way, during testing was able to recognize up to 10 touches.  It is possible to use it with gloves, for this you need to select a special mode in the settings of the Highway Honor 5C phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway Honor 5c review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405435.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The reviews concerned only problems with fingerprints.  It is incomprehensible that it attracts traces to the screen in such a way that it was really impossible to modify the <span>oleophobic coating</span> so that the prints were easily erased.  The problem remains urgent. </p><h2>  New operating system </h2><p>  Probably it would be strange if the developers had put on the novelty the old version of Android.  Therefore, the device received Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  It is also accepted that there is a proprietary interface add-on, which seems to make it somewhat different.  EMUI 4.1 also finalized and changed the drawing of menu items, icons and the notification curtain. </p><p>  Otherwise, everything inside has remained unchanged.  Workspace organization can be customizable.  The main screen contains a list of applications, new software is added to additional blocks.  Everything can be moved and added to your taste. </p><p>  By the way, the notification curtain has become perhaps more productive.  It was divided into two tabs.  The first is responsible for notifications, the second contains shortcuts to the standard settings. </p><p>  Returning to the updated EMUI 4.1, it is worth noting the abundance of parameters available to users.  In addition to the already established settings for the smartphone, the developers suggest changing the interface to your taste.  Moreover, the owners of this model can hope to adjust the smallest details. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway honor 5s reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405436.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can change the position of the screens, turning them over, setting up gestures and a combination of virtual buttons.  You can work with issuing notifications or adjust the settings for managing standard actions.  In general, ‚ÄúHighway Honor 5C‚Äù allows you to show all possible creative talents. </p><h2>  By standard </h2><p>  Otherwise, everything remained unchanged.  Intact software for communication and messenger.  The design here is from Android 6.0.  A standard virtual keyboard or its analogue is also available. </p><p>  Preinstalled applications are, fortunately, a minimum.  Huawei did not "stuff" all kinds of software, which still have to be removed in order to free up memory.  From the proprietary <span>file manager</span> and system optimizer.  The latter, by the way, is very useful, now you will not need to look for similar software in the Google store. </p><p>  The music player and radio turned out to be quite simple both in use and in the interface.  To turn on the latter, as always, a headset is required as an antenna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway Honor 5s owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405442.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  New </h2><p>  A gift for sports lovers.  An application that monitors physical activity has penetrated the new smartphone.  This is usually sought in the play market, and in the "Highway Honor 5C" it is built-in.  The coprocessor and motion sensor here work as a famous pedometer.  In the settings you can search for various interesting additions.  In general, the application monitors physical activity, and quite accurately.  There is also a useful option for those who do not like to take the phone for a walk or a run.  To keep counting, you can use Bluetooth trackers. </p><h2>  Generous "filling" </h2><p>  The developers tried, providing powerful features for a smartphone such as Highway Honor 5C.  The company received enthusiastic reviews about the performance.  It is worth considering that for its price the device came out quite powerful and efficient. </p><p>  The main thing in this model is the availability of the Kirin 650 system from HiSilicon.  It allows you to harmoniously assemble two quad-core processors.  In addition, the i5 coprocessor was placed on the phone, which works only with sensors and a sensor.  Now the smooth, stable operation of the display and its quick response to commands becomes understandable. </p><p>  The graphics processor here is the Mali-T830.  The RAM here is 2 GB, which is normal for this price category.  The internal memory is 16 GB, of which only 11 GB will be free.  If this is enough for the owner, he can safely use the slots for two SIM cards, if not enough, then you will have to work with one operator.  Only in this case, the amount of memory can be increased. </p><h2>  The working process </h2><p>  With daily work, neither lags nor sub-loads were noticed.  The amount of RAM is enough to play a toy in the evening, which was opened in the morning.  The whole system works stably and for the benefit of Highway Honor 5C.  The characteristics are confirmed by third-party software such as "Antutu".  The performance is average and stable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor Highway 5s Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405438.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To test real performance, it is best to run the toys.  Of course, such as Doodle Jump or Lara Croft: Relic Run work without lags and subsidence fps.  But World Of Tanks Blitz is best at minimum settings, as high fps are observed at high settings. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The developers tried to improve everything possible for a smartphone of this price category, therefore, makes Honor Highway 5C a five plus photo.  A pleasant surprise was the presence of a front camera of 8 megapixels.  The main lens got 13 megapixels. </p><p>  The optics of both cameras are of high quality.  Each of them has a good aperture of 2.0.  The camera software itself is convenient and easy to use.  Automatic settings do not always work correctly, but with manual settings you can play around and take really high-quality pictures. </p><p>  You can find it in the menu, where, by the way, there are many interesting modes, for example, ‚Äúdelicious food‚Äù or timelapse. </p><p>  Pictures with automatic settings are excellent only during the day in good light.  But if you shoot indoors, then the noise can be traced more clearly.  In principle, the picture remains not bad, but its detailing is noticeably deteriorating. </p><p>  At night, you can shoot only with the correct manual shooting.  Of course, while sunset, the camera can produce good photos, but if you work with the parameters, the images are much better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor Highway 5s photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405439.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The flash turned out to be rather weak.  Since it lacks a two-tone LED, it works with varying degrees of success.  Sometimes it's better to refuse her help.  In addition, it can work correctly only at close range.  Macro shooting is, but the desired effect is unlikely to be achieved.  It seems that the detailing is good, but it is impossible to achieve a ‚Äúblurred‚Äù background. </p><p>  The front camera does not seem to give the promised 8 megapixels.  It is quite ordinary without autofocus and with low viewing angles. </p><h2>  Wireless technology </h2><p>  There are no complaints regarding the wireless interface.  The developers did their best to make communication comfortable using the Honor Highway 5C smartphone.  A description of all the features is available in the instructions.  From the basic: the user can use LTE frequencies. </p><p>  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are standard.  Navigation works with Glonass and Baidu.  This option in the smartphone works as quickly as possible.  The minimum satellite search time is up to 5 seconds, in some cases the phone needs half a minute to receive data. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A 3000 mAh battery is available for operation.  The average battery life is about one and a half days.  In this mode, the user can access 60 minutes of conversations, a couple of hours of music, half an hour of games and the same number of videos.  At the same time, the <span>background mode of</span> social networks and their active use are not ruled out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Honor Highway 5s phone" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405443.jpg" width="600"></div>

The phone costs about 15 thousand rubles.  The model completely pays for itself and sometimes seems like a gift among other devices in this price category. </p><p>  The smartphone is productive and affordable.  It will not suit unless those who are in pursuit of fashionable fashion gadgets. </p>
