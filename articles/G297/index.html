Therefore, it will be correct to present, within the framework of this article, only the most popular and profitable options that will help to more quickly achieve such a goal as making money on iPhone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Earnings on writing articles </h2><p>  The so-called copywriting appeared in RuNet about 8 years ago.  The first ones were given the opportunity to earn by writing articles such exchanges as eTXT.ru, Advego.ru.  To start "making money" in this way, you should follow these steps: </p><ul><li>  Find and register on the exchange you like (you can immediately on several, so it will be easier to pick up more orders). </li><li>  Leave a request for work. </li><li>  Wait for her approval by the customer. </li><li>  Complete the order. </li><li>  Get your hard-earned money. </li></ul><p>  How is the writing process carried out?  Most likely, this question began to worry almost every reader.  So, let's say the customer gave the task to write about "how to get rid of a headache."  The contractor drives this phrase into the search engine, finds articles on this topic, carefully re-reads them and writes his own unique article. </p><p>  Apparently, there is nothing complicated about this.  It would be a desire!  If you do this well, it‚Äôs quite possible to make money on your long-awaited ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù within 3-4 months. </p>

    <h2>  Earning polls </h2><p>  In this way, most likely, it will be difficult to make money on iPhone in a short time, since often this type of online work brings in no more than 3000 rubles a month.  But, accordingly, he spends a little time.  So, for example, it takes about 20 minutes to complete one survey, but it costs about 50 rubles.  Thus, in order to earn 3,000 rubles, it takes only 20 hours of time.  That is, a day will not need to spend even one hour. </p><p>  Moreover, it is worth noting the simplicity of this type of earnings: all that will need to be done is to answer the questions presented.  However, there are very few invitations to fill out a questionnaire from one site.  Therefore, to ensure a more decent income, you should immediately register in a dozen questionnaires. </p><p>  Yes, as they said, this method will not allow you to earn a lot of money.  However, an additional 3,000 thousand in a piggy bank with the inscription ‚ÄúOn iPhone‚Äù will not be superfluous to anyone!  Moreover, some exchanges offer special points as payment, having accumulated enough of them, you can choose certain valuable gifts.  Therefore, you should "rummage" in such sites, perhaps thanks to one of them you can earn "iPhone" ?! </p>
