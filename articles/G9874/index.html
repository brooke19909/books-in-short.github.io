    <h2>  How to get information about the balance of the uterus: online calculator </h2><p>  Suppose you and your family are happy owners of a family certificate.  One of your children is already three years old, and you have already spent part of the money allocated by the state.  Next, you had plans to use the remaining part of the funds, but you do not know the exact amount in the account. </p><p>  How to find out the balance of maternity capital in this case?  The easiest option is to use the service on which there is an online calculator for such calculations.  As a rule, such calculators have a very simple menu.  It has 5-6 items, scheduled by year.  In order to carry out the calculation, it is necessary to indicate in the necessary column the exact amount that you spent in a particular year.  For example, in 2013 you spent only 20,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, enter this amount into the window from 2013 and click on the highlighted button ‚ÄúCalculate‚Äù.  In this case, the calculation is performed taking into account the amount established in the specified year.  Recall that at that time it amounted to 408 960 rubles.  After checking, the service will receive the balance amount for 2014 - 429,409 rubles and the indexed balance amount for 2015 - 453,026 rubles.  And here a reasonable question arises: ‚ÄúFor what reason did the balance amount not decrease, but increase?‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Why did these amounts increase? </h2><p>  Do not assume how to find out the balance of maternity capital?  In the calculations, did you get an increased amount of the balance?  The main reason for this anomaly is the indexation of the amount of mother capital.  That is, the law provides for annual indexation of money until 2017.  In particular, we are talking about those families that at a certain point in time have not yet managed to use all the money from family capital, but only a small part of it has been used up. </p><p>  In such cases, each year the amount of the remaining capital will be indexed and, accordingly, increase. </p><h2>  How to find out the balance of maternity capital through the Internet: public services website </h2><p>  The second option for obtaining information on the balance of funds of the capital is to access the public services website.  In order to submit a request for providing information on the balance of money in the account, you must first record your data in the system, and then do the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  go to the public services website; </li><li>  select the item ‚ÄúPublic services‚Äù; </li><li>  at the bottom of the list, click on the tab ‚Äúall services (by departments); </li><li>  select the tab "Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Russian Federation"; </li><li>  select the ‚ÄúPension Fund of the Russian Federation‚Äù tab; </li><li>  follow the link ‚ÄúInforming citizens about the provision of state social assistance in the form of a set of social services‚Äù; </li><li>  click on the button ‚ÄúGet a service‚Äù. </li></ul>

Can this be done?  At the moment, you cannot enter the Pension Fund website and find information about the balance of the capital there.  This is due to the law on the storage of personal data of users. </p>

    <h2>  Can a spouse or family <span>member take a statement of the</span> balance of funds? </h2><p>  The certificate on the account status of the capital can only be obtained by the parent who previously wrote an application for the issuance of such a document.  He, too, can receive a certificate only by passport.  A spouse or any relative of this person will be able to get a certificate only if there is a notarized power of attorney.  Otherwise, no account balance information is provided. </p><h2>  Can I get a certificate of the balance in another city? </h2><p>  Many mothers are interested in the question of how to see the balance of maternity capital in another city.  For example, if the certificate was issued in Moscow, and you currently live in Volgograd.  In this case, you can get such information.  However, before this, it makes sense to contact the Pension Fund branch at the place of residence and write a statement about the request for your case to that branch of the fund, in which documents for issuing the certificate were issued earlier.  Further, the Pension Fund will send a request to another body of the FIU. </p><p>  After receiving your case from Moscow, you will be able to write an application for a certificate of the amount of the balance.  According to preliminary information, the electronic transfer of your case will take about 1-2 weeks. </p><h2>  Does the <span>expiration date have a</span> certificate of the requested amount of the balance of the capital? </h2><p>  In addition to the question of how to check the balance on maternity capital, many parents are also interested in whether the certificate with such information has an expiration date. </p><p>  Based on the rules, there is no expiration date on the certificate requested by parents about the balance of funds in the account.  By and large, it is relevant only at the time of treatment.  Suppose, after receiving it, the owners of the capital decided to spend another part of the money.  Consequently, the amount indicated in the certificate will no longer correspond to real data. </p>
