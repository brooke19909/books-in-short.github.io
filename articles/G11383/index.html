For the first time, a new decree was officially and legally enshrined in the 11th century, during the reign of the Kiev prince Yaroslav the Wise.  Some historians <span>consider this</span> innovation an important stage in the transition from blood-kinship to socio-political relations. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the era </h2><p>  Vira in ancient Russia is a new step in strengthening princely power in the early history of our country.  At this time, this institution has just begun to take shape in society.  An important role was still played by tribal relations, which had to be reckoned with.  The rule of blood feud, which did not comply with the principles of the nascent young state, was maintained.  There was a need to streamline social relations in order to subordinate them to supreme power.  Therefore, vira in ancient Russia is an important measure in strengthening the status of the prince. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vira in ancient Russia is" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1286742.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The first mention of this concept in ancient Russian sources dates back to the 9th century; it is found in treaties between Russians and Greeks.  In the famous "Tale of Bygone Years", in the story of the time of the reign of Vladimir the Holy, there is a mention of how this prince began to restore order in his possessions, and for this began the fight against the robbers.  The chronicler reports that after the adoption of Orthodoxy, he replaced the execution with a virus.  It should be borne in mind that the first concept did not always mean a death sentence, but also implied any type of punishment of moderate severity.  This word meant bodily blows, <span>confiscation of property,</span> arrest and others.  Finally, the son of Vladimir Yaroslav, nicknamed the Wise, enshrined this decision in one of the oldest legal monuments.  According to the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù, a vira in ancient Russia is a contribution to the prince for the murdered or mutilated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Application </h2><p>  Some historians point out that the introduction of the new rule primarily provided for the protection of princely people.  The price for their murder at that time was quite high - 40 hryvnia.  For this money it was possible to buy a herd of sheep or several cows.  So, the amount was large enough for an ordinary person and contributed to the replenishment of the princely treasury.  In this regard, vira has become an important means of regulating social relations.  In ancient Russia, this is the century of the establishment of the supreme princely power, so the new norm was designed to strengthen its environment. </p>

    <p>  The source in question also mentions other social strata that were under the protection of the prince.  These are Rusyns and Slavs.  In historiography, there are different points of view regarding the content of these concepts, which will be discussed below.  Here it is necessary to add that the supreme power, expanding the circle of people for whom the virus was supposed to pay for the killing or mutilation, strengthened its position in society. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is Vira in ancient Russia? Definition" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1286738.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Categories of persons </h2><p>  So, historians disagree on what ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù meant by the concepts of ‚ÄúRusyns‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlav‚Äù.  By the first term, some mean a princely warrior, a combatant, referring to more ancient sources, in which "Rus" denoted the immediate environment of the ruler.  However, some authors apply the concept to the 11th century, arguing that we are talking not only about princely warriors, but also about categories of the urban population in general, and note that in this way the authorities sought to subordinate the city to their influence.  Proponents of this point of view at the same time oppose the Rusyns to the Slavs, seeing the latter as a villager.  They emphasize that in this way the supreme power tried to subjugate not only the urban population, but also the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Concept extension </h2><p>  One of the controversial issues in the study of early history is what is vira in ancient Russia.  The definition of this term is rather difficult due to the fact that it is not explained and explained in any way in the studied source.  However, already in the next major legal monument - ‚ÄúThe Truth of the Yaroslavichi‚Äù - it is noted that the fee for the murder or mutilation of a princely man - a horse - has been increased.  This is seen as a written fixation of the process of strengthening princely power.  It is significant that these sources provided for the payment of a fine only for free people.  Killing or mutilating a slave, for example, was not payable.  In addition, there was still wild vira in ancient Russia.  This concept was understood as the procedure for collecting a fine from the entire community if the killer was not found, or if he himself could not pay for himself.  Thus, the community members were bound by <span>mutual responsibility.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vira in ancient Russia meaning" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1286735.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Role </h2><p>  The penalty payment system was an established mechanism.  He was collected by a special princely servant - a wirnik, and the prince gave one tenth to the bishop.  Therefore, vira in ancient Russia played a great role in strengthening the supreme power.  The significance of this norm was very important for eliminating the blood feud rule, replacing it with a system of public punishment, and also for strengthening the supreme power. </p>
