The beautiful of the ordinary</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It‚Äôs a pity sometimes to throw a bottle out of a wine of an unusual shape, bright saturated color.  One would like to transform it into some original decorative little thing, give, so to speak, a second life, adapt it for storage, or decorate the interior.  Perhaps such a desire arises in many creative natures, which is why there are so many different ways to decorate ordinary bottles and turn them into extraordinary household items and original gifts.  The painting of bottles can be done with stained glass or acrylic paints.  Moreover, the bottle is so democratic and timeless that you can paint it as you like using a traditional ornament, abstract painting, a picture in the spirit of pop art, expressionism, etc.  Full scope for imagination and creativity.  Do-it-yourself bottle painting is an activity to which children can be introduced.  They will definitely get something very original. </p><p>  Painting bottles.  Necessary materials </p><p>  To implement creative ideas you will need a beautiful bottle of stained glass.  In addition: acrylic <span>paints for glass</span> and ceramics in the main spectrum of colors;  contour paste (in a special tube) for glass of black, gold and silver color;  Disposable plate for <span>mixing paints;</span>  acrylic transparent varnish;  acetone;  thin brushes with natural bristles, cotton buds, a thick needle, matches, cotton pads, paper napkins, a soft simple pencil (cosmetic can be used) or a gel pen. </p><p>  Painting bottles.  Work sequence </p><p>  The very first and most difficult stage of work is drawing a preliminary <span>outline of the pattern</span> on the surface of the bottle (fat-free with alcohol or acetone).  You can use a stencil that is placed on the bottle and outlined with a pencil or pen.  You can draw the contours of the picture yourself.  In any case, the traditional way, when the drawing is laid under glass and outlined, is unacceptable here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After applying the drawing, it is outlined in pencil lines by a glass outline.  The result should be a convex contour pattern.  If in some places there are traces of a pencil or pen, then after the contour dries, they are washed off with water. </p><p>  Now you can start applying paints.  First, the bottle needs to be fixed in an inclined state so that it does not spin.  A serving stand, or two pieces of polystyrene foam with slots, is well suited for this.  After the bottle is fixed, you can begin to fill the areas between the contour with paints. </p><p>  Acrylic paints are quite dense and not very liquid, so it‚Äôs convenient to fill in separate sections between the contour.  First we use one color, the darkest.  After the dark paint has dried, the necessary transitions and small strokes are applied on top with lighter colors.  The smallest details of the drawing are applied with dotted strokes with a cotton swab or a match.  To accelerate the drying of the paint, a household hair dryer is used.  Work with him will go much faster.  You can dilute the acrylic paint with varnish, it will lie thinner and more even, and the texture will become more transparent. </p><p>  At the end of the work and after drying of all layers of paint, the drawing is coated with acrylic varnish.  This makes it less vulnerable to washing and protects against possible damage. </p><p>  Spotted bottles </p><p>  There is another very interesting and unusual way of painting bottles where only the outline is used.  Colored dots from a multi-colored contour cover the surface of the glass, like a beaded patterned grid.  The technology of painting is similar to the previous one.  The surface of the bottle is degreased, a preliminary contour of the drawing is applied.  Then along these lines, squeeze the contour from the tube into small dots, placing them close to each other, as if stringing rows of beads or embroidering with beads.  The most diverse colors of the contour, as well as gold and silver inclusions create an amazing pattern.  You can pre-prime the glass surface with an <span>acrylic primer,</span> and on it, for example, draw a thin dot pattern with a black outline.  This manner of painting will imitate delicate delicate lace. </p><p>  Bottle painting is a kind of creativity that turns simple everyday things into real works of decorative art, colorizing life with bright colors, allowing you to "plunge" into the wonderful world of creative imagination. </p>
