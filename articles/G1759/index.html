Since they are an inseparable component of smart cards, we will start a discussion with them. </p><h2>  Smart cards </h2><p>  This is the name of plastic cards that have an integrated chip.  The prevailing number of them contains an OS and a microprocessor that protect access to the card, in other words, carry out cryptographic operations: storing operations using keys, user authentication, operations in a trusted environment. </p><p>  Smart cards are debit and credit cards, travel cards, passes of various organizations, student cards, sim cards, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contactless cards" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1671761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Types of Smart Cards </h2><p>  The first classification of smart cards is based on the method of exchange with a reader: </p><ul><li>  Contact (ISO 7816): well-known cards with chips that do not contain batteries - the energy of readers is taken.  These include payment <span>cards, SIM cards,</span> subscriptions for pay phones. </li><li>  Contact with USB: a more "advanced" version of the first type, in which the chip is integrated with a USB reader in a small case. </li><li>  Contactless smart cards: a type in which to read information you need to bring the card closer to the reader.  "Communication" with the reader occurs with the participation of RFID technology.  These cards also do not have batteries, the energy in them is stored using <span>an inductor,</span> which "feeds" the operation of the device.  Examples: electronic travel cards, badges, biometric passports. </li></ul><p>  The second classification is based on functionality: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Memory cards: they store any <span>amount of information</span> and mechanisms for restricting access to it ‚Äî passwords, unique numbers, etc. The most common group are travel cards, electronic tickets, and cards for pay phones. </li><li>  Intelligent: characterized by the presence of a microprocessor and the ability to download work algorithms for it, operate under the operating system, contain a set of certificates.  These are SIM cards, electronic visas and passports. </li></ul><h2>  Contactless cards and their features </h2><p>  To paraphrase the above, we can add that this is the general name of the contactless mechanisms used in payment systems and access control points. </p><p>  Their main advantages are as follows: </p><ul><li>  almost zero possibility of fake; </li><li>  a large shelf life of information - up to 10 years; </li><li>  data transfer rate to the reader - fractions of seconds; </li><li>  profitability - you can rewrite information within 100 thousand times; </li><li>  the possibility of prolonged use - the card is less subject to wear due to the lack of contact with the reader. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contactless card reader" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1671779.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  A standard reader "sees" contactless cards at a distance of 15 cm, which allows you not to get the device for payment or control out of a bag, pocket or wallet.  This significantly speeds up standard operations at the cash register and turnstile (according to estimates, up to 40%). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, contactless banking cards are the most universal, as  they are additionally equipped with a chip and a magnetic strip.  Moreover, their price is quite acceptable, which explains the widespread occurrence of contactless cards in our everyday life. </p><h2>  Varieties of contactless cards </h2><p>  Contactless cards also have their own classification: </p><ul><li>  <em>Em-marine</em> : the most common contactless access cards (tags).  Inside the plastic base there is an antenna and a proximity chip.  Their distinguishing feature is the ability to read at a distance of up to 70 cm. They are used as passes for parking lots, parking lots, fitness centers, schools, universities, medical facilities, etc. With their help, they take into account the time employees spent in the organization‚Äôs walls, the travel routes of drivers, sales representatives etc. </li><li>  <em>MIFARE¬Æ</em> : its ‚Äúcore‚Äù consists of an antenna, a microchip with protected memory, a transmitter and a receiver.  Card data can be stored for up to 10 years.  Another feature is a unique individual number that fits into one of the memory sectors - it can be used as an identifier code. </li><li><p>  <em>HID PROXIMITY:</em> Original contactless badge cards operating at the widest temperature range.  Reading time from them - no more than 0.1 sec.  They have a buzzer and a three-color LED for audio and visual information about the result of contact with the reader. </p></li><li><p>  <em>HID ICLASS:</em> have more sophisticated algorithms for contact with the reader and data encryption - the transfer of information begins only when the card and reader exchange special keys.  Their difference is that they can store <span>biometric data,</span> such as a fingerprint, in their memory.  This allows you to implement the device on closed objects, because the reader compares the information about the fingerprint on the card with the finger of the owner of the HID ICLASS leaning against it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contactless smart cards" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1671780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    </li></ul><h2>  Contactless card reader </h2><p>  Contactless card readers - devices used to recognize information from contactless cards, key fobs, badges, bracelets, stickers.  The vast majority of them only receive a signal, but there are also types that record data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contactless access cards" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1672670.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Readers are divided into near ones - recognizing the card at a distance of up to 10 cm, and long ones - up to 100 m. The first are used mainly on access control systems, at control points.  Long-distance, which, by the way, can receive a signal from several cards at once, are operated at large enterprises, in logistics. </p>
