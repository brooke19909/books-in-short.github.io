They must be similar in structure and perform the same functions.  Subsequently, organs and their systems are formed from tissues.  <span>Tissues of plants</span> and animals have significant features.  The former have virtually no <span>intercellular substance.</span>  The function of protection and the relationship with the environment is performed by the <span>integumentary tissue, the</span> bulk of the body forms the bulk.  Mechanical and conductive provide support and movement of the necessary substances.  But the next plant tissue can be called "magic."  It begins to act where it is necessary to restore the integrity of the body.  It is called educational.  Its cells are able to turn into elements of any tissue needed in a specific place in the body. </p>

    <h2>  What human tissues are involved in wound healing </h2><p>  First of all, such properties are possessed by connective and epithelial tissues.  The former, being the basis of the body, are found in almost every organ.  Granulation tissue is especially rich in young, actively dividing cells.  She is a kind of connective.  Epithelial tissues complete the repair process.  Each of them has its own mechanism of work.  Regardless of which tissues are involved in wound healing, their structure is modified to a certain extent. </p><h2>  Epithelial tissue </h2><p>  She participates in the processes of regeneration most often.  After all, scratches and shallow superficial wounds are the result of careless behavior even in children.  Their recovery is fast enough.  After all, it is this type of tissue that regenerates constantly.  Its keratinous surface layer is peeled off every day when washing the skin, rubbing on clothes, etc. This is of great protective value, because together with the surface layer the body gets rid of dirt and pathogens.  What tissues are involved in wound healing?  All <span>epithelial cells</span> are capable of active division.  Including glandular, able to secrete various secrets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Connective tissue </h2><p>  This type of tissue contains a lot of intercellular substance, since it forms the basis of the whole organism.  Bones, cartilage, blood, fat are all connective structures.  Consider which tissues are involved in wound healing.  A special role in this process is played by granulation tissue.  It quickly eliminates defects and protects the site of injury from the penetration of pathogens.  This is very important, because the inflammatory effect delays the healing process and can lead to significant complications.  The result of the activity of connective granulation tissue is the transformation of its cells into coarse fibrous.  Visually, this is manifested in the formation of a scar wound at the site of dislocation. </p>

    <h2>  Thrombus formation mechanism </h2><p>  Violations of the healing processes and their immediate course are also closely related to the activity of the blood.  It is also a connective tissue, which, due to the special properties of the intercellular substance, is fluid.  The mechanism of the healing process primarily involves colorless blood cells - white blood cells.  They neutralize foreign organisms and bodies through phagocytosis - intracellular digestion.  This prevents inflammation.  Pus is often formed at the site of the wound.  These are the bodies of dead white blood cells.  Another defense mechanism is the formation of a blood clot.  With mechanical damage, the integrity of the vessels is almost always violated, which can lead to significant blood loss.  However, in a healthy body this does not happen due to the activity of platelets.  If blood vessels are damaged, they are destroyed.  At this time, plasma protein fibrinogen, which is soluble, is converted to fibrin.  As a result of complex chemical transformations, a network of its filaments is formed, which does not allow blood to flow out of the vessel.  Violation of this process is called hemophilia.  This disease is hereditary and is transmitted primarily through the male line. </p>

    <h2>  Wound healing process </h2><p>  The healing mechanism includes several processes that depend on the degree of damage.  These are constriction, filling of wound defects with collagen protein threads and epithelization.  With an unfavorable course, inflammatory processes occur.  To accelerate the healing process, the creation of certain conditions is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãsterility and purification from dead cells. </p><p>  So, in our article we examined which tissues are involved in wound healing and what are the mechanisms of this process.  A special role in it is played by connective and epithelial, while to a certain extent all groups of cells of a living organism are capable of regeneration. </p>
