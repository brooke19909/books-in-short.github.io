    <p>  As if a pearl of the archipelago of people from different countries beckons with a magnet.  The sparsely populated island will surprise the native people who are not spoiled by the harmful influence of civilization and who live in their own world. </p><h2>  Underground river </h2><p>  The main attraction of the resort, lost in the sea, is not in vain considered fabulously beautiful nature.  In 1967, Palawan (Philippines) was recognized as a national reserve.  The most beautiful place on earth falls in love with everyone who has arrived to enjoy amazing landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What awaits tourists on the territory of a colorful island?  Of course, the underground river located in the karst zone and flowing through a mysterious cave will delight everyone.  Winding in grottoes with colonies of limestone formations of Puerto Princesa takes its place in the list of modern wonders of the world. </p><p>  During a fascinating tour of the underground labyrinth hidden from the human eye, tourists admire a huge cave, the halls of which are decorated with <span>stalagmites and stalactites of the</span> most fantastic forms.  By the light of the boatman‚Äôs lantern, the emerald expanse of water shimmers with a scattering of lights, and a bizarre play of light and shadow conjures up the imagination of visitors arriving in Palawan (Philippines) with unusual images. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palawan philippines" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1370412.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Considered the longest underground artery in the world, Puerto Princesa makes you admire Mother Nature, who created a unique masterpiece.  Twenty-four years ago, the local authorities turned the river and its adjacent territory into a national park, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><h2>  Tabon Caves </h2><p>  In the south-west of the magic corner there are Tabon caves, which became famous after archaeologists found in the halls the remains of a primitive man who lived here more than twenty thousand years ago.  The underground kingdom, formed due to the influence of water on karst rocks, opens up an amazing world for all visitors, which makes you stiff in admiration.  Out of almost two hundred caves, only seven are open for tourists, and scientists have studied about thirty halls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palawan island philippines" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1370413.jpg" width="600"></div>
