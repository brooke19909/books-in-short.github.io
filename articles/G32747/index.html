Today's customer is not enough to get a good, solid building.  At the very least, he wants something non-standard, durable and at minimal cost.  The use of information modeling technology in construction helps in solving these and many other problems. </p><p>  In the course of project management for the construction of complex technological networks rich in communications and equipment, a number of problems arise.  Most of them can be allowed at the design stage.  Most of them can be eliminated.  Thanks to the use of BIM technology, the effectiveness of the interaction of all parts of the process increases, cost, time and risks are reduced.  This is not just a software product - it is a change of approach to project management. </p><p>  The building information model is a complex model containing complete graphic and textual information about all elements.  The system consists of five basic levels characterizing the development process.  From concept to actual state.  At various stages, the level of detail sets the required amount of information.  Level requirements are cumulative.  Thus, the following automatically contains requests from the predecessor. </p><p>  The main technology is a three-dimensional model.  Depending on the tasks to be solved during the work, additional vectors are added: 4D - time, 5D - cost, 6D - operation. </p><h2>  Key Benefits of BIM Modeling </h2><p>  We list the main advantages of BIM modeling: </p><ul><li>  Creation, by adding atypical elements, symbols and so on to the database. </li><li>  Collaboration both between departments and participants of the investment project. </li><li>  Parameterization. </li><li>  Search for collisions, as a result, their timely elimination. </li><li>  Release of any documentation.  From project to budget and accounting. </li></ul><p>  BIM-model - a numerical, editable, existing in real time.  Despite the relative high cost, technology is becoming increasingly promising for the Russian Federation.  This happened due to the fact that recently in the sphere of architecture and construction in Russia the following trends have arisen: </p><ul><li>  The transition to the construction and implementation of very large, complex, so-called mega-projects. </li><li>  Implementation of energy efficiency concepts, transition to innovative, energy-saving construction technologies. </li><li>  The need to move in the field of housing and communal services and the management of state property to the latest information technology solutions. </li><li>  A growing number of projects requiring bilateral attraction mechanisms.  On the one hand - state structures, on the other - private business. <div class="photo" data-original="www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="business processes in architecture" class="if uuid-2981448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2981448.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Information technology in professional activities </h2><p>  The use of IT in the architectural and construction field requires large investments, both monetary and intellectual.  The cost of the programs themselves, equipment (one 3D printer costs like a spaceship), training of specialists is quite expensive. </p><p>  Today there are organizations that are able to carry out all types of work, ranging from ideas to legal issues in construction.  The best specialists work here and the best, modern and expensive equipment is involved.  One of these enterprises is NPF Center for Information Technologies in Construction LLC in Moscow.  Carries out activities related to design, project management, implementation of construction control and copyright control. </p><h2>  Current IT situation in road construction </h2><p>  Information technology in this area is the subject of discussion in government, among people of science, in the media.  In parallel, in the process of increasing the efficiency of urban planning, a separate discussion is being held on the possibility of using BIM technologies not only in the construction of buildings, but also in other industries, in particular the road sector.  Information technologies in the professional activity of road construction make it possible to form all stages and processes as a single unit throughout the entire life cycle of an object.  Both at the stage of operation and withdrawal from it, and at the stage of formation of design, budget and executive documentation. </p><h2>  BIM and PLM </h2><p>  BIM-information technologies in road construction were ahead of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) technologies, but they only took root in mechanical engineering.  Since efficient production in this area is the concern of large corporations.  And providing the population with quality roads is the prerogative of the state. </p><p>  The basic principles of BIM to one degree or another are already being implemented in the technology of information activities of road construction.  Together with representatives of science, government, and economic bodies, legislative acts have been adopted providing for the introduction of technology in the road-building sector of Russia. </p><h2>  IT protection </h2><p>  A set of measures to ensure the protection of data from any influences must be provided for and used on all media and systems.  Personal data, electronic documents, ideas, developments, mail correspondence with colleagues and partners, financial and accounting files - all this can cause commercial and not only interest from outside. </p><p>  In today's arsenal, funds are presented as physical and organizational, hardware-software, legal.  That is, from security and good doors to the adoption of laws and legislation.  Protection of information technology is a very broad topic and deserves special attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.virtual-college.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Information technology in construction" class="if uuid-2981446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2981446.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Information technology more and more densely enters into all spheres of human life.  The forms and methods are quite diverse.  It can be a computer program, an Internet site, social networks, complex both hardware and software multi-complexes, designed to solve serious, specific problems.  IT ‚Äúbroke through‚Äù into the construction and architectural industry.  The availability of modern services can help the work of professionals, training students and schoolchildren.  The Internet will help ordinary people doing repairs at home or in the country.  The Arsenal of IT is constantly being improved, more and more new forms come in, designed to speed up the work, make its result perfect, reduce costs and much more. </p>
