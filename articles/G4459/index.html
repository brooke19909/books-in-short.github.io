This includes not only drawing, modeling and application classes, but also manual labor, that is, doing crafts from various materials.  Use paper and cardboard, waste and natural material. </p><p>  For each holiday, kids make postcards for parents.  <span>Crafts for March 8</span> in kindergarten are intended for mothers and grandmothers, and for February 23 - for fathers and grandfathers.  In addition to the main gifts for loved ones, children also take part in decorating the group for the New Year and Easter, for the Autumn Festival and May holidays. </p><p>  Teachers gradually complicate the tasks the children face, the children already know many methods of working with paper for the preparatory group, they can use scissors, cut out details by folding paper, they know different ways of applying, combining drawing and other types of art. </p><p>  But when educators give their children homework - to do some kind of crafts for the kindergarten, then parents are often lost and do not know what can be done and how the work needs to be done.  They don’t understand what a child should be able to do at his age, they don’t always know what skills the baby has already been grafted after practicing isoelectrics in kindergarten. </p><p>  In the article we will tell parents what crafts for kindergarten can be done independently at home.  We will analyze in detail all the holidays of the year and what each of them can be thought of as a creative work.  How can I help the teacher in the design of the kindergarten group?  And let’s tell you, a child of what age will master such a craft, and in which he needs help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New Year's card </h2><p>  We begin the description with the very first holiday of the year - New Year's.  All children are happy to wait for Santa Claus to come and bring gifts.  On such a wonderful holiday, the best craft is the Christmas tree.  To make such a voluminous craft for a kindergarten, you will need a dense cardboard with a print, you can choose any other instead of strips.  You will also need a sheet of double-sided colored paper in dark green and red. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scraplifters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new year card" class="if uuid-2331357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331357.jpg"></div><p>  Christmas tree branches are made of strips of different widths, from the bottom the largest, gradually decreasing, we get to the smallest on the top of the tree.  Each strip is 1 cm thinner than the previous one. How many will be needed depends on the height of the postcard.  Then the paper is folded with a frequent "accordion", especially a thin upper branch. </p><p>  Then, on the one side of the cardboard folded in half, the last fold is glued, on the other side - the rest of the strip.  It is also advisable to drop PVA into the central point so that the center does not fall apart.  So do all the details of the crafts for kindergarten, arranging the stripes in descending order. </p><p>  An asterisk is cut out on red paper under a stencil and placed at the top of the New Year’s beauty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__rfd"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Meet Shrovetide </h2><p>  In our country, the ancient customs of the Slavs are revered and in the middle of February they celebrate Shrovetide.  This tradition is also highlighted when children attend kindergarten.  Everyone loves this holiday.  In addition to cheerful street walks, it is accompanied by an abundance of delicious and beloved pancakes. </p><p>  Crafts for Shrovetide in a kindergarten can be represented by a straw doll - a scarecrow of Winter, which is traditionally set on fire at the end of the holiday, which means the end of winter cold and the approach of spring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stuffed carnival" class="if uuid-2331474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331474.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of straw, yellow knitting threads are used.  The detailed diagram shows how the threads are wound and connected to give the doll the necessary shape.  You can put a red scarf on your head and, having hooked the craft on a wooden skewer, insert it into a stack of pancakes before serving. </p><h2>  Gifts for Dads </h2><p>  Crafts in February in a kindergarten are, of course, devoted to popes - the main defenders of the fatherland.  Traditionally make items of technology - tanks, rockets or ships.  Children of the senior and preparatory groups will be able to make a wall panel with the image of sailing boats.  It is bright, colorful and includes several techniques for completing the work. </p><p>  Waves at sea are made by tearing paper stripes.  Different colors of blue and green palette are used.  You can apply plain colored paper, or you can, as in the sample, first draw the background sheets, and after the paper dries, tear off the strips and stick it on the blue sky background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="mollymoocrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sailing boats for dads" class="if uuid-2331301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331301.jpg"></div><p>  The boats themselves are represented by bulk material.  This is corrugated cardboard from packaging material.  The top thin paper is carefully removed, exposing the wavy layer.  Trapeze children in the older group will be able to cut out on their own.  The mast is a thin strip of white cardboard on which a red flag triangle is glued on top.  You can choose any other color. </p><p>  The main attraction of the crafts in February in kindergarten is the bright sails, which are represented by rectangular triangles.  Here the child must show imagination and decorate each in its own way, without repeating itself.  They can be striped or in circles, you can stick small details in the form of fish or stars, use the colors of the state flag or attach other symbols. </p><p>  To make the sailing boats look voluminous, they do not need to be glued tightly to the background, you can use double-sided tape, then the image will appear two-layer. </p><h2>  Congratulations from the kids </h2><p>  Crafts by March 8 in kindergarten begin to make even toddlers, of course, the postcard is more made by the teacher - the child can only stick a couple of details on his own.  In the younger group of kindergarten, gifts to mothers and grandmothers look more complicated.  The teacher can offer to make a tulip in the form of a gift, in which the baby’s palm is imprinted as a flower, and the child’s stem and leaf are glued out of colored paper. </p><p>  Also, a baby of three or four years old will be able to perform the application of a flower from torn and crumpled pieces of paper napkins as a crafts on March 8 in kindergarten.  To do this, draw the contours of the stem, leaf, middle and petals.  The craft should be simple and understandable to the baby. </p><h2>  How can 4-5 year old children congratulate mothers? </h2><p>  Crafts in the middle group of kindergarten are a bit more complicated.  Even tearing and creasing paper older children can perform in the form of such a beautiful flower, as in the photo in the article.  The basis of the craft is a flower with many petals carved on thick cardboard. </p><p>  Instead of napkins, brighter tissue paper is used.  The child is given a sample and the sequence of the application is explained, how to arrange the layers, combine colors.  Only after explaining the adult children begin to do the crafts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artycraftykids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tattered paper flower" class="if uuid-2331276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331276.jpg"></div><p>  Colors change stripes.  Each petal should have at least two, or better, three different shades.  The flower must necessarily be large so that everything fits freely on its surface.  This craft looks bright and colorful. </p><h2>  Congratulations from older preschoolers </h2><p>  Crafts for kindergarten with their own hands can create and children of the older group.  They already have the skills of cutting with scissors in a flat line, so they can make such a bouquet without much effort. </p><p>  To do this, you need to fold a sheet of green double-sided paper in half and cut the fold with "noodles".  Then the workpiece is folded into a cylinder and the edges are fastened with PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="funcraftskids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet for mothers and grandmothers" class="if uuid-2331425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331425.jpg"></div><p>  Then, using the template, the children translate the image of the flower onto colored paper.  To cut several identical parts, you need to fold colored paper three to four times.  In the same way, circles are cut according to the pattern for the middle ones.  It remains only to collect the bouquet by gluing the middle of the flowers on the PVA, and place the latter on thin strips of cut paper. </p><p>  Such a beautiful bouquet in the form of crafts in March in kindergarten can be put on the exhibition ladder in the locker room, presented to members of the teaching staff or grandmothers, mothers. </p><h2>  Laughter day </h2><p>  After March follows April, and as you know, April 1 is World Laughter Day.  As an article in the preparatory group of kindergarten, you can make such a fun clown.  You will need a paper disposable plate, colored paper, yarn pompons and colorful feathers.  The plate will suit both white and yellow. </p><p>  A mouth cut along the contours is placed on the bottom of the dishes.  At the age of five or six years, children themselves must draw the contours of the parts and cut them with scissors.  A red thread of yarn is glued to the middle of the mouth on PVA. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siudy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clown from a plate" class="if uuid-2331293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331293.jpg"></div><p>  Then a triangular-shaped clown cap is cut out of bright paper and decorated with circles made up of paper folded into several parts, so they will all be the same size.  Instead of a brush, colorful feathers are attached to the cap.  Eyes are cut out of white and black paper of different sizes.  Smaller black circles are pasted in the middle of the white. </p><p>  Finish the crafts for kindergarten by attaching pompons.  You can buy them at a hardware or craft store.  On top of the head are multi-colored elements depicting the hair of a clown, or rather, his wig.  And only a red pompom is used as a nose. </p><h2>  Kindergarten group decoration </h2><p>  Spring is a wonderful time when nature wakes up, birds fly back, their singing is heard everywhere, chicks are born.  A group room in a kindergarten or a room for kids can be decorated with a large craft placed on the door.  This is a collective work of both children and adults. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spring meeting - decoration of the group" class="if uuid-2331385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331385.jpg"></div><p>  First, a background of blue paper depicting the sky is pasted.  A green strip in the form of grass with cut and bent edges is attached below.  On the grass are growing flowers.  Volumetric tree and branches are made of brown corrugated paper.  Then the children are connected to work and halves with cuts in the form of a broken line are cut out of plastic plates. </p><p>  These are nests with chicks.  But the little birds are depicted on plastic spoons painted in black.  They have glued eyes and beaks.  For parents who arrive to feed the child, black wings are attached to the spoon.  Adult birds stick to a tree. </p><p>  Such an article in the kindergarten group looks wonderful and attracts general attention, although it is not difficult to do it. </p><h2>  Decorating easter eggs </h2><p>  In the spring, in the fine works of kindergarten pupils, another wonderful and very large Christian holiday is necessarily reflected - Easter.  Typically, children paint or make an application on a cardboard base in the shape of an egg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbankid.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating easter eggs" class="if uuid-2331407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331407.jpg"></div><p>  Our sample presents decoration of Easter eggs with threads, buttons or felt.  Details are placed in colors in stripes. </p><h2>  Autumn meeting </h2><p>  Autumn is a wonderful time when they use not only paper and cardboard, but also various natural materials.  From the leaves make the application of animals and characters of fairy tales.  Three-dimensional crafts with the addition of plasticine are made from cones.  From nuts you can form a turtle or a boat.  A bear is usually made from chestnuts, and a hedgehog is made from plasticine and sunflower seeds. </p><p>  You can make applications from branches, for example, a house or a well.  Even fruits and vegetables make real masterpieces. </p><h2>  Group decoration for Autumn holiday </h2><p>  Every year in the kindergarten, the Autumn Festival is held - this is a matinee in which the gifts of this season are glorified.  Children put on costumes of fruits and vegetables, dance the spikelet dance.  There are also characters - rain and droplets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn tree made of paper" class="if uuid-2331391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2331391.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate the game room with such a wonderful autumn tree, in which the leaves are made of multi-colored sheets of paper folded with an accordion and glued in half.  They are placed with alternating shades and placed in layers.  The craftwork looks bright and festive. </p><h2>  Parent reviews </h2><p>  Adults love to receive gifts no less than children.  Therefore, the crafts that children prepare their parents for the holidays, they are very pleased.  Feedback on the work of educators is usually positive, as they take an active part in preparing gifts.  It is necessary not only to come up with the look of the craft so that it looks interesting and matches the age and skills of the child, but also to prepare the necessary materials. </p><p>  Positive feedback from parents is pleasant for every teacher, because he puts a piece of his soul and imagination into the work of the students. </p>
