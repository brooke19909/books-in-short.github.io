This tourist attraction has a man-made origin. </p><h2>  Tuim failure (Khakassia): history until the middle of the 20th century </h2><p>  The presence <span>of mineral deposits</span> near the village of Tuim first became known at the beginning of the last century.  Opened by a French engineer De Larue.  He had 4 daughters, and he named each of the deposits in the name of one of them: Julia, Daria, Lydia, Theresa. </p><p>  The thirties were marked by the organization of the Tuim-tungsten association, which was engaged in the extraction of copper, lead, gold, <span>tungsten, molybdenum</span> and iron. </p><p>  Tuimlag, formed before the war, is mentioned by Solzhenitsyn in his famous work The Gulag Archipelago.  The recollections of local old-timers also confirm that at the end of the thirties political prisoners were kept here, who mined molybdenum at the mine and were engaged in its processing at the processing plant. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, scheelite-tungsten mined in Tuim was used as an additive to alloy steel, which was the material for the manufacture of armor for T-34 tanks. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuim failure Khakassia story" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/990902.jpg" width="570"></div></h2><h2>  Mine </h2><p>  The mine at the site of failure began to operate in 1953.  Work underground was carried out mainly with jackhammers.  Underground explosions were also practiced.  They led to the gradual subsidence of the mountains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ore was exported on trolleys, then the extracted minerals were sent to the factory.  Its productivity by the standards of that time was quite high: 500,000 tons per month. </p><h2>  Education failure </h2><p>  In the 50s, livestock began to disappear from the inhabitants of the village of Tuim.  It was during the search that a large number of breaks and displacements in the mountain were discovered. </p><p>  In 1954, the formation of failure began to take shape.  The diameter of the initial depressions was about 6 m, and by 1961 reached 60-70 m. </p><p>  In 1974, mining operations were discontinued, as many safety violations were identified.  According to rough estimates, 140,000 tons of copper remained uncovered in the bowels. </p><p>  In 1991, a minor earthquake occurred in those parts, which provoked the collapse of part of the soil.  As a result, the Tuim failure (Khakassia) was formed, the diameter of which at the moment is more than 300 meters, while this value is gradually increasing. </p><p>  In 1996, they talked about the Tuim failure after <span>Yuri Senkevich</span> dedicated one of the episodes of the TV program “Travelers Club” to this unusual place.  Already in the 2000s, there took place the shooting of the program “Fear Factor”. </p><h2>  Tuim failure (Khakassia): how to get there </h2><p>  Located at a distance of 190 km from the city of Abakan. </p><p>  If you leave Lake Shira, then you need to move to the village of the same name, past the railway station, in the direction of the village of Tuim.  The entire distance to the place is approximately 20 kilometers. </p><p>  There is an interesting attraction along the way that you should pay attention to.  On the 9th km of the road, right on the rocky spur, there is a burial-cult monument, which is an echo of Okunev culture.  It is called the Tuim ring.  In the central part are burial plates, under which a woman priestess and two children are buried.  In the circle line there are 4 huge stones that mark the directions of the four cardinal points.  To the east of the burial place is laid a symbolic road of small width, it is bordered by several stones.  This unique monument is somewhat reminiscent of the English Stonehenge, although it is not so large in size.  The spirit and mysterious energetics of this ancient burial cover an entire surrounding space like an invisible veil. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having entered the village of Tuim, at the first big fork, you need to turn right.  Before you appear the ruins of an <span>enrichment factory.</span>  They need to go to them.  Then you should cross the <span>railway crossing,</span> and then turn left.  After a few minutes of the journey, another left turn will appear, in front of which is a plate with the inscription "Failure".  If you travel by car, you can safely turn off.  But if the car is heavy-duty, it is better for safety reasons to drive straight another two kilometers to the entrance to the adit. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuim failure Khakassia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/990901.jpg" width="595"></div></h2><p>  As soon as the Tuim failure (Khakassia) becomes visible, the first thing that strikes the imagination is the height of the mountains.  Then, when the gaze turns down, the blue-green water of the lake at the bottom of the artificial crater becomes visible. </p><p>  In the vertical rocky walls of the hole, you can see the holes leading to the tunnels through which copper was transported on trolleys. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  If you decide to go to Tuim failure (Khakassia), do not forget about security measures.  Its walls are very unreliable and quite often crumble.  Therefore, you should not come close to the edge. </p>

    <p>  The last major collapse occurred in November 2010.  It is better to use the observation deck, from which the entire panorama of the failure is visible. </p><p>  Tuimsky failure (photo see below) is a very popular tourist attraction. </p>

Extreme sports are offered a very dangerous entertainment - a bungee jump, and diving enthusiasts can try to swim to the unknown bottom of the lake.  So far, no one has succeeded.
