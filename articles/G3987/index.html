  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To purchase a new sweater, knitting is the best option!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many fascinating hobbies, and one of the most popular is knitting.  <span>Knitwear is</span> now at the peak of popularity, and in connection with this, the typical image of a knitter has undergone dramatic changes: now this is not a grandmother knitting socks for her grandchildren, but a young woman who knitting not only allows you to quickly and inexpensively replenish your wardrobe with relevant and stylish things, but also relax after a hard day's work.  The choice of yarn and knitting needles in stores is truly enormous, and their quality has recently grown very much, so home-made items no longer seem like terrible handicrafts and have not extravagant, but sometimes very respectable looks.  The quality of modern yarn allows even not very experienced needlewomen to receive beautiful exclusive new items for their wardrobe. </p><p>  The most popular are <span>knitting sweaters</span> which - albeit a fairly long, but fascinating process.  In fact, it is long only at the beginning, and as mastery grows, it decreases significantly.  Of course, knitting a <span>man‚Äôs sweater</span> takes much more time than a woman <span>‚Äôs sweater</span> , and it takes up to two times more yarn, but this is one of the best ways to show love and care.  If you take <span>women's sweaters with</span> knitting needles of such sweaters, for many it becomes a favorite way to fill your leisure: an infinite variety of patterns allows you to choose any according to your skill level, and a variety of knitting techniques will not let you get bored during the knitting process. </p><p>  Knitting <span>sweaters</span> which take literally several days are especially popular among beginner needlewomen, and the savings are significant: children‚Äôs clothes sometimes cost no less than adults, and you can get a new, beautiful, inexpensive thing, in addition, from that yarn that is necessary, for example, if the child is allergic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to quickly get high-quality <span>sweaters, knitting</span> must already be at a confident level, otherwise it can take a lot of time.  You should study on simpler products, for example, scarves or a poncho, where there are few components and a simple shape.  It is recommended to start knitting from the front or the back, after calculating the number of loops, even if it is in the model description: the density of knitting varies for different people, and the values ‚Äã‚Äãgiven in the description are rather indicative.  The same applies to the number of knitting needles: if you knit more tightly, it makes sense to take a little more knitting needles, and vice versa.  In general, first you need to knit a small sample with your knitting needles and your own hands and calculate the number of loops in 10 centimeters - this will show how many loops you need to dial for your product size.  The same with the length: the number of rows must also be determined based on the data obtained from the sample, otherwise the size of the finished product can be very surprising. </p><p>  Assembling of the finished product is done after all the parts have been washed and ironed so that they take the final dimensions and outlines.  An exception is the neck: sometimes the model involves knitting it after assembly with circular knitting needles.  It is recommended to connect the details of the sweater with the same threads from which it is knitted, but many prefer to take ordinary ones of the corresponding shade.  I must say, this option has a right to exist, especially in the case of using wool yarn: seams from synthetic threads will make the product more durable, while seams from wool threads can not withstand stretching. </p><p>  If knitting sweaters are an indispensable part of your wardrobe - a skill that you cannot do without.  This hobby will allow you to regularly replenish your collection with new things almost insensitive to your budget, and satisfaction from the magnificent result of your work is the best way to save on psychoanalysts. </p>
