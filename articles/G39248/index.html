    <h2>  Tropical Dreams Hotel Apartments: reviews </h2><p>  In general, this hotel was liked by many vacationers.  Cons, of course, also have.  Where without them ?!  But there are much fewer negative points than positive ones.  First of all, tourists write about the quick check-in and the friendly attitude of the staff and the administration, no matter what time of day the guests arrive.  Secondly, the guests liked the view from the windows and from the balcony, which opens part of the hotel and the beach area.  If there are any violations in the agreement between the hotel and the tourist (that is, for one reason or another the administration cannot fulfill its obligations), in addition to an oral apology, the guests will receive some other gift as compensation for moral damage. </p><p>  Some vacationers believe that the cost of living in Tropical Dreams Hotel Apartments (Cyprus) is overstated, as the hotel is not so comfortable.  In addition, there is practically no entertainment.  Families who stayed at the hotel with children note that it is convenient to stay with the kids in the apartment: there is a separate room, and meals can be prepared for the child at any time.  But, perhaps, the main thing that captivates the guests is the cleanliness and friendly attitude of the administration.  Since tourists come to the sea, and the beach is close, this is another definite plus.  Many people have been here many times, are going to come again and advise others.  Relatively low price, the possibility of privacy, peace and quiet are wonderful conditions for families and couples in love! </p>
