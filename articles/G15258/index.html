    <h2>  User opinions </h2><p>  The administration of the resort complex painstakingly collects feedback from visitors, both positive and negative, because it is very important for her to know in which direction it is worth developing.  Thanks to this analysis of the impressions of tourists, a plan of further actions is drawn up. </p><p>  Many people call this place simply a hotel or apartment, while the chic complex is somewhat beyond this narrow framework.  The territory is closed and carefully maintained.  Initially, it was assumed that residents would stay here permanently.  Over time, entrepreneurial owners began to hunt for rent, because the flow of people was really very large.  Business has gone up.  Over time, everyone else took over this trend, since there was no sense of stability, every day the face of a new neighbor flickered in the hallway.  Moreover, tourists are not always distinguished by quiet behavior, so that comfort was becoming less and less. </p><p>  People resting here mentioned that they had to run into the disapproving look of a regular a couple of times.  It is advised to rent a room in a guesthouse or hotel where tourists are treated professionally.  Alupka is a large resort center where there is plenty to choose from.  However, not every hotel can be faced with such chic. </p><h2>  Profitable and unforgettable </h2><p>  Many people resting here emphasize that there is a balance between the quality of services and pricing.  They like to splash around in the pool.  A nice bonus is the ability to secure a deck chair, which makes the rest more comfortable.  The beauty of the local area captivates, they carefully look after it and try to keep it at a high level. </p>

    <p>  The proximity of the beach also deserves a lot of admiring feedback.  There is no crowds and crush, you feel calm and peaceful, really surrendering to the grace of rest.  The hotels are very comfortable, especially those rooms where you can enjoy the breathtaking scenery from the window.  Some tourists regret that the hotel complex does not have Wi-Fi.  However, this pleasant benefit can be found by the pool and in the restaurant.  In total, people really like it here, and they strive to visit these parts again. </p>
