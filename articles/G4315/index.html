    <h2>  What to consider when choosing hotels? </h2><p>  The first thing you need to pay attention to is nutrition.  Is it included in the price, is there a dining room or restaurant, what is the cost of lunch and dinner.  Secondly, you should consider the distance to the beach.  Generally, the greater the distance, the cheaper the hotel.  Thirdly, the cost of the hotel largely depends on the repair and equipment of the rooms.  Read all conditions carefully before booking rooms.  Fourth, the cost depends on the area.  This is exactly where you can save.  Advertised and most visited resorts do not always surpass the less known.  It is better to choose a quiet place with a clean beach and a lower cost. </p><p>  An inexpensive vacation at sea is possible with the right approach.  In some cases, booking a hotel on your own and buying tickets is cheaper than contacting a tour operator for help. </p>
