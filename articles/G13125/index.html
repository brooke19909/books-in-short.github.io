    <h2>  Geography of the country </h2><p>  Spain is the second largest country in Europe; it also ranks second in average altitude and the number of mountainous areas.  The state spreads over most of the <span>Iberian Peninsula;</span> its shores are washed by the Mediterranean Sea and the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  The large extent of the state leads to the fact that the regions of Spain are significantly different from each other climatic and natural conditions.  The relief of the country is due to several mountain systems: stretching from west to east by the Pyrenees, Central Cordillera, which divides the country into northern and southern parts, as well as the Cantabrian and Iberian mountains. </p><p>  Most of the country is located on the high plateau of Mesete.  Only its southern region is in the lowlands.  The difference in the flora and fauna is also determined by the uneven distribution of water resources.  If in the north and north-west there are no problems with fresh water, then the central and Mediterranean parts often experience an acute shortage of life-giving moisture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Government of Spain </h2><p>  <span>The Kingdom of Spain</span> is a constitutional monarchy.  In 1978, the current Constitution was adopted, which vested the King with supreme power.  All regions of Spain are subordinate to the monarch and the prime minister, who is nominated by the party that won the popular elections. </p><p>  The country is divided into 17 <span>autonomous regions,</span> which include 50 provinces.  Each region has its own charter and leadership, which shares power with the center of the country.  From time to time, ideas about complete autonomy from the center arise in different regions, but the state has so far been able to contain these trends. </p>
