Our great-grandmothers for the most part owned this type of art to one degree or another.  And this is not surprising!  In the era of simple and coarse linen textiles, every girl had to be able to embroider.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, rich or not, she had to be able to embellish clothes through embroidery, embroider initials on her family‚Äôs accessories, diversify the decor of bedding and curtains, and make her handkerchief unique and beautiful.  In many cases, the ability to embroider exalted the future mistress of the family. </p><h2>  Why is monochrome gaining popularity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="towel cat" class="if uuid-2318389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2318389.jpg"></div><p>  For lack of a variety of shades and colors of threads for needlework, monochrome embroidery was widespread.  One-color and two-color ornaments decorating old towels and pillowcases are a sure confirmation of this. </p><h2>  What kind of embroidery is called monochrome? </h2><p>  Monochrome, called embroidery, which is performed in one color.  It can be a pure primary color and its shades, although embroidery made in two colors is also monochrome.  The main indicator that you see monochrome embroidery is the predominance of one (primary) color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cupcakes diagram" class="if uuid-2314718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2314718.jpg"></div><h2>  Monochrom species </h2><p>  Usually embroiderers determine three types of embroidery of this type: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  <span>Embroidery monochrome contour.</span> </li><li>  Similar cross-stitch. </li><li>  Blackwork embroidery. </li></ul><ol><li>  The most fantastic kind of monochrome embroidery is the contour picture.  Usually they perform it with a <span>counting cross.</span>  The drawing is refined and neat.  In its lines there are airiness and understatement, evoking a flight of fantasy.  Moreover, monochrome embroidery patterns in this technique are very simple, those who wish can come up with and implement their own schematic drawings.  Even novice craftswomen will cope well with this embroidery technique.  Performing contour monochrome, it will be possible to introduce a small element of a different color, it will become a kind of highlight of the whole image.  Such an element may be: a flower in the hairstyle, highlighted with a bright eye color, a small thing in the general form of design. </li><li>  Blackwork - consists of threads of two colors, white and black.  In the blackwork technique, the back needle stitch is often used.  When you need to embroider a large pattern, the embroidery is carried out with a counted cross. </li><li>  The most painstaking and perhaps the most difficult type of embroidery is monochrome cross-stitch.  This technique involves the implementation of the plot, which has a large amount of color of one shade.  It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between subtle transitions from one (darker) shade to another (lighter).  This type of monochrome cross-stitch, not every craftswoman will embroider.  But the result of such work is magnificent!  Using only the threads of one color palette and its various shades, the craftswoman is able to create huge full-fledged embroidered paintings.  This technique usually uses full sewing of canvas or uniform weave. </li></ol><h2>  We embroider the kitchen </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kitchen mohrom" class="if uuid-2314695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2314695.jpg"></div><p>  People spend quite a serious part of their lives in the kitchen, especially if they are women.  Therefore, the kitchen is rightfully considered a women's room.  They cook lunches and breakfasts on it, and it is in the kitchen that the whole family gathers for dinner in the evening.  This is where they call a secret girlfriend, while the household go about their business and host throughout the apartment.  So why not make our kitchen even more beautiful and, most importantly, cozy, adding cute embroideries made by your own hands to its decor?  Moreover, almost any woman is able to perform some types of monochrome embroidery for the kitchen.  In each of them, the genes of the great-grandmother craftswomen are napping. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monochrome cross stitch for the kitchen </h2><p>  This type of embroidery, like all its other varieties, is divided into three types: large embroideries, small, medium-sized images. </p><p>  So, remembering that a monochrome still requires certain skills, choose the simplest outline cross-stitch pattern for the first experiment.  Also, the embroidery size is better for the first time to take a small one.  Some embroiderers, having made several small designs for the kitchen, combine them into one composition.  Thus, <span>embroidered in a baguette embroidery</span> becomes the center of attention of households and guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutlery" class="if uuid-2314716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2314716.jpg"></div><h2>  What pictures can be embroidered in the kitchen </h2><p>  They are very popular in monochrome embroidery for the kitchen: all kinds of cups with tea, hot coffee, embroidered coffee grains.  Crockery is an ageless topic for kitchen embroidery, so glasses, jugs and krinks, spoons and forks with different decorative decorations on them, cakes, cupcakes, cream muffins in one or two-color versions will look good. </p><p>  Embroidered kitchen towels and tablecloths.  In this case, in addition to "edible" ornaments, plant patterns are suitable.  All sorts of bindweed, leaves, openwork flowers, will help your kitchen sparkle with new colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doily embroidery" class="if uuid-2314688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2314688.jpg"></div><p>  Patterns of monochrome cross-stitch can be purchased at points of sale related to needlework.  Such patterns are cheaper than multi-colored ones, as a rule, the set already includes the threads of the desired color and the canvas on which you will embroider your monochrome plot. </p><p>  Also cross-stitch patterns of monochrom are easy to find on the Internet.  Download and print them today is not difficult.  Small and simple scenes can be embroidered directly "from the monitor", saving the photo on the computer desktop and enlarging it. </p><p>  For this type of embroidery, it is advisable not to take a large canvas.  Set aside the canvas of the fourteenth, and even more so the eleventh county.  More decently and accurately your monochrome will show itself on the canvas of the sixteenth and eighteenth counts.  Remember that in case of embroidery on the eighteenth count, black threads should get a good table lamp. </p>
