    <p>  The most popular hotel complexes are built directly on the Red Sea.  Almost all of them have their own beach.  In general, choosing a vacation in this resort city, tourists should consider that there are not many sandy areas for swimming, more often the bottom of the sea is covered with stones and corals. </p><p>  Many hotels are known for their presentability and a wide variety of services.  Vacationers are offered hotel water parks and discos, water sports centers and health clubs.  If the complex is aimed specifically at family guests, then its infrastructure necessarily includes a mini-club, and there is also a playground for children. </p><p>  Meals are most often offered on an all-inclusive basis.  Three meals a day are served buffet style, and local drinks are available free of charge in the bars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many good hotels in Sharm El Sheikh with four or five stars are located in the Sharm El Maya area, where there is a single sandy beach.  The oldest and most well-maintained area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis resort city is Naama Bay with its bustling promenade, which is lined with numerous restaurants, shops and clubs. </p>

    <p>  It is designed, according to reviews, for tourists without any complaints.  Located in the center of Sharm, it has a rather convenient position: within walking distance of the Old Town and the famous entertainment complex, the hotel overlooks El Mercato - the central street of the district.  Here are the McDonald's, Starbucks and KFC, as well as the office of the local mobile operator, Fares fish restaurant, banks. </p><p>  Clients do not need to go anywhere on purpose, because everything you need is literally within walking distance. </p><p>  The hotel area is always clean.  The buildings form two cozy patios.  The rooms, although modest, without any frills, are quite comfortable for living. </p><p>  Reviews of Russians about food are somewhat divergent.  Some consider it monotonous, others were satisfied with food, especially desserts. </p><p>  Summarizing, we can say that the Regency Lodge Hotel is suitable for those who clearly understand that they are not going to "five", but to "three stars".  And for the price difference, you can pick up and buy those services that, in their opinion, are needed on vacation. </p>
