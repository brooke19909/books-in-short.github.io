    <h2>  Mortgage with ‚ÄúPSN Group‚Äù </h2><p>  This is the first loan product offered by Vozrozhdenie Bank.  Mortgage, whatever it may be, entails the conclusion of a contract of sale / purchase.  And, if you have to do this, why not contact a reliable seller? </p><p>  In this regard, the Bank offers a <span>targeted loan</span> for the purchase of an apartment in the building under construction by PSN Group, a major developer that has been operating for a very long time and always brings its projects to completion.  Bank Vozrozhdenie collaborates with him. </p><p>  A mortgage seems to be profitable.  The client is allowed to issue it together with two additional co-borrowers.  The basic rate starts from 13% per annum, taking into account the implementation of property and personal insurance.  Down payment - from 0% to 85%.  An application is considered within 2 to 15 days from the date of application. </p>

    <h2>  Approximate calculation </h2><p>  Looking at the numbers, it will be possible to understand the scheme much faster.  So what does Vozrozhdenie bank offer?  The mortgage, which was mentioned above, is very popular.  In addition, this service is actively advertised.  What is obtained in practice? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Suppose a person picked up an apartment for 3,000,000 rubles and decided to pay the amount for 5 years.  In total, he will have to give 4,088,764 p.  The amount of interest will be 1,088,764 p. </p><p>  In the first month, he will pay 32,500 rubles.  In the future, the amount of the monthly payment will be 69,935 rubles / month.  A considerable amount, but if you take a targeted loan of this type and only for this period, this is the best option. </p><p>  Because the same mortgage, with the same amount, but for 10 years, will cost much more.  Despite the fact that the monthly payment is 45 165 rubles.  But in the end, people pay 5 362 058 p.  Of which 2,361,058 will be in interest.  It is worth recalling that 3,000,000 is taken on credit. The amount of interest is not much less than that which was taken on credit. </p><p>  But, by the way, Vozrozhdenie Bank has a very convenient online calculator, with which you can calculate everything.  There is even a separate item in which everything is scheduled by year - interest paid, debt and the amount paid for the whole year. </p>

    <h2>  "Apartment-New building" </h2><p>  This is the name of another loan product that Vozrozhdenie Bank offers.  Mortgage conditions have the following: 10,000,000 rubles as a maximum, the rate starts from 12.95%, and the term - from 1 year to 30 years.  The client gets the opportunity to obtain a targeted loan for the purchase of housing in an apartment building from the number of objects that are being built by PIK Group of Companies. </p><p>  Attraction of two co-borrowers is also allowed.  Down payment - from 0% to 20%.  Insurance is required, and a commission is charged for its execution and subsequent renewal.  For the first year of lending, the amount will be 1% of the loan amount.  But as a maximum - 100,000 rubles.  For the second and all subsequent years, insurance will amount to 0.7% of the balance of loan debt. </p><h2>  Profitable proposition </h2><p>  Now many are buying apartments in houses that are just under construction.  And this is really a very profitable decision, since housing in new buildings is 20-30% cheaper than in already completed and commissioned buildings.  In fact, the borrower takes part in shared construction.  This is what Bank Vozrozhdenie offers. </p><p>  Mortgage reviews get pretty good.  All developers who work with this financial institution are time-tested.  These are INTECO Group of Companies, Samolet Development Group of Companies, Morton Group of Companies, as well as Etalon-Invest Group of Companies, New Zelenograd Residential Complex, Vidnoe-Kupelinka Residential Complex and MR Group Group of Companies. </p><p>  The rate starts from 13%, the maximum amount available for a loan is 30 million rubles.  And the down payment is from 0% to 85%.  Interestingly, in terms of interest and debt payments, this is the same tariff as the one mentioned at the very beginning.  But only in this case, for three million you can buy a better apartment, since in a finished house it will build 20-30% more.  So, at the first rate, a person would have to take a 20-30% more voluminous loan. </p>

    <h2>  Subsidized Target Loan </h2><p>  This service is also offered by Bank Vozrozhdenie.  Mortgage for secondary housing at all times has been popular.  And this financial institution decided to ease the conditions for its potential customers.  No wonder a month ago, on November 22, 2016, it was announced that Vozrozhdenie was among the top five banks with the lowest interest rate on <span>mortgages with state support.</span> </p><p>  After all, customers are offered only 10.9% per annum.  Given that everywhere, at least 13%, it is not surprising that such a high rating of this organization.  Reducing rates is an additional incentive for many people who want to get their own square meters. </p>
