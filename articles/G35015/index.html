    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Resort Atlantica Princess 4 * (Rhodes) has a positive reputation among tourists.  But it was not without criticism.  Guests in their reviews indicate such service deficiencies: </p><ul><li>  Well-groomed and small area near the hotel.  There is a road between the buildings, which is sometimes noisy. </li><li>  There is no sand on the beach, only large pebbles, on which it is impossible to walk without special shoes.  Unfortunately, there are no sandy beaches nearby. </li><li>  The beach is not equipped with a shower, changing cabins and a toilet.  Sun beds and beach towels give out only for money. </li><li>  The hair dryer in the room does not work well.  It burns, but does not dry hair. </li><li>  Animation may seem boring because it is conducted exclusively in English. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  A comfortable stay will be given to you by the Atlantica Princess 4 * hotel (Rhodes).  Of course, the cost of living here can hardly be called low, but the quality of service is offered accordingly.  The hotel is suitable for tourists who prefer a relaxing holiday, retirees, couples and even youth. </p>
