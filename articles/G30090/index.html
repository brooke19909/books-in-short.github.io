There is even a small outdoor pool with sun loungers on the roof.  True, our compatriots who have been here note that it‚Äôs somewhat dangerous to go there now.  The fact is that repairs are underway on the roof and in the pool you can stumble on construction waste.  Therefore, while it is better to refrain from visiting it. </p><p>  As for the Internet, it is provided free of charge throughout the hotel.  However, according to travelers, Wi-Fi does not always ‚Äúcatch‚Äù well in rooms.  But in the public areas of the hotel, the Internet works fine. </p><p>  A number of guests also complained about parking problems near the hotel.  However, if you rent a motorbike, then there is always parking for it.  With a car, of course, it will be more difficult.  However, this is a problem not only of this hotel, but also of most urban-type hotels that do not have their own territory. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As mentioned, Patong Beach is a ten minute walk from the hotel.  Experienced travelers say that this, of course, is not the best beach in Phuket.  So, it is quite crowded and not always very clean.  However, it can be visited several times.  Next to it there are lots of cafes and bars where you can have a bite or have a drink with an alcoholic or soft drink.  Many tourists prefer to spend an active vacation, every day discovering new corners of Phuket, which implies not only attractions, but also beaches.  Moving around the island is easiest on a rented motorbike.  According to travelers, despite the fact that traffic on the roads here is rather chaotic, with caution, you can drive quite safely. </p>
