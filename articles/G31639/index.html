    <p>  Compared to other countries of the peninsula, holidays in Slovenia can hardly be called popular, but from this it acquires its own special charm.  There are not a huge number of tourists and advertised places, but silence and solitude are everywhere.  Resorts are affordable and are great for families with children, as well as for young or older couples. </p><h2>  about the country </h2><p>  The ancestors of the Slovenes lived in the modern territory of the country already in the 6th century.  After another hundred years, they formed one of the first Slavic states - Quarantine.  Subsequently, it broke up and in different years was under the protectorate of the Franks, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The independence of the country was proclaimed relatively recently - in 1991.  Now it is a developing state with a population of just over 2 million people. </p><p>  Geographical location is one of the main advantages Slovenia can be proud of.  Rest here can be very diverse: from active sports to exclusively wellness.  The country is located in the Alpine-Danube region, in the northwest it is limited by the majestic Alps, in the northeast - by the Pannonian lowland, in the south - by the Dinar Highlands and the Adriatic Sea in the west.  The mild climate, the abundance of beech, coniferous, oak forests (more than half of the entire territory), together with a rich historical and cultural heritage - all this creates ideal conditions for a comfortable stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is hardly possible to tell in the framework of one article about all the resorts of Slovenia, the rest of which is possible year-round.  Therefore, we draw your attention to the most popular and interesting places. </p><h2>  Portoroz - Port of Roses </h2>

You can get to it from Ljubljana by plane and bus.  Around it is surrounded by the small village of Lucia, the medieval city of Piran and, of course, the sea.

If you choose excursion, beach vacation and treatment in Slovenia, then Portoroz is perfect for this, harmoniously combining all these aspects. </p><p>  The climate of the resort town is similar to the Crimean one: with mild and snowless winters, dry and not too hot summers.  One of the main pluses is the presence of a bulk municipal sandy beach.  It is opposite it that the majority of the city's hotels are located. </p><p>  Portoroz has been known as a medical resort since the 13th century, when healing Benedictine monks discovered healing salt.  Modern medical centers of the city use it to this day, as well as royal and salt water, medicinal sea mud and thermal mineral water.

    <p>  A delightful provincial town on the Adriatic coast can be safely called an open-air museum surrounded by magnificent natural landscapes.  For tourists, it is especially attractive for its examples of medieval architecture (mainly Venetian) and its proximity to the border with <span>neighboring Italy</span> and Croatia.  Numerous sightseeing and shopping tours will diversify your vacation and give you a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions. </p><p>  Slovenia, the vacation in which is gradually gaining popularity, is small in area, but it gives a very pleasant opportunity - an independent trip through it.  So, from the capital to Piran can be reached in just 2-2.5 hours by bus, and then get directions to the nearest settlements (Koper and Isola) or to beautiful Venice, because the city has a port.  If you choose a beach holiday in Slovenia, then let it be a beautiful and ancient Piran. </p><h2>  Koper </h2><p>  A small resort town is next after Piran on the Adriatic coast of the country.  With a length of 30 km along it, it is the largest in terms of population.  Once upon a time there was an ancient settlement of Aegis in its place, and it got its modern name from the Roman Caprice.  The heyday of the city reached during the Venetian Republic, becoming the largest port in this area.  Since that time, the most significant and recognizable architectural monument - the Pretoria Palace, erected in 1464 - a monument of Venetian Gothic, has been preserved.  The most ancient building is the Ascension Rotunda (12th century).  It is here that the closest relationship between Italy and Slovenia is especially evident.  Holidays in Koper pleasantly combines a historical and cultural program, clean beaches and excellent gastronomy.  The city hosts a large number of folklore and music festivals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Isola </h2>

    <p>  Seaside provincial town with developed infrastructure is ready to receive tourists all year round.  It is interesting that earlier it was a small island, and only in the 19th century it was connected by an artificial isthmus to the mainland.  The basis of Izoly's economy is tourism, fishing, and related industrial processing of seafood. </p><p>  If you have chosen Slovenia for your vacation, you can recommend relaxing with young children in Izola, a quiet and calm town with a rich history and a great beach.  In addition, this place is perfect for sailors and windsurfers.  The basis of transport links is the seaport.  From it you can easily get to other European cities, including the nearest Venice. </p><p>  Wellness holidays in Slovenia reviews among holidaymakers are extremely positive.  In terms of quality of infrastructure, treatment options and effect, the country's resorts are in no way inferior to recognized world standards.  So, Rogaska Slatina, which will be discussed later, is a world-famous <span>thermal water</span> . </p><h2>  Roga≈°ka Slatina </h2><p>  Located in the eastern part of the country, 82 km from Ljubljana, the balneological resort town is known worldwide for its healing water, intended mainly for drinking courses - Donat Mg. </p><p>  The Slatine Valley was known even during the time of the Roman Empire, as evidenced by the excavation of an ancient road that once went from Rogatec to Lemberg.  Then, presumably, the healing waters of the resort were discovered, information about which quickly spread throughout Styria and beyond.  The first written mention of the place and mineral water is found in the writings of the alchemist L. Turneysser in 1572. </p>

    <p>  There is a very beautiful legend about the origin of the thermal spring.  According to her, he appeared at the request of the beautiful Apollo, who ordered his horse Pegasus to strike with a hoof between the Holy Cross and the Rogatz for the appearance of water with which people could be healed.  The memory of this froze over the centuries.  Stately Pegasus is depicted on the coat of arms of the city and in the form of a statue on one of its squares. </p><p>  When choosing a vacation in Slovenia on thermal springs, it is important to remember the specification of the resort.  Roga≈°ka Slatina specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, overweight problems, metabolic disorders and the function of the large intestine, including type 2 diabetes, etc. The basis of treatment is drinking local mineral water courses, a dietary nutritional system and balneology.  Systemic therapy allows not only to reduce negative trends, but also to avoid many complications or to do without drugs in the future. </p><p>  You can get to the resort from Ljubljana: by an individual transfer directly from the airport or by shuttle bus or train. </p><h2>  Terme ƒåate≈æ </h2><p>  Terme ƒåate≈æ is one of the largest balneological resorts not only in Slovenia, but throughout Europe.  It is located surrounded by woodland, on the right bank of the Sava River, the distance to Ljubljana is 100 km.  For treatment and relaxation, Terme ƒåate≈æ remains attractive throughout the whole year due to its pleasant subalpine climate with mild winters and moderately hot summers.  On its territory there are numerous campsites, hotels, a medical center and the medieval castle of Mokrice.  The latter majestically rises above the centuries-old forests of Goryantsev.  Now the castle is a luxury hotel with restaurants, halls and lounges.  One of those that Slovenia boasts for tourists. </p><p>  Rest and treatment in Terme ƒåate≈æ is indicated for people with problems of the musculoskeletal system (rheumatism, inflammatory diseases), excess weight, neurological diseases, as well as for postoperative and post-traumatic rehabilitation. </p><p>  Acratohypermal water is used with a temperature of +41 ¬∞  to +61 ¬∞ , which is saturated with sodium, iron, potassium, sulfur oxide, chlorine, bicarbonate, magnesium, as well as therapeutic mud. </p><h2>  Terme Dobrna </h2>

    <p>  This is an ideal place for a family holiday, combining the beauty of nature, architectural monuments and therapeutic thermal springs.  The swimming season on the lake is open from June to September.  There are two city beaches: paid (equipped with everything necessary) and free.  In winter, the surroundings of the lake turn into a place for a comfortable ski vacation. </p><h2>  Winter holidays in Slovenia </h2><p>  Slovenia is beautiful at any time of the year, and that is a fact.  Moderately hot summer is replaced by warm autumn and mild winter.  The proximity of the Alps contributes to the prosperity of winter sports and specialized resorts.  There are a lot of them, but we will focus your attention on the most popular. </p><ul><li>  <em>Kranjska Gora</em> is one of the main ski centers in the country.  It is located in the valley <span>of the Sava River,</span> surrounded on the sides by the Julian Alps and the Karavanke mountain range, about 2 km to the Austrian border.  Here you will find a typical alpine flavor with cozy little houses, green meadows, as if lost in the mountains and frozen in time.  Service at the highest level.  The resort offers not only climbing, skiing, snowboarding and hiking, but also pay attention to the nearby Triglav Nature Park and the Zelenka Nature Reserve. </li><li>  <em>Bovec</em> is the only resort in Slovenia whose routes run at an altitude of more than 2000 m above sea level (photo below).  The place is located in the western part of the natural park mentioned above, 136 km from the capital.  The ski season lasts from December to the end of April. </li><li>  <em>Maribor Pohorje.</em>  Located 17 km from the border with Austria, this ski resort is the most popular in the country.  The city is famous for its developed tourist-oriented infrastructure.  High-quality ski runs, of various difficulty levels, a modern ski lift system and a variety of winter activities. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in Slovenia tourists reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/1354936.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Holidays in Slovenia: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  The first thing to note: Slovenia as a tourist destination in our country is still gaining popularity.  And, meanwhile, it is a great alternative to more expensive resorts.  Holidays in the country are very diverse and represented in a wide variety of areas: from ecotourism to luxurious and expensive ski resorts, beaches with golden sand or pebbles.  The architecture of the country is extremely beautiful and includes many castles, fortresses, cathedrals and small charming churches.  However, the most popular holiday in Slovenia is the sea.  Reviews of tourists about it are mostly positive.  The clean Adriatic coast, according to them, is best suited for a measured and secluded vacation for two or with children.  In popular coastal towns there are no nightlife, clubs, and the location itself is relatively remote. </p><p>  Remember this, counting on a moving and noisy vacation with night parties, but choosing a vacation at sea in Slovenia.  2016, judging by the reviews, also pleases tourists with its prices.  To travel to Slovenia, you need a Schengen visa, however, getting it, you can easily go on your own to neighboring Austria, Italy or Croatia, because they are literally at hand. </p><p>  In their reviews, supporters of outdoor activities also note more affordable prices at the country's ski resorts compared to those in neighboring states. </p><p>  Each country is unique and inimitable, rich in beautiful places and architectural monuments, sultry deserts or harsh mountains, it is simply important to understand before the trip what exactly you expect from it. </p>
