Provincial Reform of Catherine 2</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to prevent peasant unrest, Catherine II in 1775 decided to carry out a reform relating to local governance.  This step led to a clearer division of the entire territory of the Russian Empire.  It began to be divided into administrative units, which determined the size of the so-called taxable population (people who paid taxes).  The largest of these were the provinces. </p><h2>  1708 reform </h2><p>  According to the <span>decree of Peter I</span> of December 18, the whole empire was divided into 8 provinces: Moscow, Smolensk, Azov, Arkhangelogorod, Kazan, Siberian, Kiev and Ingermanland, which after 2 years became known as St. Petersburg.  They were ruled by governors appointed by the king himself.  Major dignitaries usually claimed such high positions.  They received tremendous military, administrative, as well as judicial power.  In addition, they were given the opportunity to manage the finances of their province. </p>

    <p>  Over the next few years, 3 more large administrative units appeared: Riga, Astrakhan and Nizhny Novgorod.  The provincial <span>reform of Peter I</span> lasted for several years.  In 1715, some changes were made to local government.  They consisted of a fractional division of the provinces, which was based on a statistical principle, i.e., by the number of yards.  In 1719, these administrative units began to be divided into provinces.  Later, they were divided.  As a result, 250 counties were formed, which were governed by the governors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that both the decree of <span>Peter I</span> and the year 1708 itself became turning points in the management of the vast empire.  At that time, it was considered almost innovative. </p><h2>  Catherine Transformation Goals </h2><p>  The main paper that determined the implementation of the next reform in Russia was a document entitled "Institutions for the administration of the provinces of the All-Russian Empire."  I must say that on the eve of the reforms initiated by Catherine II, the territory of the country, in comparison with the times of Peter the Great, already had a larger number of administrative territories.  This was due to the fact that new lands constantly joined the empire. </p>

    <p>  The provincial reform in Russia, initiated by Catherine II, was to transform 23 provinces, 66 provinces and approximately 180 counties.  Its goal was to increase the number of large administrative centers.  As a result, their number almost doubled. </p><h2>  Separation </h2><p>  The whole empire was divided into provinces, and then into counties.  This process took place only on an administrative basis, without taking into account any economic, geographical and national factors.  The provincial reform of Catherine 2 pursued one goal - to adapt the new administrative apparatus to police and fiscal duties. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The separation occurred according to a quantitative criterion, i.e., according to the number of people.  So, in the territory of each province about 400 thousand people should have lived, and in the county - 30 thousand.  After a number of transformations that took place from 1728 to 1760, the old governing bodies were liquidated.  Provincial reform also abolished territorial units such as provinces. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The largest territorial units were headed by governors who could be appointed or deposed only by the emperor.  Provincial boards consisting of a prosecutor and a couple of centurions helped to manage them.  Treasury chambers dealt with fiscal and financial affairs.  Education and public health supervised the orders of public charity.  Legality was carried out by prosecutors with two solicitors. </p><p>  The provincial reform of Catherine 2 also affected the county administrations.  There, zemstvo police officers stood at the head, who were chosen by local nobles.  There were also collegial governing bodies, which were called lower zemstvo courts.  In addition to the police officer, there were two assessors.  The zemstvo courts were subordinate to the police.  Also, their duties included monitoring the order and implementing various decisions and laws of provincial boards in the territory under their control.  And in the cities a new position has appeared - the city manager. </p>

    <p>  The management of several large territorial units was carried out by the governor-generals.  They were the commanders-in-chief in these regions if the emperor himself was absent there, and had the right to introduce not only emergency measures, but also directly contact the monarch with reports. </p><p>  I must say that the year 1775 was very important for centralized power. Provincial reform further strengthened it.  By dividing the country's territory in this way, it maximally strengthened the position of its administrative apparatus in all regions.  In addition, the judicial system was reorganized for the same purpose, and special bodies were established to carry out police and punitive functions. </p><h2>  Alleged Reorganization </h2><p>  In 1769, by a laid commission, attempts were made at the provincial level to divide the responsibilities of administrations and courts.  To do this, it was supposed to create a four-level system, which would include county and provincial orders, provincial executory chambers, as well as the Senate, which was an appeals instance. </p><p>  In the cities, they wanted to keep the provincial magistrates' courts.  In addition, the organization of class courts was planned - separately for peasants and nobles.  At one of the meetings, the deputies suggested that the proceedings should be open and public.  But at the same time, they supported the creation of class courts.  It was such a double attitude that, in the long run, prevented the separation of judicial functions from the authorities.  The deputies understood that it was possible to protect the privileges and special status of the nobility only with the help of the administration.  Despite this, most of the proposals put forward by the commission were put into effect when the provincial reform of 1775 began. </p>

    <h2>  Ship separation </h2><p>  In 1769, deputies prepared a special bill, which regulated the foundations of judicial law.  It was supposed to create several courts: a merchant engaged in brokerage and merchant affairs;  special - was in charge of customs problems;  criminal, police and civil - engaged in "deaneries";  spiritual - examined intra-church issues regarding law and faith;  military - engaged in criminal acts of court officials. </p><p>  Police, criminal and civil courts wanted to divide according to the territorial principle - into city and zemstvo.  All of them were to enter the general system of three-level subordination: province - county - province.  It was also assumed that the judiciary would be able to evaluate the decrees emanating from the central authority from the point of view of state significance.  In addition, city and zemstvo courts had to be elected, and trials open.  All these proposals made by the commission at that time were of great importance for the upcoming judicial reform in Russia in 1775. </p><h2>  Class system </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the transformation affected not only the administrative apparatus.  Provincial reform also brought about changes in the judicial system.  She not only clearly formulated, but also maximally strengthened the division on an estate basis. </p><p>  ‚óè In each county, special courts were created for the nobility.  They consisted of a judge and two assessors.  They were elected by the local nobility for a period of 3 years.  The Upper Zemsky Courts played the role of the appellate courts and consisted of two departments dealing with civil and criminal cases.  They were the only ones in the entire province and consisted of two people - the chairman and his deputy, who were appointed by the emperor himself.  They could conduct audits as well as control the activities of <span>county courts.</span> </p><p>  ‚óè Magistrates became the lower courts in cities.  Their members were also elected for a term of 3 years.  For these <span>courts</span> , the provincial magistrates were <span>appeals</span> .  They included 2 chairmen and 2 assessors from among local residents. </p><p>  ‚óè In the lower county reprisals, state peasants were tried.  Civil and criminal cases were examined there.  They were engaged in by officials who were appointed by the authorities.  Appeals for lower steel upper reprisals.  Cases in them were made only on bail, which was valid for one week. </p><p>  ‚óè Provincial reform has established so-called <span>conscientious courts.</span>  They were also built on an estate basis.  They included representatives of the nobility, as well as citizens and peasants.  These courts performed the so-called conciliation function (they helped to settle the conflict between the plaintiffs).  In addition, their duties included special proceedings in relation to crimes committed by insane people or children.  Witchcraft cases were also considered here. </p><p>  ‚óè In provinces, audit and appeal instances were judicial chambers that considered both criminal and civil cases.  They revised the claims coming to them from the upper zemstvo courts and massacres, as well as from provincial magistrates.  As a rule, <span>appeals were</span> accompanied by a sufficiently large pledge of money. </p><p>  ‚óè The Senate was the highest of all the judiciary. </p><p>  So, what else is interesting provincial reform of Catherine 2 (year 1775)?  It was then that the first attempt was made to separate the administration from the court.  But she still failed.  Governors could still influence the execution of sentences, for example, on deprivation of honor or the death penalty.  The presidents of the courts were appointed by the authorities, since representatives of the estates had the right to elect only assessors.  Many cases went to the city police.  In addition, patrimonial justice acted. </p>

    <h2>  Responsibilities </h2><p>  The principles of the police department were discussed at the meetings of the laid commission, before the provincial reform began.  The year 1771 was marked by the completion of a project that involved the creation of police departments in cities.  They were to become an apparatus for maintaining public order. </p><p>  The duties of the police included the suppression of various illegal acts.  For example, it could be debauchery, fistfights, the manifestation of excessive luxury, fast driving or disturbing order during worship and religious processions.  The police also had the right to control various festivities, to observe trade in markets and the cleanliness of cities, rivers, food, water, and many others.  other </p><p>  The functions of the police also included the fight against fires, robbers and vagrants, secret meetings and other troublemakers.  She also regulated trade rules and restaurant maintenance.  In addition, the duties of the police included control over taxation, city planning and the organization of various holidays. </p>

    <h2>  Police organs </h2><p>  The provincial reform of Catherine 2 began. The year 1775 provided for the creation of a number of special police bodies.  But the draft ‚ÄúStatute of Deanery‚Äù was completed only after 6 years.  The following year it was published.  It consisted of 14 chapters and 274 articles.  This charter determined the structure of the police, their system, the main aspects of activity, as well as a list of acts that were subject to punishment. </p><p>  The law enforcement body of the city became the administration of deanery.  Its staff included ratman-advisers, bailiffs involved in both criminal and civil matters, the mayor (or chief commandant) and the police chief. </p><p>  For convenience, all cities were divided into quarters and parts (the section took place according to the number of buildings).  The bailiff was the head of the police department in the unit, and the overseer in the quarter.  All ranks were included in the ‚ÄúTable of Ranks‚Äù.  Provincial authorities led the police.  It was they who resolved all issues related to the dismissal or appointment of posts.  Police in the capitals were controlled exclusively by the Senate. </p><h2>  Offenses </h2><p>  The Charter of the Deanery listed a number of crimes and sanctions that the police were supposed to know.  Here is some of them: </p><p>  ‚óè acts related to non-compliance with laws and decisions of police authorities; </p><p>  ‚óè activities against worship and the Orthodox faith in general; </p><p>  ‚óè bribery; </p><p>  ‚óè acts that violate public order; </p><p>  ‚óè actions that are contrary to the norms of deanery, such as gambling, forbidden performances, drunkenness, abuse, building without permission, unseemly behavior; </p><p>  ‚óè criminal activity directed against the existing law and order, property, person, etc. </p><p>  Police authorities had the right to impose sanctions on violators only for some offenses, for example, for illegal possession of weapons, theft of property, speaking out against Orthodoxy, violation of customs rules, etc. But most often the police were engaged in preliminary investigations and subsequent transfer of the collected material to the courts.  The only thing she did not work with was political crimes.  For this purpose, other bodies existed. </p><p>  The provincial reform of Catherine 2 contributed to the separation of executive and judicial authorities.  All estates, not counting serfs, began to take a more active part in local governance.  Also, a court was created for each of them.  In addition, provincial reform put an end to the functioning of almost all collegiums.  The exception was only the most important - the Foreign, Admiralty and Military.  The duties of the liquidated colleges passed to the provincial authorities. </p>
