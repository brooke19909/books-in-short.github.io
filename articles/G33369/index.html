    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first decision to establish a recreation area was made by the city authorities in 1896, when various exhibitions were held at this place.  By decision of the merchants, the park received its initial appearance on May 1.  Nizhny Novgorod was then completely different, and the recreation area was very different from modern. </p><p>  In the wasteland between the Moscow-Nikolaev railway and the forest of <span>Count Shuvalov</span> , a walking area with 50 fountains and a pond in which swans lived was divided.  Over 30 entertainment venues were built throughout the territory.  That was the park on May 1.  Nizhny Novgorod has changed a lot since then, only a pond and the territory itself, which they decided not to rename, have reached our time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphinarium Park May 1 Nizhny Novgorod" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1818498.jpg" width="600"></div>
