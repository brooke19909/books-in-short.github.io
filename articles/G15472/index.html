Payments in Internet banking are operations carried out within the system on the accounts of an individual without visiting the bank office.  So, at the beginning of this year, the penetration rate of the system in Russia is defined at 16.7%.  It is at the initial stage, since, for example, in Canada this indicator is 60%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Analyzing the use of Internet banking for individuals in our country, it should be said that the volume of payments and transactions within the system is constantly increasing annually, which indicates its advantages. </p><p>  Thus, the share of payments made by individuals through banking in the number of transactions increased by 18% by 2017 and amounted to 26% compared to 8% in 2011. </p><p>  In our country, in the use of Internet banking services, the share of payment for mobile operators is leading and amounts to 48%.  This is followed by payment for Internet services and utilities, payment of details, making online purchases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.riyadbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet banking for individuals" class="if uuid-2276392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2276392.jpg"></div><h2>  Possibilities of the system of JSC ASB Belarusbank </h2><p>  Let's consider the possibilities of using Belarusbank's Internet banking. </p><p>  The system at JSC Belarusbank is a specialized developed information system that provides the operation and the ability to provide services via the Internet for customers. </p><p>  In order to be able to use the banking services, an individual needs to register in two ways: through the online registration service or at the office of this financial institution.  Each client can have only one account. </p><p>  Logging into the bank‚Äôs Internet banking system is done through an account (login and password) in your personal account. </p><p>  The process of registering a client in an individual account of the system is as follows: </p><ol><li>  When contacting the bank office: <ul>  it is necessary to submit documents to the bank office for identification and an existing bank card;  fill out a special application form in the form of a bank with the possibility of servicing through this system;  acquire a unique name and get a password to enter the system, as well as a special card for session keys;  activate the key card. </ul></li><li>  When applying through the bank's website, the following steps must be taken: <ul>  apply on the site;  pay for the provision of services;  wait for a card of session keys to the house. </ul></li></ol><p>  To start using the system, you must perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  click on the "Personal Account" icon; </li><li>  enter login and password in the appropriate fields; </li><li>  set the session code. </li></ul><p>  Opportunities of Internet banking in your account: </p><ul><li>  view the balance of funds; </li><li>  deposit operations; </li><li>  credit operations; </li><li>  payments in favor of Internet service providers; </li><li>  money transfers; </li><li>  View payment history. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internet banking personal account" class="if uuid-2276396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2276396.jpg"></div><h2>  The Future of Internet Banking </h2><p>  There are two directions for the development of Internet banking services in the near future: </p><ul><li>  improving existing systems, focus on attracting new customers; </li><li>  focus on an advanced user and, as a result, a qualitative improvement in the work of Internet banking due to the elaboration and refinement of services, adding new ones. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.firstcapitalb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="login to internet banking" class="if uuid-2276397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2276397.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In modern conditions of high market dynamism and competition for their customers, banks are trying to come up with more and more new ways to attract additional financial flows.  To this end, various means of improving customer service are used.  One of which is the introduction of Internet banking services.  The experience of recent years in a number of banks has shown that the introduction of this system allows not only to improve the quality of service for existing bank customers, but also to increase the number of new ones, which, in turn, ensures the growth of bank profit and profitability.  Thus, Internet banking is a service whose growth prospects in the coming years are very bright and significant. </p>
