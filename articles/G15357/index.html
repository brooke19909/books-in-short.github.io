Therefore, every native resident of St. Petersburg and visitors living in this city, choose for themselves a bank that meets their ideas.  Citibank is quite popular among citizens.  In this institution you can carry out a wide variety of financial transactions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.hipdir.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Citibank ATMs in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2249595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2249595.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Citibank </h2><p>  Citi Bank began its development many decades ago.  As early as 1916, during the October Revolution, the first branch was opened.  The main goal of the institution at that time was to accept assistance and provide resources to the state in wartime.  The first branch was founded in Petrograd, then another branch in Moscow.  In 1919, another branch was opened in Vladivostok.  Due to difficult times, the crisis of those times, in 1920 all three branches were closed. </p><p>  Later, Citibank again took off and resumed work in Moscow.  It began in 1973. Due to difficult times, in 1979 the department was again closed. </p><p>  Citibank did not want to leave the financial market of the Russian Federation, so in 1992 it resumed work.  The first year a banking institution existed exclusively for the international financial relations of Russia with other countries.  Nevertheless, already in 1993, the organization received permission to conduct business and activities in the <span>banking sector.</span>  This bank was one of the first to appear in the Russian Federation.  Initially, the main task of the institution was to provide services to legal entities, as well as interbank currency trading on exchanges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="spb.hipdir.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Citibank History" class="if uuid-2249597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2249597.jpg"></div><p>  The impetus for the development of the structure occurred in 1995, when the bank contributed to a major transaction for a developed and profitable company.  After that, the bank became popular and was heard by many.  In 1996, an office was opened in St. Petersburg.  It was here that the bank actively began to position itself as a financial structure that provides great opportunities for its customers.  As before, corporate clients remained the main group. </p><p>  Having survived the 1998 crisis and staying on the market, Citibank began to expand its area of ‚Äã‚Äãpresence.  Opportunities for customers also increased during this period.  The organization actively began to develop the retail business and serve individuals.  Already in 2010, the number of customers of a banking organization exceeded one million, which was a record at that time. </p><p>  In 2016, Citi Bank was named the most stable and reliable financial institution in the Russian Federation by some sources.  Looking at the long history and stability of a banking organization, it is easy to conclude that the structure can be trusted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Addresses of Citibank branches in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2249594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2249594.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time, Citibank tried to break into the front ranks among banking institutions.  Nevertheless, it was possible to do this on the third attempt, when the war times and hours of instability in the country passed.  Zeal and desire is one of the best indicators for a financial institution that will not stop either the crisis or the difficulties in the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Benefits of Citibank Financial Institution </h2><p>  Citibank has many advantages, due to which customers turn to this structure.
