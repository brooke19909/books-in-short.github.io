    <p>  In this article you will find the most unusual gadgets, the usefulness of which can be doubtful.  These include, for example, laser-guided scissors. </p><h2>  Great helper - a robot vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  The first robots appeared a long time ago.  Gradually, new technologies are emerging that make them very useful.  Of course, robotic devices are quite expensive, but there are those that are available to the buyer with an average level of income. </p><p>  For example, choosing unusual <span>gadgets for the kitchen,</span> let‚Äôs dwell on robotic vacuum cleaners.  For the price they are on par with modern phones.  But at the same time, the benefit from them is much greater than from multifunctional smartphones. </p>

    <p>  If you do not want to spend a lot of your time on home cleaning, and when you come home from work, observe cleanliness and comfort, then an unusual gadget in the form of a robotic vacuum cleaner will be very useful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can buy an average robot in quality and characteristics for 40 thousand rubles.  Normally, he can process and clean up to 120 square meters of floor.  This will disappear as small particles of dust and dirt, as well as larger lumps of wool, the remnants of food. </p><h2>  Sensors help the robot stay on track </h2><p>  Due to the presence of many sensors that control the movement of the robot in space, you can not be afraid that he will crash into something or fall from the stairs. </p><p>  The cost of such a gadget depends on the following characteristics: </p><ul><li><p>  battery life without recharging; </p></li><li><p>  type of cleaning (dry, wet, combination); </p></li><li><p>  remote control capability. </p></li></ul><p>  Of course, the cost depends on other qualities (for example, the manufacturer), but the above are the most significant and noticeable for the average user. </p><h2>  USB flavor: create a pleasant atmosphere in the office </h2><p>  It just so happened that most residents of huge cities spend their lives at work at the computer.  Five days a week, we are forced to sit in the office, carrying out instructions from managers. </p><p>  Not each of us is in a separate office, and we need to share our work space with other people.  At the same time, different smells that can reach us can be unpleasant.  For example, fish cakes, canned goods or products with similar harsh aromas do not always want to be felt outside of lunch.  In addition, there are people with increased sweating, from which it does not smell like freshness. </p>

    <p>  How to deal with all this?  To do this, you should purchase an unusual gadget USB-flavor.  It looks like a regular flash drive.  But unlike it, such a device does not contain internal memory, and its purpose is completely different.  The principle of operation is as follows: on the gadget there is a special place on which you should pour a couple of drops of aromatic oil.  After that, you need to insert the device into the USB port on your computer or laptop.  Wait 2-3 minutes, and your workroom will be filled with a new pleasant aroma. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It would seem a simple device, but sometimes it is so much lacking.  It is useful not only for office work, but also for home use of a computer.  This is especially true for owners of cats or other pets.  It is enough to use a computer with such a "flash drive", and in an apartment or house it will always be pleasant to smell. </p><h2>  What does a gadget consist of? </h2><p>  The cost of this device is at the level of 500 rubles.  Usually the kit includes: </p><ul><li><p>  USB plastic aromatizer; </p></li><li><p>  bottle with oil. </p></li></ul><p>  This unusual gadget is a device that allows its owner not to take any additional actions to create comfort in the space surrounding him.  It‚Äôs enough to choose a suitable smell, add a couple of drops to the device and insert it into the USB port. </p><p>  Choosing unusual gadgets as a gift, do not pass by such a device. </p><h2>  Laser scissors - stupid or useful thing? </h2><p>  When describing unusual <span>home gadgets,</span> one cannot ignore the following Chinese know-how.  At first glance, it can show that the scissors do not need any additional devices, especially a laser.  But the sale of such products is at a fairly high level. </p><p>  Thanks to the precise laser, the owner of such a gadget has no trouble cutting something very evenly.  Moreover, using the device is very easy: the laser is turned on with one touch, and its accuracy can be adjusted thanks to special screws. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the usefulness for an ordinary person of such scissors is doubtful.  But for housewives, seamstresses, as well as young children who like to engage in creativity and amateur activity, such an unusual gadget will come in handy.  It will allow you to cut paper, cardboard and fabric with high accuracy. </p><p>  The cost of such a device is at the level of 500 rubles and depends on the quality of the material, as well as the power of the laser beam, which is manifested in its length. </p><h2>  Utility must match price and effort </h2><p>  Unusual electronic gadgets have been described above.  Very often, in the pursuit of a novelty, people forget that the usefulness of the purchased product should correspond to the money spent. </p><p>  Of course, a robot vacuum cleaner is beneficial and helps to make the house cleaner and more comfortable.  But it also has drawbacks that will not relieve you of the obligation to remove dirt from inaccessible places, as well as from where the device could not get. </p>

    <p>  Also with laser scissors.  In principle, the idea is interesting, but few people want to pay that much money to cut off straight lines.  It is much easier to use a ruler and pencil for drawing. </p><p>  That is, not always unusual devices, gadgets and other modern innovations are something useful.  Sometimes they are just toys for entertainment. </p><p>  Of course, there are useful devices, for example, a USB flavor.  So, acquiring a similar thing, think about the appropriateness of the purchase.  Will it become a burden for your wallet? </p>
