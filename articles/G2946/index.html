    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, you can make a stencil in the form of letters or any other object at home.  Nothing complicated.  The main thing is to understand the technology and be patient. </p><h2>  Tools and materials for work </h2><p>  To make a DIY chipboard, you will need the following: </p><ul><li>  a sheet of paper for printing a picture; </li><li>  tracing paper in order to transfer the template to cardboard; </li><li>  a sheet of cardboard of the thickness you need; </li><li>  a simple pencil; </li><li>  <span>scotch tape (painting</span> or regular); </li><li>  sharp knife; </li><li>  a solid substrate on which you will cut (special tablet, board); </li><li>  <span>sandpaper</span> (sandpaper) for processing bumps along the edges of the workpiece. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, nothing special and expensive is needed.  All, most likely, is already at hand. </p><h2>  DIY scrapbooking chipboards </h2><p>  To make an element in the form of text, ornament or other object, work like this: </p><ol><li>  Find a suitable version of the contour image or create it in a graphical editor. </li><li>  Print the picture on a sheet. </li><li>  Now the image needs to be transferred to cardboard.  Depending on the complexity of the object, choose a method for further work.  If the outline is simple and you make one object, cut out the pattern and circle on cardboard. </li><li>  If you have printed words in which you need to observe the distance between the letters, a complex ornament, then use tracing paper.  Fill the sheet on the template and draw around the outline with a simple pencil.  So that the tracing paper does not accidentally move, it is better to fix it on the basis of tape. </li><li>  When the redraw is complete, remove the tracing paper from the stencil and circle the drawing on the back of the tracing paper. </li><li>  Put tracing paper on the cardboard.  Fasten again. </li><li>  Circle the pattern again.  Graphite on the back is printed on cardboard. </li><li>  If the contours are very poorly visible, circle the pattern on the cardboard again brighter, so that then you do not have to strain your eyes. </li><li>  Start cutting parts along the contour with a sharp knife.  The usual mock-up clerical option will do. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY scrapbooking chipboards" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1230815.jpg" width="351"></div>  If the tool is not sharp, it will be difficult to cut and the edges will turn out with notches.  Since cardboard consists of several layers, you can cut through the elements several times with less effort.  It will turn out more accurately. </li><li>  When all the elements are cut, treat the edges of the workpieces and the side parts with sandpaper, if necessary. </li></ol><h2>  How to decorate a chipboard </h2><p>  In some scrapbooking jewelery, chipboards are used raw, but are most often used as the basis.  The cut out pattern or letters can be painted in the same color with several smooth transitions, create the effect of peeling paint particles by applying paraffin to these areas and then re-staining, make craquelure, create a relief surface, apply sparkles, microbeads. </p><p>  So, you met with a new concept for yourself - a chipboard.  What is it and how to use it - you know.  Now it‚Äôs time to start practicing: buy suitable blanks or make them yourself and actively use them for decorating works in scrapbooking technique. </p>
