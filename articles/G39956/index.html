How to recharge your phone in other ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mobile communication allows us to always let our relatives and friends know about us, quickly contact the person we need, clarify any information or communicate something important.  Without mobile phones, we feel limited in movement, and this happens when the balance becomes zero.  Since this can happen anytime, anywhere, you need to know how you can deposit funds to your mobile account.  We‚Äôll talk about this.  We will discuss how to recharge the phone from the phone (noting different operators), and, of course, consider what other ways you can do this. </p><h2>  We replenish from the phone </h2><p>  How does the transfer of money between mobile accounts?  It should be noted that this is done using short USSD commands.  A person who wants to share money must make a request, and then confirm it.  If you are looking for how to top up the phone from the phone, remember: a commission is charged for this operation, so this method is the most expensive.  But it‚Äôs convenient, fast and relatively simple. </p><h2>  MTS </h2><p>  The company provides its subscribers with the opportunity to both ask someone to deposit money into their account and send payments on their own.  The first one is ‚ÄúTop up my account‚Äù service.  Its essence is to send a short message to the subscriber‚Äôs number with a request to replenish the account.  This is done through the combination * 116 *, after which the number of the subscriber to whom the transfer is made should go.  The combination should be completed with a ‚Äútrellis‚Äù (#).  It is noteworthy that such a request can be sent not only within the MTS network. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If, on the contrary, you want to share money from your account, dial * 112 * phone number of the recipient of funds * the amount by which you would like to top up #.  A maximum of one transfer in this way can send up to 300 rubles.  The cost of one such replenishment (meaning a one-time commission) is 7 rubles.  If the subscriber sets up regular replenishment, this amount is debited once (for the first time). </p><h2>  Beeline </h2><p>  The Beeline operator also has a simple answer to the question of how to top up the phone from the phone.  You can do this on the company's website.  It is enough to enter your number, as well as the number to which the payment will be sent.  Of course, this is not free - a fee of 3 percent of the recharge amount plus 10 rubles will be charged from the sending subscriber.  Beeline does not provide information on how to replenish the phone directly using short commands. </p><h2>  Tele2 </h2><p>  Like MTS, Tele2 has a short digital combination for transferring funds directly.  It looks like this: * 145 * phone number * amount the sender of funds wants to replenish the account #.  The cost of the service when sending money to the number of another Tele2 subscriber is 5 rubles.  If we talk about transferring to a ‚Äúforeign‚Äù operator, the commission increases to 5% of the payment and 5 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Again, after entering the USSD combination, an SMS message will be sent to the sender's number.  With it, you will need to confirm your intention to send money to another subscriber. </p><h2>  "Megaphone" </h2><p>  This operator provides the ability to send money to another number using a slightly different mechanism.  To do this, you need to send a message to 3116 containing the recipient's number and the amount to be debited.  It‚Äôs not worth worrying about the fact that the money will be delayed - they are credited a couple of minutes after sending the message.  Before you top up your phone with a Megafon phone, consider the maximum amount - 500 rubles per payment. </p><p>  The commission is not reported on the operator‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Credit card recharge </h2>

    <p>  Sending funds from a phone to another phone is certainly convenient, but not very profitable.  It is advisable to apply in cases where you do not have access to the Internet or payment terminals.  If you have access to the network, you can recharge with a card.  How to recharge a phone from a card is described on the pages of operators.  More precisely, companies have provided such an opportunity directly on their sites.  To <span>transfer money</span> from Visa or MasterCard to your account, just enter the card details and wait a bit. </p><p>  Everyone will understand how to replenish the phone from the card with each individual operator, so we will not dwell on this.  The main thing is to have all the card data (number, validity period and CVV code).  There is nothing complicated here. </p><h2>  PayPal Deposit </h2><p>  Another relevant way to deposit funds to a mobile account is <span>electronic currencies</span> and various payment systems.  A vivid example of this is PayPal, the most popular payment sending and receiving service in the world.  There are practically no instructions on how to top up your phone with PayPal, since there are no direct transfers in such directions.  Given that the ‚ÄúStick‚Äù is tied to a card, we can say that from the same card you can replenish your mobile method, as indicated above.  An alternative is the use of special services that exchange any currencies (the so-called exchangers). </p><h2>  Top-up via Yandex </h2>

    <p>  Another important factor worth mentioning is the payment system in which you receive income. </p><p>  We will give a simple example: if Yandex.Money does not charge a commission, then in order to replenish an account in this system, you will have to deposit some funds.  If you get a salary, say, on a Visa card, then there is no point in interacting with Poison, as this will entail the calculation of a commission.  If you are a freelancer, you are paid to the Yandex.Money wallet, then everything is fine, you can replenish the accounts of your near and dear ones with the greatest benefit without any restrictions.  The same applies to other currencies and payment systems. </p>
