  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of modern science. Logical and philosophical study</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>The essence and task of natural science.</strong>  <strong>Natural worlds</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  The concept of modern natural science has not yet been established in science of science.  A very significant number of authors have their own conceptual versions, which, as a rule, are not consistent with each other.  Disagreements concern not only the structure of the subject, but also its history. </p><p>  On the question of the essence of natural science, the authors agree in the following. </p><p>  If the sciences that study nature are combined into a system, then such a system will be natural science.  Moreover, nature is understood as the totality of worlds that is achievable for any form of human experience, i.e.  Universe.  It is they (the worlds of the Universe) that are the object of study in natural science. </p><p>  In terms of the scale of the worlds, they can be divided into 3 interconnected components: </p><ul><li>  the nature of the microworld; </li><li>  the nature of the macrocosm; </li><li>  nature of megaworld. </li></ul><p>  The nature of the microworld is a region whose boundaries are determined by the size of the atom.  This is a world of phenomena that are less than or equal to an atom. </p><p>  The nature of the macrocosm extends from the size of an atom to the measurability of the globe.  This is a world of phenomena that are larger than the atom, but smaller than the Earth or equal to it. </p><p>  The nature of the megaworld is limited by the size of the Earth - on the smaller side and the size of the Universe - on the larger. </p><p>  As you know, worlds are reflected in consciousness.  It is noteworthy that only in a reflected form can a person observe them, since he has no other reflective (reflective) ability, other than the ability of consciousness. </p><p>  In terms of reflection properties, two types of worlds coexist: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - <span>Objective reality</span> (reflected).  It is dominated by a special form of consciousness - undistorted.  This form ("pure consciousness") is not a property of man, its presence can only be assumed. </p><p>  The objective world as such cannot be reflected, because, as noted above, a person has nothing to reflect on him.  However, through thinking, the objective is knowable and subject to investigation. </p><p>  - Subjective reality (reflected).  The subjective world, in contrast, is the result of reflection.  This is a world distorted by the intervention of human consciousness. </p><p>  Speaking about the main task of natural science, most authors agree that it studies the objective laws of nature. </p><p>  <strong>Description, understanding, explanation in natural science</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  The properties of objects and phenomena are not quantitatively limited.  With every new study of nature, there is always a chance to discover the phenomenon and object from a new perspective, with new features.  A thing has an infinite number of properties. </p><p>  Only a certain, limited accuracy is possible with a quantitative characterization of a particular property. </p><p>  Even one object or one phenomenon does not allow accounting for all their properties.  It is also impossible to investigate the nature of one property with the requirement of zero error, i.e.  infinite precision. </p><p>  Full knowledge of any subject or phenomenon is impossible.  It is only possible to take into account a certain part in the aggregate knowledge of their properties, and at the same time a definite error will be allowed. </p><p>  Providing the phenomenon with an adequate mathematical description does not mean that this phenomenon has become clear.  In fact, the explanation of the phenomenon means an explanation of its nature, the reasons for the existence of this phenomenon and dictating its given, and not other behavior. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To explain a thing in this way means to reveal: </p><ul><li>  mechanism and internal essence of a thing; </li><li>  the reasons for each part moving; </li><li>  the mechanism of how these parts interact; </li><li>  a picture of how this movement interacts with other phenomena and material formations. </li></ul><p>  Almost every concept of modern natural science is based on the fact that things are knowable when their inner essence is revealed. </p><p>  <strong>Stages of Natural Science</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  Productive forces in the era of the ancient world and the Middle Ages developed without reliance on <span>scientific knowledge,</span> then still elementary and rudimentary.  In any case, the beginnings of ancient knowledge in no way constituted the necessary condition for the development of productive forces.  The foundations of the transformation and subjugation of nature were religious beliefs, as well as practical knowledge and empirical skills. </p><p>  This period of development of knowledge about nature carried a certain (comparatively small) number of early discoveries, which in the future partially laid the <span>foundation for science.</span>  However, technology and technology have evolved almost without intersection with these discoveries, rather slowly in terms of progress. </p><p>  In production processes, both physical and mental labor efforts were made by the manufacturers themselves.  Their knowledge was enough to independently conduct their chosen production. </p><p>  This stage in the history of reflection of nature by consciousness should be called pre-scientific.  It is important to note that, from the point of view of periodization, the very use of the term "natural sciences" in relation to this era is conditional. </p><p>  At the beginning of the next stage - the stage of scientific knowledge - philosophy lay deep in their foundation.  Almost every concept of modern natural science mentions this. </p><p>  Along with the accumulation of experience and empirical skills, a need arose for their processing, systematization, and generalization. </p><p>  The transformation of practical knowledge into the beginnings of science has led to the formation of elements of scientific knowledge: first physical, astronomical, biological, geological, later - geographical, mechanical, etc. </p><p>  If, on the basis of this article, the most general conception of modern science were built, it would argue that it dates back to 1948, when Norbert Wiener created cybernetics.  According to this science, wildlife and society are governed by strictly defined laws.  Wiener's discovery was of tremendous importance for the entire scientific paradigm of the 20th and 21st centuries, and cybernetics received the informal title of "science of sciences." </p><p>  Since the late 90s of the 20th century.  computer science has become the successor of cybernetics, which, in turn, is still considered the ‚Äúscience of sciences‚Äù up to now. </p><p>  Modern science, which sooner or later will gain a single concept, for its creation will require continuous consideration of changes in the <span>scientific pictures of the world.</span>  In it itself, it will be necessary to provide a mechanism for its updating. </p>
