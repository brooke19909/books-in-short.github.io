If you don‚Äôt have time to think about how to make a tail of a squirrel or a beak of a pelican, then you can just dress up as a princess.  Any girl and girl have a beautiful dress.  But what is the crown to be made of?  From foamiran.  Read the detailed instructions for its manufacture below. </p><h2>  What is foamiran? </h2><p>  This new material is widespread.  In fact, foamiran is a foam rubber.  The texture of the material is incredibly soft.  Sometimes it is compared to faux suede.  But unlike fabric, foamiran is very light, and sheets of this material can have a thickness of 1 mm. </p><p>  What is made of <span>foam rubber?</span>  She is very popular among needlewomen.  Girls make dolls, flowers and various decorative elements from foamirana.  Why did this material displace such a popular plastic several years ago?  Firstly, foamiran is lightweight.  Secondly, it does not fade in the sun.  Well, and thirdly, neither rain nor snow are terrible for this material.  Recently, party costumes have been sewn from foam rubber.  And girls use foamiran to make jewelry, for example, crowns. </p><h2>  What materials will be required? </h2><p>  To make a foamiran crown, we need a piece of the foam itself.  The dimensions of the canvas for creativity should be at least 30 x 30 cm. The color of the foamiran can be any.  The material is well tinted.  Therefore, if you do not find a suitable piece of gold or black, you should not worry.  True, in this case, you will need PVA paints and glue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For work, we need a hot gun.  If this is not on the farm, then it can be replaced with glue "Titan" or any other, except PVA and clerical, of course.  You can also use an iron or a soldering iron. </p><p>  Foamiran is a rubber, which means that when it is hot, it adheres perfectly.  We will need scissors and a knife to shape the material.  Note that we need the stationery cutter.  Various accessories that will serve as a crown decoration should also be in your inventory.  Well, a bezel, hairpin or elastic band will also come in handy.  With these devices we will fasten the crown to the head. </p><h2>  We make a pattern </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a crown of foamiran" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114842.jpg"></div>  Before proceeding with the manufacture of the crown from foamiran, you need to do all the preparatory work.  The first stage is drawing a pattern.  You can use our option proposed above.  And also you can independently draw a crown pattern from foamiran. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To do this, you need to set one stencil of the headgear and propagate it.  The tops of the crown do not have to be round.  They can be in the form of rhombuses, crosses, ovals or hearts.  You can dream a little to make the crown unique. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Draw a contour?  Now we cut out a pattern on it.  On foamiran, we circle our paper crown with soap or chalk.  Why not with a felt-tip pen, pen or pencil?  Then the trace from these writing instruments is erased very poorly.  But the chalk can be removed by wiping the product with a damp sponge.  Pattern is ready.  Now we move on to further elaboration of the crown. </p><h2>  Cut out the details </h2>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rim foamiran crown" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114840.jpg"></div>  So that our foamiran crown does not look boring, you need to decorate it.  For this we need either foam rubber or cardboard.  Of these materials, you need to cut out the hearts if you go according to the standard pattern.  You can use other shapes, such as rhombuses, circles, or even the faces of animals.  Glue all this variety around the perimeter of the crown. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <p></p>
    <p>  There is another way to decorate our headgear.  Do not stick decorative elements on it, but, on the contrary, cut them out of our crown.  In this case, jewelry will be replaced by curly holes.  Here, too, you can show imagination and cut out any shape that only comes to your mind.  But you need to remember that all your decorative holes should be equally spaced from each other. </p><h2>  Glue the crown </h2><p>  Our headgear is almost ready.  It remains to answer the question of how to make a crown of foamiran round shape?  Here we can not do without a hot gun or glue.  Why is it better to use heated silicone as a binder?  We advise you to do this for the reason that, if necessary, excess glue is quite easy to remove, and when solidified, the glue holds even bulk parts well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We take the crown, turn it around, grease the two ends with glue and hold for 3 minutes.  If you use something that binds for a long time as a binder, it is better to staple our headpiece. </p><p>  But the easiest and fastest way to glue the crown is to heat two edges with an iron or a soldering iron.  Rubber quickly "floats."  This will allow one end of the crown to be quite simply glued to the other. </p><h2>  Decorate the finished product </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown from foamiran master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114841.jpg"></div>  There are several ways to make jewelry for our headgear.  One of the options is to decorate the crown with the help of details carved from foamiran.  You can personalize the product by attaching rhinestones and beads.  We glue volumetric glass at an equal distance from each other and frame each of them with one or several rows of rhinestones, sequins and other decorative elements, which you have at hand.

      <p></p>
    <p>  But you can go the other way and immediately make an elegant crown of foamiran with glitter.  This is the same foam rubber, only one of its sides is strewn with sparkles.  Such material is elegant in itself and does not require additional decoration. </p><h2>  Second Crown Making Option </h2>
      <br>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glitter foamiran crown" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114844.jpg"></div>  We examined the phased production of one of the types of hats, and now we will show how similar solutions can be made.  Let's assemble the second version of the glitter foamiran crown.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Take the material with black sparkles, and tint the other side with red paint.  To do this, mix gouache with PVA glue and carefully treat the foam rubber with a sponge.  While the material is drying, we are preparing a pattern.  You can take a picture, on the basis of which we made the first crown, and stretch its pointed edges up, and draw hearts instead of circles. </p><p>  We cut out the pattern and circle it on our foamiran.  And cut it out again.  We glue with an iron or a hot gun.  It remains to decorate our product.  To do this, we need a large red stone (you can use a pendant for this purpose) and small rhinestones.  And a strip of shiny pebbles on the ribbon.  Glue the red stone in the center of the crown and frame it with rhinestones.  Glue the tape on the bottom of the product.  Our crown is ready.  You can focus on this option, but you can go further and make the whole composition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glitter foamiran crown" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114845.jpg"></div>  To do this, we attach a foamiran crown to the rim, and next we attach artificial flowers, chains and colorful pieces of tulle.  You can use various accessories in the form of keys, locks, spiders, skulls or coins.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown of foamiran" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114846.jpg"></div>  We already know how to make a hat of two kinds, now consider another method of manufacturing.  The crown of foamiran, the master class for the manufacture of which is described above, can have many different variations. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To make a hat, we need a piece of lace.  Gently glue it to our foamiran base.  And now with a clerical knife we ‚Äã‚Äãcut out the upper patterned edge of the lace.  Glue the edges of the workpiece together. </p><p>  A crown made in this way turns out to be quite voluminous, so it makes no sense to attach it to the rim.  It is better to stick hairpins on both sides.  The preparatory work is over and the most interesting part remains - decoration.  To do this, we need cuts of black and red velvet fabric.  In the center of the crown we make a red cross.  And on top we paste two black velvet ribbons, but narrower than the first time.  It remains only to fix the red fabric at the bottom of the crown, and our headpiece is ready. </p><h2>  Fantasy is the basis of creativity </h2>
      <br>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foamiran crown pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2114847.jpg"></div>  We have described the most common methods for making crowns.  But this does not mean that you should be limited only to them.  Copying someone else‚Äôs work without introducing creativity there is simply not interesting.  Try to diversify the above options by making the crown a ‚Äúskirt‚Äù of tulle or add lace ribbons.  If you make a crown for yourself, and not for your daughter, then you can completely step back from our sample and make a diadem.  Such an ornament looks much more spectacular than the crown.  And most importantly - is more suitable for an adult girl.

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Do not be limited to one crown.  You can build an entire composition on your head.  Use the crown as a center, and plant flowers, plants, insects or animals around it.  If the decoration is made for Halloween, then it can be decorated with skulls or pumpkins. </p>
