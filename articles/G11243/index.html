In Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, there are practically no families that would not have been hurt by the Nazis.  Someone lost their fathers, sons, brothers in the war, someone lost relatives during the bombing, but the worst thing is the Holocaust of children forcibly taken from their parents.  In the period 1933-1945, millions of innocent children of different nationalities and religions suffered.  Few of them managed to survive, the fate of thousands of children in the post-war period was occupied by humanitarian organizations. </p><h2>  Selective extermination of children </h2>

The children of Jews and Gypsies were destroyed in the first place, since they were considered dangerous for Germany.  Physically and mentally disabled children from the occupied territories of the USSR, Poland and Germany itself were also exterminated.  Many families affected the Holocaust of children; both orphans and children who were forcibly taken from their parents fell into concentration camps.  All victims can be divided into several groups:

Holocaust children over 12 years old were used as labor, but the conditions were such that they could not stand it for a long time.  The weak Nazis were sent to gas chambers, shot or simply left to die in agony.  The Holocaust of children has become a shame for the entire nation, the Germans still can not cleanse themselves before the public for those terrible deeds.  The fate of the kids, as a rule, was controlled by the Judenrat, and by his order, the children were deported to <span>death camps.</span>

    <h2>  Surviving children </h2><p>  The fair-haired, blue-eyed guys with fair skin were more fortunate, they were taken away from their parents, but not killed, and sent to foster ‚Äúracially full‚Äù German families, because such an appearance was ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù.  The Holocaust of children did not affect the thousands of little Jews who were deported from Germany and the Nazi-occupied countries by the Kindertransport program.  There were brave people who agreed to hide the unfortunate under their shelter.  Many children found shelter in Belgium, Italy; in France, nuns, <span>Catholic priests, and</span> Protestant families hid them. </p>
