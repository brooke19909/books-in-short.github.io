But since January last year, it was bought by the Cassels Hotels &amp; Resorts chain and conducted a massive renovation.  In this regard, the status of the hotel has increased.  What now pleases the hotel guests "Five Continents"?  This we will find out by studying the many reviews of tourists. </p><p>  To begin with, let's say that the hotel is located on the first line of the Jabel-Ali canal.  Once there stood the Gantut Palace (which is also displayed in the name of the hotel), now abandoned.  The hotel is located on the border between two emirates: Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  It positions itself as a vacation spot for families with children and non-drinkers.  Dubai Airport is a half hour drive away.  The shopping malls "Battuta" and "Emirates" - about twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1111581.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Luxurious old palace </h2><p>  Hotel Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 * was built on the basis of Gantut in 2012.  Hoteliers tried to preserve the appearance of the Arabian palace and the spirit of sophisticated luxury.  Despite the fact that the building is four-story, looking at it, it is impossible to get rid of the feeling of the fairy tale "A Thousand and One Nights."  The name "Gantut" firmly entrenched in this area.  Tourists advise explaining this to taxi drivers exactly where you need to get to, because due to the frequent change of hotel names, even locals don‚Äôt know what ‚ÄúFive Continents‚Äù is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, within walking distance of the hotel is the Expo 2020 Exhibition Hall.  Also nearby is the world-famous Grantut Racing &amp; Polo Club complex.  Many tourists praise the hotel's convenient location.  Living in the "Five Continents", you can save on a taxi.  Indeed, a hundred meters from the hotel there is the Sharaf DG metro station.  And the Mall of the Emirates is only one kilometer from the hotel.  This is a pleasure noted by shoppers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 standard" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1111585.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  As befits palaces from Arabian tales, the guest rooms at Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 * are very spacious.  However, their design and equipment are quite European and modern.  Most rooms have pretty balconies.  In addition to the standard set of services typical of the Quartet in the Emirates, guests note the availability of an iron and ironing board, bathrobes and slippers.  Of cosmetics, every day they give not only soap, shampoo and shower gel, but even a razor, small toothpaste, body lotion.  Sockets in the <span>United Arab Emirates are</span> non-standard, and for a laptop or electric razor you need to take an adapter at the reception.  The code for Wi-Fi is issued there.  Access to free Internet in rooms is limited, but you can use it as much as you like, sitting on a soft sofa in the lobby.  Maids are cleaned up to their conscience, whether you leave them a tip or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 Dubai" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1111582.jpg" width="600"></div>

When it comes to nutrition, you are free to choose only breakfast, half board, Soft all inclusive (three meals) and Super all inclusive.  However, the latter option is not popular among Russian travelers, since alcohol is not poured in the hotel bars. </p><p>  As for breakfast, their tourists rated it a solid five with a plus.  A huge variety of dishes, an abundance of fruits and all kinds of pastries.  For diabetics and other people in need of special nutrition, there is a diet menu.  Reviews mention that all rooms have a coffee maker and hot drink sets.  Products are replenished every day.  A minibar puts a bottle of water per person.  Those who only took breakfast say that there are a lot of cafes near the hotel (praised the Golden Fork restaurant).  You can eat inexpensively in shopping malls.  But many tourists who ordered food "BB", reconsidered their decision and bought additional meals.  It costs (if you buy half board) one hundred dirhams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Five Continents Cassells Beach Resort Ghantoot 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1111583.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pool and beaches </h2><p>  Hotel Five Continents Ghantoot <span>Beach Resort 4 *</span> stands on the banks of a wide (200 meters) canal.  The water there is sea and running, so it‚Äôs quite possible to swim, especially for those who are unsure of themselves, swimmers and those who are afraid of the waves.  The hotel has its own beach, fenced off from other territory by a small grove.  If you want fresh water, you can swim in the pool.  Next to it is a small and small-sized tank for children. </p><p>  Twice a day (at nine and twelve o'clock) the hotel bus takes those who wish to the beach for free.  There are thirty seats in the car, and therefore you need to register for the flight the day before (a piece of paper at the reception).  A bus brings holidaymakers to <span>Jumeirah Beach.</span>  It is paid (five dirhams).  In addition, on Mondays there is Women's Day (only very young boys with mothers are allowed out of the male).  Then the bus brings vacationers to the free Jumeirah Open Beach.  The infrastructure there is more modest, but there is also a shower and toilet.  Rescuers are working. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go for shopping </h2><p>  To make successful purchases is another motive to visit the UAE and stay at the border of the two emirates, in Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 *.  Dubai and Abu Dhabi are approximately equal distances from the hotel.  Therefore, you can safely alternate shopping in two neighboring emirates.  Another bus leaves the hotel daily - not to the beach, but to the shopping malls.  Its schedule is very convenient for tourists.  You can have breakfast, swim in the canal or pool and go shopping.  The bus takes the tourists back at six in the evening. </p><p>  Once a week, the car leaves for Abu Dhabi, to the malls there.  Tourists are advised not to be limited to large shopping centers.  You should definitely visit the Al Karama bazaar (near the metro station of the same name). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Five Continents Ghantoot Beach Resort 4 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1111586.jpg" width="600"></div>
