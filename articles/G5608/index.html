    <p>  Recent fashion trends show that you can knit not only clothes, but also shoes.  For example, you can make booties, knitting needles.  Your child will like them, and you can also make such boots for yourself. </p><h2>  Knitting boots </h2><p>  Preparation for knitting boots does not require large material costs.  You will need yarn and knitting needles matching it by number.  To create boots, you will also need soles that can be taken from your old shoes or boots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="booties knitting needles with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687639.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  A very exciting activity is knitting.  Booties, boots of any color for any time of the year can be created.  Knitted boots come in many forms: openwork summer boots, glamorous style stockings, winter boots, and home boots.  Can be knitted for adults and children.  As a rule, summer openwork boots are crocheted, and winter warmer boots are knitted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting preparation </h2><p>  To start <span>knitting boots,</span> you need to know the foot size of the person to whom you knit.  Any booties, knitted boots, will suit you if you correctly remove the size of the foot and make a pattern on paper.  Knowing the size of the shoes, you can go to the shoe repair shop and purchase the sole there of the size you need.  At the same time, pay attention to the fact that this sole can be easily pierced with an awl, and that insoles can be glued into it. </p><h2>  Yarn for boots </h2><p>  When choosing boots, pay attention to what yarn you will knit.  Very light shades of yarn look elegant, but the boots from it will be easily soiled, and you will often have to wash them.  This can negatively affect their appearance.  In order for your booties, knitting boots to work out well, you first need to calculate the loops to start knitting.  To do this, make a small sample, tie it with the selected pattern, wash and dry.  After that, you can calculate how many loops you should have in a centimeter, and how many you should put on the knitting needles at the beginning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="booties knitting needles master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687662.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <p>  Now you start making boots.  Ready-made boots look good if they are starched.  Booties, boots with knitting needles with a description will turn out better if not only knitting yarn, but also fishing line are used in their manufacture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitted boots with needles for adults, lower part </h2><p>  If you want to knit boots that a person will wear on the street, then, of course, you will need a sole or old shoes. </p><p>  Knitting booties with knitting needles in this case is not difficult, especially if you were knitting before.  Warm boots for adults are created in two parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting booties booties" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687628.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  First, we draw forty loops into two knitting needles and distribute them into four knitting needles.  We knit in a circle to a height of four centimeters, while using a scarf pattern (one row - front loops, one row - wrong).  Then we share our work. </p><p>  We knit a pattern with braids on ten knitting needles or a two-in-two elastic band pattern.  So we knit ten centimeters to a height and close the loops there.  We continue our work on the remaining loops.  It will be approximately 70 loops.  We knit again on four needles with a garter pattern. </p><p>  So we tie about two more centimeters and close the loops.  Then the lower parts of the boot are sewn together and sewn to the sole from under the shoes. </p><h2>  Boot Cuffs </h2><p>  In order to make booties, knitted boots, you will need to create cuffs - the upper part of the boots.  We collect twenty two loops on the usual two knitting needles on the fishing line, and first knit three centimeters of garter stitch <span>,</span> and then gradually add another four loops and go to the ‚Äútwo-two-elastic‚Äù or ‚Äúthree-three‚Äù pattern (which in this case seems more beautiful).  We finish at the height of the cuff thirty-eight centimeters.  Then we sew this part of the boot to the lower part, buttons can be sewn on top of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Knitted boots for children, the beginning of knitting </h2><p>  Very beautiful <span>knitted booties with knitting needles, a</span> master class on which is already in front of you, are quite suitable for young children and adolescents.  These boots can be worn like slippers in the room, can be worn outdoors in the warmer months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted booties" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The child‚Äôs leg is approximately thirteen centimeters in length, and to tie the soles, we take Turkish yarn of the Yarn Art Bulkey type, we gather eight loops and knit a row of facial ones.  In the second, fourth, sixth rows, we uniformly add one loop at the very beginning of the row, then we knit 34 rows.  To create booties, knitted boots, your desire and diligence will be required. </p><p>  After knitting another twenty rows, we begin to gradually close the loops, in order to eventually get eight loops on the edge.  So the soles are obtained.  The edges of the soles can be crocheted. </p><h2>  Boots top </h2><p>  For the top of the boots, we knit forty loops on the knitting needles and distribute them so that the three needles have an equal number of loops, and on the fourth - two or three loops more.  So knitted booties-boots with knitting needles.  You got acquainted with the description of the process.  Now we begin to knit the toe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie booties with knitting needles" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687663.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  In many ways, the process of knitting such booties is similar to knitting a sock.  Therefore, if you are used to knitting socks, then you can easily master the booties.  After all, at first the booties are knitted on five knitting needles in the same way as socks, and then a little differently. </p><p>  For our booties, the toe fits like this: two facial, two wrong, two facial, two wrong, and so fifteen loops.  But on the side you need to knit two loops.  This creates booties with knitting needles, a workshop on which we are currently conducting. </p><p>  We knit a toe to a height of thirteen centimeters according to the drawing and close it.  You can make different patterns - elastic bands, braids, bumps.  Any of these patterns will add elegance to your boots. </p><p>  When the toe is over, we knit ten rows in a ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern.  We also make a number of facial loops and a number of purl loops, close the loops.  Then we sew the top of the boots with the sole, you can still decorate them with beads. </p><h2>  Children's ugg boots </h2><p>  When knitting children's boots, you can combine knitting needles and a hook.  Knitted booties with knitting needles with a description can be easily used using wool yarn, and a little yarn is needed - about a hundred grams. </p><p>  First, we crochet the sole.  You can make a double sole - white and gray.  Crochet we make a chain of 18 air loops and tie it with double crochets.  There are many patterns that will show you how to make an oval with a hook.  A crochet hook will come in handy even if you are learning <span>how to knit booties and boots with knitting needles.</span> </p><p>  Now you need to dial 72 loops for the back arches of loops on the knitting needles.  On knitting needles we knit several rows of facial loops.  Knitted booties with knitting needles work out well if you use 21 colored stitches to define 21 stitches on which the toe will be made. </p><p>  The next row is knitted according to the principle: two loops knit together front, in the end there are 14 loops.  We continue to work until seven loops remain on the knitting needles, add two to them, and you can begin to create the boot tongue.  To do this, you need to knit a fragment with the ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern on the nine loops obtained, that is, when one wrong loop with one front loop alternates, and in the wrong rows the loops are knitted according to the pattern.  And it turns out booties with knitting needles, a master class on which we are conducting. </p><p>  Those loops that remained before knitting the toe are used to create the shafts.  We knit 32 rows with front stitch, make round edges, as a result, we have the bootleg ready.  You can make embroidery on it with threads of different colors.  Embroidery is done using a plastic needle with a thick eye.  You need to have a pattern for embroidery.  The Norwegian pattern will look spectacular.  If you want to make beautiful <span>booties, knitting needles, schemes</span> need to be selected carefully. </p><p>  Do not forget to make laces of different colors, that is, weave white and beige threads. </p><h2>  Summer shoes </h2><p>  Knitted boots can be worn not only in winter but also in summer.  But for the summer you will need to knit them from cotton yarn or from acrylic with the addition of viscose.  You will need to work one hundred and fifty grams of cotton thread, an awl, a crochet hook, scissors, a needle and thread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="booties knitting scheme" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/687667.jpg" width="438"></div>

    <p>  So, if you have old slippers in which you no longer go, then you need to carefully separate the insoles from them.  Then, along the edge of the sole with an awl, we pierce small holes at a distance of 0, 5 centimeters from each other.  We select the appropriate insoles in size and stick them on top of the soles.  If you can‚Äôt do it yourself, then give it to the master in the shoe workshop - he will do it to you. </p><p>  Now we knit the boots themselves.  We crochet thirty air loops (the number varies from size), we knit three centimeters in single crochets, then we knit with an openwork pattern.  The openwork pattern can be any - it can be chains of air loops that alternate with double crochet, can be double crochet. </p><p>  When our boot is ready, we must attach it to the foot.  To do this, you must first attach it with tailor's needles, and then you can already hook it.  Sew the bootleg carefully to the sole, and now you can wear your summer boots. </p>
