    <h2>  Geographic location </h2><p>  Dadonghai Bay is located on the southwestern side of Sanya, which is also very popular among tourists.  Nevertheless, tourists more often choose a bay for recreation, since in cities the prices for accommodation and entertainment are much higher.  The distance from the bay to the city is about three kilometers.  At 15 kilometers from the city of Sanya Phoenix International Airport is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  Getting to the resort from the airport is not at all difficult.  Here, tourists have three options: regular bus, taxi or transfer (if the hotel provides such a service).  Buses run regularly from Dadudhaya to Sanya, so traveling to the city is easy.  And besides, the distance of three kilometers can easily be overcome on foot, admiring the scenic landscapes along the way.  A bus from Sanya to Dadonghai will cost a tourist 1 yuan, and a taxi 10-15 yuan (1 yuan - 8.95 rubles).  Local buses can travel around the entire island. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Since Hainan is the southernmost island of China, it has a tropical climate.  Almost 300 days a year, Dadonghai resort welcomes its guests with warm sea and sunny weather.  Since the island is constantly warm, only two seasons are distinguished here - rainy and dry.  In the period from April to November, heavy rains reign on the island along with intense heat.  At this time, the cost of rest falls. </p><p>  The average annual air temperature in Dadonghai is 24 ¬∞ , and in the South China Sea washing it - 22 ¬∞ .  During the year, a sharp temperature difference does not occur.  However, the island is obviously cooler in winter than in summer, especially in the evening.  In autumn, the island is subject to the influence of typhoons.  Nevertheless, the tourist season lasts all year round. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a concept as a high season in Dadonghai is very arbitrary.  Since weather conditions allow you to comfortably rest here all year round, the influx of tourists usually depends on the holiday dates.  Nevertheless, in the summer, due to showers and heat, the popularity of the resort falls.  Most tourists come here in December and January.  And in September and October, mainly Chinese people rest at the resort.  Swimming on the beaches of Dadonghai Bay is best in November and from March to June. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions of Dadonghai Bay </h2><p>  The bay is located between two mountains: "Turned Deer" and "Tail of the Hare."  Mount Turned Deer is the main attraction of the harbor and a famous natural monument.  Once upon a time, local shamans gathered here to perform their rites.  Today, on the slopes of the mountain there is a beautiful landscape park where you can admire the local beauties, as well as meet monkeys, turtles, deer and other interesting animals. </p><p>  According to ancient legend, once a hunter wanted to catch a golden deer on this mountain.  The pursuit of the beast dragged on for nine days.  In the end, the hunter managed to drive the deer off the coast.  Realizing that there is no way to retreat, turn the deer into a beautiful girl who amazed the hunter with her beauty.  As a result, the couple fell in love with each other, and they lived happily ever after.  This is the most common variant of the origin of the unusual name of the mountain.  There are other versions.  All of them are displayed in numerous souvenirs that are sold in the shops of the bay. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the resort, you can find other attractions: museums, ancient temples (the most famous of them is the Nanshan complex, which is one of the main centers of Buddhism in China), factories (the pearl factory in Sanya is especially popular), nature reserves (including famous park Sanya Meitianya and "Monkey Park"). </p><h2>  Wellness </h2><p>  Hainan Island (China) is a great place not only for relaxation, but also for recreation.  There are several popular centers of traditional medicine in the Dadonghai harbor: the Garden of Longevity, the Taiji Clinic, the Do Wen Tien Medical Center and others. </p>

    <p>  Treatment in local health facilities is carried out in accordance with traditional methods, the effectiveness of which has been confirmed over the centuries.  As a rule, treatment includes: massage, breathing exercises, gymnastics, taking herbal decoctions, acupuncture, reflexology and more.  All these measures can get rid of a large number of diseases against which modern drug medicine is not always effective. </p><h2>  Family resort </h2><p>  In Dadonghai it is convenient to relax with children of different ages - a healing tropical climate, clean sandy beaches, warm sea and fresh exotic fruits will help the baby get a lot of impressions from the trip.  In addition, the resort can find a lot of children's entertainment and playgrounds. </p><h2>  Souvenirs </h2><p>  For those who want to bring something worthwhile to their loved ones from relaxation, there are a huge number of souvenir shops in the Dadonghai resort.  Here are the win-win options for souvenirs from this resort: silk products, tea, handmade souvenirs, pearls, alcohol with a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù in the form of a scorpion or snake, and herbal tinctures. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited Dadonghai Bay (China, Hainan Island), mostly respond positively to rest in this picturesque place.  Among the advantages of the resort are noted: convenient location, modern infrastructure, the availability of comfortable hotels, a variety of restaurants and bars, an abundance of shops and entertainment venues, a beautiful beach.  It is noteworthy that the island will be comfortable both for lovers of outdoor activities (surfing, diving, excursions, etc.), and those who want to soak up the hot sun and visit spa treatments.  Another important advantage of Dadonghai Bay is the price.  Here it‚Äôs quite realistic to relax inexpensively, without limiting yourself greatly.  So, for example, in the same 4-star Linda, the cost of a standard room is only 1900 rubles / day.  Suite with sea view will cost 3100 rubles per day. </p><p>  Of course, the resort also has disadvantages.  The main one is that the sea and the beach are not always clean and not everywhere.  After storms, algae and garbage are washed ashore, and the water remains muddy for some time.  Therefore, it is better to go here in the most favorable season for a beach holiday.  In addition, many experienced tourists note that due to the resort's orientation towards a comfortable beach holiday, the national Chinese flavor is weak.  However, having gone to neighboring settlements, you can fully enjoy it. </p>
