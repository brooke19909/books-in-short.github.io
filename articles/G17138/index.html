    <p>  The phone appeared in 2005 and, according to Western sources, has become one of the best options for its time.  The release of this device allowed the recently appeared elite company to take its place in the market.  Sometimes notes appeared in the press: the quality of the Erickson connection and the camera from Sony.  In fairness, it is worth noting that this was not far from the truth. </p><p>  Sony Ericsson K750i was the first device of that year to have a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus capabilities.  And although many believe that it is impossible to take good photos with the phone‚Äôs camera, the pictures from this device could compete in quality with soap dishes of the same year of release.  The model became a prototype for the W800 version of the same brand, which was distinguished by a different firmware, configuration and appearance. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In a box with a new phone, the user received headphones, a driver disk, a cable for connecting to a computer, a memory card and instructions.  She had Russian and 119 pages of detailed information.  At the same time ‚Äúon board‚Äù: FM with auto search, MP3 player, voice recorder, flashlight, simple browser, Bluetooth and modem.  About the camera has already been said, but you can mention the curtain that hides the lens at normal times.  The curtain, by the way, was not only on the K750, many subsequent models of the brand had lens protection.  At the same time, the flash, whose power is sufficient for use as a flashlight, does not close with it, and the phone‚Äôs firmware allows you to turn on the flash separately from the shooting mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The right side of the top picture shows the shifted curtain.  Takes a picture of the <span>Sony Ericsson K750i</span> without unlocking the keys.  By moving the shutter, the shutter button is activated, as well as several buttons on the keyboard that activate various shooting modes.  The viewfinder is the front display.  Pictures are recommended to be saved on the card - this can be set directly in camera mode. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  There is a minimum of internal memory, so the card is included, by the way.  The main difference between the K750i and W800 was in the scope of this attached card.  Sony Ericsson K750i was positioned as a business device, and it received a flash card in only 64 MB.  The second device comes with 512 MB. </p>

    <p>  Not only the camera can use the card, the player can also see it, it was also possible to record a ringtone for it and a message signal on it.  The player can read flash drive folders, supports playlists.  In addition to those captured by the camera, other pictures can be stored on the card.  <span>File Manager</span> understands audio, video and graphic information.  Based on the almost complete lack of memory as such, the developers took care of the quick transfer of data from the phone to the card and vice versa.  When replacing a memory card with a more capacious user, for all the numerous functions of the phone, he also gets a USB flash drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battery and Charging </h2><p>  The battery for Sony Ericsson K750i is made in a separate unit, which is inserted under the cover located on the back of the phone.  For proper insertion, there are small stops on the side of the contacts, which at the same time serve as guides during installation.  Simka is under it, slightly recessed into the case, and it is impossible to remove it without disconnecting the battery and a sharp object to pry off the edge. </p>

    <p>  If the phone is used only for calls, cameras, radio - the battery capacity may last for a week or more (for comparison: the smartphone needs to be charged 2-3 times a week).  Like other modern devices, charging from a computer is steadily supported, but another problem arises - the PC will not see the phone (and therefore will not charge) until all drivers are installed, which are separately divided into drivers for cable and phone.  Therefore, it is easier to use the Sony Ericsson K750i charger that comes with the kit. </p><p>  In 2005, when this phone came out, there was no unification of charges yet, so charging from another phone is not suitable.  The same applies to other cables - the phone has a non-standard connector, you can only connect a cable that has connectors for devices from SE.  But non-branded cables, which are half cheaper, also work quietly.  The unified SE connector in all models works the same way: ‚Äúears‚Äù on the sides for fixation, and between them there is a set of thin plate-contacts.  Each connected device has plates in its places, and when connected, closes its contacts on the socket.  However, thanks to the company's announcement of a new line, the issue of connecting headphones of other brands was resolved through an adapter. </p>

    <p>  One end has a plug that allows you to plug it into the phone, and the standard 3.5 jack is placed on the other. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  For all its variety of functions, the Sony Ericsson K750i display has only 256 thousand colors and a resolution of 176x220.  The screen itself is under the glass of the case.  Glass does not glare, but on a bright sunny day, the image fades slightly, although it remains visible. </p>

    <p>  The backlight is quite pleasant blue tones, the brightness is selected manually, but, as a rule, the phone out of the box is already configured correctly.  The screen is well lit, visible in the same way as during the day.  Under the keys, the backlight is white, however, the "asterisk" and "pound" remain in the shade. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to many, the Sony Ericsson K750i has become one of the best sellers on the phone market, despite the fact that many years have passed, there are minor flaws with drivers, the set of functions of this device can still be called "All in One". </p>
