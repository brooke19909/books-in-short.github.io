    <p>  The secret of this place‚Äôs popularity lies in a combination of factors such as sophistication, the highest service, a wide range of services and a unique natural climate.  The park in which the hotel building is located is a real attraction of the village.  Exotic plants and unusual statues, which are located throughout the territory, give this resort zone a unique charm.  The combination of needles and eucalyptus makes the air in the hotel complex truly unique in its healing properties.  However, the real pearl of this place is the embankment, which has no equal throughout the southern coast of Crimea.  A bewitching view of the mountains and the sea surface does not leave indifferent any witness to this beauty.  The combination of the sound of the waves and the sounds of the forest is a truly unique natural phenomenon, which is worth hearing at least once in a lifetime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Crimean Breeze Hotel is a Crimean hotel complex that meets the highest requirements.
