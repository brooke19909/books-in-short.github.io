    <h2>  <strong>Blessed by Sergius of Radonezh</strong> </h2><p>  Legends connect the Belopesotsky monastery with the names of Dmitry Donskoy, as well as Sergius of Radonezh.  <span>The principality of Moscow</span> in the 14th century was subjected to raids by the steppe hordes of the Mongol-Tatars.  Donskoy, who had to defend the border of the principality with his army, asked Radonezhsky for his blessing to build a monastery off the banks <span>of the Oka River.</span>  After all, monasteries in those days were also important defensive structures on the borders of the country. </p><p>  Rev. Sergius blessed the creation of the monastery.  According to legend, he used to go through the White Sands (the so-called left bank of the Oka River) from Serpukhov to Kashira, and he really liked this place.  After his blessing, two holy sources appeared there. </p><h2>  <strong>Built by monk Vladimir</strong> </h2><p>  Historical information connects the direct construction of the monastery with the monk Vladimir, in the world Vasily, who was born in Rzhev in a boyar family.  At first he wanted to devote his life to military service, since the political situation at that time in the principality was turbulent.  <span>Feudal wars</span> for land ownership flared up every now and then.  Rzhev also often changed his owners. <br>  Vasily, a long time serving as a soldier in the regiment of guards, then an officer, decided to take <span>monastic tonsure,</span> went to the Novgorod monastery and became known as Vladimir.  However, he did not stay there for long, because he wanted to establish a new monastery for the monks, and set off on wanderings.  They brought him to Kashira. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Traditions say that the left bank of the Oka River opposite Kashira was a secluded place, uninhabited.  Vladimir decided to found a monastery there and built a church.  Soon other monks began to flock to him.  So the Belopesotsky monastery was formed.  In addition, peasants began to settle around the monastic cloister and settle in the surrounding area. </p><h2>  <strong>Enjoyed the favor of the kings</strong> </h2><p>  For the first time this monastery was mentioned in 1498 in such a written source as a letter of merit from the Tatar prince Magmet-Amin.  According to this letter, Moscow Prince Ivan III granted his defeated ally the inheritance of Kashir, and the Belopesotsky monastery received land and forests. </p><p>  Later, more than once, Vladimir Belopesotsky was mentioned in letters of honor, by which he was given repairs and villages in Turov and Rostov volosts.  The last such letter in the name of St. Vladimir was issued in 1522. <br>  In addition, peasant farms, which were formed on the monastery land, were freed by the Moscow prince from duties and all sorts of tributes.  They flourished, and with them monks existed comfortably. </p><p>  True, there is no need to talk about their special wealth, since during the life of Abbot Vladimir there weren‚Äôt even stone buildings in the Belopesotsky monastery, and there were only wooden cells and the old church of the Holy Trinity. <br>  When the Monk Vladimir died, it is not known exactly.  Chronicles only say that "he was 72 years old," and the saint was buried "at the Trinity under the porch." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The monastery as a defensive structure </h2>

    <p>  Privileges and growing wealth soon allowed the monks to begin stone construction.  In 1569, the Trinity Cathedral was founded.  In the 16th century, the main part of the monastery fortifications was erected - the eastern wall and the gateway to St. Nicholas Church, which also served as a watch tower. </p><p>  It also had niches through which special hers lattices were dumped.  A little later, a stone belfry and five loopholes appeared in the monastery, and cannons and squeals were installed on the wall.  So the Holy Trinity Belopesotsky monastery turned into a strong outpost of the state. </p><p>  Tatars from the Crimea attacked the borders of the Moscow principality many times.  And it was the Belopesotsky monastery as a reliable fortress that stood in the way of the enemy.  The population of the surrounding villages during the raids of the Tatars hid behind its walls.  The inhabitants of the monastery and monks had good skills in military affairs.  Therefore, the Tatars did not manage to take the fortress, they could not even break through its walls.  At the end of the 17th century, the Belopesotsky monastery lost its military-strategic purpose, the borders of the Russian Empire moved south. </p><h2>  Continued to be built and restored </h2><p>  Soon the monastery was introduced into the holdings of the Kolomensk Archbishop, then it was assigned to the Trinity Monastery.  On its territory, the St. Sergius Church is being erected.  However, in its original form it has not reached our time.  In the 19th century, due to dilapidation, it was destroyed.  A new temple was built on this site, then two more chapels were added. </p>

    <p>  The church was restored in 1852, and was even re-consecrated.  Undoubtedly, more than once underwent <span>restoration work</span> and the main temple - Trinity Cathedral.  This first happened in the 17th century, then in the 18th.  Restoration in the 19th century was carried out with the money of a peasant M.P. Shcherbakov.  He donated them to frescoes, renovation of the plaster and the construction of the iconostasis. </p><p>  The temple in honor of the <span>beheading of John the Baptist was</span> built under Hieromonk Athanasius (1824-1842) with the money of the Rayevsky nobles Mikhail and Ivan.  All the buildings of the Belopesotsky monastery were severely destroyed in the floods of 1908. The water of the spilled Oka reached almost the level of a stone fence.  In 1914, the monastery buildings were restored. </p><h2>  Monastery today </h2><p>  About what the Belopesotsky Monastery has become today, the official website will tell him in full.  However, it should also be said that under Soviet rule, the monastery buildings were used for other purposes.  There were prisoners, a pioneer camp huddled, artists performed ... </p><p>  In 1989, they decided to create a historical and cultural center on the basis of the monastery.  But did not have time.  In 1992, the monastery was returned to the possession of the Russian Orthodox Church, and on June 18 the first service was held in Sergius Church. </p><p>  At the same time, restoration work took place.  For example, the Trinity Cathedral was restored by the spring of 2002. At present, divine services are held every day at Holy Trinity Belopesotsky Monastery. </p>
