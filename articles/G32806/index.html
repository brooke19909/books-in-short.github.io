    <p>  Example: </p><p>  An employee was sick from April 21, 2016 to September 30, 2016, has sick leave for this period.  Dismissed on October 21, 2016.  There were no working days in the calculation period to determine the average earnings (July, August, September).  According to the rules, average earnings are calculated based on the amount of earnings for the period preceding the working period and equal to the estimated.  In this case, these are three calendar months that preceded the onset of temporary disability: January, February, March. </p><p>  Example: </p><p>  The employee quits on October 24, 2016.  He has been working in the organization since October 01, 2016.  That is, he worked for less than a month.  For a full working month he was set a salary of 28,000 rubles.  The employee worked 17 working days out of 21 according to the plan. </p><p>  The average earnings for reference to the employment center will be: </p><p>  28000: 21 x 17 = 22666.67 rubles. </p><p>  Important: </p><ul><li>  if the dismissal is executed on the last day of the month, then this month can be included in the billing period, but only if the average salary of an employee is higher; </li><li>  if for one month in the calculation period two monthly bonuses are awarded for the same successes (performance indicators), then to calculate the average one needs to take a big bonus; </li><li>  <span data-mce-mark="1">if the employee worked in the organization for a part-time period for which bonuses are accrued, but they were accrued in proportion to the time actually worked, then the amount of the bonus should be fully taken into account when determining the average monthly salary.</span> </li></ul>
