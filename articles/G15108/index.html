    <h2>  Features of rest in August </h2><p>  First of all, when planning a vacation in the last summer month, it should be borne in mind that in most countries this time is at the height of the tourist season, which means a higher cost of trips than in May-June.  However, here you can significantly save money by using the early booking service, which is offered by almost all travel agencies in our country.  So, having bought tickets for August in the spring, you will receive a discount, which sometimes can reach up to 15-20%. </p>

    <h2>  August: where to go to the sea </h2><p>  When planning your vacation in the last month of summer, be sure to keep in mind that in the vast majority of southern countries at this time there is very hot weather.  This is true not only for Turkey and African countries, but also for the south of Europe.  Therefore, if you and your family members do not tolerate the heat well or simply do not like it, but at the same time want to soak up the beach, then opt for directions to the north near the cool <span>seas: Adriatic,</span> Black, Baltic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vacations in August are very popular in countries such as Bulgaria, Montenegro and Croatia.  Many of our compatriots like to spend their holidays here not only due to the excellent climate, clean sea and well-developed infrastructure, but also due to the similarity of languages, which makes it possible to painlessly solve the problem of the language barrier.  Also, countries such as Greece, Turkey, Spain, Italy, France and Egypt enjoy great popularity among Russians and other residents of the CIS.  We offer a more detailed discussion of each of these areas. </p><h2>  Bulgaria </h2><p>  This country is rightly considered a real gem among states offering holidays on the Black Sea coast.  And this is not surprising, because here the mild climate, magnificent nature, rich excursion program and well-developed tourist infrastructure are very harmoniously combined.  <span>Holidays in Bulgaria</span> in August will be at the peak of the tourist season in this country, but you will not regret it for a minute.  After all, this time is the most optimal in order to spend days on end at the magnificent local beaches.  By the way, the local beaches are recognized as environmentally friendly.  A big plus for travelers with young children is the relative proximity of Bulgaria.  So, for example, from Moscow to fly here just a couple of hours.  Also in Bulgaria acclimatization is quite easy and quick, which is also an important factor for families with small children.  Weather in Bulgaria in August, as a rule, does not cause any inconvenience to vacationers.  So, the air temperature this month averages 28-30 degrees Celsius.  Water in the sea warms up to +26 degrees.  It rains quite rarely and, as a rule, is short-lived. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the most popular resorts of this country, they are Riviera, Sunny Day, Golden Sands, Albena, Sunny Beach, Dune and others.  Holidays in Bulgaria in August also provide an opportunity to make a trip to the famous medical resorts located in the mountains.  We are talking about places called Velingrad, Hisar, Sliven and Starozagorsky Baths and others.  Here you will find healing mud baths and a variety of mineral springs. </p>

    <h2>  Spain </h2><p>  If you want to combine a beach holiday in August with a rich excursion and entertainment program, then feel free to go to Spain.  Here you will find a variety of holidays and festivals.  And local sandy beaches are popular with tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  We are also in a hurry to please those who are not only interested in a beach <span>holiday in Spain</span> in August.  During this period, a number of traditional cheerful holidays are held here, a visit to which becomes an unforgettable and vivid memory for tourists.  So, at the very beginning of August, namely from the 2nd to the 4th day, mass festivities dedicated to the feast of St. Roch are held in Tenerife.  By the way, this holy Catholic church is very revered not only in Spain itself, but throughout Europe, since in the 13th century it was engaged in healing people from such a terrible disease as the plague, which tens of thousands of people fell victim to at that time.  Another lavishly celebrated church holiday is St. Augustine's Day, which falls on August 28. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As for the other reasons for fun, there are more than enough of them in Spain.  So, on August 4, you can take part in celebrations on the occasion of Asturias Day, which received autonomy in the 80s of the last century.  This region is definitely worth a visit, because it is famous for its picturesque nature, which has been preserved to this day in its original form. </p><p>  From mid-August to early September, events are held to glorify the time of grape harvest.  For example, if you get to the town of Murcia from August 9 to 18, you will witness a fun and cheerful wine-making festival.  Here you can listen to live Spanish folk songs, taste delicious food and, of course, try local wines.  Another reason for the fun among the Spaniards is the Tomatina festival, held in the small town of Bunyol in the last week of August.  It will also be noisy, a little drunk and very tasty. </p><p>  Another reason to spend your holidays in Spain in August is the season of discounts at this time in the numerous shops of this country.  So, a thing you like can be bought at a price of 30-80% cheaper than in early summer.  Therefore, we can confidently say that Spain in August is a real paradise for shopaholics. </p><p>  As for the weather in the last month of summer, it is quite hot here.  So, in the afternoon the air temperature can reach 35 degrees Celsius.  Water in the sea warms up to +27 degrees. </p><h2>  Turkey: Holidays - August </h2><p>  At the end of summer, quite a lot of our compatriots go to the coast of the Republic of Turkey, which has long been loved by Russians and other CIS residents.  A variety of hotels for every taste and budget, well-developed infrastructure, excellent beaches and a rich excursion program - all this makes Turkey a great place for a summer vacation.  Of course, it is worth noting that rest in August here will be really hot not only at incendiary discos in numerous clubs, but also in the open air.  After all, during the day the temperature here very rarely drops below +32 degrees Celsius.  In this regard, it is recommended, if possible, not to get involved in outdoor excursions at lunchtime, as well as always use means to protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation and wear hats to avoid sunstroke. </p><h2>  Greece </h2>

    <p>  If your vacation falls in August, a vacation at sea will be just great in Greece.  In particular, pay attention to the islands of Corfu and Rhodes, famous for their magnificent and well-equipped beaches.  You will have a wonderful time at other Greek resorts such as Crete, Athens, Halkidiki, Kos, etc. Arriving for a vacation in this country, you can not only enjoy the picturesque nature, enjoy plenty of fun in the clear sea and sunbathe on the luxurious beaches, but also to touch the historical sights that have come down to our days since ancient times.  As for the weather in Greece in the last month of summer, it is undeniably hot here.  However, the big plus is the lack of high humidity, which makes it easier to tolerate high temperatures, reaching 32 degrees Celsius.  Water warms up to +25 degrees.  Fresh sea wind also helps to tolerate heat. </p><h2>  Egypt </h2><p>  If you like the warm sea and tolerate the heat normally, then for you a great place to vacation in the last month of summer will be the country of the great pyramids.  It is in connection with high temperatures that Egypt is not so popular in August.  However, this is only a plus, because at this time in hotels and on the beaches it is not so crowded, and the cost of trips is slightly lower. </p><p>  Water in the Red Sea in August warms up to +28 ... + 29 degrees!  So, when you go swimming, you will not have the slightest desire to go ashore.  This time is great for diving, and just to watch the life of underwater inhabitants.  After all, only a mask is enough to admire the mass of colorful colorful fish scurrying between corals near the coast. </p><p>  However, if you plan to diversify your beach vacation by visiting the world famous attractions of Egypt - the pyramids, Luxor and others, then in this case it is better to postpone the vacation for a couple of months.  Indeed, high temperatures in August can be relatively easily tolerated only on the coast.  In the depths of the country is sweltering heat. </p>
