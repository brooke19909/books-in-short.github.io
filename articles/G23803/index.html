They are used as decorative pillows for decorating the interior, as well as one of the educational games for children.  From letters you can make a name, surname or soft initials.  This decor is new to the Russian consumer, so many online stores want to cash in on our compatriots.  But is it worth it to pay money for what you can do yourself?  In this article we will tell you how to make letters from felt, the pattern of which will be attached below. </p><h2>  Selection of analogues </h2><p>  To make letters from felt with your own hands, you need to look at the analogues of the work and be inspired by the finished products of the masters.  It is from the borrowing of other people's ideas and combining them with their own plan that the author's product is obtained.  Do not blindly copy samples of letters that you like.  Think about how you can make a product more attractive in design or more functional.  You may need to remove some sharp corners, and the shape of the letter will turn out to be more ergonomic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew letters from felt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1915617.jpg" width="500"></div>  For inspiration, you can look not only at letters from felt, patterns of which are available on the network, you can use just a beautiful font.  There are many examples of such fonts on design sites in the font composition section.  From there you can take not only the ideas of the original styles, but also the whole composition of future letters.

Have you already found samples of beautiful letters from felt?  Pattern them do not need to be done right away.  First you need to think about which word or font composition the letters will be smoothed out.  Perhaps this will be the name of a loved one, child or friend, or maybe it will be some abstract beautiful word, for example, "Love".  Having decided on the word, you need to decide on the font.  Felt is a fairly dense material, and making thin lines from it is almost impossible.  Therefore, you immediately need to choose a pattern with thick lines and without curls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY felt letters" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1915618.jpg" width="464"></div>  If you make pillow letters, they should be at least 25-30 cm in length.  Otherwise, lying on them will be uncomfortable.  If it will be a decorative composition, you need to determine the size, which will depend on the location of the products.  It is necessary to measure the size of the chest of drawers or shelves, so that later you can easily arrange the finished letters from felt on them.

    <h2>  Draw a pattern </h2><p>  Choosing the right font, you can start making letters from felt.  The pattern is very simple: the word is printed with the font that you liked.  Each letter is cut out along the contour.  Here is the pattern and ready.  Now you need to transfer the drawing to felt.  This material has two sides - the front, but do not rejoice that now you do not have to mirror the details.  This is necessary because the wrong side of us automatically becomes the one on which we circled the printed pattern.  By the way, it is best to circle a water-soluble marker or a piece of sharpened soap.  It is not worth drawing with a pencil, because it is then difficult to remove it from the fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After all the letters are circled, we begin to cut in the circled form, retreating 1-1.5 cm from each side to the binder. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="letters from felt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1915619.jpg" width="458"></div>  Having cut out all the letters, you need to prepare parts that will add thickness to the product.  This is done simply: the width of the future product is planned, for example, 7 cm. So we need to cut a long strip 9 cm wide (2 cm will go to the seams).  This ‚Äúthickness‚Äù needs to be cut out for all letters.

    <h2>  We sew letters </h2><p>  Sewing letters from felt with your own hands is simple, you do not even need a sewing machine for this.  We take one of the details of the letter and the part of "thickness" and sew them with a seam "over the edge".  Having completed the entire letter, we proceed to sewing the other side.  The main thing is not to forget to turn the product in and out and fill the product with filler, because it will not work at the end of the work.  You can stuff the product with a synthetic winterizer or holofiber (tightly twisted balls).  You can also use cotton wool or unnecessary scraps of fabric. </p><p>  After the product is sewn, turned and stuffed, you need to sew up the last hole that remains after stuffing the last segment.  The pillow toy is ready! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="letters from felt pattern" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1915620.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How to <span>sew letters from felt that</span> have no extra thickness?  Here everything is a little more complicated: you need to stitch two parts of the product according to the algorithm given above, turn it out and fill the product.  The complexity of this method lies in the fact that you need to think in advance in what sequence to sew the product, otherwise you cannot turn out some letters (for example, ‚ÄúA‚Äù). </p>
