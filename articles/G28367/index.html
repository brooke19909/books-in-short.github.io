    <h2>  What is in the box? </h2><p>  Impeccable equipment cannot stand out from the competition of Nokia 225.  In this regard, reviews highlight a MicroSD card (it simply is not included) and a stereo headset (there is no call accept button on it).  The rest of the package is quite familiar for a device of this class.  The boxed version of this device includes: </p><ul><li>  The mobile phone itself. </li><li>  Interface cord for charging the battery and connecting to a computer. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Battery with a nominal capacity of 1200 mA / h. </li><li>  User manual, at the end of which there is also a <span>warranty card.</span> </li><li>  Certificate of conformity. </li><li>  <span>Acoustic system</span> entry level. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone nokia 225 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/630884.jpg" width="202"></div></li></ul><h2>  Hardware resources of the device </h2><p>  Enough "closed" in terms of hardware platform turned out "Nokia 225 DS".  Reviews indicate that it is impossible to determine the type of processor installed in this device.  The embedded resources of the operating system do not have this capability, and additional application software cannot be installed.  But as for the graphics accelerator, we can confidently say that it simply does not exist in this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Graphics and Camera </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of this mobile phone is the display.  We are talking about a screen with an impressive diagonal (as for this class of device) of 2.8 inches.  In this parameter, he has no competitors.  Its resolution is 320 dots in height and 240 dots in width.  This combination of diagonal and resolution eliminates the graininess of the image on the display. </p><p>  The matrix of the screen is based on outdated LCD technology.  But you can‚Äôt expect more from an entry-level gadget: manufacturers seek to save on each component.  Although the <span>type of matrix</span> in this device is a bit outdated, but still the viewing angles are not bad, the color reproduction is impeccable and does not cause any complaints. </p><p>  But with the camera in this device, not everything is as rosy as with the display.  It is based on a 2 megapixel matrix.  There are no additional options (for example, LED backlight, autofocus and image stabilization system) for the camera at Nokia 225.  Photos, reviews indicate this, are very mediocre with her help.  The situation with the video is even worse.  The clips are recorded at a resolution of 320 pixels in height and 240 pixels in width with a refresh rate of only 30 frames per second.  The image is completely poor quality, blurry.  As a result, there is a camera in the phone, but its capabilities cause a lot of complaints. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Very little integrated memory in Nokia 225.  The characteristic, reviews of which cause a lot of controversy among specialists and owners, is the volume of the internal drive.  In reality, these are a few kilobytes, which provide the lowest possible level of functioning of the device.  How many of them in reality is hard to say.  The Finnish manufacturer himself is delicately silent about this, but it is impossible to determine it in any other way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As noted earlier, internal OS tools are not enough to solve this problem, but external <span>application software</span> cannot be installed on it.  But in order to fully reveal the potential of this device, you need to install a microSD standard memory card in it.  The maximum amount of external storage can be 32 GB.  This is enough for photos, music, and the Internet.  The only remark is that you will have to buy a memory card separately for an additional fee. </p>

    <h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  But the design and ergonomics distinguish the Nokia 225 phone from similar devices.  Feedback from satisfied owners is another confirmation of this.  The dimensions of the case are: 124 mm in length and 55.5 mm in width.  But his thickness is 10.4 mm and weight is 100 grams. </p><p>  Five color options are available at once: yellow, black, red, green and white.  The material from which it is made is a fairly good plastic with a matte finish.  At the same time, as with most similar devices, the case is not opened with paint, but made of plastic of this color.  That is, over time, even if it is scratched, the color will completely and completely retain its color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Two wired connectors (MicroUSB and 3.5 mm AudioJack) and a flashlight are displayed on the top edge of the phone.  All other faces were left without any controls or connections.  The buttons, like the display, on this large mobile phone and it‚Äôs a pleasure to operate it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  An ambiguous situation is obtained with the autonomy of Nokia 225 DUAL SIM.  Reviews indicate that one battery charge lasts for 2-3 days at a nominal capacity of 1200 mA / h.  This is very small.  The point here is not that the quality of the BL-4UL battery has changed for the worse, but in the hardware specifications of the gadget.  The diagonal of the display is 2.8 inches and the device is equipped immediately with 2 slots for SIM cards - these are the moments that reduce battery life. </p><p>  Another feature of this phone is that it uses a microUSB format connector for charging, rather than the familiar ‚Äúround pin‚Äù.  A similar design solution has long been asking for this entry-level phones from this Finnish manufacturer, but only now they have implemented it.  But most of the competitors have long switched to the standard MicroUSB format connector.  The capacity of the complete charger is 750 mA / h.  If you divide 1200mA / h by 750mA / h, it turns out that it takes only 1.6 hours to fully <span>charge the battery</span> in this case. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Another weakness is the Nokia 225 system software.  Reviews in this regard mercilessly criticize this device.  In this case, we are talking about the Series 30+ platform from Nokia.  Some additional Java-based software cannot be installed on this device.  He simply does not support him.  Therefore, you will have to do with what is available. </p>

    <p>  There is a familiar browser from Nokia.  In addition to visiting online resources, it also allows you to communicate on social networks.  A similar situation with toys.  To increase their number will not work due to the installation of additional Java-applications.  In general, the decision of the Finnish developers is not entirely unambiguous.  It seems like a good phone, but expanding its functionality by installing additional application software is impossible.  And by this indicator, it loses significantly to both its Chinese counterparts and entry-level smartphones.  At the same time, the price of the former is much lower, and that of the latter, functionality is much better. </p><h2>  Data Interfaces </h2><p>  Taking into account all the previously stated technical parameters, a fairly balanced set of interfaces for Nokia 225 DUAL SIM.  Reviews only confirm this.  And the list of interfaces in this case is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Full support for 2nd generation mobile networks of the GSM standard.  Maximum <span>data transfer rate</span> up to 500 kBit / s.  The device has 2 SIM card slots at once.  They work in alternate switching mode. </li><li><p>  To connect to a PC, the MicroUSB port is used.  Included is the necessary cable.  But you cannot get full access to the software of the device using the PC Suite utility.  The software component does not allow this.  The only possible one in this case <br>  mode of operation - like a flash drive. </p></li><li><p>  3.5 mm Audio Jack allows you to connect your phone to external speakers.  High-quality sound can not boast of complete stereo.  how <br>  result, music lovers will have to buy quality headphones separately. </p></li><li><p>  There is also a Bluetooth.  It is perfect for those cases when you need to transfer files with a small amount of information to a similar device. </p></li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now about the practical experience of using this device.  The advantages in this regard are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Big buttons. </li><li>  An impressive display diagonal. </li><li>  The ability to work on the Internet. </li><li>  The presence of 2 slots for SIM cards. </li><li>  A good set of interfaces for transmitting information. </li><li>  Quality housing. </li></ul><p>  But he has the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Closed software part. </li><li>  Short battery life. </li><li>  Slightly overpriced. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Nokia 225 phone turned out to be a fairly good budget-level device.  Reviews of real owners only confirm this.  But he won‚Äôt get wide popularity.  The main problem in this case is the ratio of functionality and price.  The cost of the device at the moment is $ 50.  For the same money, you can buy a more functional Chinese-made smartphone.  If we compare this device with "grandmothers", then the Chinese counterparts are much cheaper with less functionality.  But for this category of buyers, the low cost of the device is important.  As a result, the only niche in which this phone will succeed is the true fans of this Finnish brand.  It is on them that this gadget is oriented. </p>
