Even Italians themselves often visit this resort.  To be fully prepared for the trip, travelers should read this material.  We will provide basic information about the town, as well as reviews from people who have already visited it. </p><h2>  Total information </h2><p>  Holidays in Rimini are popular because it is a resort town with a fifteen-kilometer beach area and a variety of attractions.  Every year, travelers from all over the world come here to have fun. </p><p>  It is located on the east coast and is one of the most popular places in the Adriatic.  The settlement was founded by the Romans back in 268 BC.  Now you can fly here by plane or get on land by means of transport with transfers. </p><p>  There are no problems with moving around the resort.  You can use buses and trams for up to two euros or rent a car directly at the hotel.  An alternative is to call a taxi, but you will have to pay 15 to 20 currency units for the trip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.morewallpapers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in rimini" class="if uuid-2367312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367312.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches near the city </h2><p>  Holidays in Rimini mean a long enjoyment of the excellent climate and sunny weather on the beach.  The advantage of the resort is that you can relax equally well on the entire coastline.  It is divided into certain sections, which are separate beaches.  Their total number is 150 and only two - under numbers 1 and 100 - are free.  On them, sand and water are not as clean as in paid places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Payment is made for a sunbed with an umbrella, and you can simply go in for a swim without making the necessary amount at the entrance.  If you take the complete set, the price will be 16 euros, and a set of two positions can be taken only four units more expensive.  The locker room key is also included. </p><p>  The employees control the free use of the beach, and therefore it is not possible to relax with your towel here.  The infrastructure on the coastal strip is well developed.  You can come here with children, because the sea near the beach is shallow and they can have fun with water. </p><p>  In Rimini, often on the beach you can see water rides and all kinds of slides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hotelsclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach area in Rimini" class="if uuid-2367316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367316.jpg"></div><h2>  Residences and Shopping </h2><p>  Despite the fact that holidays in Rimini are quite popular, the hotel business is not developed to the highest possible level.  There will be no problems with housing, but there are not so many luxurious rooms. </p><p>  The main mass here are guest houses, apartments and hotels up to three stars.  The price for double rooms starts at twenty euros.  In places a class above, this amount doubles.  For the best rooms in hotels from one to three stars they will ask for about two hundred euros, in ‚Äúfours‚Äù with ‚Äúfives‚Äù the cost can reach up to 500. The infrastructure does not shine with chic places for tourists, but finding the best hotels for holidays in Rimini with children does not hitters can be easily found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, this resort town is famous for the fact that here come shopping lovers from all over the country.  A large number of stores with branded items at affordable prices are open most of the day.  The most popular sales centers are located in the center of the resort.  Here you can meet people who live shopping and run with large packages from one place to another. </p><h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Holidays in Rimini in Italy, as in any other place, will be incomplete if a person does not taste the delights of local cuisine.  The resort is part of the Emilia-Romagna region, which has the glory of the country's gastronomic center.  It is here that different varieties of Parmesan, Parma ham, Bologna sausages and a variety of sauces are produced.  This feature was reflected in the kitchen of local catering establishments.  There is a pasta factory in the area around Rimini.  Because of this, in the menu of every cafe or restaurant you can order this dish of all kinds with any sauce. </p><p>  Lunch, on average, will take 12 euros, and if you take a comprehensive set, then 18. This also includes a portion of wine in volume 0.25 liters.  For lovers of a snack on the go, the doors of local fast food restaurants are open.  Here you can eat pizza, pita bread with toppings, paninos and other dishes. </p><p>  Restaurants can be divided into a separate category.  They are open to people who are willing to give 150-200 euros for dinner.  The cuisine here is the most diverse, there are even Russian, Indian and Japanese dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.riviera.rimini.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Rimini" class="if uuid-2367317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367317.jpg"></div><h2>  Start sightseeing </h2><p>  In Rimini, spending your holidays with children is a great place for sightseeing.  Their number is not so large, but several places are simply a must. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first of these is the Tiberius Bridge, which was nicknamed the Devil for its incredible strength.  The construction was erected in 14 BC, and, according to legend, the lord of darkness himself helped people to create it.  The true reason for its strength lies in the excellent wooden piles and a mixture of volcanic ash, which replaced concrete. </p><p>  The arch of the emperor Augustus can compete with this attraction in popularity and prescription.  It was built about two thousand years ago.  An older arch cannot be found in all of Italy with its rich history.  Near the building, tourist life is always in full swing because of its beauty.  Once it was part of the city wall with a gate.  Now in this place travelers are invited to plunge into the era of Roman conquests and world fame of the once powerful empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zainoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Italy - Rimini" class="if uuid-2367321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367321.jpg"></div><h2>  Two historical places </h2><p>  Photos from a vacation in Rimini can replenish the collection of any traveler, if you visit the main attractions in the city.  The Malatesta Temple is one of them, because it was erected in the XII century.  Its design is exemplary in the style of Franciscan Gothic.  Travelers can see the building in an already redesigned form as conceived by the greatest Italian master Leon Alberti.  Not all decisions of the architect were implemented, but even without this, the architectural monument looks attractive. </p><p>  Inside, you can see unique works, among which the ‚ÄúCrucifixion‚Äù from Giotto himself.  From here you can go to the main square of the city - Cavour and spend a lot of time there inspecting the surrounding places.  Particular attention should be paid to a fountain of three rings called Pigna, which during the Roman Empire was the only source of drinking water in the area. </p><p>  Only on this square you can see the old trading counters, built of stone and many other attractive buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hotelsclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rimini holidays with children" class="if uuid-2367324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367324.jpg"></div><h2>  Different exhibitions </h2><p>  If you come to Rimini, you can take a unique opportunity to see all of Italy in miniature form.  To do this, just visit the special theme park.  It is called "Italy in Miniature" and demonstrates 270 architectural structures with an approximate location on the peninsula.  All of them have historical significance and attract tourists from all over the world to view.  Copies are made with special attention to details and exactly 25 times smaller than the original structures. </p><p>  The park is already ending its fifth decade, and it is an interesting alternative for those who cannot afford a full trip around the country.  Another famous venue is the exhibition center called Rimini Fiera.  It is famous for the fact that business meetings are held here for entrepreneurs who wish to invest money in the tourism business or other industries in the resort.  Tourists are advised to immediately go to the market sector of the building, which presents a variety of useful things for relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rimini Vacation Reviews" class="if uuid-2367327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367327.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews from tourists </h2><p>  There are plenty of positive reviews about the rest in Rimini from tourists to visit this town at least once.  Many people enjoy the relaxed atmosphere that distinguishes the resort.  There are a lot of beaches here, employees are trying to follow them, even if they do not succeed in lying on their towels, as mentioned above. </p><p>  Restaurant prices are affordable compared to other places in the country.  For tourists from Eastern Europe, the entourage and design of various institutions will be close. </p><p>  A positive point in reviews of holidays with children in Rimini is the depth of the Adriatic Sea.  In some places it is so small that you can not be afraid for the safety of the child in the water.  This is especially true of the coastal strip. </p><p>  An important point is that the city has sights, the inspection of which will fill the rest with vivid impressions.  The ancient age of the city, amounting to more than two thousand years, is felt near the buildings preserved from those times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.descoperalocuri.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Rimini" class="if uuid-2367329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2367329.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative from visitors to the resort </h2><p>  Negative reviews about the rest of tourists in Rimini are also recorded, although there are fewer than positive comments.  Tourists note that in the city and on the beaches it is too dirty.  The number of people in the season is simply huge, and because of this, discomfort is felt. </p><p>  Sightseeing is beautiful, but on the bridge of Tiberius ugly traffic and calm only in the morning or late in the evening.  The local cuisine is not to everyone's taste.  Food in hotels is recommended not to order, because the dishes are monotonous and not too tasty.  Even poisonings happened after visiting catering establishments. </p><p>  Many also mentioned that there are problems with finding supermarkets, and for this you have to ride around the resort.  Service in hotels and residences of up to three stars is also not happy.  Old air conditioners or poor quality maintenance may get caught. </p>
