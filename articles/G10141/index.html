Despite their long history, vests do not go out of style, slightly changing styles, modifying, they, subject to the requirements of fashion, complement a strict business suit or casual sports ensemble, and in combination with a warm knitted sweater or jacket can be a great alternative to an autumn coat or jacket .  Recently, fur vests have become very fashionable, warm, elegant and beautiful, which, without changing their versatility, act as part of an evening ensemble and as outerwear for the street. </p><p>  How to sew a vest made of fur?  Despite the apparent difficulty, this is quite simple.  Natural or artificial fur well hides all the bumps and "flaws" in the work of inexperienced tailors, in addition, it does not require a complex cut.  A fur vest can be of the simplest style, because all the beauty of a product lies in the exquisite pile structure of the material from which it is made.  So, how to sew a <span>vest from fur</span> yourself?  It‚Äôs better to start with artificial material, especially since now artificial fur is not inferior to natural in beauty and sophistication. </p><p>  1. First, select the appropriate style and make a pattern of parts from paper.  As already emphasized, the style of the fur vest should be the simplest.  As a rule, a pattern consists of two shelves, which are cut out in a mirror position, and a back.  You can even abandon the clasp and use a wide leather belt to secure the vest at the waist. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Now proceed to the cutting.  We put the fur on a hard flat surface, face down, and on the wrong side, always indicate the direction of the pile with the arrow.  We lay out the details of the pattern so that the pile on them goes in the direction from top to bottom.  We cut out the back and shelves with small allowances for the seams and hem of the bottom.  Never cut parts with scissors.  For cutting use a razor or a very sharp thin knife.  Fur fabric is cut very carefully from the inside, trying to capture only the fabric base with a razor and not damage the pile.  The same parts are cut out of the lining fabric. </p><p>  3. In order to sew a fur vest on a typewriter, first carefully fold the parts with their faces inward, combining the slices and tucking all the knocked-out villi inward, then chop them together with tailor pins so that they do not move during operation.  Now we sew the largest stitches on a typewriter along the side and shoulder sections, retreating to the width of the allowance.  With a thick needle, we even out the pile that got into the line, pulling it on the face.  We bend the binder of the lower cut and sweep.  Then we grind the lining details and hem the lining from the bottom. </p><p>  4. How to sew a lined vest?  We sew the sewn-in lining details with the wrong side up on the front side of the fur base and sweep out all the outer cuts and cuts of the armholes without affecting the bottom of the product, then lay the machine line.  After that, the pile in the seams is carefully straightened, we turn the resulting product on hand.  At the bottom, we carefully sew the lining to the hem of the <span>fur vest by</span> hand, without pulling it and making sure that it does not pull off the fur.  In the same way, you can sew a vest made of natural fur, for example, using an old fur coat. </p><p>  To master tailoring skills, you can use a woolen or silk shawl.  How to sew a vest from scarves?  To work, you will need two colorful scarves 60 or 70 cm in size. From one scarf we make the back of the vest, from the other - two shelves.  Still need <span>lining fabric</span> and thin dubbing.  In the center of the headscarf, we outline the back detail on the pattern, so that the side and top rims are cut off, and the bottom remains.  We cut out two shelves from another scarf, spreading the patterns so that the border runs along the bottom and along the front sections of the parts.  Armholes can be designated, but can be left straight.  Mark the neckline not too deep and mow the shoulder sections.  Cut out similar parts from the lining.  With dyes from dubbing, lay the neckline, armholes and front parts of the shelves.  From the border remaining when cutting the back, cut two parts for the edging of the shelves.  Sweep the parts, then sew on a typewriter, frame the shelves with edging and sew on the lining.  On the belt of such a vest, you can lay a drawstring and insert into it a belt of plain fabric, suitable in color. </p>
