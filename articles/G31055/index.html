    <p>  So, according to the ancient Greek myth, the Boeotian river god Kefis and the nymph Lyriopa were the parents of a very beautiful young man named Narcissus.  Many nymphs and ordinary girls fell in love with him, but he did not reciprocate.  And once the goddess Aphrodite was angry with Narcissus for rejecting all her gifts, and punished him, condemning him to unrequited love.  Cara overtook the young man near the stream, over which he bent to drink water.  At this moment, he saw his reflection and fell in love with him.  The feeling of Narcissus was so strong that he could no longer tear himself away from his reflection and remained forever at the stream, turning after death into a flower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That is why for the ancient Greeks, the daffodil is a symbol of narcissism, deceived hopes and selfishness.  But many other peoples associate this flower with positive events.  So, for the ancient Romans, he was a <span>symbol of victory: a</span> wreath of daffodils met the victorious warriors.  In Persia, this flower symbolized youth.  And in Switzerland, even annually a celebration is held in honor of the daffodils. </p><h2>  Tools and materials for making daffodil </h2><p>  To begin work on the creation of daffodils should be with the collection of necessary materials and tools.  You will need corrugated paper in three colors - white, yellow and green.  To create a flower stem, you will need cocktail tubes, long wooden skewers or wire, as well as a green <span>floral ribbon.</span>  She will also need scissors, glue and a vase, a pot or basket to form a composition after daffodils from corrugated paper are ready.  With your own hands, you also need to prepare templates for the petals and leaves of the flower, for which you should use cardboard and a simple pencil.  In addition to all of the above, you will need to prepare small sweets if you are going to make daffodils from corrugated paper and sweets.  A master class on their manufacture will also be present in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Making a white daffodil flower </h2><p>  The manufacture of a white daffodil must begin with its middle.  To do this, it is necessary to cut a trapezoid 2-3 cm high and a base 5-6 cm from yellow corrugated paper. Next, using scissors, the basis of the resulting trapezoid must be made wavy.  Then the figure should be turned down with the even side and twisted into a cylinder, glued along the edge.  After the glue dries, you need to stretch the corrugated edge of the cylinder with your fingers a little.  Such middles will need to be made as many as there will be flowers.  It is from this part that you should start making daffodils from corrugated paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With your own hands, you will need to cut 5-7 petals from white paper according to a previously prepared template, the middle of which you need to slightly stretch with your fingertips, giving them a convex shape.  It is necessary to collect the daffodil already on the stem made in advance.  To do this, a middle is fixed on it, around which the petals are glued.  Here is a white daffodil flower and ready! </p>

    <h2>  Making a Yellow Daffodil Flower: Master Class </h2><p>  <span>Yellow flowers</span> are no less beautiful, and maybe more, besides they bloom much earlier than white.  So why not make such daffodils out of corrugated paper?  As you know, a yellow flower has a more magnificent center than a white one, so its manufacture will be slightly different from that described previously, although the general principles will remain the same.  A trapezoid cut out of yellow corrugated paper should be taller and longer, because, as I recall, yellow daffodils are looking at us from beneath a large bell.  From corrugated paper, you also need to make antennae, which is inside the middle of the flower.  To do this, a small rectangle of a lower height than the height of the trapezoid must be folded into a tube and glued, and when the glue dries, make five small cuts on the cylinder and wrap them on the outside.  Around these "antennae" it is necessary to fix the bell, and then the petals, cut according to the pattern of yellow paper.  Assembling a yellow flower, with the exception of the middle, is similar to white. </p>

    <h2>  Making leaves and stem </h2><p>  To make a stem, you need to wrap a cocktail tube, wire or wooden skewer along the entire length with a green floral ribbon or with a thin strip of green corrugated paper, which you had to prepare before you started making daffodils from corrugated paper.  The master class also assumes the presence of leaflets in flowers that need to be cut according to the previously prepared template and attached with glue to the stem. </p><p>  It is worth noting that when using a cocktail tube, its upper part needs to be slightly incised, and when the flower is ready, bend the stem at the bend of the straw.  So daffodils from corrugated paper will look more natural. </p>

    <h2>  Corrugated paper and candy daffodils </h2><p>  If you make daffodils from corrugated paper with sweets, they can become not only a wonderful decoration element in the interior of any room, but also a very tasty gift.  To make such <span>an unusual flower,</span> candy must be wrapped in yellow paper or golden foil in advance.  Next, the workpiece should be attached to the stem, and around it, as described above, to make the middle of the flower.  After that, in a circle, fix the white or yellow petals.  Believe me, you don‚Äôt need too much effort to make daffodils from corrugated paper and sweets.  The master class presented in this article is beyond the reach of even beginners in this matter. </p>

    <h2>  Formation of the composition </h2><p>  After all the flowers are ready, you can proceed to the formation of the composition.  If you plan to place daffodils in a tall vase, then nothing special is needed.  If desired, it will be possible to diversify the bouquet with other flowers, bows or ribbons.  If you chose a flowerpot or a basket for decoration of the composition, then it will be a little more difficult to place daffodils from corrugated paper in them.  With your own hands, the master class invites you to make a flat circle from foam plastic 5-8 cm high, and with a diameter slightly smaller than the container where the flowers will be placed, and stick it to the bottom.  It is in this polystyrene that you can stick ready-made flowers.  Thanks to such a small trick, the composition will look neater and more beautiful. </p>
