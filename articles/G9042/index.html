    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Resort Hotel <span>Coral Hills Resort Sharm El-Sheikh 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh)</span> is located on the highest point of the city - Um El Sid Hill - directly above the sheer and picturesque cliffs.  Also, after making a 20-minute journey by taxi or bus, you can find yourself in Naama Bay, famous among travelers.  The road from the airport to the hotel will seem to you quick and easy, because it takes only 20 minutes of your time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service Rating </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of the quality of service at the Coral Hills Resort <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh).</span>  The rating of services, based on the opinions and surveys of travelers, allows you to create the most objective and complete picture regarding this issue. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Category</em> </td><td>  <em>Score (out of 5 possible)</em> </td><td>  <em>A comment</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Infrastructure facilities </td><td>  4.0 </td><td>  Particularly highly appreciated was the work of the security service, as well as the beauty and well-being of the surrounding area.  Speaking about the flaws, it is worth noting the sphere of catering, namely, restaurants and bars. </td></tr><tr><td>  Quality of service </td><td>  3.1 </td><td>  Such a low rating is due to the insufficient level of staff training, as well as dissatisfaction with the work of some hotel services.  So, the greatest number of complaints is reception.  Also an unpleasant moment is the manner in which workers communicate with vacationers.  The terrible quality of the Internet is noted. </td></tr><tr><td>  Accommodation </td><td>  4.0 </td><td>  The microclimate in the room was rated above all, due to the good quality of the air conditioning equipment and the proper operation of the ventilation system.  In all, with regard to furniture and the state of plumbing, reviews were not the best.  You can not appreciate the quality of cleaning in the rooms. </td></tr><tr><td>  Private beach </td><td>  3.4 </td><td>  The beach can be considered one of the main shortcomings of the hotel.  There is no basic infrastructure, as well as too inconvenient and unsafe entry into the water.  Hotel staff should also pay more attention to cleanliness on the coast. </td></tr><tr><td>  Children's holiday </td><td>  2.2 </td><td>  Such a low rating makes the hotel almost unsuitable for families with small children.  Here, poorly thought out children's animation, as well as virtually no corresponding infrastructure.  The greatest number of complaints is caused by the nutrition of babies. </td></tr><tr><td>  Dislocation </td><td>  3.5 </td><td><p>  The hotel is located somewhat remotely from the urban and entertainment infrastructure.  An inconvenient path to the sea is also noted. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Coral Hills Resort 4 * (Egypt, Sharm-El-Sheikh) presents 156 guest rooms to the attention of tourists, two thirds of which can be attributed to the standard category.  This is just a small bedroom with a king size bed or two single beds.  If we talk about family rooms, they are somewhat more spacious and consist of two rooms.  2 bedrooms are connected by a door. </p><h2>  What is provided in the rooms </h2><p>  In all apartments of the hotel you can take advantage of the following amenities: </p>
