He won the audience‚Äôs love thanks to the cult series ‚ÄúThen Bronson Came‚Äù, in which he played the leading role and the title song Long Lonesome Highway for a long time in the ranking of the most popular.  Despite public acclaim, Michael Parks was put on the Hollywood blacklist because of his political beliefs and harsh remarks.  For several years, he disappeared from the big screen.  The role of the dashing Texas ranger in Quentin Tarantino's film "From Dusk Till Dawn" became a new round in Parks' acting career and brought him worldwide fame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michael Parks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1494925.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Youth </h2><p>  <span>Michael Parks</span> (Harry Samuel Parks) was born in the city of Crown, California on April 24, 1940 in a large family.  His father, who worked as a truck driver, was the only breadwinner in the family.  Therefore, starting in adolescence, Parks traveled around the country, earning money wherever he had to.  Such a life made the young man grow up early.  At the age of fifteen, he even got married, but the marriage did not last long.  During his wanderings, Michael Parks joined the amateur theater and toured California with him.  In 1960, at one of the performances, a young talent was noticed by a CBS agent, who was looking for young actors to participate in the company's television series.  An agreement was signed with Parks, but due to the absurd character, he only got episodic roles.  However, in 1963, such a role in the series "Perry Mason" he attracted the attention of the audience and producers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michael parks movies" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1494917.jpg" width="384"></div>

The actor‚Äôs work in this film was praised by critics, and in 1969, Parks was offered the lead role in the television drama ‚ÄúThen Bronson Came‚Äù.  His character is an eternal wanderer, in search of the meaning of life, he travels on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle throughout America.  Different people meet on the way to Bronson, he helps some, others help him.  But the main character‚Äôs path to himself is as long and lonely as the title of the title song Long Lonesome Highway, which Michael Parks performed in this television movie.  After the series was released, the young actor literally woke up famous.  His musical career also went uphill.  From 1969 to 1970, Parks released three albums recorded at MGM Records. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michael Parks photo" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1494921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Black list </h2><p>  The fall of the actor from Hollywood Olympus was as swift as taking off.  The fact is that Parks, having a <span>heightened sense of justice,</span> did not hesitate in public to criticize the ruling circles of the United States, moreover, he openly called on his fans to support George Wallace in the presidential election.  Big Hollywood bosses did not approve of such freethinking.  In those years, actors were perceived as puppets of film companies, and did not have the right to such calls.  Therefore, Parks instantly turned out to be among those actors to whom the entrance to large film studios was closed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Michael Parks: filmography </h2><p>  Director Larry Cohen was the first to melt the ice, and in 1977 he invited a disgraced actor to one of the leading roles in his film "John Dougher Hoover's Personal File".  Portraying Bobby Kennedy, Parks once again managed to attract the attention of the viewer and critics.  In the same year, the films ‚ÄúEscape from Bogen County‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove and Night Car Service‚Äù were released.  The former popularity gradually began to return to the actor, and in 1986 the ABC channel invited him to take part in the Dynasty television project, where he played Philip Colby.  For our viewer, Parks could be remembered for the first time as the drug dealer Jean Reno, whom he played in the cult series Twin Peaks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michael Parks filmography" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1494918.jpg" width="600"></div>
