Known for its healing mineral waters used to treat a wide range of diseases.  In the village there is a wide network of hotels for every taste and budget. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The municipality of Montegrotto Terme is a small resort town with a population of 10,000 people near Padua.  He is not as famous among the general public as neighboring Abano Terme.  But it is well known in high society as a place for a relaxing holiday.  This is quite an expensive resort where eminent guests are offered VIP-level services.  Throughout the history of Montegrotto, many worthy people have visited: scientists, philosophers, politicians, and cultural figures.  Among them are Petrarch, Mozart, Goethe, members of the royal families of Europe and others. </p><p>  In architectural terms, the town embodies the ideas of the townsfolk about the resort: cozy, quiet streets, buried in verdure;  low-rise buildings in the form of expensive cottages and villas;  Old quarters interspersed with state-of-the-art spa centers and hotels.  From a bird's eye view, the pools reflecting the blue expanse of the sky are clearly visible.  The romantic look is complemented by medieval churches and orchards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelaugustus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montegrotto Terme: how to get there" class="if uuid-2577682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2577682.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Hot springs among the greenery of the magical Euganean hills have been known since ancient Rome.  In local terms, the health of Livy and Plutahr was corrected.  Under the emperor Augustus, a magnificent bath complex was built here with luxurious pools, decorated with statues and mosaic panels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ancient excavations in the 18th and 20th centuries revealed numerous ruins of a large spa complex dating back to the second half of the first century BC.  The water supply system is especially inspiring due to the use of lifting mills, which pumped water into the three tanks used for bathing.  Parts of other structures such as the theater and swimming pools were also found. </p><p>  Today, in the vicinity of Montegrotto Terme, there is a covered archaeological exhibition, where the remains of the structures of Ancient Rome are presented: </p><ul><li>  Maly Theater. </li><li>  The building of Biassidato (appointment undefined). </li><li>  Ancient hydraulic system. </li><li>  Thermal pools. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.calabriavillaggi.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montegrotto Terme Hotels" class="if uuid-2577676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2577676.jpg"></div><h2>  Healing factors </h2><p>  The entire area south of Padua is a resort area.  Today, the Parco Regionale dei Colli Euganei nature reserve has been created on the Euganean Hills, designed to protect the unique local landscape and preserve a flawless environment.  Hills are the remains of an ancient volcano, active 50-60 million years ago.  Although active volcanic activity has long been completed, magma continues to bubble somewhere in the depths.  It saturates with minerals and heats water, which under pressure breaks to the surface in the form of hot springs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The temperature of the mineral water reaches +90 ¬∞ C; therefore, before feeding it is cooled in pipes and special tanks to the required values.  To enhance the healing properties in the spa use additional procedures: wraps, compresses, clay treatment.  The sources contain a lot of magnesium, calcium, bromine, iodine, potassium.  Healing water fights inflammation, relieves headaches, regenerates the lubricating tissue of joints, improves cell metabolism. </p><h2>  Montegrotto Terme Hotels </h2><p>  The commune has over 140 hotels for all population groups: from luxurious 5-star to democratic 2-star.  More than 300 offers - from owners of private real estate.  An important feature is that the vast majority of them offer spa treatment services either on their own base, or enter into an agreement with medical complexes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.termedellenazioni.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The hot springs" class="if uuid-2577656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2577656.jpg"></div><p>  Expensive hotels, as a rule, have spa centers with expensive modern equipment, fitness rooms, equipped with indoor baths and outdoor pools with mineral water.  Procedures and treatment are carried out by specialists with a medical education, or who have undergone special training.  VIP services are available for famous people. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Montegrotto Terme is surrounded by popular tourist destinations.  From the western suburbs, the lands of the Colli Euganei nature reserve begin.  On its territory, excellent infrastructure for recreation, hiking and cycling is organized. </p><p>  Two kilometers north is the equally popular resort of Abano Terme.  It is famous not only for its spa centers, but also for its funky nightlife.  For gastronomic delights, it makes sense to go to Padua, before it is 15 minutes by car.  Of course, you should not miss the opportunity to visit Venice.  The city of romantics is only 45 km away (less than an hour by train). </p><p>  There is something to see in Montegrotto itself.  First of all, it is the world's deepest 40-meter Y-40 pool, the Guinness Book record holder.  It is located at Terme Millepini.  A glass tunnel has been laid through its thickness, from which you can observe the training of divers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesun.co.uk" data-author=": Maryse Farag, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pool Y-40" class="if uuid-2577664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2577664.jpg"></div><p>  In the pool with a water temperature of +32 ... + 34 ¬∞ C, underwater caves are equipped. </p><p>  For ancient architecture are responsible: </p><ul><li>  Archaeological Museum; </li><li>  Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul; </li><li>  City Hall </li><li>  Medieval Villa Callas. </li></ul><p>  In the Museum of Art Glass, you can see the work of the famous Venetian glassblowers from the island of Murano. </p><h2>  How to get to Montegrotto Terme </h2><p>  The municipality is located in the south of the Veneto region in the province of Padova.  The nearest international airports are: </p><ul><li>  Marco Polo, Venice (located 60 km); </li><li>  Treviso (70 km); </li><li>  Valerio Catullo Villafranca, Verona (80 km). </li></ul><p>  A railway line has been laid to the city, from where trains leave for Padua, Venice and other cities.  The local station is called Terme Euganee Abano-Montegrotto. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.3371998" data-lng="11.783265000000029" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/9/0/4890.png"></div><p>  Perhaps it will be convenient for someone to first get to Padua, and from there take a bus (departs from the central bus station) to Montegrotto.  The whole trip takes a couple of tens of minutes.  Italy has a good car rental service.  If you have rights, you can rent a car and move in any direction, guided by the navigator. </p>
