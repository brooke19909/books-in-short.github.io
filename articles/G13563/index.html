Every day we use household appliances, previously considered to be nothing more than fiction.  The Internet, smartphones, cars, stuffed with sensors and autopilot, are our usual things and phenomena that brighten our lives.  It turns out that the military industry is driving the technological progress of the evolution of mankind.  For example, the microwave oven was first available to the military, and then the civilian population of the planet found out about it.  Satellites, computers, and much more have come into our lives with you.  A military exoskeleton will soon become available to us. </p><h2>  What are you talking about? </h2><p>  After reading the last paragraph, many were surprised or even afraid of the word ‚Äúexoskeleton‚Äù.  Do not panic, let's figure it out and decide what kind of "beast" this is and why it is needed. </p>

    <p>  The exoskeleton is the latest unique development of scientists in such a field of science as biomechanics.  The technology is made in the form of an external frame system, which is designed to strengthen the muscular strength of a person or an android robot.  This term was taken from biology.  It means the surface skeleton of invertebrate organisms.  Such technology in the future will eliminate physical limitations in human life, as well as in the use of mechanisms.  Military technology and its needs once again exceeded all expectations.  They say that in 5-6 years, special equipment will appear in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You already managed to understand and guess that the development of exoskeletons is the sphere of interest of the Ministry of Defense.  After all, such a development will increase the capabilities and physical abilities of a soldier.  In the future, they want to use these technologies on spacecraft, as well as in machines for diving to extreme depths for research. </p><h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  Military exoskeleton has become commonplace in the fantasy world.  We saw such devices in video games, movies and cartoons, but these ‚Äúcostumes‚Äù appeared in development not so long ago.  The very first introduced to the world of American military technology in the 60s of the twentieth century.  But it was so heavy and limited in mobility that it was necessary to exclude the possibility of its use in practice.  General Electric and United States Military closed the project with no positive results.  Samples that have been successfully applied have appeared recently.  The exoskeleton of Russian production has proven itself positively.  Costumes are developed by other countries: USA, Israel, Japan.  And what do you think, which powers are competing with each other in this development?  The honor of bearing the name ‚Äúmilitary exoskeleton‚Äù has so far been awarded to the developments of the USA and the Russian Federation! </p><h2>  "Exosuit" today </h2><p>  In various games, there is an exoskeleton: "Stalker", "Warface", "Starcraft", "Crisis" and others.  But in reality, these costumes are only being developed.  In our country, this novelty is being developed by the Research Institute of Mechanics of Moscow State University under the ExoAtlet logo.  In America, two vehicles are being developed in parallel: the lightweight infantry Hulk from the Loken Martin company and the multi-purpose heavy IKSOS-2 from the manufacturer Raytheon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A large amount of information about the development is closed.  But human biomechanics in our country wants to release a device for the open market.  A medical skeleton will appear soon. </p><h2>  Medical Exoskeleton </h2><p>  Russian-made systems are planned to be used in medicine.  This will expand the capabilities of wheelchair users.  Human biomechanics is trying to introduce such devices into the rehabilitation process.  They will perform several functions simultaneously: </p><ul><li>  wheelchair substitute; </li><li>  simulator for people with diseases of the musculoskeletal system; </li><li>  means of social and emotional rehabilitation. </li></ul><p>  The owner of such a technique will be able to move independently and even get rid of the problem of looking from the bottom up. </p><h2>  Rescue suit option </h2><p>  The military exoskeleton was designed to solve several problems: </p><ul><li>  the transfer of very heavy loads for humans over long distances; </li><li>  mine clearance; </li><li>  participation in anti-terrorist operations; </li><li>  liquidation of consequences of man-made disasters and natural disasters; </li><li>  analysis of collapses and blockages; </li><li>  extinguishing fires when the supply of air in the breathing apparatus of the lifeguard is limited, etc. </li></ul><h2>  What is a modern superhero costume? </h2><p>  The Russian-made exoskeleton is made in the form of a frame located behind the owner‚Äôs back.  There are also two supports for the arms and legs on one side of the body.  The limbs, performing the role of the hand, the device does not.  Domestic development differs from the overseas counterpart.  Our device is passive in nature.  It is not equipped with servos, that is, the movement is due to the strength of the muscles of the owner of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  But the world community believes that our development is much more promising than the American one in terms of mass application.  "ExoAtlet" allows a fighter to carry a load weighing about a hundred kilograms.  The thing is that the weight on the frame is correctly distributed.  Such a solution reduces the cost of exoskeleton production by tens of times, which makes it possible to equip a larger number of fighters. </p><h2>  Overseas counterpart </h2><p>  A large number of electronics and batteries were built into the American development.  In addition to the high cost, in the western construction there is another problem - autonomy.  Engineers made the system work 72 hours.  But soon the question arises of charging or replacing the power supply unit (battery), because in the field it is very problematic, and sometimes impossible! </p><p>  Critics saw another problem with the American Hulk.  What should a fighter do if the structure is discharged, and there is no way to restore energy?  Designers argue that this situation is not a problem at all.  These military robots can be easily folded, turning them into a kind of backpack.  But such a robot has a weight of about 25 kg.  And what should the defender do: give up expensive development or carry another 25 kg of excess weight, not counting those 100 kg of baggage? </p><h2>  Maintainability HULC </h2><p>  In the field, the reliability and the ability to repair this equipment also raises a large number of questions.  For military equipment, these parameters are very important.  For example, small arms will be effective if it resists adverse factors, and a soldier can fix it with improvised means during operation.  It is not known how the unprotected electronics of the American counterpart behave in conditions of frost or dust.  In order to incapacitate a fighter with such a ‚Äúthing,‚Äù it is enough to shoot a firearm at a structural element, power supply or hydraulics.  As a result, the super suit will turn into a heavy ballast.  It is not possible to repair such a thing in the field due to the increased technological complexity. </p><h2>  Russian exoskeleton </h2><p>  In the domestic version there are no problems with the power source.  Our ExoAthlet is limited only by the physical capabilities of a fighter.  The device does not remove the physical load from the warrior, but allows you to carry up to 100 kg of equipment and weapons.  Our development does not carry a load, it helps a person to fulfill this function.  Military developments are unique.  Engineers have ensured that ExoAtlet has a mass of only 12 kg.  This is one of its advantages.  Indeed, in battle, every gram counts.  We must understand that excess weight slows down the activity of a fighter.  This negatively affects the effectiveness of the warrior.  And the ease of such a design is an obvious plus. </p>

    <p>  The military use of ExoAtlet is also due to the fact that hydraulics and electronics are absent.  The device is a simple and lightweight metal construction.  Indeed, the simpler the equipment, the less negative factors affect it, whether it is a breakdown or harsh climatic conditions.  Repair will also be much easier.  Our developers have created a skeleton in which there is practically nothing to be damaged.  And it‚Äôs much easier to restore mechanics in battle than electronics.  In connection with these factors, domestic development is much more reliable than its Western counterparts. </p><p>  Simply put, soon simple and economical military robots will appear in the defense of our country.  Meanwhile, Western structural engineers continue to puzzle.  They have a long way to go to refine and improve their brainchild.  HULC recently participated in army trials, but, unfortunately, the results were disappointing.  Therefore, the military youth of the United States will not yet see the exosuit on their shoulders. </p><h2>  The history of the creation of ExoAthlet </h2><ul><li>  2011 - MSU scientists won a tender by the Ministry of Emergencies for the development of the skeleton.  In subsequent years, the team creates passive and active devices.  Passive was not afraid of fire, weighed 12 kg and suffered heavy loads of up to 100 kg.  Active allowed the fighter to lift weights up to 200 kg. </li><li>  2013 - a team of scientists separated for the development of ExoAtlet for medical purposes.  Their motto was that real people would walk in exoskeletons. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  2014 - Research Institute of Moscow State University receives the main prize from Startup Village.  The team became a Skolkovo resident, and also entered the top five finalists of the Generation S competition and performed at the Sochi Olympics in robotics.  Next was a presentation of the development in Singapore and negotiations with the country's chief rehabilitation specialist. </li><li>  2015 is the first sale.  Arkhangelsk region purchased 6 suits for research and testing.  In the same year, the first trip to the Middle East took place.  At the X Venture Fair in Kazan, the team won first place in the high technology nomination. </li><li>  2016 - ExoAtlet crosses the Atlantic and conquers the American as well as Asian markets.  This year is associated with skeleton developers with a shot from a signal pistol.  Sales of devices in Russia start, and serious clinical trials also begin. </li></ul><h2>  ExoAtlet at home </h2><p>  Our ‚ÄúAthlete‚Äù is designed to fully reproduce the owner‚Äôs gait.  But this does not mean that the process will be carried out without the participation of the owner.  This kind of movement can be compared to cycling.  A person will have to get used to control.  With such equipment, you need to re-learn to maintain balance and take the first steps one after another.  This process takes from several hours to several days.  The exoskeleton control training procedure takes place in a clinic, where the device is regulated according to the owner‚Äôs personal parameters: </p><ul><li>  pelvis width; </li><li>  back height; </li><li>  length and proportion of legs. </li></ul><p>  Naturally, everything passes under the supervision of a doctor who, before each workout, conducts a full body check.  Further, the patient has the right to conduct training and rehabilitation at home, but again under supervision.  The robot captures telemetry data and transmits to the surveillance center. </p>

    <p>  If the spinal cord is injured relatively recently, then there is a chance to avoid disability.  But this "golden hour" does not last long.  The sooner the patient gets to his feet and takes the first step with the help of ExoAthlet, the more chances he has to restore motor functions and return to normal life.  But it is important to remember that everyone has their own rehabilitation process and depends on the vital resources of the affected person. </p><p>  In the event of a complete loss of motor functions, ExoAtlet will become a partial replacement for a wheelchair.  It should be understood that in a suit you will not be able to spend days on end, as this is a means of rehabilitation.  Daily training in a suit will immediately replace three physiotherapists, as well as fundamentally change the quality of life of paralyzed patients.  An exoskeleton will help people start walking.  Walking will lead to the fact that ventilation of the lungs will improve significantly, blood pressure will return to normal, joint mobility will increase, urinary tract infections will go away, nutrition of internal organs and muscles will be restored, and intestinal function will improve.  All this is a physiological effect. </p><p>  The emotional and psychological aspects in the life of a disabled person are no less important.  Paralyzed people using the ‚ÄúExoAtlet‚Äù noticed that their mood and attitude to the world around them improved.  Their life began to be filled with colors, positive impressions and emotions.  They have new forces.  Now they are able to communicate on a par with surrounding people.  In the eyes of the pilots of the ExoAthlet, fire and an interest in life appear.  They say that behind them is not electronics and a battery, but a pair of technological wings. </p><h2>  Japanese hal </h2><p>  In the Land of the Rising Sun, human biomechanics does not stand still.  Scientists of the Japanese experimental laboratory have developed a hybrid auxiliary limb.  Today, people with disabilities use it on the island.  The development and improvement of this costume was held at Tsukubin University for 20 years!  Today, the Japanese are actively introducing HAL technology in medicine.  Cyberdyne (the owner of exoskeleton rights) has leased more than three hundred copies.  Back in 2013, the invention received a certificate of safety in use.  This fact opened the way for the device to the world market, and also confirmed its reliability. </p>

    <p>  The owner of the HAL-5 modification can lift and move things and objects that exceed the maximum load five times in mass in natural conditions.  Such a turn in the world of technology and robots greatly simplifies the work of rescuers and liquidators of various consequences.  But this modification has not yet been implemented. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Earlier we saw fantastic developments in the cinema.  In games, they met an exoskeleton ("Stalker"), but they could not even think that such technologies would soon become available to an ordinary person.  In 2017, active tests are conducted in the field of costume management by the power of thought.  Our scientists are now required to teach the operating system to instantly read the operator‚Äôs soaps.  The problems of battery autonomy are being gradually solved, since the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation plans to start purchasing such devices already in early 2020.  We can only wait and <span>hold</span> our <span>fists</span> for our bright heads at the Institute of Mechanics of Moscow State University. </p><p>  Today in Russia there is no market for similar products.  We have yet to create it.  The question remains whether engineers and designers will bring perfection to their brainchild.  The domestic ExoAtlet team will have to solve a huge number of difficult issues: synchronization of pulse reading and equipment response, increasing the battery capacity, reducing its weight and much more.  This trend in the world is gaining momentum and becoming more and more popular.  Competitors are growing, conducting a huge number of tests.  Experts have estimated the European exoskeleton market at one and a half billion euros.  Let us wish the Russian developers good luck, creative successes and the next breakthroughs and discoveries in their difficult creative path! </p>
