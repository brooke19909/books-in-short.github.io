    <p>  Considering the sights of Side, it is worth highlighting the remains of the walls, ancient streets, aqueducts, an ancient theater, public toilets and Roman baths - all this will make you forget that now is the 21st century.  Your imagination will take you to the arena of the theater, in which there were fights of gladiators, where slaves were thrown into <span>predatory animals</span> for food for entertainment.  It is likely that in the beautiful garden you hear the murmur of the fountain, feel the aroma of fragrant flowers.  When exploring the sights of Side, you can also feel like a servant of the temple, and the Anatolian land is rich in them. </p><p>  You will be struck by the temples of Athena and Apollo, which are built in the Corinthian style of marble.  From the images on the coins, it was revealed that these two sights of Side belonged to Athena and Apollo, two of the most important gods.  It is believed that the large temple belonged to the goddess, and the one smaller in size belonged to Apollo, since on coins the god stands in front of the small church, Athena holds a model of a large structure in the palm of her hand.  Near them was also the temple of Mena, the god of the moon. </p>
