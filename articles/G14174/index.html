There are many hotels here, but not every service is at a decent European level.  Among them, one of the best, according to tourists, can be called Avenra <span>Beach Hotel 4 *.</span>  Its good location, the true hospitality of the staff, always in a hurry to instantly resolve any issue, excellent cuisine, decent service make the holiday carefree, comfortable and enjoyable in all respects.  That is why most of those who plan to come to Sri Lanka repeatedly, always want to stay only at this hotel. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Sri Lanka is called the paradise of our planet.  It is located just south of the Hindustan Peninsula, in the vast Indian Ocean.  The island itself is small, only 450 km from south to north and 230 km from east to west, but despite its modest size, recreation in each of its regions has its own charm.  The most favorable climate is famous for the Southern province, in which the Avenra Beach Hotel 4 * is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="avenra beach 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1451148.jpg" width="600"></div>  Hikkaduwa is a town and a popular resort, in the central part of which only 2 years ago the hotel in question was built.  There is an asphalt road near it, which can be reached by taxi or by bus to any end of the country.  The train station is 3.1 km from the hotel‚Äôs door, which is sometimes extremely convenient.  True, the railway tracks in Sri Lanka are unusually narrow gauge for us, and the trains move very slowly, but they can be reached from Hikkaduwa to many cities of the island, including Colombo, Galle, Kandy.  By the way, buses on the island also travel very slowly, no more than 45 km per hour, plus with multiple stops.  So, for example, in Galle, the center of which is only 22 km from the hotel, you can drive for an hour, and in Colombo - more than 3 hours, because this largest city is 110 km from Hikkaduwa.

The closest to Avenra Beach 4 * is called Bandaranaike.  It is located in the village of Katunayaka, which is 35 km from the center of Colombo.  The hotel is 143 km from there, or more than 3 hours.  It is best and most reliable to use the transfer provided by the company from which the tour to the hotel was purchased.  A big advantage here will be air conditioners.  As a rule, they are always available in branded buses.  You can only get to the hotel and generally to the Hikkaduwa resort with relative comfort by taxi.  Pay in them will need from 70 to 90.  e. Cheap from the airport to the resort, you can only go with transfers by bus or by train.  Please note that you will also have to fly to Sri Lanka with transfers in Male, Dubai or other cities (depending on the airline).  A flight, for example, from Moscow can stretch for 12, and sometimes 15 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avenra Beach 4 Hikkaduwa" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1450478.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Avenra Beach 4 * (Hikkaduwa) does not occupy a very large plot on the coast, but its compact, and most importantly, protected area is always green and beautiful.  There is no chic garden where you can enjoy walks.  The landscape consists mainly of emerald lawns, on which special arbors are placed - altankas with many pillows.  They perfectly have a rest and admire the ocean.  Green spaces in the hotel garden are represented by palm trees of various calibers and evergreen shrubs.  There is only one building in Avenra Beach 4 *.  It is two-story, built according to the configuration of the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù, the outer side of which faces the road (here is the main entrance / exit), and the inside - into the hotel (there is a spacious pool).  Near the main entrance there is parking.  The building was erected in such a way that the views of the road open only from the windows of the corridor, and from the windows of the rooms tourists enjoy the ocean and the garden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In Avenra Beach 4 * (Hikkaduwa) there are amenities for relaxing, and for celebrations, and for work.

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  In Avenra Beach 4 * (Sri Lanka, Hikkaduwa) there are few rooms, only 55 units.  They are located on the first and second floors of the building.  A lift is not provided at the hotel.  In several rooms located near the reception, views from the windows open onto the wall of the building, which is not very pleasant.  But in them, judging by the reviews of the guests, Wi-Fi catches best.  The design of all rooms is the same, compiled according to the principles of minimalism.  Their category is also the same - "deluxe", only they can be calculated for 2 people or 3, which affects the area and the number of beds.  Distinctive features of the rooms are large windows to the floor, balconies on the second floor of the building and open verandas on the first.  Equipment - beds, wardrobe with hangers and a safe, refrigerator, tea / coffee making facilities (electric kettle, dishes, coffee bags, sugar, dry cream, tea), armchairs, bedside tables, TV (many channels are chargeable), air conditioning.  Hygiene rooms are equipped with stylish showers and a washbasin, hairdryer, toilet.  On the day of arrival, sets of hygiene products (gels, balms, lotions, shampoo, toothbrushes) are provided, which are regularly replenished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avenra Beach 4 Sri Lanka Hikkaduwa" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1450477.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In most cases, according to the BB system, tours to the Avenra Beach Hotel 4 * are offered.  Sri Lanka is an exotic country, so the local cuisine to Europeans may seem complicated.  Nevertheless, breakfasts in the hotel, organized as a "self-service", are reminiscent of European ones and are suitable for almost everyone.  The menu has donuts with different fillings, granola, cheeses, sausages, rolls, eggs, a lot of exotic fruits.  Among the drinks you can choose coffee, fresh juice, tea.  0.5 ml bottled water is delivered daily to the room.  There are two restaurants in the hotel: the central one, where breakfast is served, and on the beach.  Here you can order any dishes, but for the money. </p><p>  Some tourists buy trips on the HB system, but, according to reviews, this does not justify itself, since next to the hotel and in the city of Hikkaduwa you can choose the best cafes and restaurants for lunch and dinner, where dishes will always delight you with variety and prices are affordable.  For dinner, the hotel serves meat (grilled, fried, stewed), fish, seafood with all kinds of side dishes, hot sauces and sweets. </p><p>  If hotel guests go on an excursion and cannot attend breakfast, they can enjoy packed lunches. </p><p>  The hotel has two bars: in the lobby and near the pool.  Drinks and cocktails in both paid. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Avenra Beach 4 * welcomes guests with children of any age, but there is no free accommodation for kids here.  The cost of any extra bed (baby cot, available only on request, or cots for older children) is 15.  e. per day.  Tour operators report that parents can book a babysitter for their kids at a hotel for a fee.  Here, perhaps, is all the services for babies that are offered here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avenra Beach Hotel 4 Sri Lanka" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1451147.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ocean </h2><p>  Regarding the beach, Avenra Beach 4 * is extremely conveniently located.  Hikkaduwa is famous for its fabulous white sand coast and truly turquoise-blue smooth surface of the ocean.  It‚Äôs nice to admire these beauties, but you can‚Äôt always plunge or swim.  The fact is that the open spaces open to the winds are impressive not only endlessly, but also quite impressive waves, very easily captivating from the coast to the depth. </p><p>  Otherwise, the beach at the hotel is wonderful.  It is literally a couple of dozen steps from the building.  Here, under the palm trees there are comfortable sunbeds with mattresses, gazebos, and a restaurant.  The ocean near the coast is not always calm, but the water in it is clear.  Therefore, in it you can observe exotic animals.  If for bathers the conditions on the beach are not quite acceptable, then for surfers and divers here is a paradise.  The beach is also good for evening romantic walks, as many vacationers mention in reviews. </p><h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  Avenra Beach 4 * is focused on a relaxing relaxing holiday.  Animation is not provided here.  Guests entertain themselves, mostly swimming in the pool.  Its area is quite large, and the depth is designed both for those who swim well, and for those who barely know how to stay on the water.  Only now there is no zone for kids in the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avenra Beach 4 Hikkaduwa" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1450479.jpg" width="521"></div>  For adults, a bar is working near it all day, under palm trees and grass comfortable sun loungers are installed.  Another type of entertainment for tourists, according to tour operators, could be <span>fishing in the ocean.</span>  Some guests in their reviews note that this hotel often hosts local weddings, which no one is forbidden to watch.  Wedding ceremonies here are always unusually colorful, held with the performance of dancers, singers and acrobats and to some extent replace the animation.

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  It is no secret that many just for exotic travel to Avenra Beach 4 *.  Sri Lanka, including Hikkaduwa, is able to surprise with its sights, lifestyle and traditions, which are always interesting to learn something new.  Hotel guests can independently walk in the city, visit the National Park with unique lively coral reefs.  It is possible to observe its inhabitants from boats in which a transparent bottom is made.  It is also interesting to visit the Tsunami Museum, admire the Buddhist temples (the entrance to them is only barefoot and in modest clothes).  Near the city there is a Museum of masks, you can go to a farm of turtles, to mines where precious minerals are mined. </p><p>  Many tourists travel on their own to Colombo.  To do this, it is best to use the train, because it itself is already an unusual attraction. </p><p>  If you plan longer trips, it is advisable to buy excursions at The Avenra Beach Hotel 4 *.  A tour operator from our travel agencies will always help to organize everything, interestingly tell you about the place where the trip is planned.  You can buy excursions in companies located near the hotel, but, according to guest reviews, the guides in them know Russian very poorly and say almost nothing interesting.  The most popular <span>tea plantations</span> and the factory where you can buy the freshest tea, Dambula's caves, an elephant farm, Spice Garden, Blue Lagoon, the city of Kandy, beautiful waterfalls.  I must say that most long-distance excursions are two-day, their price includes accommodation and meals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avenra Beach 4 Sri Lanka Hikkaduwa" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1450476.jpg" width="538"></div>
