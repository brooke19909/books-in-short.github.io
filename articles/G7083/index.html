  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unforgettable holidays in Paris</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The most romantic city</span> on Earth is considered Paris.  It is here that all the lovers dream of spending their vacation.  Its streets, cafes, residents, history - all this is saturated with tenderness and love.  For some people, vacation in Paris means visiting a huge number of museums, exhibitions, cathedrals, and for others it‚Äôs a great opportunity to visit the cradle of world haute couture.  In this city, such famous fashion houses as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Dior and many others got their lives and their development.  It is impossible to recognize him in one visit, so many tourists return here from year to year. </p><p>  One cannot imagine a cultural holiday in Paris without visiting the Louvre Museum - the largest art gallery in the world.  Original works by such great masters as Picasso, Gauguin, Monet, Manet, Leonardo da Vinci and many others are presented here.  Be sure to look at the entrance to the Louvre Rivoli metro, which is decorated with many colorful glass balls.  Not far from the museum itself is the closed gallery Galerie Vivienne, which was opened in the 19th century. </p><p>  The Eiffel Tower is a symbol of the city and the whole of France.  You remember her when it comes to this country.  It is impossible to spend your holidays in Paris without ever climbing the Eiffel Tower.  The most beautiful view from it to the whole city opens from the third floor.  Having gone there on an excursion, you should dine in the wonderful Jules Vern restaurant, located on the second level of the tower.  After this amazing walk, you can have a picnic on the <span>Champ de Mars,</span> following the example of Parisians. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Paris abounds in interesting places.  This is Montmartre Square, and the <span>Champs Elysees,</span> and the <span>Arc de Triomphe,</span> and the Museum of Arts and Crafts.  Every street, every house is filled with history, great meaning and beauty.  For example, you can spend the whole day on Montmartre Square, admiring the old Gallet mill, the small church of Saint-Pierre, the famous Sacre-Coeur Cathedral, where a mosaic image of Christ is laid out.  Here, on the square, there is a wall of Love, where the word "Love" is written in almost all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  If you go a little further, to Pigalle Square, you immediately get to the world-famous variety show Moulin Rouge, about which several films were shot. </p><p>  Going on vacation in Paris, it is best to initially think out a plan for visiting memorable places, because once in place, it is very easy to get confused.  The capital of France is classical Europe, which affects prices.  Here they correspond to the level of service and not all guests can afford it.  For this reason, you should not postpone the trip, because there is always the opportunity to purchase last-minute trips to Paris at an attractive price.  They are put up by travel companies for sale a few days before departure.  In this way, you can significantly save on the trip.  Typically, last-minute tours to Paris are bought by students and people whose income does not allow them to purchase a ticket for the full price.  Such a choice should not be considered wrong or entailing unpleasant consequences, since last minute vouchers are only free places in the group that no one has taken. </p><p>  Every person would like to visit at least once in his life in Paris.  Small financial difficulties should not get in the way of a dream.  If there is an opportunity to buy a tour at a reasonable price and a tourist can pack for a vacation in just a couple of days, then you should not miss such a chance.  As with the purchase of any other ticket, you need to be very careful and carefully read all the documentation, not be afraid to ask all your questions.  If you take precautions, then a vacation in Paris will be an unforgettable time, giving a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions. </p>
