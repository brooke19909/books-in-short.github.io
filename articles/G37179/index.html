    <p>  It is noteworthy that they mostly write Voronezh, not competitors base for business.  This is evident in the content of the reviews.  On the one hand, critics (we will call them that) recognize: the Deutsche Sloboda camp site is currently the most popular suburban recreation center.  However, on the other hand, Voronezh residents (as apparently pleasing for the city's leisure and leisure infrastructure) are trying to tell the owners of this institution how to improve the quality of their leisure.  Here are some of their suggestions that can increase the demand for base services: </p><ul><li>  Still, it is advisable to understaff the economy rooms (after all, the purchase of decent used refrigerators and televisions for this purpose will require relatively small funds).  In this case, we can hope for their longer eating vacationers. </li><li>  Pay more attention to trifles, for example, the presence of a coat hanger for clothes, utensils necessary for living.  From such simple things that indicate attention to customers, the German Sloboda base will become even more attractive. </li><li>  Landscaped beach with.  Devils look advantageous so far only at the regional level.  However, if you look broader, then it requires capital investment.  The idea suggests itself - to increase the number of forest stands.  Presumably due to pine healing the air by releasing phytoncides into it. </li><li>  To extend the service life, it is advisable to carry out waterproofing of the wooden buildings of the recreation center. </li><li>  The desire was expressed to improve the level of management and staff motivation, maintaining corporate identity in work. </li><li>  It is advisable, having achieved the attractiveness of the base for tourists, complement the services of the recreation center with excursions. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A favorite place for many residents of the regional center is the recreation center "German settlement" (Voronezh).  Reviews of it testify: near the city by the work of people a popular place for recreation was created. </p>
