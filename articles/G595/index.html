One fine day, upon discovering that the nth amount is debited from your account daily, you are wondering: how to disable the service on Tele2?  It will be good if you understand why money is being withdrawn from your account, and what to do otherwise?  There are several solutions to this problem. </p><h2>  Option 1 </h2><p>  If you do not know how to disable the service on "Tele2", go to your personal account, enter your number - and you will see a list of all connected paid and free services.  Then you just have to click the mouse and turn off all unnecessary additional options.  This option is the easiest and fastest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Option 2 </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt have access to the network (even if it's fantastic, but it happens), try calling Tele2 support at toll-free number 611, however, first you will have to listen to a long answering machine speech and press a few keys to get connected to the operator.

After this procedure, you can chat with the operator, find out what services you have been connected to, and disable them if necessary. </p><h2>  Option 3 </h2>

Therefore, before an important event, ask how to turn off the melody on "Tele2". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The good news is that this operator does not impose this service on its subscribers, does not replace beeps with free ringtones, as other mobile operators do. </p><h2>  SMS - modern letters </h2><p>  As we all keep pace with the times, paper letters also become less needed and relevant than half a century ago.  Now it is much easier to send SMS, which instantly reaches the addressee, and within a few minutes you will receive an answer, even if your interlocutor is on the other side of the country.  The Tele2 operator, knowing the youth‚Äôs need for a large number of SMS, offers the SMS Freedom service.  By connecting it, you get the freedom of communication, because you are given 200 free SMS per day, and payment - about 3 rubles (depending on the region).  But what if you are connected to this service, but you have no one to send messages?  Maybe it's easier for you to call and hear a lively voice?  How to disable SMS on "Tele2"?  Everything, as always, is quite simple: either you go to your personal account and disconnect any service in two seconds, or by typing * 155 * 20 #.  Deactivation of the service is absolutely free. </p><p>  You can deactivate SMS-Tele2 service at any office of a mobile operator by presenting your passport.  It takes no more than 5 minutes.

Short messages are loved not only by students attending lectures and schoolchildren, but also by lovers, because it‚Äôs so nice to exchange funny emoticons, wish good night.  Using SMS, you can send important information, for example, address or phone number, then your interlocutor will not have to look for a pen and a piece of paper, and the information stored in the phone will not be lost, unlike paper media. </p>

    <h2>  You don‚Äôt have to worry about your account status. </h2><p>  With the development of online banking, it has become much easier and faster to replenish your mobile phone account.  If 10 years ago rare subscribers with cell phones could either pay their bills at the office, or buy a pay card at kiosks or shops, both options were not entirely convenient.  Over time, payment terminals began to appear, where you need to enter your phone number and deposit the required amount.  The account is replenished automatically, but, as a rule, such terminals take a commission, which can be quite large.  Another deposit option is at the box office of large supermarkets.  Conveniently enough, paying for purchases, put a hundred or two on the phone. </p>
