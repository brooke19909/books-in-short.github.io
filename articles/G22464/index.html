    <p>  As you know, history holds many secrets.  So it is still not established whether Atlantis actually existed.  The history of our state also has many secrets.  For example, it is still unknown where the amber room is located - a real masterpiece of art. </p><p>  In 1701, Frederick the First, the Prussian King, ordered the creation of a unique cabinet.  It was to be made not of simple material, but of amber.  The work was entrusted to Danish craftsman Gottfried Wolfram and specialists from Gdansk who specialized in this material.  The office occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters.  After creation, the amber room was presented in 1716 to Peter the Great, the future emperor of Russia.  It was assumed that <span>this masterpiece</span> would become the key to a friendly alliance between the Romanov dynasty and the Hohenzollerns.  The cabinet was housed in the <span>Winter Palace.</span>  However, under Catherine, he was transferred to Tsarskoye Selo, where he was supplemented with painted panels, mosaics and mirrored columns.  This has significantly expanded the room.  As a result, the amber room consisted of 22 panels, 4 mosaics from jasper, 24 mirror columns, 180 small amber ornaments.  The entire interior was complemented by crystal chandeliers and wall sconces. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, Nazi troops invaded Tsarskoye Selo, where the famous room was located at that time.  They barbarously began to spoil the subject of art.  However, part of the room was saved.  The surviving interior was dismantled, packed in boxes and sent to Koenigsberg, where the room was assembled and demonstrated as a national treasure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the end of the war, Soviet troops entered the city where the masterpiece of art was located, it turned out that he was gone.  He was sought not only in Germany, but also in Russia, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, but all attempts to find him were unsuccessful. </p><p>  After the war, many researchers expressed the view that the amber room burned down during the <span>assault on Koenigsberg.</span>  But there was no evidence for this assumption. </p><p>  A masterpiece of art was valued at $ 50 million, so there is a version that the chapters of the Third Reich "fought" for the right to possess a relic.  That is why, each of them could win it for their own collection. </p><p>  Some researchers suggest that the room can be hidden in any cache of the Gauforum architectural ensemble, where there are many <span>underground passages,</span> cellars, crypts.  But this version cannot be verified, because  the ensemble is littered with no access to its caches. </p><p>  There is also a version that the amber room is at the bottom of the Vistula Gulf.  One of the war veterans said that in 1945 his tank platoon sank a German convoy that was walking on ice.  It is assumed that there was a room.  But the expedition aimed at searching for relics did not bring success. </p><p>  Despite the fact that it is not possible to find the room, new elements of the masterpiece continue to appear on the ‚Äúblack market‚Äù.  For example, in 1995, an amber figurine was sold at an auction in London, and in 1997 an element of the amber panel was sold in Bremen.  In addition, in the same year a chest of drawers was found, which once stood in the office. </p><p>  Today, <span>Catherine Palace has been</span> recreated in Tsarskoye Selo <span>.</span>  Immediately after its restoration, work began on the revival of the amber room.  However, the masters faced a rather difficult task, since not a single sketch was preserved.  The only thing that helped in the restoration of the room was black and white photographs.  A significant role in the reconstruction of the relics had the German government, which allocated a significant amount of money.  The opening of the amber room became a symbol of the friendly relations between Russia and Germany, laid down even 3 centuries ago under Frederick the First and Peter the Great.  Of course, every country in the world would like to have such a relic.  Therefore, the mystery of the amber room, created 3 centuries ago, as well as its location remains a mystery. </p>
