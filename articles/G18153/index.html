  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oxford: attractions, interesting places, city history, photos, reviews and travel tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Oxford is a large vibrant metropolis, which today is a world-famous training center.  Life is in full swing, and due to its amazing nature, it does not seem stuffy.  The sights of Oxford, its many restaurants and picturesque streets attract a large number of tourists every year.  It is multifaceted, unique, and therefore deserves special attention of the traveler. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The history of Oxford dates back to the beginning of the 10th century.  At that time, Edward I took possession of its territory. But historians believe that Oxford was originally a fortress that protected the local population from Viking attacks.  Since then, a lot of time has passed, however, one of the architectural monuments managed to survive - this is the Romanesque Tower (Kornmarket Street), which is part of the complex of the Church of St. Michael. </p><p>  In the XI century, the Normans conquered the territory of the city.  Since then, a few more have survived: these are fragments of the stone wall, and the castle of St. George.  Until 1996, it was not possible to visit him, since there was a prison on its territory.  This century was key for Oxford - the first colleges gradually began to appear around the monasteries. </p><p>  In the second half of the XII century, the first university building was rebuilt in the city.  But his story has certain sad facts - in the middle of the XIV century, he was subjected to pogrom, which killed several dozen students.  The next century presented Oxford with Magdalen College.  And the XVI century was marked by the emergence of another major college - Christ Church (Christ Church College), which was rebuilt by order of Gernich VIII. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="travellingdreams.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Oxford" class="if uuid-2539700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539700.jpg"></div><p>  Since then he has grown a lot.  And one of the main attractions of the city of Oxford - the old <span>English university, which</span> presented 50 Nobel laureates, is today in fifth place in the ranking of universities in the world. </p><h2>  The most famous street </h2><p>  On Oxford Street, tourists can visit several luxurious shops at once and enjoy the colorful illumination that is always included during the holidays.  Today, this street is part of London and is located in its eastern part - in the Westminster quarter.  But earlier it was she who connected the capital of Great Britain with Oxford.  Hence the name. </p><p>  Oxford Street takes its beginning from the Marble Arch and leads travelers to the Holborn area.  Being the longest street in Europe, they are 2.5 km long, and in the vicinity you will find four metro stations.  Here are the stores of world famous brands: Marks &amp; Spencer, Selfridges, TopShop and the local Children's World, information about which can be found in the Guinness Book of Records.  And in order to visit all the attractions of Oxford Street, it will take more than one day.  Their doors are open to visitors from about 9:00 until the evening.  The peak of sales falls on the Christmas season.  People come to this place to purchase quality goods for themselves and choose something as a gift to their loved ones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The oldest cafe </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Queen's Lane Coffee House" class="if uuid-2539703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539703.jpg"></div><p>  Queen's Lane Coffee House was built in 1654.  You can find this Oxford landmark on the corner of High Street and Queens Lane.  Translated, its name sounds like a cafe on the Royal Lane.  Moreover, it enjoys great popularity among tourists and among local residents, especially students. </p><p>  This cafe serves traditional English dishes, as well as Mediterranean and North African dishes.  There are hot and cold sandwiches that are presented with nachos and salads, hummus and falafel, dolma and baked beans.  There is a morning breakfast, which usually consists of a fried egg, bacon, sausages, fresh tomatoes, orange juice and a crispy bun.  In addition, the coffee house can offer a huge selection of cakes and pastries, as well as coffee, hot chocolate and fragrant tea with cream. </p><h2>  Carfax Tower </h2><p>  In the heart of Oxford, at the crossroads of four roads, the Kerfax Tower is located.  Its height is 23 meters, and it performs four functions at once: a bell tower, a high-rise landmark, since by law it is precisely such a building height that is maximum, a historical monument, and the sights of England. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Oxford remembers how, in the 15th century, it was only an extension to St. Martin's Church.  In 1676, it replaced its old five bells and added another one.  As a result, Kerfax became not just a bell tower, but a city belfry.  In the XIX century, the tower had to be destroyed and built almost from scratch, as it began to decay and gradually collapsed.  After some time, due to the need to lay a new road branch, the temple itself was demolished.  And as a result, the tower stands alone in the very center of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carfax tower" class="if uuid-2539706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539706.jpg"></div><p>  Today, Kerfax is owned by the City Ringer Society and alerts you with loud ringing of all important events.  And every fifteen minutes they beat the old mechanical chimes.  There is an observation deck on the tower, which opens up an amazing panorama of the city.  And to get on it, it is enough to overcome a hundred steps. </p><h2>  Camera (rotunda) Radcliffe (Radcliffe Camera) </h2><p>  It is located on the most picturesque city square and has long acquired the status of the symbol of Oxford.  It was erected in the XVIII century.  Aged in a classic style, this rotunda is more reminiscent of an Italian architectural structure than traditionally English.  Because of this, she stands out from the colleges that surround her. </p><p>  Funds for the construction of the camera were allocated by the royal doctor John Radcliffe, in whose honor she was named.  The building was created as a library, for this its foundation was made round and equipped with many windows that let in enough sunlight for reading.  But even after a while it practically did not change.  The Radcliffe Science Library has only expanded, which is why it had to be moved to another place, and in this building was a branch of the Bodlian Library. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.climateactionprogramme.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radcliffe camera" class="if uuid-2539709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539709.jpg"></div><p>  In 1863, free access to the premises was closed.  Only students from Oxford University are allowed in it, and, unfortunately, only they have the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the old interiors.  But Radcliffe‚Äôs camera still meets all comers openly.  It is incredibly popular among tourists and is very common in photos brought from the city of Oxford. </p><h2>  Christ Church College </h2><p>  This educational institution belongs to the University of Oxford and is considered one of the most famous.  Its walls are remembered by at least 13 future prime ministers of England.  The city of Oxford has only one such institution, and the remaining 45 colleges together cannot boast of such a number of eminent graduates. </p><p>  In 1525 Christ Church was erected as an educational institution and parallel to the monastery, in which there were 101 monks.  Since then, a bell nicknamed Old Tom rings just that many times every day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chch.ox.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christ Church College" class="if uuid-2539710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539710.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, an increasing number of buildings were attached to the main building, making the structure look great today.  Here, tourists will find not only ancient interiors, but stained glass windows with the image of a white rabbit from the fairy tale "Alice in Wonderland".  Since its author was a mathematics teacher right here, and in the main character, he embodied the image of the dean's daughter, whose name was Alice.  By the way, the shooting of the film, which was shot according to the book, also took place within these walls.  Another amazing reincarnation of Christ Church is Hogwarts, in which Harry Potter studied. </p><h2>  Magdalen College </h2><p>  One of the most significant sights of the city of Oxford in terms of architecture is the College of Old England Magdalen.  He certainly deserves your attention.  Among the important attractions are its magnificent bridge over the Cherwell River and large rectangular towers, the main of which, made in the Gothic style, literally pierces the sky.  You can see her from anywhere in Oxford, as well as hear how the student choir sits on its roof.  At this time, real reverence descends upon the city.  The territory also has the Botanical Garden, which is a laboratory of natural sciences for the study of medicinal plants.  A favorite place for walking is Wilde Park and Addisonova Street. </p><p>  The interior of the college is full of luxury.  Here and ornate railings, and wooden elements with skillful carvings, and portraits of eminent personalities who were either his teachers or graduates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britainexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magdalen College" class="if uuid-2539712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539712.jpg"></div><p>  This school was founded in the 15th century by English Chancellor William Weinflith.  He was convinced that the right education is becoming a fundamental factor for a competent choice of life path.  For this reason, his main attention was paid to the students' surroundings, and his forces were aimed at creating optimal conditions for the qualitative absorption of knowledge. </p><h2>  Merton College </h2><p>  One of the first three colleges opened at Oxford.  In the future, its architectural solution and internal equipment were taken as the basis for the construction of other educational institutions that appeared on the territory of the city.  Among the well-preserved sights of this place: the Fitzjeim Gate, a chapel dated to the 13th century, and an old tower.  The base of the building is the old "quadrangle of bachelors," called the Courtyard of the crowd.  The walls are powerful, made of stone, which is mined in the southern part of Mindlands, and is lined with limestone shade of honey.  Round slopes of roofs, also covered with stone, are designed to protect the Merton library in case of fire. </p><p>  In the same building is a repository of manuscripts and books.  This collection has survived from the distant XIII century and is now located on old shelves and in library lockers.  Here you can see the primary sources of ancient manuscripts, a collection of astrolabes and an accurate map of the starry sky.  And it was in these walls that Professor Tolkien created The Lord of the Rings. </p><h2>  Oxford Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.free-city-guides.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oxford castle" class="if uuid-2539723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539723.jpg"></div><p>  This Oxford landmark is a great spot for a casual ambiance.  Previously, its premises served as dungeons, which were closed at the end of the 20th century.  Today, within its walls is a shopping complex, museum and hotel. </p><p>  Thus, Oxford Castle gives all tourists a unique opportunity not only to make an excursion here, but also to stay overnight. </p><h2>  Church of St. Mary the Virgin </h2><p>  A medieval work of art, striking in its architecture.  It was from it that <span>Oxford University</span> grew <span>;</span> it is it that is today the largest parish church in the city.  In the XI century, it was erected within the walls of old Oxford, when it was still surrounded by powerful walls.  A religious center was concentrated here, and in parallel, the place was a university, where students attended lectures, the best students were awarded and diplomas were awarded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="povcrystal.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Mary" class="if uuid-2539734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539734.jpg"></div><p>  In 1270, an unknown architect erected a tower with a pointed spire with three peaks and decorated with statues on the territory of the church.  The front of the entrance is supported by a shell from spiral columns, in which there is a beautiful statue of the Virgin.  The internal equipment is rather modest, only archangels with shields, the chancellor's throne and the old tombstone of Adam de Brom are striking. </p><p>  Among the attractions of Oxford, tourists can see the memorial dedicated to the events that once took place on the territory of St. Mary's Church.  At the time of the Inquisition, they tried on those accused of heresy and burned them. </p><h2>  Headington Shark </h2><p>  Walking along New High Street past house number 2, a tourist will be able to discover one of Oxford's most unusual sights.  This is the Headington shark sticking straight out of the roof.  Its length is 7 m, and this monument was dedicated to the 41st anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. </p><p>  The original idea belongs to a local resident Bill Heine, who vehemently hated nuclear weapons.  His shark has become a symbol of trap and expresses feelings of human impotence.  As soon as the shark was on the roof of the house, its inhabitants expressed a general protest.  However, despite this, the huge fish remained where it was originally placed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventuresportsnetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headington shark" class="if uuid-2539726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20511/2539726.jpg"></div><h2>  Hertford Bridge </h2><p>  Hertforth Bridge, or, as it is called, the <span>Bridge of Sighs</span> (due to the similarities with the famous bridge of the same name in Venice) is one of the small, but at the same time very memorable sights of Oxford.  In English, the name of this bridge sounds like a Hartford Bridge.  It is located near the Sheldon Theater - this is the very center of Oxford.  A very neat and at the same time beautiful stone structure that connects the buildings of Hartford College. </p><p>  Oxford is a city in the UK that has a very rich history and all its attractions are able to tell a lot of interesting things about itself.  This is what attracts tourists and fans of low-key UK. </p><p>  And there is even information about what poet called Oxford the city of "dreaming spiers."  This is the Englishman Matthew Arnold, who was also a professor, convinced that literature should positively influence upbringing, promote good and ideas of truth.  With this name, the poet described the expressiveness and harmony of the architecture of the buildings of this place. </p>
