If you are not a fan of extreme descents, then explore the sights of Zakopane. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poznajpolske.onet.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum in Zakopane" class="if uuid-2248793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248793.jpg"></div><p>  The Tatra Museum will tell the guests the customs of the local population.

The museum exposition includes household items, which allows you to visualize the life of the local population in the old days. </p><p>  Also in Zakopane there is the Museum of Jan Kaspirovich and the Museum of Cornelius Makushinsky. </p><h2>  Chocholow Village </h2><p>  For tourists of great interest, of course, are the attractions of Zakopane and the surrounding area.  Seventeen kilometers from the city is the village of Chocholow, which you can visit.  Its population is 1100 people.  The village is located almost near the Slovak border.  The village is unique.  Almost all the buildings in it are original wooden houses, most of which were built in the nineteenth century.  The whole village consists of one street.  In the historical center of the village, houses along the road are arranged as if they were mirroring each other. </p><p>  During the season, a large number of tourists visit the village.  Here you can buy unusual pottery, which is produced only here.  In the village there is an interesting house built of just one pine.  It is called the "house of one tree."  It is also worth seeing the Gothic stone church, which is completely different from all the other buildings of the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The village gained fame after the events of 1846.  At this time, there was an uprising against the tyranny of Austria-Hungary.  He was led by a local teacher, John Andruskevich.  There is even a museum in the village, the exposition of which is dedicated to the Chochol√≥w Uprising. </p><h2>  Temple of the Fatima Mother of God </h2><p>  Another attraction of Zakopane and the surrounding area is the Temple of Our Lady of Fatima.  It is located in the village of Koscielisko.  The temple was erected in 1992 as a token of gratitude for the salvation of Pope John Paul II during the attempt on it in 1981.  The Pope himself visited him repeatedly, believing that the Fatima Mother of God saved his life. </p><p>  The temple has an interesting story.  It is named in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, which appeared to people in 1917 in the small town of Portugal under the name Fatima.  She then came to the three shepherdesses and told them three secrets about future events.  It is said that two of her prophecies have already come true. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nocowanie.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple in Zakopane" class="if uuid-2248815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248815.jpg"></div><p>  The temple has magnificent decoration, a rich altar and painted stained-glass windows with paintings from the life of John Paul II. </p><p>  Near the church you can see many religious sculptures, and the temple offers stunning views of the Tatras and Mount Giewont. </p><h2>  Krupowka street </h2><p>  One of the attractions of Zakopane (Poland) is the pedestrian street Krupowki.  Similar boardwalks are in all resort towns.  However, the local street is colorful and not like other streets in Poland.  It runs through the center along the entire city and stretches to the foot of the famous Mount Gubalowka.  Krup√≥wki is always crowded.  It has shops, restaurants and taverns.  Tourists are entertained by street musicians, mimes and clowns.  Along the street there are shopping stalls with traditional souvenirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.just-a-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street in Zakopane" class="if uuid-2248830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248830.jpg"></div><p>  Relaxing in Zakopane, you should definitely take a walk along the promenade and get gifts.  According to tourists, the street is really interesting, like any central street of any resort.  Here you can sit in a cafe or just relax.  Locals praise Krup√≥wki.  In fact, it may not seem as beautiful as you expect. </p><h2>  Mount Gubalowka </h2><p>  The main attraction of Zakopane and its surroundings in winter is Mount Gubalowka.  It rises 300 meters above the city.  The mountain offers stunning views of the surroundings.  You can climb to its summit by cable car or mountain tram.  Krupowki street rests right at the foot of the mountain.  From the observation deck on top of the mountain you can admire not only the city, but also the beautiful Tatra Mountains.  Here you can also walk along the paths, look at the natural beauty through optical instruments.  There are several cafes and shops in Gubalowka.  The mountain is always colder than the town. </p><h2>  Mountain resort </h2><p>  The main attractions of Zakopane in winter are mountain trails.  The town is located as if in a bowl, in the immediate vicinity there are several bases, the slopes of which are always open for tourists.  Zakopane has long gained the status of a family resort.  Favorable climatic conditions attract thousands of tourists annually.  Soft snowy winters are the main feature of the resort.  Ski slopes are ready for skiing in December.  On some slopes, tourists continue to ride until April.  Local tracks are good for beginners, but they are also popular with professional athletes. </p><p>  As a ski resort, the city began to attract the views of tourists in the nineteenth century.  Over the past hundred years, the infrastructure of the town has changed and improved.  And now tourists are met by a completely modern ski resort.  Sights of Zakopane, perhaps, are not so outstanding and can not be compared in importance with its mountain routes, but still interesting for tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tapetus.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain Lake" class="if uuid-2248840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248840.jpg"></div><p>  The best track and the most popular is Kasprowy Wierch.  By the way, the mountain is the most crowded.  It has a lot of tourists, not only in winter, but also in the summer.  Indeed, in the warm season, hiking trails are available.  In about three hours you can walk to the very top.  And on the lift, the road takes only half an hour.  Nearby is Lead - one of the highest in Poland. </p><h2>  Vitkevich Theater </h2><p>  Another attraction of Zakopane (Poland) can be called the local theater, which bears the name of the famous <span>Polish writer</span> Vitkevich.  The theater is located on the street Hramtsuvki.  By the way, he is the only one in the city and is a subject of pride. </p><h2>  Sea Eye </h2><p>  In winter, the sights of Zakopane seem especially fabulous, due to the abundance of snow.  One of the places that are interesting for tourists is a mountain lake with the beautiful name Sea Eye.  Getting to him is not so easy.  Local guides offer horse and cart rides.  The lake is high in the mountains.  They say that you can walk to him on an asphalt road in three hours.  On its coast there is an equipped tourist parking, where you can spend the night.  There is also a cafe. </p><h2>  Walks in the park </h2><p>  The resort is good in that the sights and entertainment of Zakopane are designed for guests of different ages.  Representatives of all ages can find something interesting in the city for themselves.  For a family visit, Tatra National Park is interesting.  It is especially interesting in the summer.  Numerous hiking trails are laid across the reserve, some of which end in Slovakia.  Very beautiful Koszheliska Valley.  It impresses with picturesque meadows and clean mountain streams.  They say that even Pope John Paul II himself visited her. </p><h2>  Cave valley </h2><p>  What is worth seeing in Zakopane is the Valley of Caves.  The path to it lies along a good dirt road.  The main attraction of the valley is Frosty Cave.  It was discovered not so long ago, in 1934.  It opened to visitors about 50 years ago.  By the way, this cave is somewhat unique; it is the only one in the Tatras equipped with electric lighting.  In the summer, the temperature inside the cave does not rise above +6 degrees.  The excursion route along it takes about half an hour.  Some passages are so narrow that you have to literally squeeze through.  In general, the route is simple and safe, so the cave can be visited with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pieninskiecentrumturystyki.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frosty cave" class="if uuid-2248844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248844.jpg"></div><p>  Another similar place is located in the Koschellyn Valley.  The cave is known as the Dragon Pit.  This name was given in honor of the rock located at the entrance to the dungeon.  Its shape resembles a dragon with open mouth.  Moreover, the similarity is so obvious that no one believes that nature itself, not people, made it like that.  The route of the cave is not very simple.  In some areas, it is necessary to hold fast to the fasteners in the walls, otherwise you can fall and break.  Still, mountains are not park alleys. </p><h2>  City Attractions </h2><p>  As you can see, most of the interesting places are located outside Zakopane.  But in the town itself there is a lot of entertainment.  On summer sunny days, you can swim in the pool located on the territory of the Mercury Kasprovi Hotel.  The city has a water park all year round.  There is no better place for a family vacation than the amusement park "Rabkoland", built in the vicinity of the city.  On its territory there are attractions for children of all ages and recreation areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.czteryporyroku.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Things to do in Zakopane" class="if uuid-2248848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248848.jpg"></div><p>  In the central district of the city there are all night clubs (and there are 18), restaurants, bars.  At the peak of the holiday season for vacationers organize various entertainment programs.  The main streets are always lively, here you can go shopping and look at souvenir shops. </p><h2>  Reviews about sights in Zakopane (Poland) </h2><p>  The city of Zakopane is better known as a ski resort.  However, according to tourists, it is interesting even for those who are not a fan of snow slopes.  According to tourists, the natural beauty of the region is of the greatest interest.  The town is surrounded by mountains, due to which there is a mild climate with snowy winters.  Winter landscapes of snow-capped peaks will conquer lovers of ski resorts.  But even in summer, the nature of the region is no less picturesque. </p><div class="photo" data-original="niedziela.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions in Zakopane" class="if uuid-2248851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2248851.jpg"></div><p>  It is for the sake of natural beauty that you should come here.  The resort is interesting because it is good for families.  It can not be called seasonal, because tourists come here not only for skiing.  Of course, in winter, lovers of high-speed snow tracks flock here, from beginners to athletes, for whom there are worthy descents.  In warmer periods, tourists are attracted by scenic views and healing air.  It is so pleasant to lie in the warm sunshine on a deck chair on the slope, admiring the stunning views.  Experienced travelers are strongly advised to head to the caves and see the mountain lake.  According to the guests of the city, Zakopane will certainly appeal to uninhabited tourists who visit mountain resorts for the first time.  The city is filled with a special atmosphere.  Its main street is a typical boulevard with cafes and restaurants, trading stalls and street vendors.  Every evening, guests of the resort walk here, buying local trinkets and products.  The most active tourists have the opportunity to have fun in local night clubs.  There are a lot of them in the city, and this, despite the fact that Zakopane is not distinguished by a large population.  Most of the people are tourists for whom interesting entertaining objects are created here. </p>
