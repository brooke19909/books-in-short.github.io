Those.  This unit allows you to lower or raise it.  Transformers installed in power plants carry out <span>electric power transmission</span> over long distances at high voltages up to 1150 kV.  And already directly in the places of consumption there is a decrease in voltage, in the range 127-660V.  With these values, various electrical consumers usually operate, which are installed in factories, factories and in residential buildings.  Electrical appliances, electric welding and other elements in the high voltage circuit also require the use of a transformer.  They are single and three phase, two and multi-winding. </p>

    <p>  There are several types of transformers, each of which is determined by its functions and purpose.  A power transformer converts electrical energy into networks that are designed to use and receive this energy.  <span>The current transformer</span> serves as a measurement of high currents in devices of electrical systems.  A voltage transformer converts high voltage to low.  The autotransformer has electrical and electromagnetic coupling, due to the direct connection of the primary and secondary windings.  A pulse transformer converts pulse signals.  <span>An isolation transformer</span> is characterized in that the primary and secondary windings are not electrically connected to each other.  In short, in all forms, the principle of operation of the transformer is somewhat similar.  You can also highlight the torque converter, the principle of which is to transmit torque to the gearbox from the car engine.  This device allows you to steplessly change the speed and torque. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The device and principle of operation of the transformer. </p><p>  The principle of operation of the transformer is the manifestation of electromagnetic induction.  This device consists of a magnetic circuit and two windings that are located on it.  Electricity is supplied to one, and consumers are connected to the second.  As already mentioned above, these windings are called primary and secondary, respectively.  The magnetic core is made of electrical <span>sheet steel, the</span> elements of which are insulated with varnish.  Its part, on which the windings are located, is called the core.  And it is such a design that has become more widespread, because  It has a number of advantages - simple insulation of the windings, ease of repair, good cooling conditions.  As you can see, the principle of operation of the transformer is not so complicated. </p>

    <p>  There are also transformers with an armored design, which significantly reduces their dimensions.  Most often these are single-phase transformers.  In such equipment, the lateral yokes play a protective role for the winding against mechanical damage.  This is a very important factor, as  small-sized transformers do not have a casing and are in common place with the rest of the equipment.  <span>Three-phase transformers</span> are most often performed with three rods.  The armored construction is also used in high power transformers.  Although this increases the cost of electricity, but it allows you to reduce the height of the magnetic circuit. </p><p>  Transformers are distinguished by the method of connecting the rods: butt and burnt.  In the butt rods and yokes are collected separately and are connected by mounting parts.  And in the lined sheets are going to overlap.  Laminated transformers are more widely used because  they have much higher mechanical strength. </p><p>  The principle of operation of the transformer also depends on the windings, which are cylindrical, disk and concentric.  Equipment of large and medium power have a gas relay. </p>
