Travel agencies often recommend it to those travelers who wish to relax at the lowest cost and in the most favorable conditions. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The year of construction of the hotel is considered to be 2008. At this time, a five-story building was erected in a relatively small area, in which all rooms were placed.  Since then, its appearance has been supported by various renovations, the largest of which was made in 2010 - it was at that moment that the technical equipment of the apartments was improved. </p><p>  This place is perfect for families who come to rest without children, because, according to the guests, loud music that plays during discos and shows will certainly interfere with children's sleep.  This category of tourists reviews recommend looking for a quieter place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pj patong resortel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2068786.jpg"></div>
