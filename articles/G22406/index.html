  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get from Sheremetyevo to Kazan Station in the best way</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of how to get from Sheremetyevo to the Kazan station in the optimal way often arises for those who travel in Moscow, and it is for them only an obstacle that should be overcome with minimal time and nerves.  And to do this is far from always easy due to the very difficult transport situation in the capital of Russia. </p><p>  Different variants </p><p>  Answering the question of how to get from Sheremetyevo to the Kazan station, you always have to solve an equation with several parameters.  This is mainly <span>a reserve of</span> free time until the train leaves and the availability of funds that we are ready to put out for a trip around Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Sheremetyevo to Kazan Station" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250208.jpg" width="496"></div>  A truly reliable vehicle that does not depend on traffic jams on the Leningradskoye Shosse is perhaps Aeroexpress alone.  A little more than half an hour is required in order to be at the Belorussian station of the capital.  And being here, there is nothing complicated in how to get to the Kazan station by metro.  It is enough to drive four stops along the ring line to the Komsomolskaya station. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the Kazan station by metro" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250209.jpg" width="499"></div>  But for all its comfort, Aeroexpress is quite expensive.  The standard fare for one trip in it is 320 rubles and 900 rubles - for travel in conditions of special comfort.  But there is an extensive <span>system of discounts</span> and bonuses for those who ride it often.  Expecting to use Aeroexpress, you should not forget that the terminals C and B in Sheremetyevo do not have direct access to it, you need to go by bus from them.  But if you have a sufficient supply of time, you can think about how to get from Sheremetyevo to the Kazan station with more familiar types of public transport.  This is not at all difficult to do.  <span>Rechnoy vokzal</span> and Planernaya <span>metro</span> stations run round-the-clock city buses and minibuses.  You will have to wait no more than 10 minutes during the day and half an hour at night.  The fare varies from 28 to 70 rubles, respectively.  But there is still a way from the metro with a transfer to the Komsomolskaya station.  Going down the subway and thinking about how to get to the Kazan station, you should not choose a route through the Koltsevaya line from this direction.  It is much easier to go through the center, you only have to make one change.  "Teatralnaya" - "Okhotny Ryad" when following from the <span>station "River Station".</span>  Or the Kuznetsk bridge, if you go with the Glider.  Such a route will lead us directly to the building of the Kazan station, where there are direct exits from the "Komsomolskaya" -radial. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the Kazan station" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250210.jpg" width="498"></div>  Taxi

    <p>  Going through the possible options of how to get from Sheremetyevo to the Kazan station, you can opt for a taxi.  But it should be borne in mind that such a trip will cost one and a half - two thousand rubles.  And it is guaranteed not to get into traditional traffic jams on the Leningradskoye Shosse and not to be late for a train only at night.  There are many taxi companies in Moscow.  They compete fiercely with each other.  But preference should be given only to trusted structures with a good reputation.  Recently, the service of ordering a taxi from the plane, even before its landing, has become popular. </p>
