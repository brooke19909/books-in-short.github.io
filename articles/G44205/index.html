    <p>  The main idea of ​​Narodism is the search for a lost connection with the people.  In ordinary people they saw carriers of wisdom and truth.  Adherents of the trend were looking for a way to socialism. </p><p>  Within the framework of Narodism, a revolutionary and liberal trend stood out.  The former wanted to overthrow the existing regime by violent means.  The second insisted on reform.  In the 70s, the movement entered a new phase - the first <span>terrorist organizations</span> appeared within its framework <span>.</span>  Their goal was to prepare assassination attempts against government officials. </p><p>  One of the first organizations to proclaim terror as the main way to achieve the goal is “Freedom or death”.  On the basis of disagreement over the methods of conducting the revolutionary struggle, “Land and Freedom” —the most influential populist association — disintegrated.  On the basis of this organization, “Narodnaya Volya” and “Black Redistribution” were formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The development of the movement in the 80s of the XIX century </h2><p>  Populism as a political current has changed over the years of its existence.  Formed in 1879, the “Black Redistribution” constituted a minority from the former “Earth and Freedom”.  “Narodnaya Volya” has taken the path of terrorism and radicalism.  Adherents of this organization were in the majority.  The “people's will” and the disintegrated “Freedom or Death” completely departed from the basis of the ideology of Narodism.  They sought by force to force the government to carry out reforms.  Organized attempts, terrorist attacks. </p><p>  The minority in the form of the “Black Redistribution” remained true to the ideas of the Narodniks — reformism, socialism, and peaceful forms of struggle.  By political orientation, this is a party of federalist socialists. </p><p>  The organization was formed around the magazine of the same name.  The name of the party gave the so-called "redistribution" of land.  This was due to the rumor about the universal division of plots between peasants, which appeared after the <span>abolition of serfdom in Russia.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Organization Ideas </h2><p>  The "black redistribution" retained the old ideals of the Narodniks.  It can be noted that the organization’s ideas remained at the level of the 70s of the XIX century, the time of “going to the people”.  Despite the fact that the basis of ideology has been preserved, many goals and ways to achieve them have evolved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In organizing life, the community was considered the ideal.  It should become the basis of a <span>socialist society.</span>  Ownership of land must be collective, and property of large owners must be expropriated.  The black settlers form the idea of ​​the class struggle, but it still looked ill-conceived.  In many ways, the organization was close to the ideals of the Bakuninites.  Terrorist attacks and military actions as a form of political struggle were strongly denied. </p><h2>  “Emancipation of labor” </h2><p>  The ideological crisis that the Black Redistribution was experiencing affected the composition of the organization.  The most influential people were George Plekhanov, Vasily Ignatov, Vera Zasulich, Lev Deutsch.  But they refused to continue working in the organization and created the “Emancipation of Labor” group in Geneva, which stood on the positions of Marxism.  Most of the founders were attracted by the idea of ​​the proletarian revolution.  The Narodniks joined the International, supported the struggle against the Bakuninians. </p><p>  <span>The bourgeois-democratic revolution,</span> which became the ideal of organization, was to develop thanks to the proletariat and the urban bourgeois.  An important role was assigned to the peasants as a reactionary force.  Gradually, the Narodniks turned into Social Democrats.  The "black redistribution" (the year of foundation - 1879) existed until 1883, when the "Emancipation of Labor" group was founded. </p><h2>  Association leader </h2><p>  Georgy Plekhanov was a populist and leader of the "Black Redistribution".  In addition, he also became the founder of the Emancipation of Labor group.  Having entered the “Earth and Freedom” back in 1876, Georgy Valentinovich was imbued with popular ideas.  He was the author of program documents, journalism. </p>

    <p>  After the collapse of "Earth and Freedom" and the assassination of Emperor Alexander II by terrorists, he condemned the activities of the radical wing and organized an alliance faithful to the ideals of populism.  In the early 80s he had to emigrate to Switzerland and continue his activities there.  Gradually turns to Marxist views.  He returned to Russia only after <span>the 1917 revolution</span> .  He wrote many works on sociology, philosophy, ethics. </p><p>  The evolution of views affected the choice of the development path and methods of struggle.  Ideological differences were caused by different views on the future of the country.  The organization initially chose irrelevant goals, so it quickly broke up and transformed into new parties and groups.  The collapse of the "Black Redistribution" testified to the death of true Narodism.  Many ideologists continued to write scientific publications and studies in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, and philosophy. </p>
