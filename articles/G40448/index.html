Many prioritize the layout of apartments, tired of the monotonous "Khrushchev" and "panel".  Indeed, the houses erected in Soviet times did not impress with the variety of planning decisions, the apartments were so small and completely unsuitable to use, that even in the "three rubles" the average family of four could not feel comfortable.  We want to bring to your attention a modern project - a new residential quarter "Southern City" (Samara).  Reviews of real customers and residents will help to produce the most complete and objective review. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  "Southern City" (Samara) - the largest project in the Volga region, which marked the beginning of the development of the southern direction of the city.  This is an innovative project, an analogue of which does not exist today, an example of modern buildings in the Samara region.  The project‚Äôs birthday is June 19, 2013, when the governor of the Samara region laid the first stone in the territory of the new microdistrict.  This is a multi-stage project, the final completion of which is scheduled for 2032.  By this time, in an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2067 hectares there will appear comfortable housing in a well-maintained area with developed infrastructure for 325,000 residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  A plot of land located 900 meters from the southern border of the city, north of the village of Yaitskoye, was chosen for the project.  It was here that the "Southern City" (Samara) began to appear in stages.  Reviews of customers who were among the first to buy real estate here, of course, highlight the issue of transport accessibility of the neighborhood.  Of course, at the stage of laying the foundation, it was possible to get to the place only by private car.  But at the time of the commissioning of the first facility, shuttle buses were already operating in the area, connecting the neighborhood with the city‚Äôs largest social facilities.  In 2015, the construction of the Frunze bridge began, which according to the project will connect the new microdistrict with the historic city center. </p><h2>  Architectural solutions </h2><p>  Residents of Samara are really tired of the same type of houses located in close proximity to each other, the lack of a landscaped local area.  If you read about the advantages of the complex, about what attracted and delighted the residents of the city in the project, first of all it is the spaciousness and scale of the territory where everyone will feel as comfortable as possible.  The reviews of residents of the "Southern City" (Samara), or rather the first houses put into operation, only confirm this.  Of course, at the project stage it was difficult to imagine how the houses would look in the end, how comfortable the microdistrict would turn out to be, but after visiting the facility and getting to know it in detail, all doubts disappeared.  The houses are made in a traditional architectural style, they harmoniously fit into the landscape.  Pleased with the opportunity to choose among buildings of various heights.  Moreover, finally, the residents of the densely populated Samara managed to appreciate the delights of a full-fledged <span>quarter development: the</span> territory of the site is thought out to the smallest detail, a clear division into zones of public and private space is traced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Residents of the new neighborhood note that the concept of building a small European town was a success. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  An integrated approach to the development of the microdistrict is the simultaneous construction of housing and social infrastructure.  According to the general plan, kindergartens, secondary schools, sports and playgrounds will appear on the territory of the future microdistrict, which will make life more comfortable for young families with children.  In the photo "South City" (Samara) looks great.  But if you look at the pictures and read reviews, it becomes obvious that the developer is really interested in the construction of a new microdistrict, where ideal living conditions will be created. </p><p>  So, in 2014, a kindergarten with a swimming pool for 250 children opened its doors to its first pupils.  Already in 2016, another kindergarten for 300 people was commissioned, also with a pool.  In the near future, the construction of another preschool institution will begin.  Parents and children are delighted, because kindergartens are equipped with everything necessary for the full upbringing of children: real professionals are engaged in the kids, and parents do not have to spend a huge amount of time on the road.  Yes, and as residents of the microdistrict note, there were no problems with placing children in kindergarten. </p>

    <p>  As soon as the children grow up, they will go to a comprehensive school with a capacity of 1,500 places.  The commissioning of the facility is scheduled for 2017, that is, on September 1, 2017, the school will accept the first first-graders.  Of course, those who drove earlier experienced some discomfort associated with the lack of school, but this problem is only temporary. </p><h2>  Recreation areas </h2><p>  With the delivery of houses in the complex there are more and more playgrounds and sports grounds, areas for recreation and walks, which is why all incoming residents receive maximum comfort.  The developer paid great attention to maintaining the health of citizens: a polyclinic has already been opened in the complex, and in the near future an excellent medical center will appear here. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Of course, no one wants to call in an apartment, albeit in a new area, and live in the middle of a construction site.  That is why the developer paid great attention to the improvement of the territory.  He rents all his facilities with equipped porches, landscaped courtyards and recreation areas.  Everyone can count on comfort, stopping by the LCD "Southern City" (Samara).  Reviews of the first residents are enthusiastic.  They are pleased with spacious courtyards, excellent parking lots, solving the problem of finding free space for their cars, chic walking areas, which they have accessed from the first day of their stay here. </p>

    <h2>  Planning decisions </h2><p>  You may ask, why else did the residents choose the "Southern City" (Samara)?  Layout of apartments!  The project was successful in all respects.  By attracting advanced European experience and taking into account the wishes of modern residents, it was possible to radically change the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãzoning space, to make even the smallest apartment cozy and comfortable for all its residents. </p><p>  To date, 11,661 apartments have already been sold, 1,874 apartments remain free.  That is why you still have a chance to purchase your dream home.  The prices of apartments here start from 1 107 000 rubles.  All residents receive a spacious living space with a separate bathroom, bright, isolated rooms and a balcony, which offers stunning views of the city's surroundings. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Reviews about the "Southern City" (Samara) - the main assessment of the work done.  In the end, each developer works for the benefit of the residents of a new house, block or neighborhood, trying to create the most comfortable living conditions for them.  There is still enough time before the final commissioning of the facility, but today it is obvious to many that the project is successful in all respects.  Residents of the new microdistrict will be able to experience all the delights of suburban life, while retaining access to all objects of urban infrastructure.  That is why we strongly recommend that you take a closer look at the project, visit it and see for yourself in all the advantages that it has. </p>
