After all, with its help you can contact your family and friends and exchange text messages, as well as transfer various data, files, pictures, etc.  However, each new day brings us new discoveries and inventions in the field of mobile phones, which is why a modern person places rather high demands on this device, because it must satisfy all his needs.  Of course, every day new models of phones with a different set of functions are provided to your attention.  However, at one point, you may encounter a problem: how the smartphone differs from the phone and what to choose. </p><p>  So, what is the difference between a smartphone and a phone? </p><p>  For the past couple of years, it was smartphones that received the most widespread popularity among users.  However, it is not always even the most experienced seller in mobile stores can easily explain how the smartphone differs from the phone that we are so used to lately.  But often you make the really right choice, giving preference to a smartphone, because by the number of functions it undoubtedly surpasses a standard mobile phone. </p><p>  First of all, you need to figure out how the smartphone differs from the phone.  A mobile phone is just a communication device capable of transmitting and receiving SMS and MMS messages.  Of course, it has a number of additional features, such as the availability of games and Internet access.  While a smartphone is a prototype of a computer.  After all, its functionality is beyond praise.  So, the smartphone supports all audio and video formats, any applications or programs can be easily installed on it, just as if it was a computer.  After all, with its help you can watch your favorite movie, the only thing that can cause some inconvenience is the small <span>screen size.</span>  Also, you can easily connect to the Internet and view all the files you need online.  At the same time, you can use other programs without any difficulty, and you will not have any problems with the congestion of the system. </p><p>  OS for mobile phones </p><p>  It should also be noted that it is the presence of a full-fledged operating system that distinguishes a smartphone from ordinary phones.  After all, this gives him an unlimited opportunity to simultaneously work with a huge number of various applications and programs.  It also provides better work of the entire telephone system. </p><p>  There are a large number of different operating systems, but phones with windows os are increasingly found.  Perhaps, thanks to many years of experience and gained trust, most people give preference to them.  But along with this there are the following options for operating systems: </p><p>  Android  One of the most popular <span>modern operating systems</span> currently owned <span>by Google.</span> </p><p>  Bada.  An OS that was developed by Samsung.  However, it is more considered an open platform than a full-fledged operating system. </p><p>  Apple  No less popular system designed for devices manufactured by Apple. </p><p>  And Palm webOS.  An OS designed specifically for touchscreen smartphones. </p><p>  Thus, the main difference between a smartphone is its versatility and the presence of an operating system, because smartphones have a processor.  However, they are contraindicated in any severe mechanical damage.  So, now you have the right to independently decide what is best for you. </p>
