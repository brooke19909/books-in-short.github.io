The trend towards the use of renewable and alternative energy sources is gaining momentum in the last decade, the leading place in this process is solar energy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smallcappower.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The prospect of street lights" class="if uuid-2327228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2327228.jpg"></div><p>  The rapid growth in the production of photovoltaic modules in the world has led to the fact that solar technology is becoming a real, cost-effective option to reduce fuel and available for use in the housing and communal sector. </p><p>  Installation of traditional electric lighting for household plots is often an expensive process, and their operation leads to a significant increase in electricity consumption and, consequently, the cost of its payment.  Solar powered garden lights, which are now available in a wide range of styles and colors, have many advantages over electric lighting. </p><h2>  The principle of sunlight </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nashprorab.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work street lights" class="if uuid-2327229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2327229.jpg"></div><p>  The operation of autonomous lamps is based on a fairly simple photovoltaic effect, which is used in the solar panel and photovoltaic cell.  In it, solar energy is accumulated throughout the day and then converted into direct current electricity to illuminate household plots and the adjacent territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Solar powered street lights are equipped with an intelligent controller that turns on the LED using stored energy.  The panel itself consists of many layers of crystalline silicon, as well as various chemicals that can create layers of negatively and positively charged electrons.  This conversion occurs using the semiconductor material of the device.  The generated electricity is stored in batteries.  At night, when the lighting is reduced to 10 lux, the battery supplies a voltage of about 4.5 V. </p><p>  The rays of the sun fall on a panel that is negatively charged, thereby activating the creation of electrons and holes in semiconductors.  The electric field in the pn junction separates the charged particles, a DC voltage appears, caused by the potential difference.  When a load is connected to such a source, a current appears in the circuit of the lighting network, the strength of which will depend on the level of insolation and the type of photocell, as well as the resistance of all devices connected to the source. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of alternative lighting </h2><p>  Benefits: </p><ol><li>  Unlimited source of energy.  Solar energy is inexhaustible.  As long as there is sunlight, there is no reason why you should not use solar-powered garden lights. </li><li>  Lack of AC power.  Instead, the lamps have small solar panels that use sunlight to charge the battery.  Many batteries store enough charge during the day to then provide illumination up to 10 hours at night, although their duration varies depending on weather conditions and the location of the panels.  They always work, even in the event of a power outage. </li><li>  Solar-powered streetlights are easily accessible for installation anywhere, without any restrictions regarding proximity to a power source. </li><li>  Efficiency and profitability.  Firstly, they are generally cheaper than AC luminaires.  Secondly, they are usually easy to use, do not require financial costs for installation and installation.  Thirdly, since they operate on solar energy, they do not increase the size of electricity bills. </li><li>  Environmental friendliness.  The production of energy that is spent for their work does not harm the environment through carbon dioxide emissions, as in the case of electricity generated by the production of energy from non-renewable sources. </li><li>  <span>Solar-powered</span> garden <span>luminaires</span> have such characteristics that their safety is greater than that of electric luminaires.  There are no electrical cables that pose a fire hazard.  Unlike electric lighting, which is turned off at night due to cost savings, they work for free all night, which is a strong security factor. </li><li>  Wide range of styles.  They are available in many colors and styles, suitable for a wide range of applications, including permanent installations and temporary decorations for parties, aesthetically pleasing and varied. </li></ol><p>  Disadvantages: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  They are still quite expensive. </li><li>  They operate with much lower power output, which means that they give less light. </li><li>  The "exit" of real light may depend on the weather. </li></ul><h2>  Selection options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoramobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street solar lights" class="if uuid-2327226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2327226.jpg"></div><p>  Not everyone knows how to choose the right fixtures to make the most of their features. </p><p>  To make the right choice, you first need to decide on the lighting function: </p><ul><li>  decorative, to decorate the overall design of the local area; </li><li>  security, for lighting security zones of the territory; </li><li>  tracer for lighting paths and sidewalks; </li><li>  solar garden pendant lamp; </li><li>  general purpose, full coverage of the house and the adjacent territory. </li></ul><p>  Lighting options: </p><ol><li>  The size of the solar panel.  The larger <span>the solar panel,</span> the more charge it can provide in the daytime, and therefore the greater the light output and duration. </li><li>  Working autonomous <span>battery life.</span>  <span>Solar-powered garden lights</span> should have a battery life of at least eight hours for every 24-hour cycle. </li><li>  The need for pre-charging.  Some must be pre-charged for up to two days before being put into operation, others are turned on immediately after installation. </li><li>  The presence of a day-night light sensor. </li><li>  IP rating, which means dust and moisture protection according to the EU standard.  For outdoor lighting, an IP44 rating is required - weather resistance. </li><li>  Availability of installation.  One of the main indicators. </li><li>  Warranty.  The longer the warranty, the better the quality of the product and the longer the operation will last. </li></ol><p>  Types of solar lamps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Lanterns. </li><li>  Solar powered garden balloons. </li><li>  Spotlights. </li><li>  Lamps. </li><li>  Decorative lanterns. </li><li>  Facing lights for fences and hedges. </li><li>  Track lights for warning of dangerous places such as a pond, ravines and more. </li><li>  Hanging on hooks. </li><li>  Wall mounted on homes or fences. </li></ol><h2>  Boomile 12 Pack Solar Lights Outdoor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.christophersherwin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street solar lights" class="if uuid-2327215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2327215.jpg"></div><p>  Solar powered garden lights for Boomile 12 have a new bright LED design.
