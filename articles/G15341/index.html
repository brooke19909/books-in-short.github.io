So, people who have a mathematical mindset are trying quickly and without delay to solve everyday problems and pay bills at the time.  But even in this case, if you have to solve hundreds of different questions every day, you can not only forget to pay utility bills, but also submit reports to the tax office in a timely manner. <br><br>  Delay in reporting can threaten such a forgetful person with considerable problems.  If for the first time you can get off with a slight startle and recommendations to hire a professional accountant, then the next time everything will turn out to be much more serious consequences in the form of penalties and checks of your small business.  Practice shows that many beginning businessmen, when registering their IP activities, often do not even have a clue about how and when to submit tax reports.  Developing their small business and solving many pressing problems, they are only at the very last moment trying to solve issues with tax reporting. <br><br>  Today, a site will help to cope with this problem, on which you will be provided with online assistance in creating reporting documents.  Here you can not only enter data on the company and get already prepared documents for reporting, but you can also calculate the amount of tax payments, as well as send all the documents to the supervisory authority via the Internet. <br><br>  With the advent of the tax calendar service on the website www.moedelo.org/nalogovii-kalendar, you can receive SMS notifications about the upcoming reporting by entering your company information in advance.  In online mode, you can see a schedule of upcoming events that must be carried out in compliance with the rules and legislation.  This allows you not to forget about the delivery of reports, and using the site service to receive documents already prepared for delivery. <br><br>  The appearance of such a site was a real salvation for many, because with its help you can not only save time, but also be sure that all reporting documents are correctly executed and in compliance with regulatory acts.  The ability to send reports online using the Internet allows you not to worry about accurate delivery on time.  Using the tax calendar, you can easily monitor the financial statements of any enterprise, regardless of the number of employees and the volume of commodity-money relations. </p></div></article>
