  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY paper doll house</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Agree, you can buy doll houses in stores as much as you like.  This is quick and easy, especially when the funds are unlimited.  But sometimes you want to give vent to your own imagination and come up with, for example, a house for a paper doll.  If you have several dolls, then the game will become more fun. </p><h2>  A bit of nostalgia </h2><p>  The adult generation that grew up during the Soviet Union may recall that before there was a rather interesting toy under the non-trivial name ‚ÄúAnina Apartment‚Äù.  This house for a paper doll was the ultimate dream for many girls.  There was something to dream about: the ordinary paper doll that came with it had an apartment with real furniture.  Previously, it was only necessary to cut out walls, doors that could open, and furniture blanks covered with wallpaper and paintings.  Then everything stuck together and a magical immersion in the game began. </p><h2>  More possibilities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rexlondon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building a house" class="if uuid-2918889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82913/2918889.jpg"></div><p>  Today there are more opportunities to get a similar toy.  In office supplies, anything you like is sold.  It is only a matter of fantasy and perseverance.  Let's make a house for your paper beauty too.  First, draw it with a ruler and a pencil.  We make sure that the walls, floor and ceiling are even, we will think over where the doors will be.  We also pay attention to the layout of housing for the paper ward. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a paper house for paper dolls? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rexlondon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ready house" class="if uuid-2918888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82913/2918888.jpg"></div><p>  You can carry out larger-scale construction and give your paper dolls a two-story house.  For stability, use cardboard from boxes.  Cut off the closing parts on one side of the box.  We put the blank ‚Äúon the edge‚Äù sideways.  It turns out that the closed part - it will be a wall on which you need to mark out a place for a window, and even, possibly, for a balcony. </p><p>  We cut out the windows.  When you need one big room, we leave everything as it is.  If you need two smaller rooms, we divide the box into two halves, using the cut off part, which is more authentic.  We look where the doorway will be.  We draw it, and also cut it out.  We place a partition in the middle of the doll house.  We fix with tape to the wall of cardboard housing.  The second floor of the house is made from the same cardboard box.  We put it on top of the previous box, and fasten the upper and lower parts together.  You can use a stapler for this.  The roof is made of two long cut pieces of cardboard. </p><p>  Well, now it's up to redecorating the dollhouse.  It all depends on the imagination of the designer, that is, you.  You can paste the walls with self-adhesive film, hang curtains on the windows.  Draw small pictures and decorate the room with these masterpieces.  Cute pieces of fabric (carpets) are laid on the floor, and modular furniture can be made from matchboxes.  In general, the game has begun. </p>
