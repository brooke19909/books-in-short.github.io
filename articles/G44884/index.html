    <h2>  Tropical island in the Gulf of Thailand </h2><p>  Phu Quoc?  Phu Quoc?  Fucoc?  Phu Quoc?  How right?  It does not matter.  All options are correctly perceived in search engines, but in Russian the name Fukuok is most often used.  So, this is a wonderful tropical island with palm trees and sandy beaches, as in adventure stories about pirates and treasures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel winerl phu quoc" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/2066946.jpg"></div>  The best time to relax in the tropics is from November to March, when the sun is gentle and the water is warm, and you can completely forget about the gray rainy weekdays in our northern cities.

Despite the fact that there are a lot of people on the beach, the water is spotlessly clean.  Also, the beach light yellow sand is always and surprisingly clean, so that children can sculpt sand towers, cakes or dig tunnels from it safely.  They also have a convenient entrance to the sea, which, combined with shallow water, warm water and the absence of waves, will make hours spent on the beach as calm as possible for parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel winerl phu quoc vietnam" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/2066953.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Among the shortcomings, the poorly developed trade infrastructure and the complete isolation of the hotel from the outside world are mentioned, which, however, many lovers of exotic, on the contrary, like.  Some complain about the lack of children's attractions and the services of animators.  And a large number of complaints are caused by exorbitant prices for alcohol and various tricks with a payment system, because of which many tourists are forced to spend additional funds to enjoy their vacation to the fullest. </p><p>  <span>However, the hospitality and care of the staff, tropical exoticism and the abundance of delicious dishes and drinks more than pay for some of the shortcomings of the beginner but already successful Winperl Fukuok Hotel and give our Russian tourists a pleasant sunny vacation in the middle of autumn and winter cold.</span> </p>
