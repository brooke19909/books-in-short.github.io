Make a decoupage.  There are many ideas for decoupage plates.  The technique, method and sequence of actions are almost identical in all cases.  Below are the most common ideas for creating such beautiful products. </p><h2>  Decoupage napkins: what you need </h2><p>  In the decoupage technique, napkins use multilayer napkins.  To work, you need a top layer.  The napkin should be glued to the back of the plate.  From above, it is necessary to paint it with a layer of acrylic paint and varnish in order to give strength to the product. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  cotton pad; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  paint; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  acrylic lacquer. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkins for decoupage transparent plates" class="if uuid-2421827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2421827.jpg"></div><h2>  Craquelure technique </h2><p>  According to this decoupage technique, the plate, before applying the drawing, is treated with special paint.  It cracks after drying, which gives the product an "antique effect." </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  cotton pad; </li><li>  alcohol; </li><li>  plate; </li><li>  water-based paint; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  hair dryer; </li><li>  napkins. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage glass plate" class="if uuid-2421825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2421825.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step plate design instructions </h2><ol><li>  First you need to prepare a plate, clean and degrease. </li><li>  Apply water-based paint with a brush evenly on the surface and wait until it dries. </li><li>  Then completely paint over the surface with glue. </li><li>  After the glue dries, apply a second coat of paint. </li><li>  Without waiting for the paint to dry, direct a hot stream of air from the hair dryer onto the surface of the product.  Under the influence of warm air, the paint will crack.  The longer the exposure to heat, the larger the cracks. </li></ol><p>  The product can be decorated with napkins.  The dried plate is covered with several layers of colorless acrylic varnish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  With eggshell </h2><p>  What is this decoupage technique?  Apply it to obtain similarities with the effect of craquelure, in addition to the picture, paste the eggshell. </p><p>  A pattern is glued onto the prepared surface.

Now we will tell.  One of the most important moments during decoupage is the preparation of the material with which work will go.  The plate should be clean, dry and fat free.  To do this, pour a little alcohol on a <span>cotton</span> pad and wipe the back of the plate. </li><li>  Start with the measurements, the piece of fabric should fit the plate in size. </li><li>  Measure the plate and cut a suitable size. </li><li>  Apply an even layer of glue to the back of the plate with a brush. </li><li>  It is necessary to place the fabric on the back of the plate, smooth the edges, pushing air bubbles with your fingers. </li><li>  Place each plate on the glass face down and let dry.  It will take several hours to fully dry. </li><li>  After the glue has dried, cut the edges with sharp scissors. </li><li>  To protect the surface of the decorated plates, apply varnish to their back. </li><li>  The front side is absolutely safe for eating. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftynest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage plates at home" class="if uuid-2421819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2421819.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage fabric straight </h2><p>  How do decoupage plates with cloth?  The technique is the same as in the previous case.  Work begins with the degreasing of the plate.  Then apply a layer of glue.  The pattern / fabric is placed on the front of the plate.  Its diameter should exceed the size of the plate by a couple of centimeters.  After the glue dries, the edges are carefully trimmed and glued again. </p><p>  The next step is varnishing, so that the drawing holds well.  As a rule, such products are used exclusively for decoration. </p><h2>  Plate Decoupage Workshop </h2><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  a transparent glass plate (any shape) with a flat bottom without patterns; </li><li>  <span>decorative paper</span> for the central part of the plate: wrapping, magazine, any image, greeting card, etc. </li><li>  openwork napkins; </li><li>  acrylic paint; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Do not use an image printed on an inkjet printer.  Because ink will interact with water-based glue.  Glossy photos do not fit well.  Because they resist glue, as a result of which there will be poor adhesion between the photo and the glass, air bubbles will form.  Greeting cards with different textures or glitter are not very suitable.  Regular postcards are perfect, thick enough paper, the pattern on the opposite side does not appear.  Wrapping paper will also work.  Using it, you can create an infinite number of variations. </p><h2>  Step 1: paper preparation </h2><p>  Now we will tell you how to make a decoupage of a glass plate.  It is necessary to remove the price tag from the plate and wash it in hot soapy water.  Dust must be removed so that the glue sticks better.  Wipe thoroughly, avoid getting any particles of dirt on the plate.  You need to cut a piece of paper for the center of the plate.  Its diameter should be slightly larger than the diameter of the bottom of the plate. </p><h2>  Step 2: gluing paper </h2><p>  Using a layer of glue, glue the paper (which was prepared for the center of the plate) to the back.  In this case, the image should face the glass.  Until the glue has dried, it is necessary to smooth out all the folds and air bubbles. </p><h2>  Step 3: napkin preparation </h2><p>  Take a lacy napkin and cut the pattern so that it matches the edging of the plate.  You may need more than one napkin, then the individual parts will have to be connected.  Using glue, fix them on the edging of the plate. </p><p>  With patting movements, ‚Äúexpel‚Äù all air bubbles.  After let the glue dry completely.  Apply another layer of glue to the entire back of the plate (center) to seal the paper.  Allow the product to dry completely. </p><h2>  Step 4: painting the back </h2><p>  Then paint the entire back of the plate with acrylic paint.  You may need to make several layers.  This is necessary so that there are no unpainted areas on the plate.  Allow each layer to dry well and only then apply the next. </p><h2>  Step 5: applying varnish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage technique" class="if uuid-2421824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2421824.jpg"></div><p>  Apply a finishing coat (glossy varnish) to the back of the plate.  This is done in order to protect the paint and ensure its durability.  It is absolutely necessary to use varnish or polyurethane in order to make the decor of the plate more waterproof. </p><p>  Plate decoration is complete!  It can be placed on a wall or shelf.  Such a plate can be a great gift for a holiday or birthday. </p><h2>  Plate Care: Recommendations </h2><p>  Care Tips: </p><ol><li>  The plate can be used for serving food, as the front part is absolutely safe. </li><li>  Do not wash in a dishwasher or immerse completely in water.  Do not wipe the back with a sponge brush or using abrasive detergents. </li><li>  Try not to wet the back of the plate.  Short-term exposure to water (quick rinse) is acceptable, but be sure to wipe it dry with a soft towel. </li></ol><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage transparent plates" class="if uuid-2421826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2421826.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to make decoupage plates with napkins, enough for beginners and ideas in the article.  Do not forget that the decoupage technique gives you complete freedom of action and imagination.  At minimal cost, you can create completely exclusive things. </p>
