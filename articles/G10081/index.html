    <h2>  Enterprise Development </h2><p>  Talking about the reliability rating available for such an organization as Rosenergobank, it is necessary to talk about how the company got on its feet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was founded in 1992.  Then the organization was known as Empils Bank.  Four years later, she gained the status of a closed joint-stock company.  And six years later she changed her name.  The one that we know now.  For several years, the company developed and made a name for itself, and in 2010, thanks to an additional issue of shares, it increased its authorized capital by 600 million rubles.  And it was amazing, because until that moment it was only 99 million.  After such a leap, success was followed - the client base expanded, and in 2015 the legal form was changed to AO. </p><p>  But the most important thing is that since 2005, Rosenergobank has also been participating in <span>the deposit insurance system</span> .  Reliability rating due to this he has grown.  This again attracted a certain circle of customers who were worried about their money. </p><p>  In recent years, the company has been developing steadily.  The number of net assets of the bank increased by 22.3%.  And this is from the beginning of 2015.  That is, in fact, for the year.  In numbers, this amount is 10.8 billion rubles.  Thanks to such a profit, the bank compensated for the outflow of finances from the accounts of organizations and paid off issued bills. </p>

    <h2>  news </h2><p>  Well, as you can see, the rating of the bank (Rosenergobank) in terms of reliability is not bad.  And this is once again confirmed by recent news. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, for example, on December 22, 2016, it was announced that this organization took 81th place in the rating of 99 <span>best banks of the Russian</span> Federation published by The White Square Journal for 2016.  The analysts who compiled this list took into account several criteria.  It was important how convenient Internet banking and a mobile application were, whether customers were satisfied, whether the brand was recognizable, whether the company was developing dynamically, and its financial indicators were taken into account.  The level of TOP management, social activity and corporate culture were also considered. </p>

    <h2>  The best for customers </h2><p>  Rosenergobank is trying to follow this simple and short rule.  The reliability rating (reviews confirm this) is good, and all thanks to the fact that the organization regularly makes favorable offers to its customers. </p><p>  For example, on December 15, 2016, the enterprise decided to increase the maximum loan amount for a military mortgage to 2,100,000 rubles while maintaining the previous rate (11.5%).  Even in Sberbank, the leader everywhere and in all respects, the maximum possible for employees of the state is 2,050,000 rubles. </p><p>  Also, since the beginning of December, pleasant privileges have been announced for cardholders of the UnionPay international system.  Until March 2017, they will receive a 30% discount if they pay with a card in European, Asian and American shopping centers and stores. </p><p>  Another important news became known on the last day of October.  It turned out that the company reduced rates by 0.25% per annum for three mortgage programs.  The most popular, by the way.  These are ‚ÄúMortgage with state support‚Äù, ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuying an apartment at the construction stage‚Äù. </p><p>  Also in the fall, conditions for consumer loans were improved.  The maximum amount possible for processing on credit increased, and the rates were reduced. </p><p>  And this is just the news over the past few months.  And even after reading them, you can understand that Rosenergobank really cares about its customers.  Reliability rating confirms, but the best proof that the organization is good is grateful people using its services.  And there are many. </p>
