And thanks to the various events that took place daily in 2015, Plze≈à was proclaimed the cultural capital of Europe.  Today we will talk about the most beautiful <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof the Czech Republic,</span> which is no less inferior in magnificence to Prague itself. </p><h2>  A city whose development plan resembles a chessboard </h2><p>  Located in Western Bohemia, Pilsen (Czech Republic) is located at the intersection of four rivers merging into one tributary of the Vltava - Berounka.  The picturesque city that has preserved its historical features has not escaped modern architectural trends.

And on New Year's Eve, all visitors who arrived in Pilsen (Czech Republic) are pleased with the live tree, exuding an amazing aroma.  In the heart of the old city are the main historical monuments that appeared several centuries ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plzen czech republic photo" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1553809.jpg" width="600"></div>
