  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ancient Greek god Deimos: mythological and serial</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who is Deimos?  One of the gods of ancient Greece, terrifying mortals.  This is a mythology.  According to the series "The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules," Deimos is a blonde type with a nasty laugh. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider both characters: both mythological and the one that the series talks about. </p><h2>  According to myths </h2><p>  Deimos is the god of horrors.  The bloodthirsty son of the god of war Ares and the beautiful goddess of love Aphrodite.  Mythology indicates that Ares with Aphrodite is a brother and sister.  Accordingly, we are dealing with closely related inbreeding or, in other words, incest.  What could be the result?  From an illegal union an unpredictable creature was born - Deimos.  And according to mythology, he had a twin brother - Phobos, personifying fear. </p><p>  Deimos had a normal appearance.  But the character is such a horror.  No wonder the guy was awarded the title of god of horrors on Olympus. </p><p>  What was the god of horror Deimos, judging by myths?  The result of the madness of war and the madness of love.  Of course, nothing good could be there.  Absolutely unpredictable god.  It was impossible to predict what to expect from him in a few minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greekmythology.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mythical Deimos" class="if uuid-2518869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2518869.jpg"></div><p>  The bloodthirstiness of Deimos deserves a separate topic.  He accompanied his father in all battles and was not inferior to him in the thirst for blood and the ability to wield a sword.  Deimos killed for the sake of excitement, hunting instincts worked very well for him.  He enjoyed as long as the victim resisted.  As soon as she stopped resistance, the god of horror lost interest in her and began to look for a new one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main function of the god Deimos was to sow horror and confusion.  He took on great responsibility, generously irrigating the earth with blood.  As mentioned above, accompanied Ares in the battles.  Together with him on the battlefield were Brother Phobos, who was responsible for fear, the goddess Eris - the main by contention on Olympus and Enio - the goddess of fierce war, the eternal companion of Ares. </p><h2>  Deimos from the series </h2><p>  In 1995, the series dedicated to the ancient Greek hero Hercules was released.  It was called - "The amazing journey of Hercules."  And by itself, its action took place in Ancient Greece, in the story many inhabitants of Olympus were involved. </p><p>  One of these, the eternal enemies of Hercules and his companion, Iolaus, were Ares, disharmony (Eris) and Deimos.  What is he, the ancient Greek god Deimos from the specified series?  The exact opposite of the <span>mythological character.</span>  It‚Äôs such a tall, very skinny blonde creature dressed up in an ridiculous dark brown leather suit, the bottom of which resembles panties, from which the skinny legs of the god of horrors stick out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disharmony and Deimos" class="if uuid-2518908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2518908.jpg"></div><p>  In the series, he is Ares's nephew.  Who the parents of Deimos is unknown.  At first, the version was popular that his mother was disharmony corresponding to the mythological Eris.  Then it turned out that she was a cousin of Deimos and Ares‚Äôs girlfriend.  It is a girlfriend, not a sister. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The serial Deimos behaves funny.  He constantly tries to do some nasty things to Hercules, but nothing comes of it.  The mind is not enough to outwit the demigod.  Although it is rather strange that God cannot defeat the mortal <span>son of Zeus.</span>  With a deafening crack, the god Deimos regularly fails one or another task that Ares gives him.  Moreover, the latter does not differ in patience.  He is very insidious, damn smart and dazzlingly handsome.  As Ares from the series, possessing simply stunning qualities of a "bad uncle", suffers a parody of the horror god next to him - remains a mystery. </p><p>  And Deimos from the series laughs so that around the bird from the trees they fall and fight in near-death convulsions.  With one laugh he could repeatedly kill Hercules.  But abilities are enough only for innocent birds. </p><p>  In general, it can be described as a complex divine misunderstanding.  Deimos was amazingly played by actor Joel Tobeck. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marishalna.altervista.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ares and Deimos" class="if uuid-2518912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2518912.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  One of the moons of the planet Mars is named after the god of horrors. </li><li>  The satellite Deimos, as well as Phobos, is always turned to Mars with only one side. </li><li>  One day, Deimos will fall on Mars, according to scientists, and Phobos will collapse. </li><li>  In shape, this satellite resembles a cobblestone. </li><li>  Deimos is considered one of the smallest satellites of the planet. </li><li>  There is a hypothesis that once there was only one satellite of Mars.  Then it split, and Phobos and Deimos turned out. </li><li>  According to myths, Deimos had an expressive appearance. </li><li>  Now on the Internet you can find information that Deimos is the god of war.  It's a lie.  He never was, the patron of Greek warriors always considered Ares. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mythcrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mars and its moons" class="if uuid-2518865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2518865.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, from the article you learned about two Deimos.  One of them is a mythical god, terrifying the ancient Greeks.  He loved blood and chaos, sowed suffering, and was the son of Ares and Aphrodite. </p><p>  The Deimos from the series is completely different.  He is very stupid, always gets into stupid situations and can not cope with the demigod Hercules. </p>
