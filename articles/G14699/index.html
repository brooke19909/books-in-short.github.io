This article will talk about how they are decrypted.  Photos of emoticons in the iPhone will also be presented.  The article will be needed by those who plan to purchase such a device in the near future, and those who already have it, but cannot figure out the interface.  Another goal of the article is to tell you what emoticons mean in iPhone. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Everyone who has ever held an iPhone in their hands and who used this phone knows that it has a huge number of functions and add-ons that are not on ordinary devices.  It doesn‚Äôt even matter which model of the phone is on display, it is generally recognized that there are many pleasant improvements. </p><p>  By the way, an interesting fact: at the moment, there are almost 1,500 emoticons on a variety of topics in the iPhone.  This breaks the stereotype that the emoji language is practically undeveloped. </p><p>  One of these improvements is just emoticons.  Undoubtedly, there are ‚Äúemotions‚Äù on Apple devices that are very different from ordinary ones.  Next, we will talk about the meaning of emoticons in the "iPhone". </p><h2>  How to unlock emoticons </h2><p>  So, it's time to find out what special emoticons this phone has in store.  First of all, to see them, on many devices you need to unlock them: </p><ol><li>  Go to the main settings section and find the "Keyboard" item there.  Go to this menu. </li><li>  Next, go to the "New Keyboards" menu. </li><li>  In it, find the sub-item "Emoji" and click on it. </li><li>  Done, you activated emoticons!  Now you can find them in a quick set of keyboards and instantly switch to them from any language. <div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where are the emoticons" class="if uuid-3205113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205113.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Now you can make out which emoticons this smartphone provides.  Most of them are no different from other systems, but there are a few emoticons that look completely different.  Also in the "iPhone" there are several emojis that simply do not exist on other platforms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Differences from ordinary </h2><p>  From the very beginning, it is worth noting that the semantic load that emoticons carry is the same on all devices, but is implemented differently everywhere. </p><p>  Simply put, the value of emoticons on the iPhone will not differ from the value of related emojis on other devices.  This is actually very good, otherwise users simply would not understand each other. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, it can be concluded that emoticons differ only in appearance, but quite significantly. </p><h2>  A bit about animated emoticons </h2><p>  Some additional applications allow you to create animations.  They also give a decoding of what the emoticons mean in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù.  On the latest models of the device, this function is built directly into the phone itself. </p><p>  In this paragraph, we will analyze the animation in a bit more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mashable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Animated Smiley" class="if uuid-3205049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205049.jpg"></div><p>  In general, animation is a novelty in the field of communication, but users really like it.  This is a special kind of emoticons that helps to convey not only direct emotion, but also laughter, tone, as well as facial expressions. </p><p>  We can confidently say that soon animated emoticons will gradually begin to adapt to other platforms. </p><h2>  Simple emoticons </h2><p>  Of course, among the many special emoticons there are ordinary ones.  As a rule, these are basic emoticons that we use every day, however, there are a couple of improvements on the ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù, thanks to which it is more pleasant to look at the objects in question.  For instance: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Emoticons can start to pulsate or even move according to their value. </li><li>  Emoji are better designed, drawn and adapted to the design of the application. </li></ul><h2>  The value of emoticons in general </h2><p>  The general importance of emoticons in ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, and in human life, and in communication as a whole cannot be overestimated.  They help convey emotions, mood, more fully reflect the question or exclamation. </p><p>  With the help of emoticons you can express your feelings and remind the other person that he means something to us.  They also help when a person does not have enough time.  One emoji can replace a whole sentence, and that is a fact.  To some extent, it can even be argued that we are talking about the language of modern youth. </p><p>  The importance of emoticons in "iPhone", of course, is also great, but there is one more addition: they create the design of almost all applications where they are used.  The surroundings and the emoji atmosphere on these phones are simply unrealistic.  The person who uses them feels the difference from the other options, and this is also a big plus in the piggy bank of the campaign. </p><h2>  Detailed description of some emoticons </h2><p>  Time to talk about a few specific emoticons, which are not only the most popular among iPhone users, but also are beautiful, unique.  It is advisable to describe in detail the five emojis. </p><p>  So: </p><ol><li>  Emoticon "Zombies". <div class="photo" data-original="www.itp.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zombie man" class="if uuid-3205312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205312.jpg"></div>  This emoji, like many others, has appeared on iPhones along with the eleventh platform update.  Looking at this emoticon, it is easy to guess how it deciphers: ‚Äúwildly tired‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel like a zombie‚Äù, ‚ÄúI lose interest in everything‚Äù.  Often, such emoticons are sent by working people to each other in the morning, because it is at this time of day that a person looks like a walking dead man most of all.  This emoji also has prototypes on other devices, and messengers have long entered this emoticon into their panel, as it is popular in society. </li><li>  Frozen Emoji. <div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frozen emoticon" class="if uuid-3205882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205882.jpg"></div>  No one will doubt that it stands for "terribly cold," "froze to death," "cudgel," and so on.  This emoticon is simply incredibly popular among people due to the fact that it is made in an unusual style.  A smile also appeared in one of the latest updates and caused a storm of emotions among users, especially with regard to Russian speakers.  This is not surprising, because it is in our country that the frosts are so severe that not a single emoticon, except this one, can convey them.  The only negative of this emoticon, like most of the others that we are considering, is that it does not appear on other platforms.  This emoji is only available on iPhones, and this makes it even more unique.  Of course, there is a prototype of the emoticon, but the original, of course, is much more colorful. </li><li>  Brain Explosion emoticon. <div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brain explosion" class="if uuid-3205899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205899.jpg"></div>  This is another emoticon that is still in the top for use.  They use it in a variety of situations, for example, when the interlocutor found out dizzying news or if someone said something complicated and incomprehensible.  This emoticon arrived from the already beloved update at number eleven, although there were analogs in previous versions.  Most often, emoticons are used by adolescents and children, as their lifestyle implies the constant acquisition of new knowledge.  There are no analogues to this emoticon.  It is unique in nature and looks really charismatic. </li><li>  Angry Emoji. <div class="photo" data-original="www.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Evil smile" class="if uuid-3205913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205913.jpg"></div>  This emoticon was one of the most anticipated in the eleventh update, but added it a bit later.  What word is hidden under censorship signs, one can only guess.  This emoji is used to demonstrate pain and aggression.  There are many analogues of this emoticon, and they are made very cool.  However, the most charismatic is the iPhone. </li><li>  Wry smiley. <div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grimacing emoticon" class="if uuid-3205897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3205897.jpg"></div>  This emoji is used in a variety of situations.  Very often he is sent in response to a joke, and sometimes when the interlocutor does not understand what it is about.  So, he responds with this very emoticon.  Therefore, we can safely say that it can replace almost any other smile.  Making such an emotional and charismatic emoji is very hard work.  The developers and authors managed to complete it on a solid five. </li></ol><h2>  Emoticon update </h2><p>  It‚Äôs also not a secret for anyone that Apple releases many updates that apply to all corners of the system.  Updates also affect the <span>decoding of emoticons in the</span> iPhone.  Their description and design changes.  Often people are unhappy with such updates, but in general, they accept the design of more modern emojis, referring to their uniqueness.  It is worth noting that the value of the new emoticons on the "iPhones" does not change.  On the contrary, for the convenience of communication, an increasing number of stickers are being adapted to devices. </p><p>  However, sometimes with the system update completely new emoticons appear, but they are similar to those that already exist. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, we note that deciphering the meaning of emoticons in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù is not so difficult;  This information will be useful and necessary for users.  Thanks to this article, you can better navigate communication programs, and also at times brighter to convey your emotions to the interlocutor.  It should be borne in mind that actually using emoji is very useful and we recommend this to everyone. </p>
