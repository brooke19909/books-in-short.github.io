It is worth noting immediately that it is the largest among those institutions that have foreign capital.  All shares are owned by UniCredit Bank Austria AG, whose head office is located in Austria. </p>

    <p>  It is one of the largest banks in Russia, playing an important role in the financial and economic life of society. </p><h2>  What services does it provide? </h2><p>  Since UniCredit Bank is one of the largest players in the banking services market, the list of its financial products is quite wide.  This includes loans, deposits, acquiring, cash management services and much more. </p><p>  If we talk about deposit programs, then the bank‚Äôs policy does not go beyond the average framework of established market norms.  For example, for 3 months for a contribution in rubles - about 9.3%.  Of course, you can easily find financial institutions that offer 3-4% more than UniCredit Bank.  St. Petersburg is no exception, here you can also find bank branches that offer higher rates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Market policy is the same as for all large banks with foreign capital </h2><p>  But you can notice the trend and market conditions on which all banks that have foreign capital offer cooperation.  Since they are financed in foreign currency, they do not need high <span>cash requirements</span> from the USA or the European Union.  This is reflected in low deposit rates in dollars or euros (about 1-3%). </p><p>  Meanwhile, relatively low rates can be observed.  Why?  There are at least two reasons for this. </p>

    <p>  The first is the total cash flow.  Since such banks are represented in many large regions by a wide and developed network consisting of branches, offices, ATMs, they can afford to accumulate a large cash flow from all over the country. </p><p>  This allows us not to be focused on a certain category of clients or on the principles of a regional economy, depending on the infrastructure and industrial development of the area in which the bank is present. </p><h2>  It makes no sense to attract new customers by changing rates - image plays a role </h2><p>  Due to this, you can collect money from everywhere and from everyone.  Thus, the amount of deposits is growing quite simply.  After all, somewhere there will always be people who do not want to make money on their contribution, but simply want to save money in a safe place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second is <span>the image of a</span> bank that belongs to a foreign financial group with a high image.  Of course, people trust these institutions more and are ready to give them money, considering them a reliable place to store their savings. </p><p>  After all, who do you want to give your money to - a bank that exists for one week or a large financial group that has worked for a large number of years and is represented in a certain number of foreign countries? </p>

    <p>  After all, foreign capital is protected from the political situation or the problems of the economy of one country, since in case of need, financial resources can be easily transferred from outside. </p><p>  All this contributes to the fact that large banks, which are part of an international financial group, have no need to conquer the market by increasing the proposed deposit rates. </p><h2>  Mutually beneficial cooperation </h2><p>  The issue of partnerships with other banks, despite excellent positions, is one of the priorities.  From this article you will learn what are the partner banks of UniCredit Bank, how to take advantage of a wide partner network and other benefits of such banking relationships. </p>

    <p>  Often, banks agree on cooperation to increase the number of active customers.  Typically, such cooperation is manifested in combining ATM networks, making payments at preferential prices, as well as joint servicing of several financial services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What are the partner banks of Unicredit Bank? </h2><p>  Due to the fact that this bank is part of an international group, it is very cool for customers to travel abroad, since there are many connected banking institutions. </p><p>  So, the UniCredit group is represented in 14 European countries, such as Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, etc. That is, even during travel, you can use ATMs and bank services on favorable terms. </p><p>  If we consider the scale of the Russian Federation, the partner banks of UniCredit Bank are as follows: </p><ul><li>  URALSIB Bank; </li><li>  <span>Moscow Credit Bank</span> ; </li><li>  Raiffeisenbank. </li></ul><p>  What gives such a collaboration?  First of all, customers have access to a wide network of ATMs, in which there is the possibility of withdrawing money without a commission: about 1000 of their own, more than 2680 pcs.  has URALSIB, about 900 pcs.  Moscow Credit Bank, more than 7000 pcs.  accounts for Raiffeisenbank. </p>

    <p>  It turns out that the customers of UniCredit Bank JSC have access to a network of more than 10,000 ATMs in which they can be serviced at "home" rates.  That is, the commission charged on operations is the same as it would be in your financial institution. </p><p>  It turns out that, including the partner banks of UniCredit Bank, <span>the</span> customer <span>service network is</span> quite large, and wherever you are, there will always be the opportunity to use banking services. </p><h2>  Banks love to work with insurance companies. </h2><p>  The main advantage of such cooperation can be considered the agency, which the bank receives for attracting new customers under the auspices of the insurance company.  In this case, cooperation is beneficial to both parties. </p><p>  Firstly, the customer base will expand immediately, because the bank has a lot of opportunities to offer its customers insurance - a new or old loan, cross-sales to other banking products and others. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, the insurance company will not need to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù a lot of its representative offices throughout the city.  Simply establish a mobile connection with the bank. </p><p>  For all this, the bank takes a certain percentage, which is called the agency premium.  UniCredit Bank, whose partner insurance companies have established active cooperation, also makes money on this, and it‚Äôs quite good, given the large number of contracts concluded. </p><p>  And there are really a lot of partners among insurance companies, and very different ones.  The following are the most famous: Ingosstrakh IJSC, Rosgosstrakh OJSC, AlfaStrakhovanie OJSC and many others. </p><h2>  Where can I find bank branches? </h2><p>  Since this financial institution is large enough for the Russian market, branches are present almost everywhere.  UniCredit Bank, whose branches are represented in 25 regions of the country, is present in 69 cities. </p><p>  Moreover, in each of them you will find not one, but several or the same many branches, ATMs and offices, which makes the bank closer to each client.  Wherever you live, you can always find UniCredit Bank nearby.  St. Petersburg has 15 branches and offices of this financial institution.  This is a fairly large number of branches, especially in comparison with other banks. </p><p>  It is logical that in Moscow, the capital of Russia, which is the financial center of the country, there are more representative offices from such a financial organization as UniCredit Bank.  Departments can be found both on Mira Avenue, 97, and ul.  Ostozhenko, d. 5. These offices are given as an example as one of the most popular. </p>

    <p>  Even if you live in Rostov-on-Don, you can easily find UniCredit Bank.  The addresses of the popular branches are as follows: st.  Socialist 58/51 and st.  Tekucheva 139/94. </p><p>  Even if specifically in your city there is no this bank and you think that you cannot withdraw money from an ATM without commissions, then do not worry.  UniCredit Bank's partner banks in Russia will help you out.  As mentioned earlier, in a united banking network, operations at their ATMs are charged in the same way as in their own devices of the financial institution serving you. </p>
