    <h2>  What is a free IPTV from Rostelecom? </h2><p>  When a user signs a contract with this company for the provision of digital television services, a basic tariff is connected, which includes a set of paid and free programs.  In this case, even after blocking due to non-paid list of free channels still remains available to the user. </p><h2>  What channels can I watch for free? </h2><p>  These IPTV channels can be watched for free: </p><ol><li>  NTV. </li><li>  "Russia 1". </li><li>  ORT. </li><li>  "Russia K". </li><li>  Match TV. </li><li>  Channel Five. </li><li>  "Carousel". </li><li>  "TV Center". </li><li>  "First channel". </li><li>  "Russia 24". </li></ol><p>  Connecting a tariff with a minimum fee will cost 320 rubles per month.  All this month 126 channels will be available.  In case of non-payment, only 10 channels will work.  This is a free IPTV from Rostelecom. </p><p>  It is worth noting that only a few users do just that.  But compared to other providers that immediately cut off access to services if they do not pay, Rostelecom is more humane.  And a similar "trick" on their part with conditionally free <span>IPTV television is</span> really pleasant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  IPTV settings from Rostelecom via a router </h2><p>  Often users watch IPTV television on a computer via a Wi-Fi router.  This is easiest because  you don‚Äôt even need a prefix, and accordingly, nothing is needed.  It is only important that your router supports the IGMP protocol.  Almost all modern routers support it. </p><p>  IGMP has been successfully used to support video streaming, which is ideal for implementing IPTV.  To watch the video directly, you need to go to your personal account (your account) on the provider's website and select the iptv track (link). </p><p>  Now install the IPTV player.  Ideal for LVC Player or Ace Stream Player.  These are free programs that can be downloaded on the official website of the developer.  Install the program, open it.  Click "Tools - Settings - All - Playlist".  There will be a line "Stream by default".  Paste there a link with a list of TV channels that you copied in your account‚Äôs personal account.  Now save the changes and restart the program.  When you restart, the channels will begin broadcasting, you can switch them by clicking on the "Show playlist" button.  A full list of IPTV Player channels available for viewing will be displayed there.  Click with the mouse 2 times on the channel you like, and its display will immediately begin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  IPTV settings from Rostelecom via the console </h2><p>  Setting up the console in any case involves setting up the router.  In the router itself, we need to make a "bridge" between two ports - LAN and WAN.  It is important to note that this function is not available in all routers, and in some it is called differently.  For example, in TP-LINK routers you need to enable it in the Network - Bridge settings.  On Asus models, it's called the "Wan Bridge Port."  In order for IPTV channels to be successfully shown, we need to connect the set-top box to the WAN port.  But this port is occupied by internet cable by default.  Therefore, a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù should be built between the WAN and the LAN port.  And we will then connect the prefix to the LAN port, which, thanks to our configuration, is now also a WAN port. </p>

    <h2>  Health Check </h2><p>  Just before setting up IPTV from Rostelecom, you need to check if IPTV works at all, and if there are any errors on the provider's side.  To do this, connect the computer or laptop to the provider's cable directly.  It is easy to do.  The way how to do it has already been described above.  If the picture appears on the screen, then everything is fine.  You can proceed directly to the setup. </p><h2>  Router setup </h2><p>  The first thing to do is create a bridge between the WAN and the LAN port.  Open the settings of the router, select "Network - Bridge" in the menu.  There will be the line "LAN port bridged with WAN".  Here we can choose which port to combine with the main <span>WAN port.</span>  For example, select 1. This means that now the WAN port will be aligned with LAN1.  It is in it that we need to connect the prefix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Important: if you have several IPTV consoles, then in the settings you need to select a bridge between the two LAN and WAN ports.  There is a corresponding option in the drop-down menu. </p><h2>  Connection to the console </h2><p>  After setting up the router, we connect the prefix to it (in the LAN1 port).  Now we connect the <span>console</span> itself <span>to the TV.</span>  Usually, an HDMI cable is used for this, which should be bundled with the console itself.  If this is an old model, then the HDMI interface and cable may not be included.  Then we connect the console to the TV using tulips.  Although if there is an HDMI interface, but there is no cable, it is better to just buy the cable itself.  Through the HDMI interface, the picture will look much better. </p><p>  Therefore, consider this recommendation: choose a set-top box with an HDMI interface, even if it comes out a little more expensive.  Higher cost justifies itself with better image and sound quality. </p>

    <h2>  Source selection </h2><p>  Now we take the remote control from the TV (not from the router) and select the "Source" menu (or something like that).  Here we need to select the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù HDMI, that is, the interface into which the cable from the set-top box enters.  Typically, the source button has the form of a small square with an arrow or the inscription "Source".  If the prefix was connected via tulips, then select the source "RCA".  Choose a source?  Excellent!  We are waiting for the download of the IPTV TV set-top box. </p><h2>  Work with remote control </h2><p>  Typically, the prefix loads quickly (ten seconds).  If you did everything correctly, then already at this stage a list of TV channels that are available for viewing will be displayed on the TV screen.  Switch between them using the remote control from the console and choose what you like. </p><p>  If you are watching a TV channel and want to choose another, then click "OK" on the remote control.  This button usually activates the <span>list of TV channels.</span>  Now select another channel and press "OK" again.  So with just one ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button and arrows, you can already use almost the full functionality of the console.  Next, you will figure out for yourself how to add channels to your favorites (they will be displayed very first), watch a TV program, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Problems setting up IPTV from Rostelecom </h2><p>  You may encounter various problems during the setup process.  Below will be described the answers to the main questions. </p><p>  Problem 1. The latest firmware is on the router, the bridge is configured, but the television still does not work. </p><p>  Solution: to begin with, it is worth checking whether the television works without a console.  Connect the provider's cable directly to the computer.  Even if television does not work in this way, it means the problem is on the provider side.  Call technical support and solve a problem with them. </p><p>  Problem 2. The router does not support the bridge (Bridge function).  Television still works, but picture quality suffers. </p><p>  This is logical, because without the Bridge function, the load on the router increases significantly, and the image quality depends directly on the load on the router.  If the TV is not connected using Bridge, then when working on a computer torrent, DC ++ and other data loading programs, image quality will suffer.  Try to limit the download speed (in the program settings you can set the download speed limit), this should solve the problem.  In general, it is better not to connect more than one IPTV set-top box to routers without Bridge support. </p><p>  Problem 3. You have several IPTV consoles for two televisions, and the router without Bridge features.  Naturally, the router will not be able to provide a normal video stream immediately to 2 TVs.  In this case, there is also a solution - you need to use a simple switch.  We connect 2 consoles to it, the provider's cable and the cable from the router from the WAN port. </p><p>  Problem 4. If the provider provides the connection of the set-top box only via cable.  Not all users want to drag different wires through the apartment.  The problem is especially relevant if the TV is in a remote corner of the room, to which it is difficult to lay wires. </p><p>  There is also a solution in this case - use the TL-WA701ND access point, which will allow you to connect the IPTV set-top box and the router via a Wi-Fi interface.  But for this, you will have to install special firmware on the access point. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iptv channels" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1838271.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <h2>  Nothing happens </h2><p>  If even after the operations you have failed, you need to call the provider and ask the support service to help you.  It is also difficult to solve the problem in the telephone mode, so the company can send a specialist to your home.  Usually his services are paid only if the problem arises due to the actions of the client.  If it turns out that this provider is to blame (for example, if he sold you a defective router), then the call and assistance of a specialist will not be paid. </p><p>  It is possible that the problem may be in the hardware of the console.  In this case, it is best to contact the seller or return it under warranty.  If on the next set-top box you manage to enter the IPTV settings from Rostelecom correctly and everything works, it means that the problem really was in the set-top box itself. </p>
