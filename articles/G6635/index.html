    <h2>  Metro map </h2><p>  Visitors in Kiev will be difficult only at first.  The subway grid allows you to travel to faraway areas in a short time.  To figure out where to go, help the metro scheme of Kiev.  It is presented in many copies in a prominent place at each station. </p><p>  Everyone who is just starting to recognize the city needs to remember what it is customary to use in the written description of a route the abbreviation of the word "station" - "st." </p><p>  Kiev metro offers information signs to help orienteering in the subway.  They are located at eye level of a walking person, sometimes above or almost under the ceiling.  The plates contain information about the stations where you can get in each specific direction. </p>

    <h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  <span>Kiev metro stations</span> open at such a time so that residents of the capital can get to work on time.  Therefore, the average time when the subway is ready to receive passengers is 5.45 in the morning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each station has an exact opening and closing mode.  It depends on its location: those that are farther from the center usually open earlier.  So, the Kharkovskaya metro station (Kiev), located on the left bank of the Dnieper, opens at 5.28, and closes a minute after midnight.  Such a time is important for those residents of the capital who need to get to work by 7-8 a.m., especially if you need to go from the right bank of the Dnieper.  Already at 7 in the morning in the subway trains you can see busy traffic, but the rush hour on the branch comes from 8 to 9 hours. </p><p>  Like all Kiev waking up early, the Darnitsa metro station on the left bank hurries to open at 5.27.  The last passengers leave the station at 00.06.  The scheme of the Kiev metro will help you navigate the location of the stations and calculate the time needed to travel to your destination.  We also inform you that the Teatralnaya station works the longest (until 00.18, the transition station from red to green, Zoloti Vorota station), the Hippodrome closes before everyone else (blue line, 23.54). </p>

For a long time, until mid-February 2015, they were of the same sample and the colors were blue.  The cost of the token was 2 hryvnias (about 5 Russian rubles).  After changes in <span>pricing policy,</span> travel tokens were replaced with <span>green ones (the shades are</span> very different), and throughput mechanisms were reequipped gradually until March 2015.

    <h2>  The structure of the Kiev metro </h2><p>  At the moment (March 2015), the Kiev metro consists of three branches: red (M1), blue (M2) and green (M3).  Of these, two (red and green) cross the country's main river - the Dnieper - and help residents quickly get from the right bank to the left and vice versa.  The blue branch is located only on the left bank. </p><p>  From Art.  "Theater" (red line) can be transferred to the "Golden Gate" (green), from Art.  "Sports Palace" (green) - on "Leo Tolstoy Square" (blue).  From Khreshchatyk (red branch), the transition can be made to Independence Square (blue branch). </p><h2>  About some stations </h2><p>  Each metro station in Kiev has its own characteristics.  So, "Slavutich" is a modern design in an <span>urban style.</span>  But the Theater (transitional to the Golden Gate) is recognized as one of the most beautiful in Europe.  What is the lighting of the station‚Äôs premises, made in the form of metal candelabra with many candles, bulbs. </p><p>  <span>Station "Vokzalnaya"</span> (right bank, red line) is the busiest for obvious reasons.  Every day, more than 68 thousand people are transported from it.  Among them are many guests of the city, students traveling home for the weekend.  It is followed by the Lesnaya station (also a red branch, but the left bank) - 66 thousand people a day.  The third busiest station in Kiev is Petrovka, located right next to the famous market of the same name (the name of the station came from it). </p><p>  The smallest passenger traffic is at the Dnipro metro station, as well as Krasny Khutor.  The latter, by the way, is located far from the center (on a green branch) and generally from residential areas, which is not very convenient.  But here passengers are expected by the picturesque nature, and this station is also useful. </p><p>  Attracts the attention of visitors  "Lviv Brahma" ("Lviv Brahma") on a blue branch.  The fact is that, in fact, it does not exist, since there are no exits to the top.  In many trains on metro schemes, it is listed for an undefined purpose.  It only serves to transport metro workers: often the passengers of the first carriage see how the train does not stop at the usual station and people in the form of subway workers land from the driver‚Äôs cab. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In our article-review of the Kiev metro, we collected the data necessary for a guest of the capital: we introduced the metro scheme, talked about the operating hours of different stations and prepared for pricing. </p><p>  The metro scheme of Kiev is quite simple, for example, compared with the scheme of the St. Petersburg subway.  There are only three branches and three transition stations.  Without special hitches, you can reach the remote corners of the city from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. </p>
