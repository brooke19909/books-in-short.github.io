Hinges on the canvas crocheted - a beautiful and fairly simple pattern.  It is quite suitable for hats and berets, children's things.  And to complete details of clothing decorations, for example, cuffs, collars, as well as various applications, such knitting is simply irreplaceable. </p><p>  Children are extremely fond of little things trimmed with "knitted fur" of eyelets.  Moms who have mastered <span>this skill</span> sew appliques depicting kittens and puppies, teddy bears and bunnies, the sun and clouds connected by eyelets on blouses and little coats for children. </p><p>  Also often for many women, self-crocheting a washcloth using a loop method is a real pleasure.  After all, firstly, this is a saving in family finances.  Secondly, with the inclusion of a minimum of fantasy, a regular bath accessory can become a real fun children's toy.  To do this, you just need to turn the trivial knitting of washcloths into a knitting of a fantastic pink duck with laces for hanging or a fairy teddy bear with a bow, a furry striped exotic fish or a wonderful yellow smiling sun. </p><p>  In order for <span>crocheting a washcloth</span> as a result to bring joy not only to the craftswoman, but also to the baby, of course, you must first make a pattern for the future thing and pick up the material of the right color.  Further, following the figure, the needlewoman adds or decreases the number of columns in a row, achieving the necessary bends in the shape of the product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some knitters are so skillful and economical that they manage to use even old torn dimensionless tights for the benefit.  Gently cutting the pantyhose from the toe with a spiral so that a long strip of 1-1.5 centimeter width is obtained, they wind it into a ball.  When tensioned, the strips are twisted into a thread.  Exclusive household items are made from it, using crocheting a washcloth as the main method. </p><p>  This material makes wonderful bedside mats or sofa pillows "lion's face".  For the manufacture, they first knit a round cloth with a diameter of about 30 centimeters round the columns without a crochet.  Then they switch to knitting with loops that are located only in one direction.  It will be an imitation of a lion's mane.  Upon reaching the desired size, knitting is completed.  ‚ÄúMuzzle‚Äù is decorated with eyes - buttons and a smiling mouth - the mat is ready!  It is easy to wash, dries quickly, is durable and very pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  In order to make a sofa cushion, you will also have to tie a soulmate.  But it can be without a mane or vice versa - all of the loops.  And you can perform it in complete symmetry with the first half. </p><p>  A beach bag made from old tights looks beautiful, especially if its top is decorated with ‚Äúlooped fur‚Äù.  It is also practical because sand is easily shaken out of it, it is easy to clean and it is not a pity to stain it with wedges or wet bathing suits. </p><p>  How is crocheting a washcloth done?  For this picture, in addition to the hook, you need a round stick or tube.  Old cardboard covers from thermometers are ideally suited.  You can use markers or markers, pens or pencils.  Only then the loops will be shorter. </p><p>  Having knitted the first row, in the second we begin to make loops.  That is, the working thread every time before knitting a column, we wrap around a round stick or tube, then we put the hook under the column and pull out the loop to knit the column.  We do the same with the next column.  There are two windings on our device, but we are not paying attention to this yet.  Now, according to the drawing of two loops on the hook, we do one.  Next, we repeat the knitting algorithm: we wrap the tube with thread, stretch the loop and knit both loops on the hook into one. </p><p>  When a sufficient number of wound loops are gathered on the accessory, it must be carefully removed and work continued in the same way.  The next row is knitted without the formation of loops, it is fastening.  That is, we loop each even row of loops. </p><p>  As you can see, this is not difficult at all, and it is possible to make in this way not only a primitive washcloth.  It‚Äôs worth a little imagination! </p>
