Which branch is this?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Kuzminki metro station is located between Tekstilshchiki and Ryazansky Prospekt, two other Moscow metro stations, in the eponymous district of the Russian capital.  It belongs to the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya, one of the busiest lines in Moscow.  Its opening took place in 1966, it was named after the area in which it is located.  Since then, the metro station almost all the time honestly and diligently performs its function - the transportation of Muscovites and visitors. </p><h2>  Brief description of the station </h2><p>  The station itself has only two underground vestibules leading to the <span>underground passages,</span> which are located under the large Volgograd Avenue.  If you are interested in where you can go thanks to this, then you should know: through the lobby No. 1 you can go to the avenue and Zelenodolskaya street, through No. 2 you can go to the streets of Marshal Chuykov and Zhigulevskaya, as well as the same avenue.  The Kuzminki metro station is a pillar, three-span shallow-laying platform. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuzminki metro station" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/757022.jpg" width="600"></div>  Its depth is only eight meters.  It so happened that it is the busiest station in the Moscow metro.  Now, when the extension of the metro was built for Vykhino, nothing has changed.  For partial unloading of Kuzminka, especially in rush hours - in the mornings, specially empty trains that do not stop at Vykhino and Ryazansky Prospekt are specially sent here.

The floor is covered with gray and red granite.  Cast bas-reliefs that depict various forest animals (fish, squirrels, martens, ducks, hares and tits on a mountain ash) are placed on the walls (artist - Derviz G.G.).  The architect of the station is Shagurin L.A., co-author is Korneev M.N., Shmitov N.A.  was a design engineer. </p>

    <p>  From the beginning of construction, the track walls were covered with <span>ceramic glazed tiles, the</span> former <span>cream color,</span> above and below with brown-red stripes.  In 2008, they were re-exposed with the preservation of the color design by enameled aluminum.  Then the floor was redone. </p><h2>  Some technical data </h2><p>  The station was built according to a standard project from reinforced concrete, prefabricated unified structures.  The height of the overlap is four meters, the distance between the axles is 12.9 meters, the width of the platform is ten meters, the column spacing is four meters, the width of the columns is five hundred meters, the distance between the axles is 5.9 meters.  In the very center of the platform, as well as on many others, a descent into the services premises is equipped. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kuzminki in the month of March </h2><p>  The last time in the winter in the Moscow metro is impossible to ride.  Especially where frost is good.  Winter clothes do not protect from the cold, it is impossible to hide from drafts.  Not an exception and the metro station “Kuzminki”.  People are forced to pull scarves from clothes and cover their ears and neck, although this does not save much. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow metro station Kuzminki" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/757017.jpg" width="600"></div>  Passengers wait for their train, go into it, hoping to keep warm, but in vain.  In March 2015, it was impossible to escape.  Even if the street is already a little warmer, the subway is still cold.  So passengers have to freeze.  The issue of warming, unfortunately, is not thought out.

    <h2>  Tips for using Kuzminka </h2><p>  All Muscovites and many guests of the city are well aware that in the morning, from eight to ten, to go from this station is like a murder.  Not only is it difficult to get into any carriage, it’s even more likely that you will put your clothes and shoes in an unusable form, and lose your property.  Therefore, it is very dangerous for one person to ride at this time.  It’s not worth taking the front row without certain skills, you can be right in front of the train itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuzminki metro station photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/757021.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, if you are an inexperienced local resident or a guest of the city, take the train in the opposite direction and go to where it is simpler.  Do not assume that the Kuzminki metro station will provide you with the opportunity to stop by and sit down to sleep by inviting you to an empty train.  You are likely to run out of space.  In principle, if there is such an opportunity, at this time try to go in another way.  The opening of the metro for Vykhino specifically facilitated the fate of this station, while in Kuzminki, unfortunately, it did not become easier.

    <h2>  What good is there </h2><p>  It is necessary to thank the city authorities for the fact that they built the “Kuzminki”.  The <span>metro station of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya</span> line for many years clearly performs its main function.  After all, no one foresaw that so many people would live in the <span>sleeping areas of the</span> capital.  Such a problem is observed in almost every big city in the world.  They try to solve the existing problems as far as possible.  Something succeeds, something not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuzminki metro station which line" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/757020.jpg" width="600"></div>  Near the metro station there is a bus station, from it suburban buses run to Lytkarino, Dzerzhinsky, Kotelniki, Zhukovsky and Lyubertsy.  Metro lobbies are open from 5.30 a.m. to midnight.  There is infrastructure here, you can drink in the heat in summer and eat nearby in several cafes, restaurants and even in one pizzeria.  Near the station there are several shops.  If you look in different directions, you will notice several clothing stores, both in shopping centers and separately.  Still, we feel that we are facing Moscow.  The metro station “Kuzminki” in the capital is different from the metro in many other cities.

    <h2>  Other infrastructure near the metro </h2><p>  There are several hotels near this metro station that are located up to one kilometer from Kuzminka: Okskaya Hotel, Brigantina Hotel, Len Inn Hostel, Taganka Hostel, Vega Hostel and many others.  If you wish, you can even visit a beauty salon, there are several of them.  There is also a dental clinic, several pharmacies.  There are government agencies, such as Rospotrebnadzor and a medical branch of the Center for Epodemiology and Hygiene. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuzminki metro station Tagansko Krasnopresnenskaya line" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/757019.jpg" width="600"></div>  That is, Kuzminki, a metro station, is a highly developed region with good infrastructure.  Only shopping centers are located nine pieces: "Mirage", "Budapest", "For the whole family", "AREAL", "Moscow", "Three boars", "Ryazansky", "Joule", "Chameleon".

    <h2>  Kuzminki (metro station): photos </h2><p>  Tourists, of course, visit this facility especially often.  For those who have arrived in Moscow for a few days, it makes no sense to go here (and time), but if you have arrived in the city for a long time, then in the <span>afternoon, on the day off,</span> you can just visit this place.  And if there is nothing special to do at the station itself, then, having briefly examined it, you can go on foot to the park located on the river bank.  In the summer, when a motor ship with tourists floats there, it is worthwhile to devote some time to this beautiful place, look at cultural monuments, all four ponds. </p>
