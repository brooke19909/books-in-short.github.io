This unpleasant fact is confirmed by numerous wars unleashed by people for various reasons.  Even in the dystopian worlds of Aldous Huxley, Orwell or Bradbury, a person cannot live without violence.  Apparently, shocking with weapons, some representatives of the homo sapiens race assert themselves, and it does not matter for what reason the states enter the struggle.  A war is unthinkable without weapons, and its outcome directly depends on how much the equipment of one of the parties to the conflict will be.  For example, modern naval forces are ineffective without a unique warship: an aircraft carrier. </p><h2>  Aircraft carrier: progressive ship </h2><p>  This is a huge ship carrying aircraft cargo: airplanes or helicopters.  Moreover, up to hundreds of aircraft can be on it.  They are the main striking force of an aircraft carrier.  For the first time such a surface vessel appeared in the First World War, but the peculiarity of the first-born was that they were remade from ships of other types.  For example, a cruiser called Birmingham became such a vessel.  For the first time, a plane took off from his deck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aircraft carriers of France" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1123547.jpg" width="600"></div>  This significant event happened in 1910, and it laid the foundation for carrier-based aviation.  At first, such ships were used for reconnaissance purposes, but later they realized the importance of aircraft as a means of bombing.  At the dawn of the construction of aircraft carriers, seaplanes were used, since airplanes could take off, but they could not land on deck.  For this, hydroplanes were used that successfully landed on the water.  History says that the French aircraft carriers before the Second World War were not numerous: or rather, only one, like the United States.  The largest number of such vessels at that time was in the United Kingdom (7 units).  Subsequently, America succeeded in designing aircraft carriers.

By the type of energy, there are ordinary and atomic models. </p><h2>  The main characteristics of aircraft carriers </h2><p>  Steel hulls of aircraft carriers have considerable strength, because their thickness reaches several centimeters.  The length of the huge ships is hundreds of meters: the amplitude ranges from 180 to 342. The draft of the vessel reaches 12-meter depth.  The deck width is quite large, which gives the aircraft carriers an unforgettable look.  Under the deck are huge docks and hangars for aircraft maintenance.  The only elevation on the deck, a kind of "island", is the command post, which includes location systems and antennas.  This center is usually located on the starboard side. </p>

They are distinguished by three types, one of which is not used now.  The flat deck, for example, has the famous French carrier Charles de Gaulle.  Decks of this kind are used for horizontal take-off.  For this, steam catapults are used.  Springboard decks are installed on ships containing <span>vertical take-off aircraft.</span>  A characteristic feature of such a deck is the combination of the runway and landing strip.

On the nose of such aircraft carriers was the take-off deck, and at the top was the landing deck.  But since such a scheme was dangerous for pilots, it was changed by re-equipping it, as is customary in conventional aircraft carriers. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the giants of the Navy </h2><p>  It will be interesting for the uninitiated to find out where the aircraft carriers have an inexhaustible source of speed and power.  The thing is that nuclear power plants on modern ships, including aircraft carriers in France, provide ships with an unlimited range of movement.  In addition, thanks to the nuclear installation, an aircraft carrier has the ability to maintain maximum, not cruising, speed for weeks. </p>

It is located at an angle of 9‚Å∞.  This was not done by chance.  Previously, when the line was straight, often there were collisions of aircraft standing, with those who landed unsuccessfully.  After all, it‚Äôs quite difficult to sit on a swinging and narrow deck.  To avoid such disasters and the fires caused by them, the designers came to a brilliant solution, thereby giving the pilot the right to make a mistake.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  French fleet </h2><p>  The <span>navy of France</span> occupies a leading position in the world.  According to its displacement (321,850 tons), it is located between Korea and Great Britain.  This powerful military formation is armed with submarines, ultra-modern frigates, amphibians, cruisers, destroyers, and, of course, the legendary French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with a displacement of 37 thousand tons.  The basis of the landing forces is the cruiser Mistral.  There are three units of this type of ship. </p><p>  But at the same time, there is currently a lack of air cover, since the French naval aviation has only 60 deck aircraft in service.  In general, the French government conceived a serious modernization of the Navy, since the current capacity is not enough to conduct global military operations.  Although France has a significant trump card: nuclear weapons.  First of all, these are modern ballistic missiles. </p><h2>  France and World War II </h2><p>  The French are rightly called pioneers of naval aviation.  They built hydroplanes, seaplanes and flying boats, and battleships and cruisers equipped with catapults for takeoff.  And in the 20s of the last century, the naval armed forces of France were replenished with a new member - the battleship ‚ÄúBearn‚Äù modernized as an aircraft carrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="French aircraft carriers before World War II" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1123564.jpg" width="500"></div>  It had a take-off and landing deck and a catapult.  This ship, although without any special differences, participated in the world war with German fascism, but in 1940 it retired.  This happened after the surrender of the French Republic to Nazi Germany.  Further, back in 1937, according to the planned shipbuilding program, it was decided to construct several new ships.  But this was not destined to come true.  During the period from 1939 to 1945, the armed forces of France, especially the fleet, lost most of their weapons, and demanded a total recovery.  So how many aircraft carriers did France have during the war with the Germans?  Among the unrealized and frozen projects of the Joffre, Clemenceau, and the sunk Command Command Test aircraft carrier, one military flagship, Bearn, stood out.

    <h2>  Aircraft carrier Bearn: a gray-haired story </h2><p>  The French Vice Admiral Bourget rightly believed that urgently needed to revive the French aircraft carriers as the basis of the Navy.  This man once commanded Bearn, so his advice was valuable and was heard.  The admiral believed that the French fleet needed at least 6 aircraft carriers.  Subsequently, the government purchased aircraft carriers from England, and in the 1950s shipbuilders in France designed the Clemenceau and Foch aircraft carriers. </p><p>  But about the warship, the Bearn aircraft carrier, it is worth mentioning especially if only because he took part in the war with the Nazis.  The aircraft carrier participated in the search for the German ship Admiral Count Spee.  The construction of the ship began in January 1914, and it was launched in April 1920.  The draft of the vessel is more than 9 meters and the width is 27. The length of the aircraft carrier was 182 meters.  The number of crew was 865 people. </p><p>  French Navy aircraft carriers began their story with this armored ship.  He was armed with anti-aircraft mounts, torpedoes and had on board 40 aircraft.  The aircraft carrier was designed from the Normandy hull, while the battleship turbines were replaced by a power plant.  After the French surrender, it was rumored that the aircraft carrier had taken all the state gold reserves to Martinique, but this information was not confirmed.  Further, until the end of the war, Bearn was transporting aircraft from Canada to his homeland.  In 1967, the French flagship of the beginning of the last century was dismantled. </p><h2>  Charles de Gaulle or Richelieu? </h2><p>  Now the aircraft carriers of France are modern and equipped with everything necessary to meet military standards.  Rather, the French aircraft carrier is currently the only one: the famous Charles de Gaulle.  This ship was built and launched in 1994.  Its operation began in 2001.  With a displacement of 42 thousand tons, the aircraft carrier gives 27 knots of progress.  It has two <span>nuclear engines, the</span> length of the vessel is 261 meters, and the width is about 64. The aircraft carrier is the largest vessel in France, but it is small in comparison with similar American nuclear ships.  Its crew is quite numerous and numbers 1900 people, including pilots and command. </p>

But only one vessel of this series was created, since its high cost did not allow the project to continue.  The aircraft carrier has been improved more than once, due to unsuccessful testing.

    <p>  As for the design of the ship, it is equipped with the most modern systems: catapults, unsinkable bulkheads, a double bottom, radio-absorbing and hidden equipment.  There is also a drainage, fire protection system.  For the crew, air conditioning and ventilation systems are provided.  Convenient sleeping areas, rest and eating areas have been developed. </p><p>  Around the name of the aircraft carrier at the time, serious debate broke out: <span>Francois Mitterrand, the</span> president of France, wanted to name the ship "Richelieu", since he considered it inappropriate flirting with a party of Gaullists.  But a year later, <span>Jacques Chirac</span> still convinced him, and the ship was named after the famous general. </p><h2>  Armament "Charles" </h2><p>  The ship‚Äôs atomic energy will last 5 years at a speed of 25 knots.  The aircraft carrier owes this to a power plant with colossal power filling: 76 thousand horsepower.  On such a powerful base can accommodate up to 100 aircraft.  But usually the fleet includes 40 aircraft, of which several fighters, attack aircraft, reconnaissance and liaison aircraft.  Helicopters are also available on deck.  Also, the aircraft carrier is equipped with radar systems and air defense systems.  So wondering how many aircraft carriers France has now, we can reliably answer: one.  But there are several more ships that are at almost the same level of combat capability and endurance. </p><h2>  Mistral: the French station wagon </h2><p>  The landing ship helicopter carrier Mistral differs from others in its multi-purpose application.  It can be a hospital, land motorized landing brigades on land, act as a command center, carry and serve <span>combat helicopters.</span>  If we discuss the aircraft carriers of France, the Mistral, although it is not an aircraft carrier in full, is also a worthy representative of the French Navy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="French aircraft carriers, Mistral" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1123599.jpg" width="600"></div>  An important advantage is the slow and thoughtful monitoring of the space, which is successfully carried out by helicopters.  In addition, the ship can accommodate landing barges, a tank battalion and up to 900 soldiers at a time.  The French fleet is armed with three such ships: Mistral, Tonner, and Dismudes.

    <h2>  Is it possible to sink an aircraft carrier? </h2><p>  This is a very difficult task.  Due to the fact that such super-expensive ships carry a huge amount of weapons, then, of course, the protective functions of an aircraft carrier do not quite satisfy the necessary requirements.  Therefore, around a huge ship there are always 15 or more ships that provide reliable protection within a radius of 300 kilometers.  But still, to sink a carrier is real, although very difficult.  The simplest but not very effective method is to storm.  To do this, it is necessary to neutralize the security ships, and then try to let the aircraft carrier sink to the bottom, which will be extremely difficult, because it is equipped with a huge number of compartments. </p><p>  Not the last role in putting an aircraft carrier out of action can be played by sabotage.  For example, during the replenishment of reserves, in one of the ports, a group of divers should quietly swim up to the vessel and install a remote explosive device at its bottom.  The main thing in this operation is to go unnoticed. </p>

Of course, a huge aircraft carrier will not be able to dodge a torpedo.  Only now the Kamikaze submarine is very likely to be immediately destroyed by guard ships.

    <p>  The greatest effectiveness in the sinking of an aircraft carrier is given by missile and nuclear strikes.  It is clear that the latter, due to infection of the territory, and other catastrophic consequences, are applied only in extreme cases. </p><h2>  Ships of the future </h2><p>  But the aircraft carriers of France and other world powers do not stand still, new, more modern and advanced models are being designed.  Taking into account the experience of past achievements and mistakes, a project of an aircraft carrier of the future was created under the name CVNX with a displacement of 100 thousand tons.  In its creation, stealth technologies were used, the latest nuclear installation, allowing for a long time to go without refueling, as well as a fundamentally new hull design.  According to the creators, such a ship for the entire fifty-year service life is able to cover 3 million <span>nautical miles</span> and spend 6 thousand days in the ocean. </p><p>  Progress is rapidly moving, including in the military industry.  Huge amounts of money are invested in the latest technology, but you can‚Äôt buy peace on the planet for any money. </p>
