The whole process of transformation takes place on the back side.  This elegant technique can become even more interesting if you add to it ornaments applied using stencils. </p><p>  If you like craft paper, then most likely you already have your secrets in the reverse decoupage technique on a glass plate.  Perhaps acquaintance with this type of needlework you started with vases or other transparent products.  If you have never experimented with decoupage before, then be sure that this is an extremely exciting activity, as a result of which you can proudly give things as a gift for any occasion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gelliarts.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage plates photos" class="if uuid-3042023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042023.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  If you are ready to take a chance and find new ideas for reverse decoupage of plates, prepare everything you need to start creating beauty.  Perhaps in time this will become your favorite pastime. </p><p>  For this master class on reverse decoupage of plates you will need: </p><ul><li>  A small container with water. </li><li>  Printout of your chosen graphic, photograph or decoupage card.  You can use an inkjet printer if you are sure that its ink does not leak when it comes in contact with moisture. </li><li>  Glue Mod Podge or similar for decoupage. </li><li>  Sponge applicator for paint. </li><li>  Silicone glue from a hardware store or your favorite - for glass products. </li><li>  Great art brush. </li><li>  Small capacity for Mod Podge decoupage glue, and then for paint. </li><li>  Rag. </li><li>  Small glue stencils. </li><li>  Acrylic color ‚Äúbright golden metallic‚Äù and an additional color to match the main image. </li><li>  Soft work surface. </li><li>  Cardboard for use as work surfaces for spray painting. </li><li>  Transparent glass plate with a smooth base. </li><li>  Candlestick, if you want to make a stand. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can use any measuring device to help yourself find the center of the plate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gelliarts.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Back decoupage with craquelure on a plate" class="if uuid-3043360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3043360.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get started </h2><p>  Have you already chosen the design for your work?  Reverse decoupage of plates begins with the selection of a pattern that will be on the surface.  Look for decoupage cards or print any suitable graphic on high quality but lightweight paper.  Cut round patterns, making sure there is no white paper around the edge.  Then clean the glass surface and make sure it is dry. </p><h2>  Back plate decoupage workshop with photo </h2><p>  Getting to work.  Do not forget to prepare a container with water - this will facilitate the process.  Using a large art brush, apply Mod Podge glue to the printed side of the picture.  Do the same with the plate.  Work fast to give yourself plenty of time to fit your graphics.  Then place the image print side down on the base of the plate. </p><h2>  How to smooth a picture </h2><p>  The reverse decoupage of the plates implies a flat surface.  When using the center brush, use your fingers or a flexible smoothing tool to remove air pockets from the center area.  Be careful.  Glue for decoupage can ‚Äúgrab‚Äù your fingers and adhere to the surface, which makes it difficult to smooth properly.  To fix this, dip them in water.  This can help you smooth the surface without damaging the paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blackberrydesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage plates with photography workshop" class="if uuid-3042011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042011.jpg"></div><p>  Press the edges of the image against the glass to form small wrinkles.  So the paper will fit the outline of the plate.  Squeeze out all the air bubbles around the edges.  A damp rag and some effort will help you remove glue streaks from the glass.  If there is too much of it, the image may deteriorate.  But do not rub the surface too hard, otherwise damage the graphics.  When you have straightened the paper and clean the glass, let the plate dry completely.  Reverse decoupage requires a patient approach.  It is best to leave your work for a day. </p><h2>  Additional coloring </h2><p>  Actions with the image at this stage can be completed.  If you want to add an ornament and diversify the reverse decoupage on a glass plate with a photograph, use special stencils.  Flexible adhesive options are the only type recommended for this occasion.  Everything else will not frame the surface correctly, and paint will drip under the edges.  It is also recommended to use a special foam applicator or sponge for its application, and not a brush.  It will help to apply a much more even coat of paint, so nothing will ruin the image on your plate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to use a stencil </h2><p>  Getting to the coloring.  Align the stencil with the desired point on the design and press firmly.  Take the paint using the applicator and remove most of it, using a piece of unnecessary cardboard or rubbing along the edge of the container.  Use patting movements to apply paint through a stencil.  So the layer will be thin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage on a glass plate" class="if uuid-3042004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042004.jpg"></div><p>  After applying the main color, the gold will look richer.  Let the gold paint slightly overlap the white paper.  Then carefully remove the stencil until the ink has dried.  Place it in front of your first drawing, press and apply acrylic paint again.  Continue this process until you create a series of motifs that form a circular design.  If you make two plates by decoupage with photos, select another motive and repeat the process.  Acrylic dries quickly enough - an hour will be enough. </p><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  Now it remains to complete the design of the plates.  To do this, you will need paint to match the main motive.  It is more convenient to use a spray can, but for this you need to work on the street or in a well-ventilated area.  Transfer the plates to a piece of cardboard strong enough to support their weight and go outside.  Use a mask to protect your respiratory system from the harmful substances in spray paint.  Then spray or apply pigment on the back of the plates.  Let them dry.  It‚Äôs best to leave them for a couple of days.  When the spray paint has dried, carefully turn the plates over to see your amazing result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage on a glass plate with a photograph" class="if uuid-3042003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042003.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make dishes on plates on a stand </h2><p>  You can turn your work into beautiful legged dishes if you follow a few additional steps.  To do this, you will need glass glasses.  Spray them with the spray paint used on the plates.  Then also dry them.  Be careful not to scratch the paint during the following steps. </p><p>  Using your favorite glass glue, attach a shot glass to the bottom of the plate, placing it exactly in the center.  You can use a ruler or a protractor.  Wait for the glue to dry.  Gently clean the glass surface and enjoy the result of your work.  The top of the plate can be used for food.  But do not wash it under running water.  For cleaning, it is best to take a damp cloth and lightly wipe the surface. </p><h2>  Reverse tray decoupage </h2><p>  To create an unusual thing, you can use not only round plates.  Other items will do.  For example, from a flat square dish you get a very unusual tray, if you design it using the reverse decoupage technique.  Such a decorative plate will be a great gift for any occasion.  The reverse decoupage on a glass plate with craquelure looks unusual and will definitely surprise everyone who sees it.  If you want to create an interesting effect, get a special varnish. </p><h2>  Reverse decoupage with square craquelure on a square plate </h2><p>  Creating a glass tray with your favorite pattern is a great way to personalize the item for yourself or as a gift.  As in the previous workshop, you need to attach your image to the back of the glass surface, and then use paint to fill in any places where there is no paper. </p><p>  To create a tray you will need: </p><ul><li>  Flat glass plate of square shape. </li><li>  Decorative paper or decoupage card. </li><li>  A brush or special sponge for application. </li><li>  Adhesive for decoupage. </li><li>  Craquelure varnish. </li><li>  Acrylic paint for glass and ceramics in two contrasting colors. </li><li>  Sharp knife. </li><li>  Small brushes. </li><li>  Cardboard or unnecessary thick folder. </li></ul><p>  At the very beginning, print and cut the desired image out of paper.  In this case, you can not make a single motive, but use several small parts, placing them on the surface of the tray.  Simpler paper is easier to work with, for example, good quality wrapping.  Glossy or coated is better not to use.  Next, on the empty spots, apply the main coat of paint.  Let it dry.  Apply craquelure varnish to the paint.  Dry it.  Apply a thin layer of the second selected paint to this layer very gently with a sponge.  Already during this process, cracks will begin to appear.  Let the paint dry.  Across its surface, expected cracks should appear. </p><h2>  Another way </h2><p>  You can do differently.  If you find a picture or photograph that covers the entire bottom of the plate, then cracks can only be made on the rim.  To do this, directly on the glass you need to apply a layer of craquelure varnish.  Let it dry.  Top with a thin layer to apply the paint you have chosen.  She will shine through the cracks. </p><p>  So that the plate can be washed, your creation from above must be varnished in 2-3 layers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage plates new ideas" class="if uuid-3042019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042019.jpg"></div><h2>  The process of creating a tray </h2><p>  Turn the plate over so that the bottom faces you.  Brush the decoupage adhesive on the back.  Then lay the paper face down on the desired area so that the ornament shines on the front of the plate.  After that, place the second layer on top of the previous one if you make a collage by adding decoupage to the back of the plate as needed.  Smooth air bubbles with your hands or using a special tool.  Even a cork from a bottle of wine will do.  Let dry for several hours. </p><p>  Then apply another layer of decoupage on top of the paper, covering the entire back of the future tray.  After drying, remove excess glue from the edges with a piece of cloth.  Sometimes a knife blade is used for the same purpose.  Dry the surface well again. </p><h2>  The final design of the tray </h2><p>  Now there are only a few steps left.  Paint the back of the tray with whatever color you want.  Most likely, you will need not one, but two layers.  The paint should lie thinly, but firmly.  In this case, you do not need stencils, but the work can also be supplemented a little.  You can use a soft cloth, such as felt, to shape the back of the tray.  Glue it to give a finished look to your plate.  Now everything is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse decoupage plates master class" class="if uuid-3042017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3042017.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in the reverse decoupage technique.  You can use any ornaments, motifs and drawings to create an unusual and original gift for your loved ones, without putting special effort into it.  What is done by oneself is always appreciated more.  Especially when you create it with love and care for others.  Do not be afraid to experiment and create new creations using decoupage technique. </p>
