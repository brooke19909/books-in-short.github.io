In addition to his state activities, a great interest of the public is caused by the features of his personality.  His history of formation and government has attracted the attention of historians to this day. </p><h2>  Orders under Ivan the Terrible and their functions </h2><p>  The years of the reign of Ivan the Terrible are notable for the fact that he was able to turn a typical medieval state into a world empire.  Since his reign, neither documents nor any reliable papers have been preserved.  All that is known today is stories told by word of mouth. </p><h2>  How it all began? </h2><p>  Born in 1530 in the family of Prince Vasily the Third and Elena Glinsky.  After 3 years, Prince Vasily died, and his heir in such an early age was recognized as the Prince of Moscow.  While he was little, Elena Glinskaya was in charge of the affairs of the state, and the nobles were engaged in the upbringing of the young prince.  But his mother did not live up to the age of Ivan, when he was able to become a full-fledged successor to power.  She died 5 years after the death of Prince Vasily.  8-year-old Ivan had to independently master the intricacies of politics and government, while the Shuysky family ruled on his behalf. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.puttyandpaint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan the Terrible" class="if uuid-2475324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2475324.jpg"></div><p>  Now, several centuries later, experts suggest that in the formation of such an unusual personality with strange inclinations, it was childhood that was surrounded by courtyard intrigues and intrigues.  According to unofficial data, there were times when his friends were killed with him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ivan had an extraordinary cruelty.  His favorite thing was torturing animals to death.  But regardless of the characteristics of his personality, public policy has gained unprecedented proportions, accompanied by numerous wars and bloodshed.  But among his orders there are those that could well serve in favor of the people. </p><h2>  State Management Methods </h2><p>  Ivan the Terrible was distinguished by the fact that he often issued orders, and after a while he canceled some of them.  They spread to various branches of public life.  For example, orders for estates were aimed at keeping records of servants.  Orders under Ivan the Terrible of a robber nature served to investigate crimes.  Bit orders were sent to the affairs of the boyars and their families.  To organize the activities of the postal service, a Yamsky order was issued.  Foreign policy issues were resolved with the help of the <span>Ambassadorial order.</span>  These are just some of the documents he published.  From the very moment of reign, the system of orders under Ivan the Terrible only expanded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saatchiart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsar Ivan the Terrible" class="if uuid-2475321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2475321.jpg"></div><p>  These documents were far from perfect.  The main problem was that the questions stated in them repeated each other or contradicted.  The execution of the orders involved the boyars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Order No. 1 </h2><p>  The year 1543 was marked by the coming to power of a new prince.  The nobles believed that the teenager Ivan was only busy reading books.  But his books were fraught with his main secret, which has not yet been disclosed.  According to assumptions, Ivan was fond of occult knowledge. </p><p>  One of the first orders under Ivan the Terrible concerned the removal of the Shuiskys from power.  Later, the document was continued - to execute Shuiskys.  It should be borne in mind that at that time the prince was only 13 years old.  The logical conclusion of this document was their own wedding to the kingdom.  So came the era of Ivan the Terrible in Russia, who was not so nicknamed so. </p><h2>  About creating troops </h2><p>  One of the important orders was a document on the creation of a regular streltsy army.  Later it becomes clear that the strengthening of the troops was necessary for future wars.  In the same year, the prince approved a new version of the Code of Law - a collection of rules for the people.  It said that peasants can transfer from one owner to another only once a year.  This day was celebrated.  The date is called St. George's Day.  The document dates back to 1550. </p><div class="photo" data-original="empr.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="He issued many orders" class="if uuid-2474614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2474614.jpg"></div><h2>  About the creation of the Rada </h2><p>  Another important order in the time of Ivan the Terrible is a document on the creation of the Rada.  The governing body included both representatives of the current government and people from the general population.  The basis was made by the close ones of the prince himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The prince worked with this team for the next 13 years.  What is noteworthy, these years are marked in history by the most prosperous and democratic. </p><h2>  Year 1551 </h2><p>  Thanks to the reforms of the king in the coming years, all sectors of the country will reach a new level.  In 1551, the orders of Ivan the Terrible and their functions primarily highlighted the interests of the people.  A striking example is the issuance of a decree that spoke about the need to create educational institutions in all regions of the country, starting from Moscow. </p><p>  In the same year another decree came out, the main task of which was to collect his important orders in one collection.  The official title of the document was Stoglavy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fiveminutehistory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Edit started at age 13" class="if uuid-2474615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2474615.jpg"></div><p>  The creation of the Moscow diocese can be noted in the same honorable row.  But this event happened a little later - in 1555. </p><h2>  Creation of military service </h2><p>  The orders under Ivan the Terrible in most cases were aimed at creating new state institutions or reforming existing bodies.  In 1556, significant changes took place in the military industry - military duty began to be inherited. </p><p>  The call to military service began at the age of 15.  The young man had to serve in the army until the end of his life.  Since the above year, the military has relied on a land share of 50 acres.  But the land belonged to the military only for the period during which he served in the army. </p><p>  The robbery of Ivan the Terrible, issued in the same year, said that a warrior should come to the service with his armor, horse and weapon. </p><h2>  Oprichnya </h2><p>  By the beginning of 1560, the prince decided to restrain the boyars, who in every possible way impeded him in the affairs of state administration.  In this regard, the following orders under Ivan the Terrible already concerned the provisions of the oprichnins.  Oprichniny - a group of people of nearly 6,000 people who were allowed a lot. </p><p>  The main function of the guardsmen was to serve the prince.  On his orders, some boyars were expelled from the city.  The guardsmen grew power in the city.  They were allowed raids in any city and at any time for the purpose of robbery and robbery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vinepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power passed to him in 3 years" class="if uuid-2474618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2474618.jpg"></div><p>  The following order, which spoke about the opening of street entertainment venues, where free wine was poured for them, became the top permissiveness of the guardsmen.  After the raids into the cities and villages, the bodyguards rested there in the evenings.  They existed until 1572, until the prince himself issued a decree on their abolition. </p><p>  There is also an order of Ivan the Terrible on the ministry - the Sober Order.  According to the document, a body was created to consider complaints from the people against government officials.  His manager was A.F. Adashev, distinguished by a good reputation achieved through honesty and integrity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slavorum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power inherited by son Fedor" class="if uuid-2474622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2474622.jpg"></div><h2>  Secrets of the library of Ivan the Terrible </h2><p>  What is noteworthy, since the reign of Ivan the Terrible, documents and manuscripts have not been preserved.  Although there is reliable information that he owned a solid library, where other people were banned.  Long before his death, he issued an order in which he ordered to hide his library in a safe place.  It is assumed that before this he himself divided it into two parts: ‚Äúwhite‚Äù literature and ‚Äúblack‚Äù books. </p><p>  His contemporaries write that not only books were stored in the library, but also strange objects that could perform certain functions independently.  Modern scientists suggest that it could be the invention of engineers and scientists of that time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fiveminutehistory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grew up on noble intrigues" class="if uuid-2474619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2474619.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a legend according to which Ivan the Terrible cast a spell on his library and made it so that it can only be found 800 years after his death.  In modern times, there have already been attempts to find the heritage in the Kremlin cellars, but no one has been able to find it yet. </p>
