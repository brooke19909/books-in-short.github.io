The prices here are relatively low, a wide variety of hotel complexes, a pleasant climate and, most importantly, high-quality service.  One of the most popular resorts is the Kemer region.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature and climate </h2><p>  The surroundings of Kemer are very picturesque.  Here, the emerald slopes of the mountains, over which majestic cliffs of a fanciful form rise, lush vegetation that approaches the turquoise surface of the sea.  The Mediterranean climate is one of the most favorable in the whole world.  What epithets are not awarded to him: soft, pleasant, comfortable, etc.  Indeed, vacationers here are more than comfortable.  There is no sweltering heat, suffocating dampness or, conversely, dryness, the sun shines almost all year round, and there is little rainfall.  All this makes the resorts along the coast a welcome destination for tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  In Kemer, the swimming season starts from the first of May and ends at the end of October.  Therefore, everyone who wants to expedite their meeting with the sea, as soon as possible to find themselves in comfortable natural conditions and spend <span>May holidays</span> on the Mediterranean coast, while it rains continuously in their native Moscow, can buy a ticket to Imeros Hotel 3 * Kemer or to some other resort Turkey and in a matter of hours to be in one of the closest heavenly corners to us on the planet.  By the way, in Kemer and other southern regions of Turkey you can relax throughout the year.  Of course, in the off-season you can hardly swim in sea water, but you can sunbathe unhindered.  As you can see in the picture, around the spacious pool of Imeros Hotel 3 * there are a large number of comfortable sun loungers, sunbathing on which is just a pleasure.  Unfortunately, this hotel does not have an indoor pool, the services of which can be used in the cold season, so if you are a fan of swimming, then you better choose another hotel for your vacation from November to May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imeros hotel 3 kemer beldibi" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/435546.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service level </h2><p>  Many of the hotels from 3 * to 5 * categories operate on an all-inclusive basis.  This applies primarily to the method of nutrition.  Russian tourists, which is true, it is true, is primarily attracted to this circumstance.  With these systems, vacationers on site can use all the benefits provided by the hotel from morning to late in the evening, while meals are served on a buffet basis.  Of course, a la carte restaurants also operate on the territory of many hotel complexes, but Russian tourists still prefer to use the buffet. </p><p>  A very important point in the service of <span>Kemer hotels,</span> for example, Imeros Hotel 3 *, is that they are adapted for Russian and Russian-speaking (from the CIS countries) tourists and keep Russian-speaking staff on staff.  Of course, this is a big advantage.  For example, in travel blogs where tourists who have visited the Imeros Hotel 3 * share their impressions, reviews regarding this feature are always commendable.  Almost all hotels in Turkey and in particular Kemer have all the necessary conditions for an interesting and eventful vacation: saunas, spa centers, restaurants, swimming pools, discos, bars and cafes.  In addition, interesting tours are organized for the guests of the country to the sights that Turkey is rich in, and interesting entertainment programs for both adults and small vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imeros hotel 3 kemer [" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/435545.jpg" width="417"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  No matter how comfortable and well-groomed the territory of the hotel complexes, however, for tourists who come to the sea, the beach and water activities are primarily important.  From this point of view, everything is perfectly organized in Kemer.  There are many water activities, of course for a fee, on the beaches there are comfortable changing rooms, a toilet, sun loungers and umbrellas.  However, if you prefer sandy beaches, you are unlikely to find them here.  On the coast of this resort region, almost all beaches are pebble, and even if some five-star hotels have artificially sandy beach areas, <span>the seabed</span> is covered with small pebbles everywhere.  Imeros hotel 3 * has its own beach, but it, as in other budget hotels, is not sandy. </p><h2>  Kemer Attractions </h2><p>  Regardless of which of the resort villages of Kemer you relax, you will be offered to see the sights of the entire region.  The city port itself is beautiful, here at the entrance there is an arch in the ancient Greek architectural style.  By renting a snow-white yacht, you can make an unforgettable tour of the water and from the sea to explore the entire coastal strip.  Here, near the port, there are Yoryuk park (a kind of ethno-historical museum under the open sky, where you can get acquainted with the traditions and features of nomadic Turkic peoples) and Moonlight Park (Lunapark).  It hosts various entertainment events every evening, there are many cafes and bars.  Lunapark will especially like young tourists.  Indeed, on its territory there is a chic dolphinarium with an exciting program and a kids club.  Olbia Park is a little more modest, but it is also a great place for an interesting pastime.  Since the Imeros hotel 3 * is located only 18 kilometers from Kemer - in the village of Beldibi - and there are regular flights from there to the city, tourists can come here from time to time in search of entertainment for themselves and their children.  For tourists who prefer an informative vacation, that is, various excursions to ancient architectural monuments, trips can be organized to the majestic ruins of the ancient Greek cities of Phaselis and Olympos, as well as to the church of St. Nicolas in the city of Demre.  Here you can also see the well-preserved amphitheater, built in the first century AD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imeros hotel 3 turkey" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/435543.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Beldibi Village </h2><p>  As noted above, the Kemer tourist region consists of the port city of the same name and five picturesque villages.  Beldibi is the largest of them.  There are many beautiful hotels of various categories.  The best option for a budget holiday is Imeros Hotel 3 *.  Turkey, as you know, in order to attract a huge number of tourists to its resorts, is trying to organize a tourism business in such a way that not only vacationers in deluxe hotels, but also budget employees feel comfort and a precautionary attitude.  However, tourists should understand that if they decided to save on their vacation and purchased tickets at more than low prices, then they can no longer count on service at the highest level.  Therefore, the complaints of Russian tourists regarding the service in budget hotels, for example, Imeros Hotel 3 *, are not clear.  Their reviews are not always commendable.  However, they forget that the choice in favor of this hotel or other hotels of the same category was made due to their cheapness.  However, in no other Mediterranean country, three-star hotels do not practice the all-inclusive system; therefore, we will pay tribute to the <span>service of hotel</span> complexes in the village of Beldibi. </p><p>  By the way, this resort is perfect for youth recreation.  Here is the best on the coast disco Jest Disco Club, there are many nightclubs and other entertainment venues.  For lovers of outdoor activities, hiking and morning jogging, well-groomed paths and paths are laid here between groves with lemon and orange trees.  Their aroma extends for many kilometers and gives a good mood during their stay in this paradise.  Therefore, if you are an optimistic person, quick-witted and picky, and also appreciate natural beauty and a good mood, but don‚Äôt have much money, then go to Imeros Hotel 3. Kemer, unlike Anataly and Marmaris, is considered a more democratic resort, but this does not mean that the service here is of poor quality.  Just because of the lack of sandy beaches, the tourist flow in this area is less intense.  By the way, in Beldibi there are a lot of excellent shops with affordable prices.  Therefore, shopping lovers can make purchases here and not go after them to the larger cities of the coast, for example, to Kemer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imeros hotel 3 beldibi" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/435544.jpg" width="500"></div>
