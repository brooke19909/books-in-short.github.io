    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Travelers really like this accommodation option in Tunisia as Sentido Phenicia Hotel 4 *.  Reviews in 2016 contain such positive information: </p><ul><li>  a huge green area that allows you to hide from the Tunisian heat in the shade of palm trees; </li><li>  a beautiful well-groomed beach, strewn with the purest white sand (although, sometimes, it waves seaweed ashore, but this is not the hotel's fault); </li><li>  the staff is friendly and attentive; </li><li>  very tasty and varied food (a large selection of national dishes); </li><li>  the hotel is located directly on the beach, and therefore the road to the sea does not take you much time; </li><li>  the bathroom is in excellent condition, and the plumbing is brand new;  Russian-language channels are broadcast; </li><li>  near the hotel there is a bus stop, as well as a taxi rank (this is very convenient, given the remoteness of the hotel from infrastructure facilities); </li><li>  affordable prices for accommodation and related services; </li><li>  several bars operate on the territory at once, and therefore there are no queues for drinks; </li><li>  there is a good souvenir shop with a huge selection of goods at affordable prices; </li><li>  free hookah in the evenings; </li><li>  given the enormous size of the beach, even if you do not have enough free sunbeds, you can always get a tan right in the sand; </li><li>  there are many sockets in the room, and therefore you do not have to choose between household appliances and charging gadgets; </li><li>  absolute silence on the territory (both in the daytime and in the evening); </li><li>  regular high-quality cleaning (bed linen and towels are changed according to the first requirement); </li><li>  if you leave a tip to the maid, they will not only twist the swans from the towels, but also bring pleasant surprises in the form of sweets or fresh flowers; </li><li>  deserves special attention the quality of desserts offered in the restaurant (also always a lot of fruit and ice cream); </li><li>  There are Russian-speaking workers. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative points are highlighted by guests of the hotel Sentido Phenicia Hotel 4 * (Hammamet).  Traveler reviews indicate the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are very poorly lit, and therefore, if you like to read at night, there is a risk of spoiling your eyesight; </li><li>  the air conditioner does not cope with its functions; </li><li>  children at the hotel have nothing to do (except for the playground in the open air, nothing is provided for them); </li><li>  guests are deliberately placed in poor rooms so that they can then request a resettlement fee; </li><li>  there are not enough sunbeds on the beach for all guests (you have to take a seat before breakfast); </li><li>  rooms, hall and other premises need redecorating; </li><li>  the hall where evening concerts are held is very stuffy due to a faulty air conditioning system; </li><li>  there are no pedestrian places near the hotel, and therefore, if you want to take a walk, you will have to take a taxi to the nearest boardwalk; </li><li>  the rooms are cramped; </li><li>  shabby and old bath towels; </li><li>  the table in the restaurant is assigned to the guests forcibly and for the entire period of rest, and with the neighbors; </li><li>  in the dining room a total lack of glasses; </li><li>  if you don‚Äôt tip staff, nobody will pay attention to your requests and comments; </li><li>  to eat hearty food in a restaurant, you need to come to the opening, since the amount of food in the distribution is limited and not replenished; </li><li>  a construction is being carried out near the hotel, which not only spoils the view from the window, but also creates a lot of noise; </li><li>  mold begins to appear in the bathroom, and cockroaches periodically run; </li><li>  the evening program is very boring, primitive and monotonous; </li><li>  the food in the restaurant is very oily and spicy; </li><li>  the cards that open the door to the room are constantly demagnetized, and therefore you have to repeat attempts several times or go to the reception with this problem (as an option, you can rub the key on the clothes); </li><li>  large panoramic windows are installed in the lobby, but the impression of a beautiful landscape is spoiled due to stains and dirt on the windows; </li><li>  the lobby area, as well as the rooms are decorated very simply, but I would like to see more decorative elements traditional for Tunisia. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The reviews of the Sentido Phenicia Hotel 4 * hotel allow us to conclude that this is not an ideal, but quite a decent option for accommodation in Tunisia.  Guests are impressed by the vast clean area, as well as the long sandy beach.  The food is quite acceptable, but with its own nuances.  Perhaps the most significant drawback is the need to tip everywhere.  However, this can be considered a distinctive feature of all Tunisian hotels. </p>
