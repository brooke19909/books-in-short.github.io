  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Orange Revolution: Background and Consequence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ukraine, as a young and independent state, is gradually moving towards economic and social well-being.  The basis of this well-being is directly the country's political system.  But the formation of this system does not always happen peacefully. </p><p>  The year 2004 was a turning point in the political history of Ukraine, when the Orange Revolution stirred the whole country.  What became the prerequisite for a popular uprising?  Perhaps the main emphasis should be on the economic component.  After all, it was the thirst for economic well-being and social change that drove the people at that time. </p><p>  The Orange Revolution is a set of rallies of protests, strikes and other acts of general disobedience, the main organizers of which were supporters of the opposition candidate for president in the 2004 election race - Viktor Yushchenko. </p><p>  On the eve of 2004, an opinion began to form in society about the coming to power of a certain political and economic group, which would forcibly carry out its reforms.  This group was associated, first of all, with one of the presidential candidates, namely Viktor Yanukovych. </p><p>  But as the further development of events testifies, there was nothing to fear.  Since the next <span>presidential election was</span> won precisely by Viktor Yanukovych, whose policy has a very positive effect on the development of Ukraine. </p><p>  The Orange Revolution (or rather the first protests) began after the first preliminary announcement of the results by the Central Election Commission.  According to the counted votes, the winner was the rival V. Yushchenko - V. Yanukovich.  But it was too early to congratulate the winner, since the decision of the <span>Supreme Court of Ukraine</span> instructed the CEC to conduct a second round of voting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Ukrainian people began to actively protest against the announced decision.  The main reason for the protests was the lack of confidence in the official results of the <span>election campaign,</span> as well as the allegations of massive falsification of votes.  The poisoning of one of the candidates, namely Viktor Yushchenko, by unknown poison also played a role.  It was also alarming that the data from preliminary polls, the so-called exit polls, showed completely opposite results. </p><p>  Every day more and more people took part in the protests, and the Orange Revolution was gaining momentum.  Activists from the people, in spite of everything, defended their opinion.  The second round of elections also did not give the desired result, but the revolutionaries did not give up.  Holding a vote in the second round brought the desired victory, and Viktor Yushchenko was elected president. </p><p>  Why was the mass movement in Ukraine called the ‚ÄúOrange Revolution"?  Most likely, the basis for this was the coloring of the symbolism of the candidate, in support of which the people spoke, namely orange tones. </p><p>  In the history of independent Ukraine, this revolution was one of the most massive, before that there was no such unrest.  The Ukrainian people decided to demonstrate their opinion to the whole world, which, most likely, was dictated by dissatisfaction with their social situation and the slow progress of economic reforms. </p><p>  As for the results of the Orange Revolution, first of all, <span>this is a demonstration of</span> freedom of speech and expression of will, since it was of a peaceful nature, and force methods were practically not used.  The main victory was that people realized the power of their word and their actions, got the opportunity to convey their opinions to a wide range of people, the opportunity to achieve their own.  Although after every revolution, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine was no exception, disappointment remains. </p>
