    <p>  When choosing a resort, we suggest paying attention to Sousse.  Many vacationers managed to fall in love with him for the developed infrastructure and proximity to the coast.  If you had the opportunity to relax in other towns and villages of the country, you will definitely feel the difference, because most of them are stretched along the coastline.  Sousse is a completely different story: everything is so conveniently located that the tourist can only relax and tune in to a calm and relaxed vacation.  All vacationers are impressed by the city's public beach: the widest coastline with clean fine sand - what else do beach lovers need?  The hotels here are excellent, with first-class service and developed infrastructure.  Most of them offer a full range of travel services, so vacationers do not even have to leave the hotel.  Magic Royal Kenz Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * is a hotel that is quite often found in offers from tour operators.  Based on reviews from real customers, we offer you to evaluate it from all sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Magic Royal Kenz Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * (Tunisia) is a beachfront hotel located on the first coastline, just 10 km from the center of Sousse.

The excursion program is not impressive with its diversity, but harmoniously fits into a calm and measured beach holiday </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Magic Royal Kenz Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * is located on the first coastline, respectively, just a stone's throw from the sea.  The beach is not bad, clean, with fine sand and a gentle entry into the sea.  The Mediterranean Sea here is beyond praise.

Many of those tourists who first come to Tunisia are ready to spend all their free time on the coast: such beautiful landscapes open before their eyes. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantage of the hotel is the minimum number of sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach: a real fight is being waged for them.  In order to take a free place, vacationers have to get up early in the morning and go to the beach Magic Royal Kenz Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 *.  Photos of tourists only confirm this.  In season, the beach is not only crowded, but also quite dirty. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Hotel Magic Royal Kenz Thalasso &amp; Spa 4 * is a good option for a vacation in Tunisia.  An excellent landscaped area, developed infrastructure, high-quality and varied food, comfortable rooms and impeccable service are what attract many vacationers.  Of course, I would like for the price to include more free services, but for the price of the room that the hotel offers, you can forgive him this drawback. </p><p>  We advise you to take a closer look at this option if you are looking forward to an excellent holiday on the Mediterranean coast. </p>
