    <h2>  City location </h2><p>  Jelgava bears the proud name "Zemgale pearls" (one of the five historical Latvian regions).  And this is not surprising - because the city is in the heart of this area.  Jelgava is only 40 km from Riga, 46 km from Jurmala.  This allows you to make both day trips to the Latvian town and long trips. </p><h2>  History of the Courland capital </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine, but about seven thousand years ago, the place where Jelgava is today was hidden under the water.  The Zemgale plain formed at the end of the ice age.  From the south, zemgals came to this territory.  It happened about four thousand years ago.  The name of the tribe became the name of this land.  The main occupations of the Zemgals were cattle breeding and agriculture.  And after the construction of the fortifications began the development of trade and various crafts.  By the way, the chronicles also mention a port located not far from Jelgava. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists and researchers argue that the emergence of the city, now known as Jelgava, can be attributed to the XII century.  Latvia (or rather, the tribes inhabiting these lands) was then subjected to the Crusades.  The fight against the crusaders Zemgals began in 1219.  Information about this territory from the 12th century to the <span>14th century is</span> practically absent.  But in 1573, Jelgava acquired the status of a city, and at the same time a city emblem appeared.  For 217 years, from 1578 to 1795, the Jelgava Palace was the residence of the Duke.  In 1616, the city was declared the capital of Courland. </p>

    <p>  Having become the main city of the duchy, Jelgava began to actively develop.  There were fortifications, water supply.  The second name of this city sounds like Mitawa.  Its translation is ‚Äúexchange‚Äù or ‚Äúexchange‚Äù.  And this is not surprising: thanks to the trade relations of the local duke, the population could get acquainted not only with European culture, but also with overseas goods!  When Jelgava became an important shopping center, the inhabitants of the city tasted wine, potatoes and coffee.  In addition, the Latvian city played the role of a diplomatic center.  With the help of Jelgava, East and West regularly established contacts. </p><p>  In 1795, Jelgava became part of the Russian Empire.  The city continued to grow and develop: thanks to the advent of the railway in 1868, merchants and artisans, traders and teachers moved here.  Before the start of World War I, the population of the city was about 45 thousand people! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Jelgava City: Survivor of War </h2><p>  During the war years, Jelgava was seriously affected.  In 1915, a detachment of Latvian shooters was formed in the city.  Until 1919, Jelgava was occupied.  In this city the Bolsheviks, German troops and fighters for independence fought.  The victory was won by the latter.  Latvia has finally become independent. </p><p>  In 1940, Jelgava (Latvia) became part of the USSR.  This happened after the signing of the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact.  And the Germans who lived in the city were relocated to Germany. </p><p>  The Second World War also affected the appearance of the city.  The historical center, the railway, has suffered.  90% of housing and industrial buildings were destroyed.  Jelgava was in occupation from June 29, 1941 until the end of July 1944. </p><p>  Immediately after the war, a large-scale construction began in the city.  New houses, administrative buildings, cultural institutions appeared in Jelgava.  Old buildings were restored - cathedrals, the Mitava Palace, educational buildings. </p>

    <h2>  Flag and coat of arms of Jelgava </h2><p>  The flag of the Latvian city is a two-color rectangular cloth.  In 1938, colors were approved - dark blue and warm burgundy.  In the very center of the flag is the emblem of the city - the silhouette of an elk's head.  The animal profile is turned to the left.  The image of the head is on the purple shield, the upper part of which is horizontal and the lower part is rounded.  On the neck of the animal is a small emblem of the state. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  How to make Jelgava (Latvia) forever remain in your heart?

Once there was the residence of the dukes, later - the administrative center of the Courland province.  Today it is the main building of the Agricultural University of Latvia.  The palace is the work of the outstanding architect Francesco Rastrelli.  The building was erected in two stages - from 1738 to 1740 and from 1762 to 1772.  The palace survived wars, fires.  Today you can find out its history in the museum located here.  The exposition has been operating since 1968 and tells about the structure of the palace, its interiors and architecture, the history of construction.

    <h2>  Holy Trinity Church Tower </h2><p>  Want to see the city from a height of 37 meters?  Then go to this tower!  At this place there used to be a church, which was the very first stone building in Jelgava.  Its construction began in 1574.  In 1615 the temple was consecrated, and in 1688 a bell tower was added.  Almost two centuries later, work began to boil again - in 1863 the tower was built.  An air raid on the city destroyed the church, but the bell tower remained.  In 2010, after repairs, the tower was open to tourists.  Here are located three historical exhibitions, a restaurant and an information center. </p><h2>  Museums in Jelgava </h2><p>  If you are faced with the question of what to see in Jelgava in order to get to know this town more closely, then feel free to go to local museums! </p>
