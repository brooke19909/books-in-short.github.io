    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative data contain reviews about the hotel Tango Hotel 2 * (Golden Sands).  It is worth noting the following disadvantages of this institution: </p><ul><li>  an old dirty cabinet in which it is unpleasant to pack things (you have to keep everything in your suitcases); </li><li>  old crushed mattresses on the beds; </li><li>  old leaking plumbing; </li><li>  there is no pan in the shower, and therefore all water is collected on the floor during bathing; </li><li>  get to the sea long enough; </li><li>  well-groomed playground with old rides; </li><li>  the hotel is located in the old building of the former dispensary, and major repairs were not carried out in it, because everything is quite old and worn; </li><li>  old furniture; </li><li>  washed bedding and bath towels; </li><li>  due to the poor ventilation system, almost all areas of the hotel have an unpleasant odor; </li><li>  a lot of cobwebs and dust in the rooms; </li><li>  paid use of the refrigerator; </li><li>  there are no cosmetic accessories in the bathroom;  maids do not clean the balcony; </li><li>  the description and photos of the hotel on the official website do not correspond to reality; </li><li>  there is practically no lighting around the hotel, and therefore in the evening it is quite scary to go outside; </li><li>  there is a noisy track next to the hotel; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  the front door of the room is not tight on the floor, and therefore noise from the corridor will interfere with your rest; </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant work not in uniform, but in ordinary casual clothes; </li><li>  constant interruptions in the wireless Internet; </li><li>  linens are rarely changed (for this you need to run around for a maid or complain about the reception); </li><li>  the rooms have bad blankets that cannot warm on a cool night; </li><li>  on the door to the bathroom there is no lock, no hook, or anything like that; </li><li>  neither coffee nor tea is served for breakfast; </li><li>  the bathroom is so cramped that even a person with a thin physique will continually touch the walls, which is not very pleasant; </li><li>  to get to the resort center or to the beach, you need to go down the steep stairs several times, and returning is even more difficult (thus, this is not the best option for relaxing with young children or for older people); </li><li>  there is no pool in the territory, which is a negative factor, given the remoteness from the sea. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The Tango Apartment Hotel <span>(Bulgaria, Golden Sands)</span> evokes the most different emotions from travelers <span>.</span>  Travelers' <span>reviews</span> unequivocally agree that the building itself and all its interior decoration are too old, and therefore need major repairs.  In addition, it is worth noting the extremely inconvenient location both with respect to the beach and relative to the main street.  Guests will have to overcome a lot of ups and downs, which is extremely inconvenient for travelers with children or the elderly. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that Tango Apartment (Golden Sands) is an ideal budget option for active tourists who spend most of the time outside the hotel.  Reviews say that from the very first days, an outdated and worn-out environment will begin to bother.  But with a short stay on the territory you will be pleased with a beautiful park area and pleasant communication with the staff. </p>
