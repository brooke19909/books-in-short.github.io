    <p>  - 20 grams of gold beads; <br>  - 15 grams of blue beads and 15 grams of red; <br>  - a ribbon of golden color 80 cm long. </p><p>  To create such a masterpiece, you can use many other materials and needlework techniques, however, <span>beadwork</span> is considered the most winning option <span>.</span>  Schemes for various products were developed in ancient times.  And in this article one of the options is proposed - a beautiful egg in golden red and <span>blue colors</span> with a bow. <br><br>  First of all, we make the basis for our egg.  Any wood or material that holds its shape well will do.  The pattern should be smooth and fairly dense.  The harder it is, the easier it is to use it in weaving as a frame for beads.  Drill small holes at the two ends of your workpiece.  Now let's get down to work with beads.  Take the thinnest fishing line with a length of about 2.5 m, dial the first row.  String on the very middle of the three blue, red and gold beads.  Thus, it is necessary to thread twenty-two pairs, i.e.  three blue and golden, and three red and golden.  Then connect them into a ring and exit the second blue bead. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead weaving patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/114726.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The second row consists of the 1st blue, 3 golden and 1st red beads.  Exit the 2nd red.  Next comes one red, three gold and one blue.  We leave the blue. <br>  We continue to weave <span>Easter eggs</span> in the same way.  As a result, you should get a cell about five by five in size.  It will become the basis for the festive attribute. <br><br>  Weaving Easter eggs with beads is a painstaking task, so be careful and make notes.  The third row weaving, gaining five golden beads.  The fourth row - we take one golden, three blue and again one golden.  Then again one golden, three red, one golden.  Fifth row - we collect one blue, three golden, one red.  We continue in the same vein.  From the twelfth row, begin to reduce the number of components.  Weave a row, gaining three golden beads.  The thirteenth row - three blue, three red, etc.  Thus, it is necessary to weave nine rows. <br><br>  The bottom of the egg does not need to be woven around, just close it with a pre-prepared ribbon.  Top the product with mosaic weaving.  Pull the ribbon through the holes of the egg, tie a loop at the top, and make a small bow below. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beadwork" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/114727.jpg" width="600"></div>
