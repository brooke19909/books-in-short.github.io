    <h2>  About location </h2><p><em></em>  Guests of The Xanthe Resort &amp; Spa <span>5 *</span> hotel <span>(Side, Turkey)</span> note as one of its indisputable advantages a convenient location near the market and shops.  The market, guests share, is 5 minutes from the hotel, you can buy everything here: swimwear, clothes, shoes, fruits, etc. Tourists recommend always bargaining at the market, while up to 60% of the cost of goods can be saved. </p><h2>  About Territory </h2><p>  According to reviews, the territory of the hotel is quite spacious, comfortable, it has a lot of greenery.  All flowers, trees, bushes located on the territory are signed: plates with Latin names are installed near them.  The authors of the reviews share that at night, hedgehogs run through the hotel.  Along the promenade near each hotel there is a cat cafe where the staff feeds cats, to the delight of children. Tourists say that they really like the wide, long promenade, which is convenient to walk in the evenings.  The minus of vacationers believe that the bars on the beach close the view of the sea.  According to reviews, in the children's Olympic pool in the territory there is always cold water.  They note the presence of many other amenities: the main large pool with children's slides, and a beautifully designed kids club, a pool (indoor) near the spa. </p><p>  Many guests are happy with the necessary infrastructure available in the territory: a store with various little things, a jewelry, gym, spa, cinema, and beauty salon. </p><p>  Near the hotel, the authors of reviews share, a river flows.  Many turtles and fish swim in it. </p><h2>  About Check In </h2><p>  It is not populated immediately, vacationers share.  If you arrive early in the morning, you will have to wait until 14.00.  Visitors are handed bracelets, luggage can be left at the reception and immediately go to breakfast, and then walk around the hotel. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  The rooms on the 4th floor (with sloping ceilings) are equipped with spacious balconies with sea views, which is a big plus for those who like to enjoy the nightly seascape. </p><p>  The rooms on the ground floor, especially if they face the road, guests wake up at night from the noise of buses bringing new tourists to the reception.  In addition, in the morning, gardeners unceremoniously peek into the room, cutting trees under the windows. </p><p>  The administration may refuse to change the number, motivating them by the lack of free places.  The authors of the reviews recommend describing their preferences in advance, even when buying a tour to the hotel. </p><p>  Some guests report poor housekeeping.  If you put a bill with a hint on a dusty TV that it would be nice to wipe off this dust from it, the bill may disappear and the dust may remain. </p><p>  Family rooms are called cozy.  These are two-room apartments with double and bunk beds.  They have two televisions, two watering cans per shower.  The minuses call vacationers significant audibility in the evenings, as well as noise from neighboring rooms. </p><h2>  About the sea and the beach </h2><p>  Vacationers note that the beaches in Side are usually jam-packed. About 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel to the sea.  Living beach is called good, its surface is strewn with yellow sand, the water in the sea is very clear.  The beach is shallow, vacationers say, which is very convenient for bathing children. </p><p>  Unfortunately, hotel guests share, despite the presence of garbage containers, there are a lot of cigarette butts and other garbage on the beach.  According to reviews, tourists have never seen a beach cleaned.  Sun beds, according to reviewers, are often busy with towels, not vacationers.  Many have come to the beach for a long time to look for a free place. </p><p>  Tourists note a comfortable gentle sandy entry into the sea, without stones and breakwaters.  On the beach there is a bar, vacationers share. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists are very pleased with the food provided at the hotel.  According to reviews, in hotel catering establishments everything is very tasty and in large volumes.  As vacationers admit, the hotel does not skimp on alcohol in cocktails.  Food vacationers rate 5 points.  Tourists express great gratitude to the hotel chef, Mr. Erdogann, who is called not only an excellent cook, but a charming person. </p>

    <p> The reviewers report that the hotel can have breakfast and lunch in the main restaurant, at the pool bar, lobby bar, at the beach bar.  There are also a la carte restaurants (Italian and fish), which vacationers can visit for 1 time during their stay for free.  There is also a pastry shop on site.  During the day you can order pizza, Turkish cakes, waffles and ice cream. </p><p>  Hotel guests joke that here you can, without stopping, eat from the morning until the very night soup.  The hotel restaurants regularly prepare delicious and varied dishes.  A lot of sweets, fruits and fresh vegetables are always served.  In the morning there is a delicious pastry.  Themed dinners are held in the evening.  There is a children's and diet menu. </p><p>  Some guests noticed that the waiters in the restaurant pay more attention to German tourists, and to the Russians, the authors of the reviews say, they are somewhat worse. </p><h2>  About excursions </h2><p>  During the first meeting with the guide, hotel guests receive many offers from the tour desk.  The most noteworthy tourists consider an excursion to Israel ($ 250). </p><p>  But the future guests of The Xanthe Resort Spa 5 * reviewers do not recommend going on a shopping tour, although it is included in the price.  The hotel administration has an agreement with some very high-priced shops selling leather jackets, bags, fur coats, sheepskin coats, expensive textiles.  Instead, tourists are advised to visit the local market, which, according to reviews, has a very large size and a huge selection of high-quality goods that sell at affordable prices. </p><h2>  About animation </h2><p>  The guests at The Xanthe Hotel consider animation to be weak.  According to reviews, although during the day the hotel has a children's room, children often refuse to go there, because the animators do not entertain them, they don‚Äôt play games with them on the street, and parents consider it to be true sacrilege to just sit children indoors in this weather.  There is no children's playground in the hotel either, parents share, ‚Äúsomething like that‚Äù is only available on the beach.  In the evening there is a mini-disco, but the children, having gone there once, also for some reason refuse to attend the event.  Adults - on the beach, they sluggishly offer ‚Äúbuch‚Äù and some other games, sometimes there is live music in the evenings. </p><h2>  About contingent </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews report that there are few Russians in the hotel, mainly Germans live here, who, as residents have noticed, the staff loves.  According to reviews, The Xanthe Resort &amp; Spa 5 * is a very calm hotel, mainly the contingent of vacationers in which are pensioners (Germans or Russians) or parents with children.  The number of senior citizens of some tourists is "annoying."  Mostly, guests who have visited the hotel express their intention to stay here again next time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, guests of The Xanthe Resort &amp; Spa 5 * reviews about it leave very positive.  Many loved the hotel.  It is called a rather pleasant object of tourism. </p><p>  The hotel‚Äôs advantages include good quality food, convenient accommodation, a high level of service, equipped beach, staff professionalism, comfortable comfortable rooms, where good cleaning is regularly held, green, clean territory.  Hotel guests call a significant minus of the institution weak animation and a large number of Germans among guests who receive more attention from staff than other vacationers. </p><p>  The hotel is recommended for living for those who like a calm, measured rest, elderly tourists, parents with children.  Youth will be bored here, the authors of reviews assure. </p>
