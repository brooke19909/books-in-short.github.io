Many turn to banks for a loan.  That's just not all have an ideal credit history.  The problem is that everything is introduced into it, even the smallest oversight of the client, such as a single delay in payment.  Not to mention the untimely repayment of debt and other errors.  And when there is another need to arrange a loan - problems arise.  Since the banks, looking at the payment past of the client, do not run the risk of giving him money.  However, there is a way out.  There are banks that do not check credit history. </p>

    <h2>  Binbank </h2><p>  It should be noted that financial organizations that completely turn a blind eye do not exist.  But then there is a list of banks that are condescending to the payment past of their customers.  And because of this, they are becoming more and more popular. </p><p>  Here, for example, Binbank.  It is on the 12th place of the All-Russian rating of banks.  That is, it is among the 15 best and is not the last line there.  The amount of its assets exceeds 1.18 trillion rubles.  And over the past month, Binbank has increased it by 35.87%!  More than 312 billion rubles in 30 days - this data is impressive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you urgently need money, then the best option is to get a credit card for the required amount at Binbank.  Employees of the organization do this as quickly as possible, they do not check the payment history of the client.  Urgent loan service can also be a way out of the situation.  Indeed, the decision in this case is made as soon as possible, for which it is not possible to analyze the history of the client. </p>

    <h2>  "Home Credit Bank" </h2><p>  When listing banks that do not <span>check their credit history,</span> this financial organization should also be noted.  Why?  At least because she is a leader in consumer lending in our market. </p><p>  True, you will have to pay for the bank’s “closed eyes” on a bad payment history.  Interest payments, of course.  The worse the credit history - the higher they are.  But you can look at it from the other side - by regularly depositing money as a debt repayment and not overdue them, you will be able to “bleach” your payment past. </p><p>  So, about the rates.  If a person who is already a <span>client of the bank</span> decides to get a loan in the amount of 10 to 850 thousand rubles, it will amount to 17.9% per annum.  The minimum term is one year.  And the maximum is 84 months.  New customers are offered an amount from 30 to 500 thousand rubles at 19.9% ​​per annum.  And for a period of 12 to 60 months.  For example, if a person on these conditions draws up 300,000 rubles on credit for a year, then in the end he will pay 59,700 rubles as interest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  GE Money Bank </h2><p>  This organization should also be noted with attention when talking about banks that do not check their credit history. </p>

    <p>  The first advantage that pleases GE Money Bank is the ability to complete an online application, which is considered within 30 minutes.  Of course, during this time no one checks the payment past of their potential client.  Here is what GE Money Bank offers: </p><ul><li>  No commissions. </li><li>  The more documents will be provided - the lower the interest rate will be. </li><li>  Amount - from 20 thousand rubles to a million. </li><li>  The maximum term is 5 years. </li><li>  Possibility of early repayment without commissions. </li></ul><p>  It is not surprising that this organization was included in the list of banks that turn a blind eye to the payment past.  By the way, their most popular service is the provision of instant credit cards.  And the name speaks for itself.  In general, at GE Money Bank everyone can borrow money - that's why he is popular. </p><h2>  "Russian standard" </h2><p>  This organization also belongs to the list entitled “Banks that do not check credit history”.  She also offers an express loan service.  The application is considered within 15-20 minutes.  This time is enough for the bank to decide how much to issue to its client. </p><p>  The service is available to everyone.  After all, in order to use it, you need to show only your passport.  But even better - an express loan can be issued remotely through an online service.  Only age limits are limited - the client must be at least 23 years old and a maximum of 65 years. </p>

    <p>  The amount may vary from 3,000 to 1,000,000 rubles.  The minimum term is 3 months.  And the maximum is 3 years.  The rate is determined individually. </p><h2>  Bank Renaissance Credit </h2><p>  It must be noted with special attention.  Do banks check credit history?  Such as the Renaissance, no.  They offer their customers remote credit card processing, with a limit of up to 150,000 rubles.  It is only important to indicate detailed information about yourself (passport data), about your financial condition and work experience.  If the representatives of the organization, in principle, are satisfied with everything, the person will receive the card on the same day.  By the way, when compiling an online application, he can immediately indicate the department in which it will be more convenient for him to pick it up. </p><p>  What about full loans?  The maximum amount of a possible loan is 500,000 rubles.  Maturity - from 24 to 60 months.  The rate for "trouble-free" customers is 15.9% per annum.  For those whose payment history leaves much to be desired - 19.9%.  I am glad that there are several types of services provided to people with financial problems.  Therefore, the Renaissance is consistently included in all kinds of ratings, which list banks that do not check their credit history.  Moscow is the capital, and it is rich in such organizations.  But the Renaissance, whose headquarters are located there, is especially popular. </p>

    <h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  It is impossible not to mention him, listing banks that do not check credit history.  The list of such organizations includes <span>Sovcombank</span> always. </p><p>  It's all about the concept.  This is the largest private bank with a universal profile.  And he primarily specializes in providing financial services to those people who receive them.  These include retirees, citizens of small settlements, and, of course, customers with poor credit history.  It is even indicated in the description of this bank. </p><p>  And, again, one of the most popular services is express credit.  All that is required of a person is a passport of the Russian Federation, compliance with the age limits (up to 85 years) and a 4-month work experience.  True, a small amount can be taken - from 5 to 40 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Where else can I go? </h2><p>  There are several more organizations you can contact.  And it is worth combining them into a list: </p><ul><li>  Tinkoff and Promsvyazbank (history is being studied, but minor delays and similar shortcomings are not taken into account). </li><li>  "Trust" (only a passport is needed). </li><li>  Prominvestbank and ZapsikomBank (only income statements are required). </li><li>  "Orient Express" and "Summer Bank" (loyal requirements for borrowers and a minimum of documents). </li><li>  OTP Bank.  Does <span>OTP Bank</span> check its <span>credit</span> history?  No, he has recently been in the financial market and is trying in every possible way to lure customers. </li><li>  <span>City Bank</span> (they provide loans of completely different sizes, but to obtain a large amount you need official confirmation of income). </li></ul>
