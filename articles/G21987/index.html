Features, interesting ideas and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want the interior to please not only your look, but also delight your friends, you can transform it in many ways.  For example, making decoupage candles.  Thus, you can get accessories that will be unique. </p><p>  Decoupage can be called a craft, when the finished product can stun.  When people look at the result, they think that it is terribly difficult, but in fact everything is very simple.  You only need to be able to cut.  One of the most pleasant things in decoupage is that you can use absolutely any items that you can easily find near your home, for example, herbs, flowers, leaves, pebbles, shells. </p><h2>  First things first </h2><p>  In general, the first thing to do is figure out in which direction the drawing of your candle will be.  Let's say something marine, that means you need a white or blue candle, napkins with anchors, with ships and so on.  Or, for example, something floral - a green candle with sunflowers.  Etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artesanatototal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finished candles" class="if uuid-2342504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342504.jpg"></div><p>  That is, in advance you need to think about what color the candle itself needs, what pattern to choose.  Well, then you can already perform decoupage candles.  A napkin should be tried on a candle, maybe there is something superfluous, if it is found, you need to cut it or cut it off. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Candle selection </h2><p>  Experienced craftsmen say that a white candle will work best.  The fact is that working with such candles is much easier: pick up a picture, design.  And when you practice with <span>white candles,</span> you can take others.  Best of all is a candle so that its top layer is dense. </p><p>  It is also worth bearing in mind that thin candles do not like redundant elements, and monochrome drawings are best for them. </p><p>  Important!  If you do the decoupage of candles with your own hands on a colored surface, that is, which has not one color, but two or three, then the napkin should be with a tone-on-tone pattern and brighter than the pattern of the candle. </p><h2>  Essential Items </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.simplecraftidea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Items for decoupage with a spoon" class="if uuid-2342340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342340.jpg"></div><ul><li>  We need the candle itself.  Now on sale a lot of different, there are round and square, triangular and so on.  Therefore, you can choose any. </li><li>  Next, you need a napkin. </li><li>  Need some rag, best waffle towel. </li><li>  You also need a contour and glitter. </li><li>  If you want volumetric details, you will also need a 3D gel. </li><li>  In addition, you need acrylic varnish to stick glitter. </li></ul><h2>  About napkins </h2><p>  There are special napkins for decoupage, but you can take the usual.  However, it should be borne in mind that we need only the layer on which the picture is depicted.  It should be carefully separated.  Further, it already looks according to the drawing, either it must be cut carefully with scissors, or it can also be carefully removed with your hands.  In some cases, the entire tissue adheres. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are several ways to make decoupage candles.  A master class of some of them will be considered in the article. </p><h2>  The first way - using a teaspoon </h2><p>  You will also need another additional candle to heat the spoon. </p><p>  So, we need to wrap our candle with a napkin, see that the joints coincide, hold it with your hand.  If there are separate elements, then they must also be held by each. </p><p>  The spoon needs to be heated, but the inside is heated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spoon heating" class="if uuid-2342354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342354.jpg"></div><p>  The movement starts from the center of the napkin, ends with the edges, the same applies to the elements.  It is necessary to drive with a spoon so that the napkin is as if flooded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gluing with a spoon" class="if uuid-2342353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342353.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as the cloth dries, you need to carefully examine it, especially pay attention to the stains if they look white and dry.  This fact suggests that the wax did not completely saturate the napkin.  The spoon warms up again and is carefully carried out in those places. </p><p>  It‚Äôs clear that you can see where the spoon went.  To do this, you will need any rag that does not have villi.  The surface is smoothed, this is done up, then down, very quickly.  Thawed wax will correct the surface, but you need to do it very carefully so as not to spoil anything. </p><p>  Now you need to pay attention to the drawing - somewhere to paint the contours, for example, if these are stamens, then you can circle them in red.  Some elements can be made voluminous using a 3D gel.  For example, stars or the moon, or gulls, and so on.  If you use a 3D gel, it must be dry, at first it is white, but as it dries, it will become transparent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawing contours" class="if uuid-2342350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342350.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to see where you put the glitter.  After choosing a place, apply varnish, sprinkle sparkles. </p><h2>  Hair dryer </h2><p>  Decoupage candles can also be done using a hairdryer. </p><ul><li>  Also need a candle. </li><li>  A napkin is required. </li><li>  You will need parchment paper and a hairdryer. </li></ul><p>  As in the first case, the tissue layers must be separated.  The hairdryer is plugged in, and the picture is placed on a candle, smoothing it very well.  Parchment paper is placed on top of the drawing, wrapping the candle around, but you need to look carefully, the jamming is unacceptable.  Now you need to turn on the hair dryer, direct it to the picture. </p><p>  The candle will slowly begin to melt, and you need to turn it so that it warms up evenly.  Then leave it briefly so that it cools down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecoupage 1" class="if uuid-2342522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342522.jpg"></div><p>  This candle decoupage is quick and easy, especially if you work out.  We take a cloth, wipe the candle to remove excess wax or paraffin.  The candle will be slightly leveled.  Next are wax markers, stained glass paints, acrylics, glitter and so on. </p><h2>  Cold method </h2><p>  There is a cold decoupage technique, now we will consider it. </p><p>  For this technique, the candle must have thin walls.  This is very important because the pattern and surface will match.  Even beginners will cope with this look. </p><p>  Cold decoupage of a candle is done using any stick that has a smooth surface, but it is best that it is made of glass.  Now you need to see how long the napkin is.  A centimeter is left for the stock - not only in length, but in width.  The rest is cut off.  The drawing must be attached to the candle, well aligned using a glass tool.  Movements are made from the center, the item needs to be pressed a little.  As soon as the picture is stuck, the seam will be visible, it should be processed.  The same thing needs to be done with the edges.  All excess is cut off, from above it is necessary to impose some additional elements. </p><h2>  Wax paper </h2><p>  There is another interesting way to decoupage candles.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Candle, preferably one-color. </li><li>  Scotch. </li><li>  You also need tracing paper. </li><li>  And you also need wax paper. </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that the tracing paper is very thin, it breaks in the blink of an eye, so you need to fix it with tape to a sheet for printing and print a photo or picture. </p><p>  Important!  The printer must be exactly laser, otherwise ugly spots will appear on your image.  If you do not want to print, you can simply draw (on tracing paper). </p><p>  Around the image you need to cut off all the excess.  Next, you need wax paper that should wrap your candle.  Now take a hair dryer, keep it at a distance of 10-15 cm from the candle and drive very slowly.  You should see how the wax paper will melt, ink will be visible.  The paper must be held very tight, otherwise your whole structure will collapse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideastand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage with wax paper" class="if uuid-2342493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342493.jpg"></div><p>  Now just peel off the paper and enjoy your beautiful original candle. </p><h2>  Secrets </h2><p>  Decoupage can be called a craft, when something ready can stun just incredible.  But there are a few secrets that not everyone knows. </p><ul><li>  Regarding the image - it is best to use decoupage napkins.  However, this is not limited to.  The image can be taken from postcards, calendars, and even print it yourself.  Cut your projects and store them somewhere in a folder.  Also in any city you can find a store where all kinds of things for decoupage are sold.  In an extreme case, for sure, there are a couple of pretty napkins in household goods stores. </li><li>  It‚Äôs best to take an ordinary candle than an aromatic one, since the glue will not stick properly to the latter, it is too greasy for this. </li><li>  If decoupage involves several levels, it should be borne in mind that one level should dry for at least an hour. </li><li>  If you perform decoupage on a colored candle, that is, which has not one color, but two or three, it is very important that the napkin is brighter than the tone of the candle. </li><li>  Also, if you have any strips, traces, or roughness from a spoon, everything needs to be smoothed out.  It is best to apply a new double-sided sponge.  The coarse part will give smoothness, and the soft polish. </li></ul><p>  Now you know how you can perform decoupage, and the article has several ready-made proposals, as well as ideas from which you can build on your own ideas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facebook.com" data-author=": Joanna Wi≈õniewska, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecoupage 2" class="if uuid-2342524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2342524.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many people who have never tried to decoupage candles, but then still decided to do this, understand that in fact there is nothing complicated.  The main thing is to handle the fire very carefully if decoupage is done with a spoon, since the spoon itself, wax or paraffin will be hot.  It would be nice to train on the simplest options so as not to spoil the beautiful candles.  It is done quite easily, gifts are unique, which are not in the store. </p><p>  Decoupage candles is limited only by your image, you can use a variety of napkins, a variety of images, coming up with various topics for any occasion. </p>
