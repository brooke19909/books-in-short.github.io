  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted toys: schemes, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The assertion that toys will always be popular is no exaggeration.  However, over time, the fashion changes.  Once used in special demand fabric, but now they are not inferior in popularity to knitted.  For readers who would like to pamper the children with an original animal made by themselves, we offer an article.  In which we will talk in detail about how to make knitted toys.  Schemes, tips and, of course, a detailed description of the whole process will also be offered to the attention of novice masters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toy pig" class="if uuid-2958923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2958923.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Before embarking on an unusual craftsmanship, it should be carefully considered.  First of all, decide which toy you want to play.  If the product is knitted as a gift to a child whose preferences are unknown, professionals recommend knitting a bear, cat or bunny.  Because it is precisely these animals that kids love most.  It is better for novice masters to take a ready-made knitted toy pattern in order to at least perform the first work on it.  Although the technology of most products is very similar.  Little animals are distinguished only by different faces, sizes of tails and other features of a particular character. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted toys description" class="if uuid-2958805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958805.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><p>  Recently, yarn manufacturers offer a huge selection of products.  Among them, it will be easy to find material that is ideal for making knitted toys and souvenirs.  For example, for a charming bear, you can purchase the appropriate knitting threads - mohair or plush yarn.  However, it is important to remember who the product is for.  For little lovers of knitted toys, it is better to purchase special children's yarn.  Preferably not too fleecy.  After all, babies have a habit of chewing everything that comes into their hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  Knitters who are engaged in the implementation of knitted toys according to the schemes presented on the Internet and on needlework magazines or developed independently, argue that it is most convenient to work with a crochet.  This allows you not to use the needle for stitching parts, but to knit the entire product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted toys step by step" class="if uuid-2958304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958304.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the toy, knitted, is too holey, translucent.  Which significantly spoils her appearance.  Nevertheless, every knitter can choose a convenient tool based on her taste.  In this article, we present instructions for knitting needles and a hook. </p><h2>  Amigurumi ring </h2><p>  Amigurumi is a technology that involves knitting soft toys with knitting needles or crochet.  She appeared relatively recently, but has already managed to win a huge number of fans around the world.  Moreover, a special skill is the implementation of tiny toys.  Although copies of the size of a schoolboy are also popular.  They do not argue about tastes in this matter.  The development of the aforementioned technology begins with the study of the so-called amigurumi ring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted toys" class="if uuid-2958797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958797.jpg"></div><p>  This is the initial stage of the implementation of any toy.  He implies the following actions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We take the yarn and wrap it on the index finger of the left hand. </li><li>  The resulting loop is carefully removed and tied with a hook. </li><li>  We make six single crochet.  We will knit them throughout the entire process. </li><li>  Then gently tighten the ring by pulling the free end. </li><li>  Then we knit the product further, moving in a circle. </li></ol><h2>  How to start knitting ideas with knitting needles </h2><p>  To make a <span>knitted toy with knitting needles,</span> it is necessary to prepare tools that usually knit gloves, socks, and other hosiery.  Then we collect six loops and distribute them into three knitting needles.  Next, we knit, moving in a circle.  In the first and subsequent odd rows, we work with the current number of loops.  In the second and all subsequent even ones, we add one new loop after the first and before the last one.  As a result, we gradually reach the desired size of the part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted toys technology" class="if uuid-2958799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958799.jpg"></div><h2>  How are knitted toys </h2><p>  The needlewoman chose the knitting needles or hook to bring her ideas to life, it is not so important.  Because both processes are very similar.  To begin with, the master performs the product by tying a circle of the right size, and then ties it around, giving it the desired shape.  The simplest options fit in without adding or decreasing.  But true amigurumi masters betray the details of the desired texture.  For example, carefully muzzle is tied out.  It is also worth noting that almost all master classes and, accordingly, patterns of knitted toys start the same way.  The needlewoman knits legs or paws first.  If the toy is human-like, two parts need to be prepared.  If this creature, standing on four legs, is 2 times more.  When the necessary parts are ready, they need to be assembled together.  The reader can learn the technology in the photograph below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted toys how to make" class="if uuid-2958318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958318.jpg"></div><p>  Two work options are visible on it.  However, it is important to note that the four legs should be separated by a small gap.  To do this, we fasten two front paws and two hind legs separately.  Then from any one pair we knit a cloth half the size of a common circle.  Having reached the desired length, we attach the second legs to it.  Then we tie the outer side of the first pair, move along the side of the resulting fabric, go to the outside of the second paws and finish knitting the first row, passing along the second side of the intermediate fabric.  Next, we rise to the required number of rows, twisting the trunk.  Then we reduce the loops in such a way as to form a hole for tying the neck.  We tie it and, finally, make out the head.  That's the whole point of the description and patterns for knitted toys with knitting needles or crochet. </p><h2>  Master classes </h2><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to tie a conceived animal, doll, baby doll or fictional character with your own hands.  Especially if you study the ready-made step-by-step master class.  We suggest that you consider the most interesting and simplest work options for beginners in the photo below.  They have ideas for knitters who prefer knitting needles, as well as for those who more respect the hook.  Thanks to what, everyone can try their hand.  And then, after training on the instructions prepared by professionals, and understanding the technology of amigurumi, it will be possible to knit various creatures according to their own parameters and ideas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted toys" class="if uuid-2958299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2958299.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, I would like to draw the attention of readers not only to the presented collection of "Crochet and knitting toys."  But also on the main photo of the current article.  It depicts a charming pink piggy.  Which must be tied to the upcoming New Year.  After all, this particular animal will accompany us throughout the next year.  So that he does not take offense, and besides, he fulfills his most secret dream, he should be met with due respect.  For example, having greeted with a knitted toy "Symbol of the Year". </p>
