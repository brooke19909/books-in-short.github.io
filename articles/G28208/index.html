It successfully combines the ideal conditions for lovers of lazy relaxation, and a large number of attractions and attractions.  If you are one of those who want to return with a gorgeous bronze tan to the envy of all friends and girlfriends, you should definitely pay attention to the resort of Thailand Hua Hin.  The best hotels and beaches of the country are concentrated here.  It is about them that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  City Beach </h2><p>  The territory of Hua Hin is conditionally divided into three parts: central, southern and northern.  The last two are suitable for families with small children, as well as tired of the noisy city bustle.  The first combines sights and entertainment. </p><h2>  central part </h2><p>  This territory is located near the ‚ÄúStone Head‚Äù and has a length of several kilometers.  Next to this Hua Hin beach in Thailand is the Hilton Hotel.  The main entrance here is located near the police.  Trade tents, a huge number of souvenirs and accessories - that‚Äôs what will meet you, you just have to step outside the gate.  The cost of renting a sunbed and an umbrella is 100 baht (195 rubles), but if you live in one of the local hotels, they can be taken for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hua Hin Beach" class="if uuid-2573160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2573160.jpg"></div><p>  If you come here to relax with the maximum noise and chic, it is best to choose the central beach of Hua Hin.  Entertainment for every taste and color is its main feature.  Not sure where to go in the evening?  There are many bars and restaurants.  Want to buy souvenirs?  Welcome to the central market.  Do you dream of visiting the famous Thai massage?  There are plenty of spas here.  And this is not all the entertainment offered by Hua Hin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  southern part </h2><p>  It starts from the base of Mount Khao Takiab, crowned with a temple and an open area for a view.  The main feature and advantage of this Hua Hin beach, the photo of which can be found below, is that in many of the local hotels you can directly go to the sea from the steps.  Tourists here are not crowded, and indeed there are few visitors.  Not surprisingly, the beach is extremely narrow and there are practically no umbrellas with sun loungers. </p><h2>  Northern part </h2><p>  This zone stretches from the fishing pier to the airport itself.  Being here, you should definitely visit the Royal Palace and Sirikit Park.  Due to the fact that the residence of the king is carefully guarded, you can not worry about your safety.  Fans of soulful conversations in silence under the starry sky will find the north beach the best beach of Hua Hin.  Perhaps this is indeed so.  Clear water and a spacious shore - that's why people come here from all over the resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pbase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain and beach Khao Takiab" class="if uuid-2572238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2572238.jpg"></div><h2>  Kao Takiab </h2><p>  This name bears both the mountain and the nearby beach in Hua Hin.  It‚Äôs impossible to get to them along the coast, only along the highway. </p><p>  The sea and coast here, as a rule, are always clean and not crowded, which attracts lovers of lazy relaxation.  Here you can ride a horse in the surrounding area, a water bike in the sea, or climb to the top of the mountain, called the Monkey Mountain.  No, actually it is extremely difficult to see them here, almost unrealistic.  All because they are practically not here, only a few elderly individuals.  Climbing up here is for a 20-meter statue of Buddha and observation platforms with unrealistic views of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From gastronomic entertainment, the beach offers only a couple of cafes.  Night life as such is not here. </p><h2>  Xuan Song </h2><p>  This Hua Hin beach is actually a continuation of Khao Takiab.  If you call here from the highway, you will have to pay 10 baht (20 rubles).  If you come from a nearby beach, no one will take anything.  Suan Son is considered to be the most picturesque beach of this resort, although tourists visit it quite rarely.  Mostly locals rest here.  Apparently, only they can appreciate this wonderful Hua Hin beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luxury-thailand-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xuan Son Beach" class="if uuid-2572962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2572962.jpg"></div><h2>  Sai noi </h2><p>  Half an hour from the center is the most favorite beach of tourists.  There are no shops, no hotels, no peddlers.  But there is no crowd either.  San Noi Beach in Hua Hin is preferred by families with children and couples in love who prefer a quiet and relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Tao </h2><p>  Another Hua Hin beach located near the mountain of the same name.  Its highlight is the lagoon.  It is this beach that is chosen by families and those who have not gotten used to swimming.  Tourists here love to just walk along the coast, enjoying the romantic atmosphere.  Umbrellas, sunbeds and grocery stores are not here. </p><h2>  Hua Hin Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, the opinions of tourists differ, since everyone has their own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ideal beach holiday.  Someone recommends a noisy central city beach, someone quiet Sai Noi.  In any case, everyone here will find a place that he likes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Apart from the sea and beaches, Hua Hin definitely has something to do.  For example, many tourists take a few days off specifically for sightseeing.  What are the most interesting? </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Station" class="if uuid-2572247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2572247.jpg"></div><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  No matter how strange it may sound, but for Thais this place is almost sacred.  It was built in 1911, when the king chose this city as his residence and made it a real resort.  In 1920, a special waiting room for the monarch's family was equipped in the station building.  They now rarely visit here, but tourists really like this place. </p><h2>  Cicada market </h2><p>  If you do not know what to do with yourself on the weekend, the best solution would be to go to Khao Takiab Street.  It is here that the main Hua Hin party place is Cicada Market.  Theatrical shows, open-air galleries, accompanied by the music of local bards, souvenir shops and masterpieces of Thai, European and Chinese cuisines.  And you can buy all this not for money, but for tickets that are purchased at the entrance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chalaymonta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cicada market" class="if uuid-2572992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2572992.jpg"></div><h2>  Night market </h2><p>  By name, it is clear that this place opens only at night.  More precisely, from 5 pm.  However, the assortment is rather mundane: clothes, shoes, a large number of souvenirs.  Nearby there are many cafes and food courts where you can try various local dishes.  Seafood is cooked right before your eyes. </p><h2>  Wat ampharam </h2><p>  Another attraction of Hua Hin, enjoyed by the Thais only because of its connection with the royal family.  If you want to feel the local flavor with might and main, definitely visit this complex from the temple, monastery and columbaria. </p><h2>  Pala-U Waterfall </h2><p>  This nature-created Hua Hin landmark is located in Kaeng Krachan National Park.  Pala-U is the highest waterfall in Thailand.  Climbing 16 steps, you can see the chic landscapes of Hua Hin.  Nearby are the jungle and pristine nature.  Not far from here you can meet elephants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall Pala-U" class="if uuid-2572977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2572977.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal Palace and its history </h2><p>  Perhaps the main <span>attraction of Hua Hin</span> is the palace of Marukhataivan.  It was erected in 1923 by order of the monarch of Rama 6. Initially, the castle was located on the beach of Chao Samran.  The result did not satisfy the ruler, and the building was demolished.  They decided to build a new palace from teak in the Cha-Am district.  From the area to Bangkok there is a railway, around a beautiful forest landscape, mangrove trees and a fresh sea breeze. </p><p>  The king personally designed almost the entire design for his palace.  Majestic high ceilings, good ventilation system, niches with water to repel ants.  To complete the project, the monarch hired Italian architect Ercole Manfredi. </p><p>  The ruler used the palace as a summer residence for the royal family until his death in 1925. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://yourthaiguide.com/mrigadayavan-palace/" data-original="yourthaiguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teak Palace" class="if uuid-2574074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2574074.jpg"></div><p>  Marukhathaivan is also called the Palace of Love and Hope.  It consists of three parts with long corridors between them.  One leads to the beach, the second to the king‚Äôs private room, while the third leads to the women's section. </p><p>  Phisan Sacorn - King‚Äôs private quarters: study, bedroom, bathroom, refectory and dressing room.  Rama 6 was a poet and wrote most of his poems in the Teak Palace.  In the Smundra Biman section, the wife of the king lived.  Sewakamart has work rooms and a theater. </p><p>  After the death of Rama 6, the castle remained empty.  Now this is the main attraction of Hua Hin.  Having visited her, you can see some household items of the monarch, for example, his bed, sofa, desk, pencils and paper. </p><p>  Tourists come here daily, except Wednesday, until 5 pm.  When planning to visit the palace, do not forget that they are not allowed in short shorts, skirts and T-shirts here.  You also need to take off your shoes in reverence for the ancient traditions of Thailand.  At the entrance they will give out a bag where you can put your shoes.  The tour includes a visit to the palace itself, as well as a walk through the surrounding areas.  Shooting is prohibited here.  For a more comfortable walk you can rent a bike. </p><h2>  Top Hotels </h2><p>  Before planning a trip, you can consider everything: transport, entertainment, interesting places to visit.  And most importantly, the hotel.  Below is a selection of the best in Hua Hin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hua Hin Hotels" class="if uuid-2573157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2573157.jpg"></div><h2>  The Hotel Cha Am de La Phe </h2><p>  This hotel is suitable for those who come here to really relax without the crushing noise of the city crowd, annoying screams.
