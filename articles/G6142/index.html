Lappeenranta - Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lappeenranta (Finland) is a small town by Russian standards near the border.  It is two hundred and twenty kilometers from St. Petersburg, sixty from Vyborg, and even less than 25 km from the Brusnichnoye checkpoint.  Therefore, from the city on the Neva, you can go to Lappeenranta and return home within one day. </p><p>  Most of our compatriots consider a trip to Finland exclusively through the prism of shopping tours.  But in vain.  You can significantly <span>expand the horizons of</span> your spiritual world by visiting this city with an educational tour.  However, to relax on the shores of the wonderful Lake Saimaa in the summer and ride on a real ski slope in the winter is also quite possible.  Let's see how to get there and how to spend time in the wonderful and characteristic town of Lappeenranta.  After all, he is so interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lapperanta for 1 day" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393756.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In Lappeenranta by minibus </h2><p>  Private carriers of St. Petersburg literally fight for customers.  The package of services often includes collecting and transporting to the addresses of passengers, as well as paying them money by invoice.  But the main purpose of such trips to the Finnish city is purely commercial.  In addition to brief information about Lappeenranta, you will not hear anything more from the guide.  But there will be long stops at Lidl, Prism stores, and shopping malls.  Some carriers promise free time for their sightseers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is what a regular shopping tour in Lappeenranta looks like.  Departure from St. Petersburg around seven to nine in the morning, passing the border without visiting the duty-free store.  Then, before reaching the city, the group for an hour drops anchor near the Lapland store.  Then you are given ‚Äúfree time‚Äù for sightseeing.  It varies from two to three hours.  It is usually used by tourists to plunder the central boutiques of the city.  Then the group goes on an excursion to the shopping centers "Lidl", "Disa's Fish", a wholesale warehouse "Kespro" and returns to St. Petersburg late at night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lapperant's Card" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393757.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  By bus </h2><p>  Tourist minivans are good because they will take you home with numerous purchases.  You can also negotiate with the driver about transportation to Lappeenranta Airport - the easternmost in the European Union.  From there, the Air Baltic, Blue1 and Ryanair low-cost flights fly to Germany, Italy, Spain and the capital of the country, Helsinki. </p><p>  Of course, the regular bus to Lappeenranta is not as convenient as the minibus provided by the travel agency.  But you are not constrained in time and can spend it on what you want to do.  This type of transport leaves from the city bus station, as well as daily from the Gallery Gallery (near the <span>Moscow station)</span> and the Pulkovskaya hotel.  Using flight beads, it is quite possible to make independent one-day tours to Lappeenranta. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lapperanta finland" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393758.jpg?1400005543691" width="550"></div>

Bus and train stations are located nearby.  But you are unlikely to be able to plan a Lappeenranta 1-day train tour.  Unfortunately, there is no direct rail link between St. Petersburg and Lappeenranta.  The authorities promised to introduce such a train in 2014.  But so far, by rail, this Finnish city can only be reached with a change in Vainikkale.  From there go minibuses to Lappeenranta.  By the way, the old building of the Imperial Station, which was one of the sights of the city, burned down in a fire last year. </p><h2>  Lappeenranta 1 Day Cruise </h2><p>  From mid-May to the first decade of September, you can take an exciting journey to this Finnish city by ship.  The motor ships ‚ÄúKarelia‚Äù and ‚ÄúKamila‚Äù depart from Vyborg, Russia and sail along the picturesque Saimaa Canal with a call to the city of Lappeenranta, whose sights - the castle and the church - are perfectly visible from the side of the boat.  Passengers are given several hours of free time, so the trip, if desired, will be very informative.  From June 16 to August 9, lovers of boat trips have one more opportunity: take a ride on the motor ship ‚ÄúBrahe‚Äù from Lappeenranta to Savonlinna along the surface of the beautiful Lake Saimaa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Lapperanto" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393759.jpg?1400005584306" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What you can see on your own in Lappeenranta </h2><p>  In this small city, whose population is only seventy-two thousand people, a map is practically not needed.  Lappeenranta, as well as the expanse of the lake will open to your eyes if you climb the fortifications of Linnoitus Lappeenranta or the local bastion.  The fortress was erected in 1649 on a prominent cape into the water.  The Swedes began to build it, and the Russians already finished. </p><p>  Here you can familiarize yourself with the most interesting history of the city.  He also has another, Swedish name - Wilmanstrand, which means ‚ÄúSavage Coast‚Äù.  This name is also displayed in the coat of arms of the city, on which a man in a green <span>loincloth</span> with a club flaunts.  For a long time, Lappeenranta was a Russian outpost guarding the country's borders from the Swedes.  The Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary - the oldest Orthodox church in Finland (the year of consecration - 1785) is preserved here.  The cathedral is located on the territory of the fortress, as well as the museums of the Horse Guards and Art of South Karelia, an exhibition of crafts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lappeeranta Attractions" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393760.jpg?1400005680322" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Walking </h2><p>  To feel the calm, pacifying atmosphere of this resort, just walk along the streets of a city like Lappeenranta.  Its sights are not limited only to the fortress complex.  Be sure to take a look at the country's oldest wooden town hall (1829), the monument to the battle of Wilmanstrand, visit the Lutheran churches of the Virgin Mary and Samonlahti, the house-museum of the merchant Volkov, and the art gallery.  In this city, you will not feel the <span>language barrier,</span> since local residents have long been accustomed to Russian tourists and, if they behave in a civilized manner, show them cordiality and hospitality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus to Lapperanta" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/393763.jpg?1400005802762" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Events </h2><p>  When planning a trip to the city of Lappeenranta for 1 day, you can guess in such a way as to get to one of the many festivals.  For example, on May 17th there will be held the "Night of Museums."  The entire complex of the fortress at this time is working around the clock, but they do not charge money for entering it.  In addition, fire and dance shows, tours in Russian, firing from cannons and a performance of a puppet theater are expected. </p><p>  Summer is especially eventful.  An excursion train works, a competition of sand castles is held, exhibitions of aviation, precious stones, paintings are held, fairs are held.  On June 13th, the resort will host a jazz festival, and on July 12-13, a music festival.  On August 22 and 23, a gala concert of European ballet will take place. </p><p>  Autumn here is off season.  The fun begins again with the advent of the Christmas holidays, which are marked by the opening of the winter fair.  On December 23, the city solemnly meets Joulupukki at the railway station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shop tour to Lapperanta" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/396813.jpg?1400149153275" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Arriving in the city of Lappeenranta for 1 day, you can have a great time in nature.  If the weather spoils you on a hot summer day, the beautiful sandy Mullusaari beach with a water slide is at your service.  This resort has a racetrack, golf courses, and a stadium with pools.  From May 1 to the end of September, the ‚ÄúFlow Park‚Äù is open for outdoor enthusiasts.  On the shore of the lake, on the beach, there is a sauna.  You can also enjoy the baths at the Lappeenrannan Kilpilya SPA Hotel. </p><p>  In summer, the local tour desk organizes hiking and cycling excursions.  Tracks and tracks are perfectly marked, so you can go hiking yourself.  You can rent a boat or pedal boats <span>.</span>  The huge expanse of the lake and constant winds allow you to surf here. </p><p>  Winter is not a barrier to outdoor activities in Lappeenranta.  Any alpine resort can envy the abundance of snow entertainment in this city.  Instead of a sand castle, an ice palace is being erected.  There is a skating rink in the center of winter entertainments ‚ÄúKisapuisto‚Äù and a real ski resort Khukhtiniemi with ski jumps, slopes, slalom, toboggan and snowboard tracks. </p>
