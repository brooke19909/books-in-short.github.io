But the first one still dominates, and this means that it rains in winter and dry in summer.  Basically, the average temperature in winter does not exceed +16 degrees with high humidity of 75%.  Little snow falls, mostly it remains lying in the mountains, it is practically absent on the plains.  The cold winds of boron and Euroclidon bring abundant cloud cover, but then beautiful weather sets in.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the winter months, the weather prevails unstable.  Most of January it rains and it is very cold.  But there are such days, people call them quiet, then there is warm, dry weather.  February is usually much warmer and hotter than January.  During this period, the buds even begin to swell in the trees.  The winter months are considered the low season for the tourism business.  For those who love a warm beach holiday, in principle, at this time in Crete there is nothing to do.  But for fans to admire the ancient historical buildings - this is an ideal period.  Since the weather is changeable, it can be warm or very cold. </p><h2>  December </h2><p>  In December, there is a decrease in daylight hours by about 6.5 hours.  The low sun slightly warms the earth, and in the highlands, in general, snow lies.  In the mountains, frosts are very common.  Water warms up to about 18-19 degrees.  In the absence of wind, a beautiful natural phenomenon occurs that looks like swirling steam. </p><h2>  January on the island </h2><p>  This month, the longitude of the day increases, this significantly affects the heating of the air.  At night the temperature is from + 7-12, during the day + 11-16 degrees, sometimes it is cooler.  The cyclones coming from the western side of the island significantly spoil the weather, they bring with them coolness and rainy gloomy weather conditions. </p><h2>  February </h2><p>  The weather in Crete in February is more unstable.  This month, daylight hours increase, the probability of heavy rains slightly decreases.  But the dominant northerly winds (borras and mesoborras) continue to cool the troposphere of Crete: at night the temperature is + 7-12, during the day - plus 12-17 degrees.  In certain periods, cold air currents from Europe can cool the surface layer of the troposphere to zero, but the sea remains warm: plus 15-16 degrees.  February is the coldest month. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  High season on the island </h2><p>  To this season travel companies include all the summer months.  Hot weather on the island is from the very beginning of summer until late August.  Air temperature ranges from about 28 to 30 degrees.  And sometimes 40 degrees can be seen on the thermometer.  It can also be noted that the island is not very crowded with tourists.  True, this is observed in cities that are located far from the center and offer minimal living conditions for a fairly small fee.  Also in the midst of the high season, you should go to the northern part of the island, on the shores of the Aegean Sea. </p><h2>  Swimming season in Crete </h2><p>  The bathing season on the island, as a rule, is opened in the second half of April, because at that time the water in the Mediterranean warms up to about 21 degrees.  More comfortable only at the end of May.  This month the sea is more pleasant and warm.  The maximum temperature of the water can be observed somewhere from the middle or the end of summer, when there is sultry heat.  In summer, it is advisable to go out to sea only in the morning or in the evening, as in the daytime the sun is very harmful and dangerous.  In general, those who want to relax comfortably and lie on the beach should come to the island in September.  Indeed, at this time the heat is falling, the sun is not dangerous, and the sea is more pleasant. </p><p>  Guests of Crete are welcomed throughout the year by hotel complexes of various categories.  There are both luxury expensive hotels and options for budget travelers.  One of them will be considered in this article. </p><h2>  Characteristic hotel Zantina 2 * </h2>

    <p>  The hotel deserves its 2 stars.  The rooms here do not sparkle with luxury, but living in comfort is quite possible.  The main thing is that there are no roommates in the form of cockroaches and bed bugs. </p><p>  The room has everything you need.  For air conditioning you need to pay extra for 5 euros per bitch.  It does not bother that instead of a large double bed, two twin beds are pushed together.  You can ask the staff for a long pillow and close the joint. </p><p>  The service in the hotel Zantina Hotel 2 * (Crete, Rethymnon) is simply wonderful.  Room cleaning occurs 2 times a week.  At the same time, the apartments are completely washed, dusted, the bathroom is thoroughly cleaned, garbage is removed and toiletries are added.  Sheets are changed once a week. </p><p>  The hotel is private.  Owns a friendly family.  Each guest is a master here, and they are treated with special trepidation.  The leaving guests are escorted to a taxi and after a long wave of their hand. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  You should not expect from a two-star hotel too much variety in food.  Do not serve seafood and other exotic here.  But I am glad that the hotel provides BB breakfast, that is, it is included in the price. </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard to stay hungry even after a modest table.  Breakfast includes sandwiches with sausage and cheese, cookies, butter, jams, juices.  The hosts themselves offer hot drinks and milk.  The dishes on the table are always clean.  For two stars, the food is quite diverse. </p><p>  Free internet is available at the reception.  In some rooms he also catches, but weakly. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

    <p>  Zantina Hotel 2 * (Crete, Rethymnon) is located in an excellent location.  The beach is within walking distance.  You need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas, but you can do without them.  The beach area is very spacious.  Outside the hotel there are many cafes and shops.  Rethymno city center is a 10-minute drive away. </p><p>  Greece is not only the sea, the sun and the beaches.  The island of Crete itself is incredibly attractive for tourists with its attractions.  Arriving here, you must definitely rent a car and explore all the interesting places on the island.  Without this, rest cannot be called full. </p><h2>  Tour reviews </h2>

    <p>  It is best to go to Crete in early summer.  The greens are juicy at this time.  The whole island is flooded with bright colors.  In addition, there is no such heat as at the end of summer, so you can comfortably consider all the sights of the island. </p><p>  Excursions here are not very cheap.  But communication with locals is the best free tour.  It is also worth going to the Samarya Gorge.  Here you can see picturesque landscapes.  In these places amazing goats Kri-Kri live.  Getting here is not so easy, the journey takes about 6 hours.  But it's worth it.  Mountain clean air quickly relieves fatigue. </p><p>  Excursions are best purchased locally.  So it turns out much cheaper than buying a tour from tour operators.  But there is a risk of getting into a mixed group with a foreign guide.  You can also explore the sights of Crete by yourself in a rented car, while it is better to ask local residents about the routes in advance. </p><h2>  General impression </h2>

    <p>  The hotel has an ideal location.  Suitable for those who are not used to spending all time in a hotel.  The beach is across the road.  Breakfast is not very diverse, but they can satisfy your hunger.  Great work staff.  People are polite and good-natured.  Occasionally, settlement problems may occur, but all conflicts are resolved quickly and without quarrels. </p><p>  Internet only at the reception.  The rooms are in excellent condition, cleaned regularly.  All furniture and plumbing is almost new.  Linen is changed once a week, garbage is taken out daily.  There are no cockroaches, molds and other insects. </p><p>  Overall, the hotel deserves its two stars.  The price is consistent with the quality.  The location of the hotel can even count on a higher rating. </p><p>  Holidays in this place will appeal to families, the elderly and those who prefer peace and quiet to crazy nightlife.  But the main advantage of this complex is the low cost of living, which even includes breakfast.  In any case, Crete is not a place where there is absolutely nothing to do, and the hotel is the main attraction for tourists.  There are many amazing places to visit, and you can only spend the night at the hotel. </p>
