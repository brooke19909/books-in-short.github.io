    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The first thing that Samsung Tab 3 Lite should pay attention to is the screen.  On a tablet, it should usually be quite large.  Unfortunately, in this regard, Samsung can not boast of anything.  After all, the size of the diagonal of the display in the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab 3 Lite is only 7 inches.  This is not so much as it might seem at first glance.  After all, the bulk of these gadgets now comes with a diagonal of 10.1 inches. </p><p>  However, this does not reduce the quality of the device.  In general, apart from the compact size of the display, it more than suits users.  After all, this tablet conveys 16 million colors and shades.  So, the image will always be high-quality and unforgettable.  In addition, the screen resolution is also commendable.  At Samsung Tab 3.7.0 Lite it is 1024 by 600 pixels.  This is enough to watch movies in excellent quality.  In addition, reading on such a tablet and playing is also convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  Actually, not only the screen affects the dimensions of the device.  Sometimes you should pay attention to the size of the tablet as a whole.  Especially if you plan to carry the gadget with you.  In addition, weight plays an important role here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy tab 3 lite" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979744.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite has very good results in this regard.  This tablet is compact.  Its length is 193 millimeters, its width is 116, and its thickness is 1 centimeter.  But for such a device, this is enough.  Keeping it pretty comfortable.  And even a child can cope with the tablet. </p><p>  Weighs Samsung Tab 3 Lite 7.0 8GB just 310 grams.  This is extremely small.  So, the tablet will not be for you the so-called excess load.  In principle, all this very well affects the reviews left by customers.  After all, it is they who are able to glorify any gadget.  We can say that this product is a real storehouse for the student.  After all, the child will be very comfortable with such a light and miniature, but at the same time suitable for reading and entertainment tablet. </p><h2>  CPU and system </h2><p>  Samsung Tab 3 Lite also pleases customers with its processor and operating system.  After all, without these components, you can‚Äôt imagine a gadget working well.  The thing is that the processor here has 2 cores of 1.2 GHz.  This is a very worthy indicator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung tab 3 7 0 lite" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979743.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The operating system, of course, is known to everyone - "Android."  Only now the version of it is a bit old - 4.2.  Nevertheless, buyers are still happy with her.  If necessary, you can always just take and update the system.  Until any new version.  But so far it is not worth rising above 4.4.  After all, this particular version is most often found on many gadgets.  So, she is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  In order to run games and applications, in addition to the processor and the system, one more detail is needed.  It is called RAM, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.7.0 Lite in this regard has no distinctive features.  Indeed, as many potential buyers assure, there is very little RAM here - only 1 GB. </p><p>  But practice shows that this space is more than enough.  Firstly, we are not dealing with a gaming tablet.  So, a lot of RAM is not needed here at all.  Secondly, most programs and games require just such an indicator to ensure operability. </p><p>  Thus, even 1 GB of RAM ensures maximum operation of the device.  And you do not have to endure any restrictions and hardships.  Yes, the latest tablet games will not be activated.  But the bulk for entertainment or work - easily.  Sometimes this is enough for customers to be satisfied with the tablet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy tab 3 7 0 lite" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979742.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Space </h2><p>  Of course, no gadget can do without such a feature as free space.  It is necessary for recording personal data and installing applications.  At Samsung Tab 3 Lite this indicator is far from the highest level.  Nevertheless, this does not deter buyers from this product. </p><p>  It is worth considering: when you purchase, you will be available on the Samsung Tab 3 Lite 7.0.  8GB of memory.  Of these, in fact, 6.5-7 gigabytes are obtained.  After all, the rest of the space is needed for the operating system and resources to ensure the health of the tablet.  In general, the place, frankly, is not enough.  But only this, as has already been said, does not scare off buyers.  After all, this situation can be easily and simply corrected.  How exactly? </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  For example, insert a so-called memory card into the device.  Unfortunately, some models of tablets, phones and other gadgets do not have this capability.  But not the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 8GB.  After all, this device has such an opportunity. </p><p>  If you are sorely lacking space, then simply connect a microSD memory card to the tablet.  Only there is one small restriction - this is the maximum allowable amount.  It is only 32 GB.  If desired, you can attach more, but in this case you will have to prepare for numerous hardware failures.  Sometimes they can cause enormous damage to the tablet‚Äôs performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy tab 3 lite 8gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979741.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Another little tip: do not completely fill the memory and card with data.  Leave at least 500 MB free.  This will avoid some not-so-pleasant system crashes.  They are not critical, but still affect the performance of the tablet. </p><h2>  Battery and camera </h2><p>  The battery and camera are the last two components that you should pay attention to.  In principle, the camera on the tablet is not so important.  Nevertheless, it should be.  After all, without this feature, you should not even stare at one or another gadget. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is only one camera here.  And she shoots with an average quality of 2 megapixels.  Still, this is not enough for a tablet.  But in capable hands, even such a rear camera will give an excellent result.  Nevertheless, this pushes buyers away from the gadget.  Sometimes it‚Äôs pictures from the tablet that are needed in good quality.  Especially when it comes to such a compact device as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 8GB. </p><p>  But the battery on the tablet pleases.  Its volume is not so large - 3600 mAh.  But that's just a huge time.  In standby mode - about a month.  With active use, you can hope for a week of work.  And if you rarely work with a tablet, then it will require recharging in about 2-3 weeks. </p><p>  By the way, this device charges very quickly.  It takes only 2 hours to recharge the battery from 0 to 100%.  Compared to charging analogs, this is not so long.  Plus, with a slight charge, the battery does not deteriorate.  So, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the gadget turning off at the most inopportune moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung tab 3 lite 7 0 8gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979740.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price list and results </h2><p>  In principle, the main <span>characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab 3 Lite are already known to us.  Now it's time to take stock.  But first, find out the cost of this tablet.  Maybe she's too tall?  And this will scare away many potential buyers.  What do we really have? </p><p>  In fact, the price tag for this tablet is not very large.  You can find the Samsung Galaxy for only 8-9 thousand rubles.  A device of this type, as a rule, costs 2 times more expensive.  So if you need an inexpensive, but high-quality tablet, then you can pay attention to this option.  And even necessary in some cases. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Samsung is an excellent choice for study and work.  In other words, Samsung Tab 3 Lite is a good present for any student.  With it, you can not worry about the fact that the child will play various games for days on end.  And there are not so many opportunities for entertainment.  But this is usually enough for users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy tab 3 lite 7 0 8gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979738.jpg"></div>
