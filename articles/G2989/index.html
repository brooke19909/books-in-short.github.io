    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This paragraph of guests of Magic Life Imperial Resort 5 * (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh) did not disappoint.  On the contrary, according to vacationers, the food at the hotel is organized at a very decent level.  So, guests can eat both in the main restaurant, functioning in the buffet format, and in establishments working on the ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù system. </p><p>  As for the main restaurant, here guests are waiting for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The menu includes a lot of varied, every day alternating dishes.  According to tourists, you can always choose something to your taste.  So, visitors to the restaurant can enjoy a variety of dishes of fish, seafood, meat, chicken, turkey, salads, snacks, fresh fruits and vegetables, delicious pastries and desserts.  There is a separate menu for children and diet menus. </p><p>  Also, most guests of Magic Life Imperial Resort did not miss the opportunity to visit the restaurants a la carte.  It offers Italian, Asian and Egyptian cuisine.  Meals can be ordered on the menu.  According to our compatriots, they especially liked the restaurants of Egyptian and Italian cuisine.  By the way, a table in them should be booked in advance.  This can be done by contacting the administrator at the reception. </p><p>  In addition, hotel guests during the day, if desired, can eat fast food in the snack bars.  They are located near the pool and on the beach. </p><h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  This item also did not disappoint guests of Magic Life Imperial, judging by their reviews.  So, on the territory of the hotel there are several bars offering a wide selection of drinks for every taste. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, beach vacations in this hotel complex have their own characteristics.  So, no doubt, a big plus is the fact that the hotel is located on the very shore of the Red Sea.  Therefore, guests can reach their own beach in a leisurely step in just a couple of minutes.  The beach here is quite large, clean, sandy, with a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.  A bar serving drinks and snacks is nearby.  However, not all tourists liked the entry into the water.  According to them, as in many other Egyptian hotels, you can enter the sea here either directly from the coast or from the pier.  But in the first case, you have to go long enough in shallow water.  At the bottom there are dead corals, which somewhat interferes with movement.  By the way, for the same reason, it is advisable to use special shoes so as not to injure your legs.  The pier, on the other hand, seemed to be too long for some travelers.  But you can descend from it by a convenient staircase, immediately falling to a depth near a coral reef.  A big plus is the fact that a lifeguard is always on duty at the pontoon. </p><p>  Experienced tourists warn that in the morning you are unlikely to swim near the reef, because at this time a strong wind blows and rescuers hang a red flag, which means that swimming is prohibited.  As a rule, the sea becomes calm between two in the afternoon and six in the evening. </p>
