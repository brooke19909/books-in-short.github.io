Sights of Sakhalin are very diverse and interesting, and therefore worth it to be seen.  The main one is the magnificent nature, against which a person seems to be just a small cog in the grand picture of the universe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sakhalin sights" class="if" height="150" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/853167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  There is an island in the ocean ... </h2><p>  Before describing the sights of Sakhalin, we pay a little attention to the island itself.  It is located in the Far East and is the largest in our country.  Its shores are washed by the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan and Okhotsk, the <span>Straits of Nevelskoy,</span> Laperuza and Tatar. </p><p>  From the moment Sakhalin became part of the Russian Empire, it became a place of exile and hard labor.  The Soviet Union continued the same tradition.  But not only the dark past attracts tourists.  The fantastic nature of Sakhalin is what it is worth to come here for!  Healing mineral springs, ski resorts and numerous museums with unique exhibits will reward a traveler who has overcome a difficult road. </p><h2>  Rest on Sakhalin </h2><p>  Natural wonders are the main attractions of Sakhalin.  First of all, I would like to mention Mount Wajda and its cave.  The peak itself is not high - only 900 meters above sea level, but in its bowels one can see real miracles, including stalactites and stalagmites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of sakhalin" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/853168.jpg" width="499"></div>

For example, under the capital there is a spring Sinegorsk with a rare view of natural mineral waters.  They are suitable for the treatment of radiation sickness, disorders of cellular metabolism, diseases of the blood-forming organs. </p><p>  Dagin thermal springs are indicated for people suffering from diseases of the musculoskeletal system and skin ailments.  These objects are also a natural monument.  Just imagine: against the backdrop of an amazing landscape, a picturesque pond is floating, in which swans swim. </p><p>  Skin diseases are successfully treated in balneological health resorts located on the banks of the Tatar Strait. </p><p>  On the outskirts of the island capital is the mountain ski resort "Mountain Air".  It has in its territory ten kilometers of modern, well-equipped tracks of different difficulty levels, a snow park, a gutter for fans of tubing.  The resort also has a gondola and chairlift and a ski lift. </p><h2>  The island capital and its museums </h2><p>  Many sights of Sakhalin are located near the island capital.  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is the main <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof the region, the</span> only one in Russia that is completely based on the islands (there are 59 of them).  There is a city on the banks of the Susuya River in the Susunai Valley, at the foot of the Russian Mountain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums of sakhalin" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/853178.jpg" width="600"></div>

Today it is a unique modern city in which life is in full swing.  The most famous museums of Sakhalin can be found here.  This is a museum of local lore that tells the visitor the history of the settlement of the island, tells about the indigenous people, about the flora and fauna, about the war with Japan.  The building was erected in the style of teikan and has a flat roof of tiles, lanterns, windows in the ceiling, kazari. </p><p>  Sakhalin Regional Art Museum is located in the city center.  There are many rich diverse expositions, and besides this, you can visit concerts, music and poetry evenings within the walls of the institution.  Of particular interest are the museum of railway equipment and the city literary and art museum of the book of A.P. Chekhov. </p><p>  There are emerald parks in the city, a memorial complex to fallen soldiers with eternal flame.  The city culture and recreation park is a favorite vacation spot for the inhabitants of the capital.  It has a lake, lush flower beds, green lawns, benches, a children's railway, a tennis court and the Cosmos stadium.  In 1995, in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the Resurrection Cathedral was built. </p><h2>  Some more useful information </h2><p>  Natural monuments of Sakhalin will not leave indifferent any of the travelers.  What are the rocky arches of Cape Velikan on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOkhotsk, the inaccessible Cape Aniva with the eponymous abandoned lighthouse, Mount Spamberg with unique mountain lakes on a plateau (eighteen pieces), Three Brothers rocks, Devil's Bridge.  The nature of Sakhalin is so beautiful that the inhabitants of these places made legends that could explain its incredible beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monuments of sakhalin" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/853169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the island either by air or by sea - there is no land connection with the mainland on Sakhalin.  The airport of the capital accepts domestic and international flights.  Small air stations are available in the cities of Nogliki, Okha, Shakhtyorsk and the village of Zonalnoe.  If the traveler decides to get here by water, then he should head to the Vanino - Kholmsk ferry, which operates every day for a year.  And in the village of Vanino, located on the mainland, can be reached by train. </p><p>  Go to the fabulous island of Sakhalin - and you will fall in love with it once and for all! </p>
