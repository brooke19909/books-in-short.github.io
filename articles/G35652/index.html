    <h2>  Shirvani Basayev: biography </h2><p>  Born in the Vedeno district in the early sixties.  Data on the exact date of birth is very contradictory.  In general, most of Shirvani‚Äôs biography is obscured.  He graduated from high school and worked in the Vedeno district.  Father and mother came from various <span>Chechen teips.</span>  Adhered to Islamic traditions and were supporters of primordial nationalism.  In addition to the Shirvani, the Basayevs had two more children - Zinaida and Islam. </p><p>  Presumably, in the eighties, Shirvani moved with his brother to Moscow.  There they are engaged in various part-time jobs.  In particular, they worked in the field of business.  In the nineties, the first participation in the political life of the country.  The Soviet state ceased to exist, separatist sentiments began to rise in Chechnya.  The future president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was popular with such radicals.  He promised "as much independence as you can take."  That is why during the attempt of the State Emergency Committee to save the country, the Basaevs came out in support of the new government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation for war </h2><p>  Shirvani Basayev is returning to Chechnya, where a new government is already beginning to form at that time.  The first armed detachments were created back in the ninety-first year.  They were trained by former officers of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Chechens by origin.  The Basaevs immediately joined these formations and took an active part.  In an interview, Shamil claims that he and his brother studied military affairs from Russian textbooks. </p><h2>  First war </h2><p>  But they got their first combat experience in <span>Nagorno-Karabakh.</span>  By the ninety-first year, relations between Azerbaijanis and Armenians reached the peak of their instability.  Ethnically populated by Armenians, Karabakh declared its independence.  In response, the Azerbaijani authorities unleashed a war.  In view of the fierce resistance of the Karabakh population, the government appealed for support to Islamic organizations.  Chechen fighters arrived in Azerbaijan under the leadership of Basayev. </p><p>  Shirvani Basayev also became known for his participation in the Abkhaz war.  In this conflict, the Chechens fought against the Georgian army.  Shamil Salmanovich Basayev was presented to several Abkhaz awards.  According to various sources, at this moment he was supervised by the General Intelligence Directorate of Russia.  Many Chechen fighters said that Shamil was trained in Russia before being sent to Ossetia. </p><h2>  First Chechen </h2><p>  When, after several years of de facto independence of Chechnya, the leadership of the Russian Federation announced the start of a counter-terrorist operation, the Basayev family actively joined the war.  Shirvani Basayev received a post in the so-called "army of the Chechen Republic."  He became the commandant of the village of Bamut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shamil Salmanovich Basayev" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1516558.jpg" width="415"></div>  It is located in the Achkhoy-Martan district.  In advance, the militants began to prepare the defense of the village.  All surrounding mountains have been carefully studied.  Ambush squads settled in the forests.  All approaches to Bamut were carefully mined.  The defense line also included concrete blocks that reliably protected the militants from shelling.  The battle of Bamut was widely covered in the media.  The federal forces stormed the settlement several times in the ninety-fifth, but were never able to take possession of it.  The Chechens quickly moved and ambushed the advancing columns. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shirvani Basayev Biography" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1516560.jpg" width="600"></div>  As a result, the village still managed to take, but only by the spring of next year and after seventeen attacks.  Shamil Basayev‚Äôs brother distinguished himself in these battles as a skilled commander.

After negotiations, the city came under the jurisdiction of Russia.  The siege of Grozny began.

    <p>  At this time, Chechen fighters actively strengthened the areas of the city.  Many areas have been mined.  Ambushes were being prepared.  An active production of grenade launchers and anti-aircraft installations was established.  Which, however, had low productivity due to inept manufacturing.  Also used tools such as grenades on small parachutes. </p><p>  Federal troops regularly bombarded militants with artillery and aircraft.  By February, the city was taken. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shamil Basayev‚Äôs brother" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1516562.jpg" width="600"></div>  The leader of the militants Shamil Salmanovich Basayev fled from Grozny with his brother.
