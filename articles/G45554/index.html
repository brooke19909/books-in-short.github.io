  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov: biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov - one of the most famous Russian revolutionaries of the XIX century.  He was an active member of the terrorist organization "Narodnaya Volya".  He became one of the two direct executors of the assassination attempt on Alexander II, which ended in the death of the emperor.  So he went down in history.  In this article we will tell his biography, details of the attempt and the investigation. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="justpaste.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rysakov Nikolay Ivanovich photo" class="if uuid-3110609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3110609.jpg"></div><p>  Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov was born in the Novgorod province in 1861.  He was born in Arbozersky volost.  His father was from the middle class, the manager of the sawmill, his name was Ivan Sergeevich.  Rysakov received education corresponding to the situation. </p><p>  The hero of our article first studied at Vytegorsk district school, and then at a real school in Cherepovets.  It was there that the teacher, who was a nihilist by his convictions, was of decisive importance. </p><p>  In the biography of Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov, everything turned out successfully, since he studied perfectly, was a devout young man.  In 1878 he arrived in St. Petersburg, where he entered the Mining University.  Being influenced by the people of the people, he dropped out of school. </p><h2>  Membership in People‚Äôs Will </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.agitclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rysakov Nikolay Ivanovich story" class="if uuid-3110610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3110610.jpg"></div><p>  Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov became a member of the terrorist organization Narodnaya Volya in the second year of his stay in St. Petersburg.  The decisive influence on him was made by the head of the executive committee Andrei Zhelyabov, who at that time was 28 years old. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rysakov was so carried away by hatred of the autocracy that he offered his services to participate in a terrorist act directed against the emperor. </p><h2>  Attempt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.7dnevno.hr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="investigation and trial death n trotters" class="if uuid-3110604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3110604.jpg"></div><p>  The attempt on Alexander II was scheduled for March 1, 1881.  19-year-old Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov dropped a bomb on the king‚Äôs carriage.  Several passersby died, among whom was a 14-year-old teenager, but the emperor himself was not injured. </p><p>  Hiding from the scene, the terrorist slipped on the sidewalk and fell.  He was detained by a nearby bridge watchman, peasant Mikhail Nazarov. </p><p>  The emperor, who got out of the carriage, went to the arrested man and asked for his name and title.  Rysakov called himself a tradesman Glazov, presented a passport, according to which he lived in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  If you believe the testimony of Lieutenant Rudykovsky, who was at the scene, he asked what happened to the sovereign.  In response, Alexander II noted that, thank God, he survived, but many people were injured, and pointed to those killed and injured in the bombing.  Hearing these words of the emperor, the terrorist allegedly doubted: "Is there still glory to God?"  It is interesting that, apart from Rudykovsky, this story about Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov was not confirmed by anyone else. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Murder </h2><p>  Alexander II was in no hurry to leave the scene of the crime, but went to look at the Catherine‚Äôs canal.  At this moment, the second Naro-Volunteer Ignatius Grinevitsky, who was on the embankment, threw a second bomb under the emperor‚Äôs feet.  This explosion was fatal.  On the same day both Grinevitsky and Alexander died. </p><p>  The body of the terrorist was not identified for a long time, and the details of the attempt were hidden.  Because of this, many began to consider Rysakov as the direct killer of the tsar.  In the prison where he was transferred, he was warmly welcomed, including the arrested on the eve of Zhelyabov.  Rysakov was confronted with him.  One of the leaders of the People‚Äôs Volunteers persistently called him a "young hero", and asked to judge them together. </p><p>  In Paris, anarchists staged a demonstration carrying a portrait of Nikolai Ivanovich Rysakov in their hands.  Photos of the terrorist today are known to most historians. </p><h2>  Consequence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.akg-images.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rysakov Nikolay Ivanovich biography" class="if uuid-3110606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3110606.jpg"></div><p>  According to the laws of the Russian Empire, the hero of our article was a minor.  Realizing that he faces the death penalty, he began to try to avoid it in any way. </p><p>  To this end, immediately after the arrest, he gave detailed and comprehensive testimony, having issued all the members of the secret organization that were known to him.  Thanks to the information received, the police rushed into a safe house on Telezhnaya Street, in which lived Gesya Gelfman and Nikolai Sablin, who shot himself during arrest.  On March 3, Timofei Mikhailov, a Volunteer, was arrested. </p><p>  It is known that during the investigation and the trial of death N. Rysakov was never able to avoid.  The arrestor testified against Sophia Perovskaya, Ivan Emelyanov, Vera Figner.  He told the investigation everything that he knew about the Narodnaya Volya organization. </p><h2>  Execution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.executedtoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rysakov Nikolay Ivanovich" class="if uuid-3110603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3110603.jpg"></div><p>  Rysakov could really count on pardon as a minor.  Moreover, he was not subject to long periods of hard labor.  But, according to the provision, automatic pardon for minors was not provided.  Those who deserved capital punishment were executed, not paying attention to age. </p><p>  Significant in the matter was the influence of adult members of a terrorist organization and the sincere repentance of Rysakov.  Despite this, he was nevertheless sentenced to death, even though his lawyer Alexei Mikhailovich Unkovsky protested.  The lawyer's request for clemency was deemed not worthy of attention. </p><p>  The sentence was surprising for many, as extenuating circumstances were obvious.  However, the court refused to take them into account, assessing the social significance of the crime committed.  Emperor Alexander III confirmed the death sentence for all accused. </p><p>  Rysakov was hanged on April 3 at the Semenovsky parade ground.  At that time he was not yet 20 years old.  Vesta executed with him Timofei Mikhailov, Nikolai Kibalchich, Andrey Zhelyabov and Sofya Perovskaya.  All four considered Rysakov a traitor, so they refused to say goodbye to him on the scaffold before his death. </p><p>  Some of the remaining free-will people later claimed that Rysakov, although he testified against his comrades, still deserved leniency. </p>
