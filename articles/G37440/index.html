  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven hills of Moscow: a legend or a past?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of Russia is spread out on the territory with an uneven terrain.  The hills of Moscow, on which it relies, are now significantly more than seven.  No one can say with certainty how many there were in the 16th century;  and if it‚Äôs still seven, then which ones should be considered the main ones.  But a beautiful legend exists, local historians try to study it, poets mention it in poems, it decorates stories about our city. </p><h2>  Why seven? </h2><p>  The unification of the fragmented lands by the Moscow prince ended with the formation of the Russian state.  In the XV-XVI centuries, Moscow became the capital in need of strengthening power, veneration and submission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krylatsky hills" class="if uuid-3142202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3142202.jpg"></div><p>  The legend of the seven <span>hills of Moscow</span> arose by analogy with the hills of Rome, the recognized capital of the world.  When people got used to such conversations a little, a new expression appeared: "Moscow is the third Rome."  Second Rome was called at that time Constantinople.  Moscow already claimed political weight in the international community. </p><p>  Finally, in 1523, <span>Elder Filofei</span> said the long-awaited phrase, which immediately became the slogan of the city, reflecting all his obvious and secret desires: "Two Rome fell, the third stands, and the fourth does not happen." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moscovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin's mountains" class="if uuid-3142211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3142211.jpg"></div><p>  Rome really was built on seven hills.  And how many hills were in our city during its construction?  By and large, it does not matter.  The magic number seven sounded and sunk into Russian hearts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scientific and unscientific research </h2><p>  Many local historians conducted research, trying to determine: if the 7 hills of Moscow are a reality, then which of the existing ones can lay claim to those with which it all began.  In the XVIII century, M. Lomonosov occupied this issue; he compiled his list, which included the hills located within the Garden Ring.  In the 19th century, the historians M. Pogodin, the local historian I. Snegirev, the orientalist Yu. Senkovsky were engaged in counting the hills.  Each had their own list, which coincided with other options only partially. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moscovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lefortovo Park" class="if uuid-3142249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3142249.jpg"></div><p>  G. Walheim, a professor at Moscow University, refers in his notes to a document found indicating "Makovets" of seven hills.  The first landmark is the bell tower of Ivan the Great. </p><h2>  Places of worship </h2><p>  There are studies that led the authors to the conclusion that the hills are not called elevation of the terrain, but sacred places of the Gentiles, places of old temples.  There are seven of them according to the number of pagan gods. </p><h2>  Moscow hills </h2><p>  The fact that the relief of the territory of Moscow is uneven is known to both Muscovites and guests of the capital.  Moving on the streets of the capital on foot, you constantly have to climb a hill, then go down to the lowland.  The names of Moscow streets say the same: Sivtsev Vrazhek, Vorobyovy Gory, Krasnokholmskaya embankment, Krylatsky hills.  Moscow, expanding and growing every year, captures more and more new slides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="russianlandmarks.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Pushkin" class="if uuid-3142234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3142234.jpg"></div><p>  But still there is a list of hills, the composition of which is more or less according to many researchers of the legend.  They say that it is mentioned in documents of the 16th century: Borovitsky, Pskov Hill, Tagansky Hill, Kulishki, Red Hill of Moscow, Staro-Vagankovsky and Chertolsky. </p><h2>  Possible list of hills </h2><p>  In the list of the XIX century, the number of hills mentioned increased, and in the 1980 encyclopedia.  - the next option.  Let's try to make another list: </p><ol><li>  <span>Borovitsky hill.</span>  Always repeating in all prospecting lists, Borovitsky or Kremlin hill has a height of 140-145 meters.  The Kremlin, Red Square and part of Kitai Gorod are spread on its territory.  Judging by the name, the forests in these places were dense.  The first settlement appeared here in the XI century by order of Yuri Dolgoruky.  On the modern Cathedral Square was the first Moscow Kremlin. </li><li>  Tver hill.  On this hill of Moscow rises Tverskaya street.  At the top there used to be a monastery, which was demolished during the Soviet era.  The monument to Pushkin was erected at the monastery cemetery. </li><li>  Sretensky hill.  At the foot of the hill Neglinnaya once flowed, so all the lanes today are sliding down to the hidden river. </li><li>  Tagansky hill.  One slope of the mountain is Lyshchikov Lane, and the second is Sewing or Sewing Hill.  That is, a place not suitable for farming. </li><li>  Lefortovo hill.  It is located outside the Garden Ring.  Now there is the territory of the Vedeno (German) cemetery.  Here lie the Germans beloved by Peter I: Patrick Gordon, F. Walheim, Dr. Haas.  Russian people are also buried here, but who had at least some kindred relationship with foreigners: artist V. Vasnetsov, actress A. Tarasova. </li><li>  Trekhgorny hill.  This hill has always brought a lot of confusion in the calculations of researchers of all time.  Someone considers it to be one hill, someone thinks that there should be three of them.  At the foot of the hill, the Moscow River flows, as well as Presnya and the nameless rivulet.  Once there was a distant outskirts of the city.  The three-mountain factory was considered a suburban enterprise.  Today it is the center of the city, and the factory lives on. </li><li>  Sparrow Hills.  The farthest point from the Kremlin among the listed hills of Moscow.  It starts from the Neskuchny Garden and stretches along the Moskva River almost to the ring railway bridge.  Wooden houses were stretching along the top of the mountains not so long ago, today there are well-groomed territories of parks, squares, alleys.  The building of Moscow State University, erected on the highest point of the mountain in 1953, is an adornment of the city and the Sparrow Hills. </li></ol>
