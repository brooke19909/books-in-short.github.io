The hotel is really comfortable, equipped with modern technology, and the staff is very friendly.  Unfortunately, employees are not familiar with the Russian language, but they understand English.  All problems are resolved quickly, and there are no reasons for conflicts.  By the way, Russian tourists rarely stop at this hotel. </p><p>  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, as stated in the description.  Household appliances are modern and work like clockwork.  There is hot water around the clock, and towels do change every day.  Guests also note local restaurants where they are fed with tasty, freshly prepared food. </p><p>  Of course, the proximity of the beach is a definite plus - the coast is really clean, as is the sea.  Tourists recommend the hotel complex Resort Intime Sunshine Sanya 5 *.  China, Dadonghai is a great place for a beach and sightseeing vacation. </p>
