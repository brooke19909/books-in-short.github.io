Tourists from all over the world come here every year to see the most picturesque places, feel the special atmosphere, enjoy the beautiful natural views, and also look at the man-made sights of the Altai Mountains. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.justgorussia.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Altai Mountains" class="if uuid-2330699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330699.jpg"></div><p>  Today there are not many places on the planet that can be compared with the Republic of Altai Mountains.  This territory of Russia is located in the central part of Asia.  It is interesting that the republic borders on several countries at once, including China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. </p><p>  There have been many important events in the history of Altai; we only briefly mention the most significant of them. </p><p>  Firstly, it is worth noting that in the Russian Federation there are two Altai at once: a republic, as well as a region.  Previously, they were one territory, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a result of transformations, they were disintegrated and at the moment are completely different administrative units. </p><p>  In addition, the following fact should be noted: Altai is translated from the Turkic language as <span>"golden mountains".</span>  This is what attracts so many tourists from all over the planet.  After all, here are the highest peaks in the Siberian open spaces.  By the way, the highest point is Mount Belukha.  We will describe it in detail below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first settlements on this territory arose many centuries ago.  Here the culture of nomads was born, and also the Turkic language appeared.  Once in the Altai mountains lived the tribes of the Huns and Dzungars.  Photos of the Altai Mountains attractions with a description will be presented later in the article. </p><h2>  Akkem Lake </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vtourisme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Akkem lakes" class="if uuid-2330720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330720.jpg"></div><p>  This is perhaps one of the most visited places in the Altai Mountains.  <span>Akkem Lake</span> is located near Belukha Mountain in the Ust-Koksinsky District. </p><p>  The mountain is majestically reflected in this pond.  By the way, once there were glaciers that constantly shifted and pulled ridges of huge boulders. </p><p>  Almost all year round, the water has a turbid-whitish hue due to the specificity of the rocks.  As for the dark time of the day, the lake at this time acquire a bluish tint.  By the way, due to the fact that in this reservoir a very high level of concentration of microscopic particles, fish and other living organisms cannot exist in it. </p><h2>  Akkem wall </h2><p>  It is located next to the lake of the same name.  At the end of the 20th century, a large accumulation of perennial ice, called the Akkem wall, was discovered in Altai, it stretches for almost six kilometers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These glaciers among climbers are considered a very attractive attraction of the Altai Mountains.  Many people like to climb the Akkem wall. </p><h2>  Altai "Stonehenge" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nat-geo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai Stonehenge" class="if uuid-2334829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2334829.jpg"></div><p>  As can be seen in the photo, this monument is really very similar to the original English version.  Thanks to its name, this place is very attractive for tourists.  Altai "Stonehenge" stands out from the rest of the monuments, since there are stones that were brought from various places. </p><p>  In addition, next to this attraction there are many interesting archaeological sites of the Paleolithic era, as well as the Bronze and Iron Ages. </p><p>  Many still cannot understand why this ancient landmark of the Altai Mountains is located in this place.  There is a scientific version that says that earlier shamans held various ceremonies here, and these stones were related to this. </p><h2>  Blue Lakes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="raft-premier.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Lakes" class="if uuid-2330731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330731.jpg"></div><p>  In this photo, the attraction of the Altai Mountains, bearing the name "Blue Lakes".  They are water bodies formed many, many years ago. </p><p>  Lakes are called blue because they have a very peculiar hue.  On sunny days, these ponds strike a bright azure color.  Interestingly, the lakes are not permanent, they are formed seasonally in the bed <span>of the Katun River</span> during its floods, and then disappear. </p><p>  Cognitive fact: this attraction of the Altai Mountains does not freeze at all in winter, since the water temperature in the lakes does not drop below nine degrees Celsius.  Water does not freeze for just one simple reason: the springs at the bottom are amazingly powerful.  Many may think that they are hot, but this is not so.  However, their strength is so great that even the most severe frosts can not <span>freeze water</span> in the Blue Lakes. </p><h2>  How to get to the ponds </h2><p>  Getting to the Blue Lakes is quite simple if you carefully follow the recommendations of travelers who have visited those places. </p><p>  There are several ways to get to water bodies.  Firstly, you can, of course, use the bus, and secondly, personal vehicles. </p><p>  It is necessary to start your journey from the city of Biysk, since it is through it that all the roads to the Blue Lakes pass.  And the route itself is as follows: Biysk - Srostki - Maima - Manzherok - Ust-Sema - Blue Lakes. </p><h2>  The majestic Belukha Mountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travel-crazy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Belukha" class="if uuid-2330742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330742.jpg"></div><p>  This is the highest triceps point located in the Altai Republic, in the heart of the Eurasian continent.  Many tourists and climbers dream of conquering its peak. </p><p>  Mount Belukha is located on the border of two states: Russia and Kazakhstan. </p><p>  It got its name not by accident.  Since the top of the ridge is constantly covered with snow, local residents almost always see it like that.  Thus, the name of Belukha Mountain comes from the word "white". </p><p>  The earliest written records of this natural landmark of the region date back to the end of the 18th century.  However, scientific research of this territory began only in the 19th century. </p><p>  In 1904, Samuel Ternet tried to conquer Mount Beluhu, unfortunately, he did not succeed.  But the Tronov brothers in 1914 managed to climb to its top. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the climate in the Belukha mountain region is quite severe, and winters are very cold and long, but summers are always short and very rainy.  January air temperature can reach below forty degrees. </p><p>  If you decide to conquer the peak, it is best to do this in late July or early August. </p><h2>  Attractions Aktash </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vince-crane.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aktash settlement" class="if uuid-2330747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330747.jpg"></div><p>  Many begin their journey through the Altai Mountains from this amazing place.  Aktash is located on the border with Mongolia.  This place is considered a transit point for those who want to see the <span>Pazyryk mounds</span> on the Ulagan plateau. </p><p>  The village of Aktash is quite young, since it arose only in the middle of the 20th century.  Now about three thousand people live in this place.  In addition, people here are very different, they all belong to 25 nationalities. </p><p>  At one time, Aktash was considered a very popular mercury mining site.  Since the village is very young, the very first inhabitants still live in it.  They worked all their life here in adits. </p><p>  With regard to mercury mining, the mine was closed in the mid-90s.  It was then that people completely lost their permanent jobs. </p><p>  Among the main attractions of Aktash in the Altai Mountains, a monument to the participants of the Great Patriotic War can be distinguished.  The names of participants born in this territory are written on this memorial. </p><p>  In addition, there are two museums.  And one of them was created by border guards.  But to visit it, you need to agree in advance.  Even in Aktash there is a temple of the Holy Martyr Eugene Melitinsky. </p><p>  As for the second museum, it was organized by local residents.  Basically, his exposition presents exhibits made by Sergey Tanyshevich, who is professionally engaged in woodcarving. </p><p>  It should also be mentioned that in the village there is Lake Cheybekkel (Dead Lake).  The reservoir is fed by precipitation, as well as groundwater and meltwater.  Due to the fact that the lake is located at a sufficiently high altitude, ice remains on it until the beginning of summer.  The pond is called dead because there are absolutely no fish and vegetation. </p><h2>  What else to visit? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Aktash from above" class="if uuid-2330753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2330753.jpg"></div><p>  Answering the questions: ‚ÄúWhere to go in the Altai Mountains? Attractions, which is better to see there?‚Äù, Experienced travelers are advised to visit Mount Belukha.  However, there are many other wonderful places in the republic.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Rock <span>Devil's finger</span> near Lake Aya; </li><li>  the Church of St. John the Evangelist on the island of Patmos, near the village of Chemal; </li><li>  Chechkysh, a waterfall located near the village of Yelanda; </li><li>  <span>Seminsky Pass,</span> located at an altitude of about 2 km; </li><li>  natural boundary Kalbak-Tash, where the oldest rock paintings were preserved in Altai. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.79362980000001" data-lng="82.67585959999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="6"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/3/5/1535.png"></div><p>  So, where to go in the Altai Mountains, whose photos of attractions are presented in the article?
