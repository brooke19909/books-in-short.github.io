This is one of the most successful models of the Finnish manufacturer, although the platform was used new.  Earlier, devices such as 6610 and 7210 were based on it. However, unlike these models, the Nokia 6100 received an improved design and a more ergonomic design - of course, for its time. </p><h2>  Device Overview </h2>

    <p>  Against the background of its competitors, the model is one of the lightest.  The total weight with the battery was only 76 grams.  In many respects, design relief was achieved through the use of a new battery.  True, the update of the power system in relation to previous devices of the same platform did not happen in order to reduce weight, but to optimize the performance of the device.  It was presented by a BL-5B cell, the capacity of which is 720 mAh, a lithium-ion battery.  Nokia 6100, as the manufacturer notes, preserves the energy potential of the battery, which is enough for a 6-hour conversation or for 150 hours in standby mode.  But not only the power supply surprised this device.  The developers used a new matrix for the screen.  Of course, it can be called new conditionally.  Nevertheless, for 2003, when the model came out, the monochrome displays changed gradually, and Nokia was one of the first companies to implement a color screen in a relatively inexpensive device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction and design </h2>

    <p>  As already noted, the phone favorably differed in its small size.  Compared to its predecessors, it received a slim and generally compact body.  Not without reason, during the release of this line, the developers managed to earn the status of leaders in terms of the implementation of ergonomic designs.  We can say that the formation of the elegance style, combined with practicality, was just launched by the Nokia 6100 phone, as well as its subsequent modifications.  According to users, the model organically lies in the hand, without causing discomfort during the manipulation of controls.  As for the color scheme, there is not much choice, but there is still a certain variety.  In particular, the case was made in dark blue, blue and beige colors.  It is noteworthy that the manufacturer provided the ability to change color panels, so the main range can also be varied in green, burgundy, black and other shades. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In working qualities, the model did not show anything revolutionary, but in the aggregate its communication capabilities and functionality provided good performance.  The internal filling is supported by a good color screen, which the Nokia 6100 received.  The characteristics of the main parameters of the device are presented below: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The number of screen colors is 4096. </li><li>  Display Resolution - 128 x 128. </li><li>  Battery capacity - 720 mAh. </li><li>  Mass - 76 g. </li><li>  Dimensions - 102 mm in height, 44 mm in width and 13.5 mm in thickness. </li><li>  The number of names to save is 300. </li><li>  The memory for SMS messages is 150. </li></ul><p>  As for communication capabilities, the device received an infrared port, as well as WAP and GPRS data transfer modules. </p><h2>  Controls </h2>

    <p>  Basic operations are carried out using buttons located directly below the screen.  This unit is made worthy in terms of ease of use of the menu, but the keyboard as a whole has several disadvantages.  For example, the bottom row and side buttons are too deeply recessed with respect to the center keys.  This unevenness makes typing difficult.  Conversely, the central row of the Nokia 6100 phone keypad is not properly covered by the backlight.  On the left side you can find the volume control.  In this case, we can note the successful execution of the button, which protrudes from the case to the optimum value, which eliminates accidental pressing. </p><h2>  Applications and multimedia </h2><p>  Initially, the model has three Java applications, including an improved converter.  Games are represented by Puzzle Chess chess, however, there is no question of full-fledged games, since the user is only asked to perform typical tasks.  Actually, fans of ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù did not have to rely on the acceptable quality of regular games.  The main thing is the potential ability to download applications, and in this case it is present.  The sound in the Nokia 6100 phone as a whole remained the same, the same as in previous versions of the family.  The phone has both polyphonic and standard ringtones.  Again, if necessary, they can be replaced. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2>

    <p>  The main functions of the phone, this unit performs almost flawlessly.  The owners note that it provides a speakerphone, tangible vibration and stably catches a signal.  The same impressions are caused by the design, in which the main differences of this version from previous modifications are concentrated.  The battery for Nokia 6100, which is capable of providing up to 6 hours of uninterrupted conversation, has also earned high praise from users.  Other representatives of the line demonstrate similar performance indicators, but in this case, the battery favorably distinguished itself in size.  It was the flat form factor that made it possible to reduce the overall design of the phone, which affected both the visual appeal and the usability of the device. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  There are many shortcomings that are discovered by users during operation.  If the external execution of the case causes for the most part favorable responses, then the software and functionality are not so impressive.  Some fans of the brand were disappointed by the lack of a flashlight, which was provided for in previous versions.  There are also small gaps in ergonomics.  For example, many owners find it difficult to switch between text input formats in the Nokia 6100.  "How to remove an intelligent set of messages?"  - One of the most popular questions from novice users of this model.  To solve this problem, hold down the button responsible for the option to work with the dictionary.  There are also disadvantages of a different kind.  At the time of the model‚Äôs release, there was a surge in the popularity of the Bluetooth wireless data transmission module.  The usability of this technology could be appreciated by users of individual models from large manufacturers.  However, the Finnish developers did not equip the 6100 with a novelty.  The device is also deprived of voice dialing - a more familiar function for that time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Nevertheless, by average standards, there are few frank minuses in the device.  Especially if you approach the consideration of the phone in the aggregate of characteristics.  The model came out light, thin and ergonomic.  Comfort in management compensates for many minor flaws - in any case, you can get used to them.  In terms of hardware, no significant progress has occurred.  The Nokia 6100 got the same stuff, which led to a modest set of applications with multimedia capabilities.  Therefore, focus on this option should be for those who want to get a reliable tool for sending messages and making calls.  Do not forget that, thanks to this model as well, the manufacturer of Nokia has formed the image of the manufacturer of high-quality and stylish telephone structures. </p>
