    <h2>  General recommendations for tourists traveling to Egypt </h2><p>  ‚Ä¢ Choose vouchers with their filling not only according to the description, but also according to the reviews of tourists who have previously visited this resort and used the services of your chosen travel agency relatively recently.  This is necessary because reviews about the same hotel may be opposite.  For example, this may depend on the season and, accordingly, the occupancy level of the hotel, which affects the quality of staff work.  This should be considered before traveling to Egypt.  5 star hotels will certainly make your stay the most comfortable. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ As a rule, the most practical advice is given to tourists by the guides of the host country, so choosing a tour is a very responsible decision.  Your vacation will depend on this, and a competent guide will provide you with a huge amount of useful information, from accommodation at the hotel and choosing the tours you need, to good shopping and a good taxi phone number. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ Consider the climatic features of Egypt, and if you do not tolerate the heat, try to refrain from long excursions and prolonged sun exposure. </p>

    <p>  A fifteen minute walk from the resort is usually crowded El Mercato Street, where there are many bars, restaurants and branded shops.  The hotel is in demand among lovers of the underwater world. </p><p>  Advantages: on the beach of the hotel is one of the most beautiful reefs of the resort;  the beach is clean and large;  The resort has a fairly vast territory with flower beds, walking alleys and an unusual design of buildings, which cannot but please tourists.  The food in the hotel is very diverse and fully consistent with the level. </p><p>  Disadvantages: the hotel has a large number of descents and stairs, which complicate the movement of parents with strollers.  The pools at the hotel are not deep - approximately 140 cm. There is no cleared part of the beach without corals, so access to the sea is possible only from the pontoon.  Some tourists write negative reviews about the hotel because of clearly not repaired rooms.  Complaints about service are also being received.  And yet, tourists have long loved <span>Egypt hotels 5 stars</span> Sharm El Sheikh for impeccable service and comfort. </p><h2>  <span>Dessole Pyramisa Sharm El Sheikh</span> Resort 5 * </h2>

The hotel received excellent reviews for the reef, rich in exotic animals.  The food at the hotel is top notch.  There are Indian, Italian and Chinese √† la carte restaurants with good food.  This hotel is great for family vacations: there is animation for children, including contests, games, evening shows.

Many of the standard hotel rooms require renovation and renovation.
