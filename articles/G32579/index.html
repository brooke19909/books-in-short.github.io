Everything dangerous and inexplicable generates a powerful interest, therefore it enjoys constant popularity.  One of such places of pilgrimage for adventurers is Yakutia, Death Valley.  Coordinates - 64 ¬∞ 46‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ s.  w.  109 ¬∞ 28‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ in  d. </p><p>  This territory is known throughout the world for its so-called boilers.  The name perfectly characterizes it.  The mysterious area for many years explored by lovers of all kinds of anomalies and ufologists.  From ancient times there are many legends and rumors about her.  It is believed that local swamps and impassable thickets hide in their depths traces of ancient cataclysms and cauldrons, which are attributed to an alien origin. </p><h2>  The most famous researchers </h2><p>  The Death Valley in Yakutia has become a topic of publication in many encyclopedias dedicated to unusual places on the planet.  And the strange events that happen to people every now and then are constantly becoming a topic of controversy for scientists. </p><p>  This territory occupies land near the right bank of the river Vilyui.  In fact, there is not just one valley, but a whole group.  Her research began back in the mid-19th century R. Maak.  And in the 1930s, M.P. Koretsky visited here, who spoke about this place with a lot of interesting things in his letters. </p><p>  Death Valley (Yakutia) was the place of his visits three times.  Each time, a scientist visited this area, using the services of a Yakut conductor.  The original purpose of travel was to search for gold that can be washed out of the river.  But in the end, the researcher came across something more interesting.  According to him, in this territory there are many legendary boilers.  During his travels, he came across 7 such recesses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Death Valley boilers really exist! </h2><p>  They look very mysterious and mysterious.  Their diameter varies between 6-9 meters, and the metal with which the bottom and walls are covered cannot be determined.  The material is extremely durable and does not lend itself even to a very sharp chisel.  It can neither be broken off nor melted.  From above it is covered with a strange layer, the texture of which resembles <span>sandpaper.</span>  It is also impossible to deform anything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yakutia death valley" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This unusual find has been hidden for many centuries by the Death Valley in Yakutia.  According to local legends, boilers go deep underground, forming tunnels and rooms.  The scientist did not notice anything like this.  But his attention was attracted by another unusual feature: the flora around them mutated and acquired unnatural sizes.  In particular, the grass here is the height of a person and even more.  Everything is entangled with extremely long vines, and the leaves of burdocks have an unusually wide diameter. </p><p>  One of the boilers even became a place to sleep for travelers.  Nothing paranormal during this time happened to them, no one after that had any serious diseases or mutations.  Only one person after a few months completely bald, and at the very same M.P. Koretsky on the half of the head on which he slept, there appeared three small strange growths that did not pass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most durable metal </h2><p>  Yakutia (Death Valley) makes researchers around the world puzzle over guesses.  What is the origin of the material that covers the boilers?  To chop off even a small piece from them is practically unrealistic.  But you can pick up one of the stones scattered near the recess and in it.  Such a souvenir was taken away by M.P. Koretsky. </p><p>  Black perfectly round formation with a smooth, as if polished surface and a diameter of about 6 centimeters.  Later it turned out that this metal cuts glass no worse than any diamond, making beautiful, perfectly even holes in it.  Then this treasure was lost, and to this day no one knows where it is. </p><p>  And yet, what does Death Valley in Yakutia mean?  Koretsky was sure that supernatural cauldrons were the work of human hands.  He argued that their strength still has its limitations.  During one of the trips, a local resident guide told him that from a dozen years before he had found a pair of perfectly round iron humps that towered above the ground and reached him to the head.  They looked like new, but after a while it turned out that someone had split them, scattering parts in different directions. </p><p>  And when Yakutia, the Death Valley, became the site of subsequent visits by Koretsky, he himself noticed that the boilers were gradually falling underground.  Thus, a discrepancy arises: if formations decrease and collapse in a few years, then how could they survive to this day?  No one has yet been able to find an explanation for this anomaly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Look for answers in legends </h2><p>  In the early 70s of the last century A. Gutenev and V. Mikhailovsky recorded unusual testimonies of a local hunter.  According to him, in this area you can find a strange hole in which frozen people lie.  They are extremely thin, with one black eye and iron clothes.  The description is similar to aliens, but why were they attracted to Yakutia, Death Valley?  Facts, rumors do not give logical explanations, and the existence of these creatures is not confirmed. </p><p>  But scientists studied in detail local legends (primarily the main local epic "Olonkho") and with their help created their own version of what served as an impetus for the appearance of boilers.  They believe that the picture of what was happening was something like this. </p><p>  It began many years ago when this territory was inhabited by a small number of nomadic tungus.  One day, their distant neighbors noticed how Death Valley was covered in impenetrable darkness, and a terrible loud roar came from the surrounding area.  Then a powerful hurricane began, and the earth shook from crushing blows.  When all the sounds died down and it became light, people saw an incredible picture.  The earth around was scorched, and a tall structure shining in the sun appeared on it, which was visible from a great distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="death valley of yakutia" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735933.jpg" width="249"></div>

    <p>  For a very long time strange sounds came from him that cut the rumor.  And then it began to slowly decrease until it completely disappeared.  People who tried to get to this place and explore it were missing. </p><h2>  Mysterious building </h2><p>  After some time, Yakutia (Death Valley) was again covered with vegetation.  Thick thickets attracted animals, and nomad hunters came here for them.  They saw housing of amazing beauty.  It was a tall iron house with a roof dome.  He rested on many supports. </p><p>  Nobody succeeded in getting into it due to the lack of windows and doors.  Nearby, several more structures made of the same material rose from the ground.  A giant vertical funnel formed around the main building.  The legends say that it was divided into three peculiar tiers - ‚Äúlaughing abysses‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="death valley yakutia boilers" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735935.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  And in the depths of the crater a whole country lived, and it had its own "flawed" (apparently black) sun.  A strong <span>unpleasant odor</span> rose from the bottom to the surface <span>,</span> which drove away people who wished to settle nearby.  From time to time, a large rotating object appeared, shaped like an island, which then covered the main building with itself, landing on it like a lid. </p><h2>  Mysterious rooms </h2><p>  Over the centuries, the Death Valley (Yakutia) was covered with a thick layer of permafrost, which almost completely hid the iron structure.  People got the opportunity to climb the dome and found on it a spiral-shaped descent, going deep underground. </p><p>  He led into a huge gallery, consisting of a large number of rooms.  In them, even in the most severe frosts, it was extremely warm.  But any person who spent several days there was seriously ill and died after that.  If you believe this legend, Death Valley (Yakutia), whose boilers took more than one life, rightfully earned its name. </p><p>  After a certain time, the building finally drowned in ice, above the ground from it there was only a small fragment of the arch.  A peculiar cover was covered with moss.  At first glance, it was no different from ordinary hillocks, which are found everywhere on the surface of permafrost. </p><h2>  The second and third advent of the fireball </h2><p>  It would seem that this should end, but there is a continuation of this version.  The Death Valley in Yakutia again suddenly shuddered by a thin fiery tornado.  A ball of fire formed in its upper part.  He gradually began to approach the earth along a diagonal path.  Behind him was a blazing trail, and four thunders of thunder rang out throughout the district.  Then the sphere disappeared from <span>sight</span> and already somewhere beyond the horizon line exploded. </p><p>  Seeing what was happening, the nomads living nearby did not get scared and did not move to another place.  They rejoiced that the "demon" did not harm their homes and families, but destroyed the neighboring aggressive tribe, which was at enmity with them. </p><p>  Decades passed, and it repeated again.  Death Valley (Yakutia), the cauldrons of which did not stop alerting people, again shuddered at the shining fireball flying over it.  Like the previous time, it exploded on the territory of militant nomads.  Seeing that an <span>inexplicable phenomenon</span> plays the role of their protector, the nomads began to compose legends about him.  They called him Nyrgun Bootur ("Fire Daredevil"). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yakutia Death Valley facts" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735940.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  But then a terrible event happened that wildly scared even the inhabitants of the most remote suburbs.  A huge ball rose from the same crater with a great crash and exploded without flying away.  After this, an earthquake of incredible power occurred, because of which cracks appeared on the earth, extending deeper than more than a hundred meters.  Then a big fire started, during which a rotating object similar to an island flew over the ground.  Recall that the scene was Yakutia.  Death Valley (the facts confirm this) felt the effects of the earthquake, which spread more than a thousand kilometers around the epicenter. </p><h2>  People die, but the facts remain </h2><p>  Nomadic tribes who lived on the outskirts, moved away from this dangerous zone.  But this did not help them survive - they all died from an incomprehensible disease that was inherited.  But after them there were detailed stories about what happened, on the basis of which interesting and dramatic legends appeared over time.  Many stories have survived to this day about the strange structures that Yakutia (Death Valley) hides.  Facts, rumors - all this creates a mysterious and creepy history of the area. </p><p>  One hunter who roamed the taiga during a drought told the following.  He tried to break off a little ice from a large lens that the ground was covering from above.  But it turned out that under the ground there is actually a smooth surface of reddish metal.  In its form, it resembled a dome covered by permafrost.  The man got scared and in a hurry left a strange place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="death valley yakutia boilers photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735937.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  A similar incident occurred with another hunter.  He stumbled upon the extreme part of the dome.  The thickness of the metal was about 10 cm, the height of the structure was about half a meter, and the diameter was around 5-6 m. This eyewitness also did not dare to unearth his find. </p><h2>  Evidence continues to emerge </h2><p>  This does not end the <span>anomalous phenomena</span> that gave rise to the Death Valley (Yakutia).  Boilers, photos of which can even be taken from space, have brought far more than one strange event in the life of local residents and travelers.  So, not far from the Olguidakh River, a hemisphere stuck in the ground, covered with red metal, was discovered.  Its sharp edges could be easily cut, despite the fact that the wall thickness was about 2 cm. It lay perfectly flat.  According to eyewitnesses, it was possible to climb it without problems riding a deer. </p><p>  The object was found in the mid 30-ies of the twentieth century by a geologist, but after the war it was difficult to find even traces of this strange design.  After several decades, a group of scientists from Yakutsk went to study it, but the expedition did not give any results.  The old hunter, who accompanied the travelers, more than once saw the building in his youth.  But he failed to show the way to him due to the fact that much has changed in the surrounding area since then. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="death valley in yakutia" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/735939.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the 30s of the last century, the local merchant Savinov with his granddaughter Zina also stumbled while traveling on a strange red arch.  Behind her, they found a twisted passage leading to a large number of rooms, which the whole Death Valley (Yakutia) knows about.  The coordinates of these mystical havens are quite difficult to determine, but if in the winter travelers see such "hotels", they will certainly warm in them.  According to the merchant, in these rooms, even in the most severe frosts, it is invariably warm, as in summer. </p><p>  About the red rooms can be heard from other old-timers who visited these places in the aftermath of the war.  But only the most determined and courageous of them dared to go into them for the night, because such a rest invariably ended in a deadly disease. </p><p>  Another structure was discovered on <span>the Vilyui River</span> during the construction of a dam through it.  One of the workers later spoke about how, during the construction of a branch channel and the drainage of a new channel, a red bulge of metal was found at the bottom.  But the leadership did not delve into what Death Valley is in Yakutia and where strange objects come from.  In the first place was the implementation of the plan, therefore, after a surface examination, it was decided not to pay attention to the find and continue the construction of the hydroelectric power station. </p><h2>  A couple more eloquent stories </h2><p>  Ufologists met with a local hunter of advanced age.  He talked about how his ancestors roamed the area for hundreds of years and confirmed the fact of explosions.  According to him, at first a column of fire surrounded by vortices of dust rose sharply from the bowels of the earth, which reached the sky.  After that, all the dust gathered in one thick cloud, through which nothing was visible except a bright fiery sphere. </p><p>  At the same time there was a terrible hum and a whistle cutting ears.  Then followed a few strokes of thunder and a blinding eye flash.  She destroyed everything in her path, and then an explosion occurred.  Because of it, cracks formed even on the strongest rocks, and the trees collapsed, as if cut, in a territory spanning a hundred kilometers.  After that, total darkness came and it became so cold that any fires instantly died out, and frost appeared on the branches. </p>

    <p>  In 2000, an experienced geologist, local old-timer V.K. Trofimov, witnessed yet another strange phenomenon that frightened him almost to death.  He saw in the middle of the night something terrifying moving along the treetops.  Their trunks did not bend, but hoarfrost completely showered from them.  The creature that walked there was impossible to see.  But when it approached the man, it closed the sky, and at this terrible moment the stars seemed to go out.  The next morning, the geologist noticed a line cleared of snow, which stretched across the whole forest as far as he could see. </p><p>  Yakutia, Death Valley - what does this territory mean for people?  It is very creepy, the whole area is covered with swamps and dried trees.  Even animals do not like this zone; neither moose nor even birds live here.  A considerable number of people died in the Valley.  Since earlier the bodies of the dead were drowned in lakes, because of this their souls, according to legends, still wander around these lands.  People who have been here advise other travelers to be extremely careful and reasonable: do not touch anything, do not fish, do not pick mushrooms and berries and do not take any souvenirs with you.  In this case, you will have a chance to return from the Death Valley alive and unharmed. </p>
