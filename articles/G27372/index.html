What is required for income tax refund</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we are interested in the deadline for filing income tax return.  And not only him.  It is also important to know which documents are needed in a particular case.  Indeed, without a specific list, they will simply refuse to issue a deduction.  In principle, as practice shows, there are no particular difficulties with this process.  Just prepare for it.  And of course, meet the deadlines established by law.  This is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  The main thing is to keep in mind that there are generally accepted documents for all cases, but there is what is required for specific situations.  And just with the study of all this you and I have to do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deadline for filing income tax return" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217623.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Passport </h2><p>  The deadline for filing an income tax return is, of course, important.  But first you need to know what documents may be required in a particular case.  It‚Äôs not a secret to anyone that the absence of even one ‚Äúpaper‚Äù can lead to a refusal of the tax authorities to deduct. </p><p>  So, the first thing that is required from the taxpayer is an identity card.  In our case, this is a passport.  You can try to produce any other similar document (for example, a driver‚Äôs license), but most likely this option will not work.  You will be refused to accept documents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are a legal entity, you will have to present the details of your registration.  This is not something new when returning income tax.  These are the rules.  You will need copies of your documents.  Passports or details - this is not so important.  But do not forget to grab the original. </p><h2>  According to the statement </h2><p>  What's next?  Now, of course, do not forget that the income tax refund for medical services, training, and for other reasons, is mandatory only at the request of the taxpayer.  So, you have to write a statement of the established form to solve our today's problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax refund for medical services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217621.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Please note that the statement requires your bank details.  It is with their help that you will have to transfer funds for your own expenses for one reason or another.  The application does not cause any problems.  In this case, you only need the original of this document.  No copies, even if they are certified.  Otherwise, income tax cannot be refunded. </p><h2>  Reporting </h2><p>  The next important moment for us is the preparation of a tax return.  It is she who is needed to apply to the tax authorities to pay certain contributions, and to receive certain deductions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The declaration must be submitted to the tax in one copy, and in the original.  No copies, not even certified ones.  Such a document you simply will not accept.  How to fill out an income tax return declaration?  Everything is very simple. </p><p>  Special programs will come to the rescue, which form declarations for reporting.  A 3-NDFL form will be required.  It is necessary to enter data on expenses and income in it, and then click on the "Generate" button.  There is nothing difficult or special about this.  Just look at the fields in the program once to understand what and where to write.  In addition, here you can see the comments and signatures of the items you need.  Tips will certainly facilitate the process of filing a <span>tax return</span> form 3-NDFL for reporting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new when returning income tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217620.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  2-personal income tax </h2><p>  What else is required for all cases?  Here you have to take one more certificate.  It is called 2-PIT.  Or, as it may still be called, a document on the income of individuals.  More precisely, about wages. </p><p>  Where to get it?  At your employer.  If you independently carry out this or that activity, you will have to use a specialized program to generate a certificate.  The same one where you created 3-NDFL.  Most often, the employer must give you this form as soon as possible.  This is the most common option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In what form does this tax document take?  Refund of <span>income tax</span> is possible only when 2-PIT is the original.  And nothing more.  Copies are not accepted with all desire, even certified.  Such rules are established in Russia.  In principle, you can try to provide a certified copy, but it is unlikely that they will accept it from you. </p><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  But what is the deadline for filing an income tax return?  We sorted out the documents more or less.  Now that they are known (at least for the time being only the main ones), it is worth worrying about the possibility of meeting the deadline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax return" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217624.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, you have the right to issue a refund at any time.  But the period is limited.  The thing is that citizens have the right to make a tax deduction for the last 3 years.  According to modern rules, it will be necessary to meet the deadlines - in the tax reporting period.  In other words, until April 30th. </p><p>  The deadline for filing income tax return is now clear.  It is also important to note that your application with all documents will be considered for some time.  How many?  About a month or two.  After that you will receive a response with a refusal of deduction or with its approval.  In the first case, pay attention to the comment - most likely, there you will see the reason for the rejection of the request.  You can fix everything and try again happiness.  The deduction funds are returned to citizens approximately 2-3 months after submitting an application with a declaration to the tax authorities. </p><h2>  The medicine </h2><p>  Now a few special cases.  You can return money for various reasons.  For example, many are treated and want to receive a deduction.  It is possible.  <span>Refund of income</span> tax for medical services is a fairly common scenario that occurs in citizens in a particular case.  What may be required in addition to the documents already listed? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage income tax refund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217625.jpg"></div>

    <p>  First, decide what exactly you draw up the deduction for.  If for medications, a billing document and prescription for the drug are required.  Sometimes they also require a certificate from a doctor. </p><p>  Secondly, when it comes to treatment and some direct services, everything is much more complicated.  You need to take a copy of the license of the medical institution, as well as a contract with the organization for the provision of paid services.  Attach all settlement documents here - receipts and receipts of payment.  In principle, that‚Äôs all. </p><h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  Another scenario is the return of funds for voluntary health insurance.  The above list of binding documents in this case will be supplemented with just a few papers. </p><p>  Which ones?  You need a contract with an insurance company, its license, as well as all payment documents that you only have.  Of course, we are talking exclusively about those related to the insurance company. </p><h2>  Mortgage and apartments </h2><p>  Mortgage is now widespread in Russia.  Income tax refund in this case takes place.  True, you have to pretty prepare.  The list of required documents is supplemented quite seriously.  Although getting all the documents is not so difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fill out an income tax return declaration" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217626.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you just bought an apartment, then you need to attach a certificate of ownership, a contract of sale, checks and payments.  This also includes the acts of transfer and acceptance of real estate, an agreement on participation in shared construction (in some cases).  Some tax authorities require <span>extracts from the house book.</span>  It is illegal, but it is better to bring them right away.  You can take it in the housing office. </p><p>  When it comes to mortgages, you will have to supplement the already listed list with just a few documents.  You will need to attach a certificate of payment of interest on the mortgage, as well as an agreement with the bank (loan agreement).  Practice shows that there are no problems with this. </p><h2>  Senior citizens </h2><p>  <span>Refund of income tax to</span> pensioners also takes place.  True, it all depends on what exactly you deduct.  Gather a complete list of documents for a particular case, and then attach some special references. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax refund to pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1217622.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What kind?  Here you will need a <span>pension certificate</span> (copy), as well as all documents that confirm your benefits.  For example, disability certificates.  If you were a military man, then a military card is also useful.  It's all. </p>
