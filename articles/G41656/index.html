    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  You must understand that the task of choosing the best high-impact smartphone is very difficult and, probably, insoluble.  For a very simple reason - the creator of such a universal device will very quickly become a monopolist among all manufacturers, and most consumers will prefer to purchase only its products.  It is almost impossible under market conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-sink smartphone" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/612034.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, one device is maximally shockproof and well waterproof, the other, on the contrary, is as waterproof and shockproof as possible, and so on.  So decide what you need more, and decide which one to buy.
