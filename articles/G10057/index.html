According to statistics, the Internet audience is often interested in the question of how to control a computer from a phone.  And what, it‚Äôs convenient after all!  Agree that it is much more pleasant to lie on the couch and use the smartphone as a <span>remote control for the computer</span> than to constantly get up and go to the computer, rewind the film and perform other operations - and not only those that will concern watching movies and TV shows.  The situation is a little different with a laptop, but our task is not to find out if it needs a ‚Äúremote control‚Äù made from a smartphone.  Our goal is to find out how to control the phone from the phone, as well as how to do this operation with a personal computer. </p><h2>  What is needed for remote access? </h2>

    <p>  You can use the phone for this purpose with the help of special software, third-party programs.  It is not so difficult to find them on the open spaces of the international network, so there will be no talk of where they can be downloaded.

    <p>  How to control the phone from the phone?  How is the process of gaining access to the device debugged?  You need to understand that access is provided through the work of the cellular network, as well as the Internet.  Now this fact is unlikely to cause delight in anyone‚Äôs eyes, but I will tell you the essence of gaining access. </p><h2>  Program No. 1: Optia </h2><p>  So, there are several programs that work according to the following algorithm.  To gain access, the device from which they will control another must make a request and send it to the receiving device.  That, in turn, may reject the request, but may accept.  In the first case, synchronization will not occur.  In the second case, access will be allowed, and the user will be able to control the receiver remotely.  Work is carried out due to LTE technology, as well as through Wi-Fi.  In this case, both devices must be connected to a common access point.  One such program is Optia.  It was developed by Japanese engineers.  With the introduction of this utility, the user can gain remote access to the device.  This will be manifested in the ability to use the virtual buttons that are responsible for accessing the smartphone‚Äôs desktop and in the menu, using offers and more.  Optia is distributed free of charge in many application sources. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Other algorithms have similar algorithms, which we will consider later.  They simply use wireless technology to provide synchronization between two mobile devices.  At first glance, all this may look quite complicated.  But everything is much simpler than it seems.  The user will quickly get used to the management and will never again ask how to control the phone from the phone.  It is enough to use the program a little to make sure of its stability and sufficient functionality. </p><h2>  How to control the tablet from the phone? </h2>

    <p>  Nowadays, almost every family has a tablet computer.  Children are especially sensitive to such devices.  That is why, in addition to the smartphone, parents often buy their children expensive and not very, branded and non-branded tablet computers.  Accordingly, along with the question of how to control a computer from a phone, the question arises of remote access to a tablet. </p><p>  Tablets, as you know, take their mobility with high functionality.  They can watch movies, play digital games, read texts.  At the same time, the <span>resolution of the screens</span> often allows this to be done without significant restrictions, and the hardware also plays an important role.  In addition, the tablet computer can be connected to a TV and enjoy watching your favorite movies and TV shows.  But now it's a little different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Program No. 2: Tablet Remote </h2>

    <p>  Users often wonder not only about how to control a computer from their phone, but also about smartphones and tablets.  And the answer is simply on the surface, because the algorithms of the programs are similar.  So, to implement remote access to the tablet from the phone allows a program called Tablet Remote. </p><p>  She has several features.  We‚Äôll talk about them further.  Remote access will be limited.  This means that the user will not be able to get complete control over the device.  What is it about?  For example, that it will only be possible to control the playback of files and change the volume.  Available functions also include adjusting the screen brightness.  But Tablet Remote also has a good feature: administrator rights are not required.  Therefore, you can activate the program on all devices that meet its system requirements. </p><p>  In order to use the utility, it must first be installed on both devices: on the managed one and on which the remote access will be carried out.  When the installation is finished, you should run the utility on the devices.  From the very first seconds, the user will encounter an interesting animated interface, which is nevertheless not so difficult to understand.  By the way, using the Tablet Remote will solve the issue of how <span>to control the TV from the phone.</span> </p><p>  You need to go to the section called Setup.  There are options to use.  Options are responsible for using the utility as a keyboard remote from the device.  Go to the tab called Connection.  There is an icon in the form of a radar.  Click on it and wait.  During this time, the tablet will begin to detect the device.  For successful synchronization, you need to run the program on your smartphone. </p><p>  After the process of obtaining remote access begins, the owner of the device will be notified of the incoming connection.  To enable it, you just need to press the appropriate key.  Then the connection will be allowed.  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that such a procedure is one-time.  The next time you do not have to reconfirm the connection, because it will be saved in the device memory. </p><p>  The situation is much simpler with the device that will be used as a remote control.  There you just need to launch Tablet Remote, go to the section of the same name.  There will already be located icons that form the functionality of the program.  That is, control the volume, brightness, playback panel of multimedia files and so on. </p><p>  The remote control implemented in the utility has two different modes at once.  The first is portrait, the second is landscape.  By standard, a smartphone is used as a remote control.  If you change the orientation of the smartphone, it will automatically become a game controller. </p><p>  Tablet Remote is a great utility that can be used to get basic remote access to your tablet.  At the same time, you can control the tablet that was previously connected to the TV.  Thus, the issue of how to control the TV from the phone is automatically resolved.  The program is free. </p><h2>  How to control PC from phone </h2>
