  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parcel shop "St. Petersburg ASC": where is it located?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even when people are separated by distances, this is not a reason not to give gifts, not to send letters, even despite the ability to call and send e-mail. </p><p>  Let's go a little deeper into the history of the emergence and development of mail in general and gradually approach the main topic - "St. Petersburg ASC parcels shop."  The first historical fact that speaks of the beginning of the operation of regular shipments in Russia is considered to be the year 885, when "... Oleg sent to Rodimich, asking ..." ("A Tale of Bygone Years"). </p><h2>  The beginning of the mail of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The word "mail" was first mentioned in 1667 during the armistice between Russia and the Commonwealth as a result of the thirteen-year war. </p><p>  Already during the reign of Peter I there was a special postal service - emergency.  In 1714, the first St. Petersburg postmaster Heinrich Gottlieb Krauss began the device of the St. Petersburg-Riga post.  Initially, only two people worked there - directly Mr. Krauss and his assistant Osipov Gavrila, who served as scribe and translator.  But there was a lot of work, and the post office building was first enlarged, then new spacious outbuildings and individual buildings began to be erected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="psy-grafology.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main Post Office of St. Petersburg, Postal Street" class="if uuid-2280553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280553.jpg"></div><p>  At first, the shopkeepers accepted letters.  What was notified by signboards: "Receive letters to the city post number ...".  The price of the service is from 10 kopecks - the value and purpose of the message mattered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In those unhurried times, mail was collected three times (!) A day by a letter carrier from shopkeepers, taken to the department, and then, sorted, delivered to the indicated addresses.  That's why in classical literature we read about morning, afternoon and evening mail. </p><p>  January 29, 1833 is a significant date for the post office.  The first city post office in Russia began to work - "for sending letters living in the capital without investing money and things." </p><p>  A year later, mail is already delivered along with passenger traffic.  This made it possible to quickly open <span>post offices</span> throughout almost the entire territory of the Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritanstamps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Postage stamp 1872" class="if uuid-2280554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280554.jpg"></div><p>  In 1848, the first mailbox was installed in St. Petersburg.  And in its modern form - with a hinged lid, the mailbox was designed by designer P. N. Shabarov in 1910. </p><h2>  Years of devastation and change </h2><p>  During the revolution, the Civil War, postal service in the country was practically minimized.  There was very little chance of receiving a <span>sent letter</span> .  There were times when messages arrived later than their sender at the specified address.  This introduced a certain confusion in people's lives and curiosity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By 1950, the work of postal services throughout the country was fully restored.  And letters, parcels, parcels, telegrams flew from one end of our vast country to the other.  And the time for delivery of correspondence began to rapidly decrease. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novosti33.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rural post office" class="if uuid-2280559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280559.jpg"></div><p>  And even in the most remote villages post offices were organized and earned joy for all residents, which also performed an additional function - a meeting place for discussing the latest relevant "news" and gossip. </p><h2>  Steps to the future with human hands. </h2><p>  Despite a sharp technological breakthrough - the Internet and e-mail appeared in our lives, the work of Russian postmen of all ranks is not diminishing.  It has become profitable and convenient to make purchases in online stores, and delivery is most affordable only at the Russian Post. </p><p>  The abstract of a candidate or doctoral scientific work should be sent only through the post office.  Thus, no matter how technical progress develops, no matter how equipment is changed or modernized, people will receive and issue correspondence and other shipments.  And this means that such a concept as the human factor will not go anywhere from the scope of delivery of mail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Add specifics </h2><p>  Let us take a rather striking example - the 200983 department ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg ACC Parcel Shop‚Äù at the address: ul.  Sophia, 81, building 1. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.8483434" data-lng="30.425916799999982" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/6/7/967.png"></div><p>  This post office is located in the Frunze district.  The nearest metro station is Obukhovo, a little over 2 km, Proletarskaya or Kupchino, but in any case it will be difficult to walk and it is worth a bit to travel if you have to travel on your own, by public transport.  It‚Äôs easier if you drive a car and have a navigator, you just dial the destination where the ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg ASC Parcel Shop‚Äù is located. </p><p>  But it‚Äôs better not to get this far.  It is better to let the consignment wait for the consignee in the nearest branch to the house or deliver it by courier.  The Russian Post also provides this service, but, to be fair, with varying success, judging by the numerous reviews of consumers of this particular service. </p><h2>  Post service </h2><p>  In addition to forwarding correspondence, post offices also provide the following services to the population: </p><ul><li>  Financial services. </li><li>  Sales of related products. </li><li>  Subscription is not <span>printed periodicals.</span> </li><li>  <span>Network services.</span> </li><li>  CyberPost @. </li></ul><p>  And all this, mind you, in addition to its main purpose - the provision of postal services.  Is it worth it then to complain that sorting in the parcel shop of the St. Petersburg ACC takes so much time?  Our domestic mail has problems, there are.  And the main ones are the low modernization of the process and the lack of highly qualified specialists in the field.  Both that, and another is caused by financial indicators.  Moreover, if you look at the branch‚Äôs website, then the opening hours are from 00:00 to 00:00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="veintech.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorting shop" class="if uuid-2280558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280558.jpg"></div><p>  And judging by the statistics presented there, already in the incomplete first month of 2018, the St. Petersburg ASC branch 200983 (parcels department) sorted and processed more than 100,000 items of various categories (from simple letters and small parcels to express courier deliveries and large packages). </p><h2>  Not all services are automated yet </h2><p>  Correspondence from at least ten previous post offices arrives in such large sorting departments (the same <span>sorting centers of the ACS,</span> only more, from other districts of the city and the Leningrad region).  For example, "St. Petersburg-Pulkovo AOPP" or from the SC of the Moscow station.  And not all such workshops are equipped with an automatic parcel sorting line, there are mechanical lines and manual sorting. </p><p>  At every airport and at every station in all cities of our big country there are post offices, and work there is in full swing around the clock.  Exactly where there is a huge accumulation of forwarded items and baggage, the work is not yet automated. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  You can understand those who are extremely dissatisfied with the work of our mail.  From the time of departure to the process of receiving the package, the parcel or registered letter go through a lot of different degrees of processing and sorting according to the address principle.  And since the volumes of various shipments in a city such as St. Petersburg are not decreasing, but even growing, the waiting time at each stage, accordingly, increases.  In some reviews, the sorting process in the package parcel 200983 ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg ACS‚Äù was even called the ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù.  Yes, it happens that small packages, envelopes simply disappear under the heap of the rest of the correspondence, and office employees do not always have time to notice the problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nevsedoma.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ASC works around the clock" class="if uuid-2280560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280560.jpg"></div><p>  Again, judging by the feedback from the senders-recipients, parcels in the parcel shop of the St. Petersburg ACC can be stuck for 3-4 weeks, and the most unlucky ones can take a couple of months. </p><h2>  Departure Control </h2><p>  In order to approximate the hour of delivery and to avoid situations when the message simply disappeared, there is a tracking function on the Russian Post website.  This is an excellent occasion to independently control the passage of correspondence path from the moment of departure to receipt by the addressee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ACC on Sofiyskaya St. in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2280555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280555.jpg"></div><p>  It is through this opportunity that it is necessary to solve the issue of the loss of a parcel, a parcel, or a registered letter in the parcel shop of the St. Petersburg ACS, if it is in this paragraph that the message traces are lost.  It is easier for the sender and recipient, and it is easier for the postal service specialists - they will be able to resolve the issue more quickly on the spot for mutual pleasure. </p><p>  In order to submit an application for the loss of departure, you must take the following documents with you: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  check for sending; </li><li>  application, but it is filled directly at the post office. </li></ul><h2>  Package searching </h2><p>  According to the regulations, a delay is considered to be a fact if a parcel in the status ‚ÄúLeft the sorting center of the parcel shop 200983‚Äú St. Petersburg ACC ‚Äùhung for more than 14 days. </p><p>  By the way, it‚Äôs better to really just come and not try to get through the multi-channel line.  Well, that is if the package is directly expected.  Due to the high degree of loading, the dispatch can really ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  There is still an option to write to the customer service of the Russian Post.  The letter should also indicate the data as clearly as possible and, if possible, attach a scan of the check. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of an automated sorting center" class="if uuid-2280557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2280557.jpg"></div><p>  A personal visit often significantly shortens delivery times.  Moreover, the address of the parcel shop ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg ACS‚Äù is simple, and the building itself is located along the road, you do not need to look for it somewhere in the depths of the block.  If you arrive by car, there is a convenient parking place. </p>
