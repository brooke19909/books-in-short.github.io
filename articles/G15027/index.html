In the city, nicknamed the Eastern Gate of Moscow, there are estates with historical significance, ancient religious buildings, beautiful parks and squares.  Many buildings were erected in the era of Catherine the Great.  Where to start acquaintance with a large settlement near Moscow? </p><h2>  Sights of Balashikha: estates </h2><p>  First of all, the city is interesting for its many noble nests, which two centuries ago the landowners and princes actively erected here.  It is not surprising that the sights of Balashikha are first and foremost magnificent estates.  For example, you should definitely visit the former possession of Count Rumyantsev.  Unfortunately, the Troitskoye-Kaynardzhi estate was partially destroyed.  The working Trinity Church remained intact, the burial place of the former owner, interesting with a colorful jasper tombstone.  The temple accepts the afflicted for about two centuries. </p>

    <p>  Sights of Balashikha are other grandiose buildings.  <span>Gorenka Manor</span> became famous in the early years of the 19th century, after it was acquired by Razumovsky.  This man was actively interested in rare plants, which prompted him to create a botanical garden.  Plants that <span>tourists</span> can admire these <span>days are</span> represented by several thousand species, many of which belong to the category of exotic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The estate Pehra-Yakovlevskoe will be of interest to those who want to see the most picturesque sights of Balashikha.  It is located on the banks of the river, looks spectacular from afar.  The main architectural value is the Savior Church, built in 1782. </p><h2>  What churches to visit </h2><p>  Naming the main attractions of Balashikha, it is impossible to forget about churches.  One of the oldest religious buildings is the Church of the Intercession of the Virgin, which was first included in scribal books as early as 1624.  Several years ago, the church survived the restoration, thanks to which its pre-revolutionary appearance was practically restored. </p>

    <p>  It is definitely worth seeing the Alexander Nevsky Church, the construction of which was completed in the last years of the 19th century.  The construction was seriously damaged in Soviet times, but since the beginning of the current century, its restoration has been underway. </p><p>  Finally, tourists may be interested in the Temple of St. Michael the Archangel.  The style of construction refers to the direction of Baroque.  It was created with the assistance of a descendant of Yuri Dolgorukov, this happened in the 18th century. </p><h2>  Interesting museums of the city </h2><p>  Manors and churches are far from all that Balashikha can deservedly be proud of.  Attractions in Balashikha are also museums.  It is reasonable to start acquaintance with the village with a visit to the Museum of Local History.  A study of the exhibits presented in it will give valuable information about the history of the region, tell about how its population lives, starting from ancient times and ending with our century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Museum of the History of Air Defense Forces is another pride of Balashikha.  Such a place cannot be found throughout Europe.  Guests of the city who are interested in military equipment will enjoy his visit. </p><p>  Balashikha art gallery is also loved by tourists.  In addition to professional works of art, among its exhibits you can find the fruits of children's creativity, attractive naive charm. </p><h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  Sights of the city of Balashikha, created by mother nature, can not be ignored.

    <p>  Visitors to the avenue will be able to see the Memorial Cross, created in 2000.  Its establishment is associated with the destruction of the Alexander Nevsky Church, which was subsequently restored. </p><h2>  Humorous sights </h2><p>  Residents of the village are endowed with an excellent sense of humor.  There is no other way to explain how the monument to the Janitor, erected in 2007, was included in the list of "Sights of the city of Balashikha."  The description of the purpose of this building, which the creators themselves propose, is that the building extols the hard work of representatives of this profession.  Near the monument to the Janitor, city guests loved taking pictures. </p><p>  There are so many interesting places in Balashikha that it is impossible to explore them in one visit.  Therefore, all visitors to the village are sure to return again. </p>
