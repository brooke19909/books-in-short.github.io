    <p>  "Sony" has always been guided by the rule: "New console - new gamepad."  2013, when the company introduced its PlayStation 4, was no exception.  Sony introduced a new joystick at the E3 game show, and the device made a splash.  It was immediately noticeable that the company invested a lot of time and energy into the development of Dualshock 4. Thanks to the stylish design, modern technologies and interesting technical solutions, the gamepad was much more advanced than the one used in the Xbox One.  Dualshock 4 is a real guide to the world of drive and video games.  But is he so good?  Does the device really have no shortcomings?  You can find answers to these and many other questions in this article. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device, as always, is at its best.  It so happened that the guys from Sony are able to do stylish things.  The gamepad looks very stylish.  Even the ‚Äúseams‚Äù remaining after welding plastic do not seem a necessary measure, but a necessity that only complements the design of the device.  Also, you can not miss the futuristic notes that make the gamepad more modern.  With all this, Sony Dualshock 4 is not too far away from the classics.  The gamemad follows all the canons of the Dualshock line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps one of the main innovations is the touch panel.  "Sony" decided that the yard is no longer the nineties.  The era of "Dandy" and "Mega Drive" has sunk into oblivion.  It's time to move on.  For this reason, Sony experts removed the bored Start / Select buttons.  And their heavy burden was borne by a brand new touch-screen display, which, among other things, is able to understand gestures.  And this is a rather interesting and convenient thing.  For example, now during the game in order to perform a certain action, you just need to swipe the screen. </p><p>  <span>The touchpad</span> will help the user outside the games.  Typing characters in the browser used to be terribly inconvenient.  After all, I had to look for each letter individually and click on it.  Forget about this hard labor - those troubled times are gone!  After all, now you can enter data using a new touch screen display.  And it just cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  Near the touchpad you can see two new buttons.  Share allows you to share the gameplay from the game with friends.  This is a pretty fun feature that provides social interaction.  The Options button, as the name implies, at one point brings up the settings menu. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Sony Dualshock 4 retained the same settings as the fellow.  Therefore, if you are literally rooted in <span>Dualshock 3,</span> then you will not have to relearn.  Moreover, after playing a couple of hours with Dualshock 4, you will not want to return to the older model.  The gamepad has a rather modest size.  Therefore, even after lengthy gaming sessions in the hands there is not a drop of fatigue.  The back panel is a little rough.  Thanks to <span>this, the joystick</span> does not slip and does not crawl in the hands. </p><p>  Dualshock 4 has a built-in vibrodrive, accelerometer and gyroscope.  All this is necessary during the game, the use of such technologies brings new sensations.  Now immersed in the game world has become much easier, and to perform various actions through the touch screen is much more pleasant than clicking on the buttons. </p>

    <p>  The luminous diode indicator is another control element that will provide a comfortable game.  It can glow in one of four colors, including red, blue, green and white.  First of all, this is necessary so that in a large company you know which of your joysticks.  In addition, the indicator is necessary for interaction with the Eye camera (something like ‚ÄúKinekt‚Äù from ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù). </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Since Dualshock 4 uses a whole bunch of sophisticated technologies (gyroscope, accelerometer, LED indicator, etc.), it is not at all surprising that the joystick sits quite quickly.  A full charge is usually enough for 6 hours of continuous play.  Nevertheless, if the game is in full swing, and the gamepad is ready to go to bed, it can be connected via the USB cable to the console itself.  Of course, in this case the joystick will be wired, but it will be able to work as much as you like. </p>

    <p>  Everyone knows that playing races, fighting games, football using the keyboard is another perversion.  The guys from Sony decided to take pity on PC gamers.  It is for this reason that the new gamepad supports the computer.  But <span>how to connect Dualshock 4 to a PC?</span>  Everything is as simple as possible.  You must connect the joystick via a USB cable.  However, in order to get full functionality (including the touch panel, gyroscope and other buns), you will have to download special drivers.  You can find them on the official website of Sony. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Dualshock 4 is an amazing device that has a lot of advantages.  In general, we can say that the upgrade was successful and the new joystick surpasses the grandfather of Dualschock 3 in all respects.  And considering that Dualshock 4 costs about $ 60, it‚Äôs also a bargain for PC gamers. </p>
