    <p>  The gadget is endowed with a standard list of features.  For example, you can use it to work on the Internet, chat on Skype, listen to music and even shoot videos!  Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet 16 GB does not perform any essentially new functions. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It should be noted that the delivery set of the device also does not stand out.  It can be called standard. </p><p>  In the box with Sony Experiment you can find: </p><ul><li>  the device itself; </li><li>  Charger; </li><li>  USB cable for connecting to a PC; </li><li>  headphones (not in all assemblies); </li><li>  user's manual. </li></ul><p>  Additional accessories for the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet must be purchased independently.  The good news is that finding the right devices is not difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About design and construction </h2><p>  The Sony Z2 Series tablet is a device that, according to manufacturers, is protected from moisture and dust.  The high level of protection of the device allows you not to worry about its integrity. </p><p>  Reviews on the <span>Sony Xperia</span> Z2 Tablet indicate that it is generally light - weighing about 430 grams.  But the size of the gadget is not encouraging.  It is often called bulky - 172 by 266 by 6.4 millimeters.  Holding this tablet in a long time is inconvenient.

    <p>  The front side of the device is primarily a screen.  But it has a fairly wide frame.  The back panel is made of matte plastic, on which fingerprints are very noticeable.  At the back of the Sony Xperia Tablet Z2 LTE 16GB is a camera.  The end of the device is equipped with a power button and connectors for USB-cable.  There are compartments for the "SIM card" and "flash drive".  Also on the case there is an infrared port, which is used to control the Smart Home function. </p><p>  Reviews of the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet indicate that the device bends a little.  This fact must be taken into account if the gadget is planned to be carried in a bag with a lot of things.  It is advisable to immediately buy a tablet case so that you can not worry about this feature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet SGP521 tablets are devices with a fairly large screen.  The display is designed for 10.1 inches with an extension of up to 1 920 by 1 200 points.  The tablet uses IPS technology.  It provides the device with a good viewing angle and brightness. </p><p>  According to users, the screen is perfect for viewing photos, films and videos.  Among the main disadvantages of the display, the owners highlight a yellowish tint of white.  Sometimes the screen gives yellow, sometimes pink.  The aspect ratio of the device is called by some strange. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  A huge role for modern mobile devices is performance.  Some phones and tablets, despite their characteristics, are slow.  Therefore, users refuse them. </p><p>  Reviews on the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet emphasize the ambiguous attitude of the owners to the performance of the device.  For example, some say that the device works quickly, but over time, brakes appear.  And someone immediately assures the slow execution of requests. </p><p>  The Sony Experiment Z2 tablet has a quad-core processor with a resolution of each 2.3 GHz.  RAM in it is only 3 GB.  For a modern tablet, this is not as much as we would like.  Some gaming innovations will not start on this device.  But basically all the programs and games on the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet work without brakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet sony xperia tablet z2 lte 16gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1801854.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Reviews on the tablet emphasize the presence of a good battery in the device.  It uses Quick Charge version 2.0 technology.  Manufacturers claim that the battery life of the device is increased by 75%. </p><p>  The battery is rated at 6,000 mAh.  The tablet can work up to 10 hours with active use and up to 100 hours in standby mode.  These are very good indicators for a modern mobile device. </p><p>  In fact, the tablet presented to attention can be compared in power with the iPad Air.  It is noted that the device under study actually discharges quite quickly.  At the same time, charging takes a lot of time (the battery charges about 5 hours from a standard power supply).  If you use a special magnetic docking station, you can reduce the battery charging time by a third. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet 16GB 4G has several cameras.  Namely, the front and rear.  The first is located on the front panel of the device, the second is on the back. </p><p>  The front camera is designed for shooting with a quality of 8.1 megapixels, and the rear - 2.2 megapixels.  Flash is not provided for any of the components.  Sony Expert Tablet has built-in Sony's standard picture and video editing features. </p><p>  Users do not respond best to the operation of the carmer of the device under study.  Some complain about the poor quality of images, some are not satisfied with the lack of flash.  At night, shooting with Sony Experia will not work.  With poor lighting, videos and photos also leave much to be desired. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  There are practically no complaints about the operating system and its capabilities.  Reviews on the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet tablet emphasize that Sony in this device went the common way - it used the Android 4.4 operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 tablets sgp521" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1801850.jpg"></div>
