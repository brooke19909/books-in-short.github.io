And slipped out of the strong fetters.  The pirates got scared and jumped into the depths of the sea themselves.  And there they turned into handsome dolphins, so that with their existence and great ability to atone for the misconduct of a past life.  They began to be called "people of the sea." </p><p>  Amazing warm-blooded creatures easily come in contact with people, even while on the high seas.
