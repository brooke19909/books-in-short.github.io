    <p>  For accommodation on the Black Sea coast there are a large number of hotels that are located both near the sea and closer to the city center. </p><h2>  Nice hotel Kalofer </h2><p>  The Bulgarian hotel Kalofer 3 * (Sunny Beach) was built in 2005.  A year later, repairs were carried out here, and in 2016 a partial renovation was also organized. </p><p>  In a small area owned by the hotel, there is one building, conditionally divided into 3 buildings.  Two of them have 3 floors, and in the central part of the building - 7 floors.  The hotel building is equipped with two elevators, on the ground floor there is a spacious reception where check-in of guests takes place.  By the way, it starts at 2 p.m., but departure must be done no later than 12 noon.  The hotel has the possibility of late check-out, however, this service is provided for a fee and is possible only if the hotel has available rooms at this time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although the adjacent territory at the Kalofer 3 * hotel (Bulgaria) is small, on the other hand there are pretty flowerbeds and a pool with sunbeds around it.  Of course, there are few entertainments in the hotel, but thanks to them, guests will be able to diversify their vacation and have a great time free from swimming and sunbathing. </p>

    <p>  Not only a place to relax at sea is Bulgaria.  Hotel Kalofer 3 * will be happy to provide everyone who is interested in the opportunity to hold a business meeting, presentation or any other important conference.  For this, the hotel has two conference halls of different capacities.  One of them is suitable for an audience of 80 people, the other will fit 50 guests. </p><p>  Both of these rooms are equipped with all the necessary equipment, which may only be needed during a business event.  It has the most advanced video and audio systems, microphones and computers. </p><h2>  Good impressions of the Kalofer Hotel </h2><p>  Not only our compatriots, but also guests from other countries come to rest at the Kalofer 3 * hotel.  Reviews about this place mostly agree that the hotel is excellent in terms of price and quality. </p><p>  The breakfasts and the rest of the food in the local restaurants are quite tasty and varied.  In the rooms all the furniture is quite new, everything is whole and clean.  The staff at the hotel is friendly and welcoming, only barely speaks Russian.  Vacationers also like the location of the hotel, because it is convenient to get to the beach, shops, and the city center.  For those who do not set themselves the goal of sitting at the hotel for days on end, accommodation here is a great option. </p><h2>  What hotel guests do not like </h2>

    <p>  Of the minuses, tourists note central air conditioning, which cannot be adjusted independently.  The hotel also has some problems with housekeeping and pool cleaning, which are not always regular.  Our compatriots in their reviews report that it is best to remind about cleaning the room at the reception, then the cleaners will soon come and do their job.  There is not enough internet for vacationers, which could be used throughout the hotel, including in rooms, as well as beach towels, which are not provided here. </p>
