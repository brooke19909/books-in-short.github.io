Yes, so that she was in the right microdistrict, and she came out cheaper.  It‚Äôs not even necessary to be a visitor.  And in my city I want to live separately from my parents.  Especially if it is a big city.  Such as St. Petersburg.  But, the larger the city, the more crooks work in it.  "Get" for money, and stay without a rented apartment at all - as easy as shelling pears.  Thousands of people will only confirm this.  But how to rent a house, so as not to become a victim of fraud?  A few tips will help you sort out the situation! </p><p>  First you need to decide: will you turn to the services of a realtor or not.  Of course in the modern world <noindex>  <span>rent an apartment in St. Petersburg</span> </noindex>  without someone‚Äôs help (even on a financial basis) it‚Äôs very difficult.  Yes, in a real estate office you will pick up a huge number of apartment options.  You just have to choose the most suitable.  But here you can run into swindlers.  You can try to do it yourself.  Say, I'll take a newspaper with free ads, and there certainly will be offered a choice of a whole scattering of apartments!  That's how it is.  Only on paper.  And in newspapers with magazines, mostly apartments are already assigned to realtors.  Or in general the apartments that are described in the magazines simply do not exist. </p><p>  Anyway, if you turn to realtors for help, you need to collect the most useful information about the agency.  Well, if the office has already managed to show itself in the market from the best side, it has its own website and a sufficient number of customers subscribed to the website.  It will not be superfluous to read reviews on the World Wide Web.  Do not trust companies that have just started their activities.  There is a chance to be cheated.  No one will guarantee that this is not a one-day company.  And then money certainly will not be returned. </p><p>  You must understand that absolutely at all stages of the search for an apartment you must be extremely careful.  Surely you have friends or relatives in a big city who have come across housing searches.  Let them advise you in advance of a reliable option.  Do not chase the cheapness.  Often scammers lure people with luxury apartments at reasonable prices.  Understand that such an apartment will not wait for someone for a long time, even if it is real.  Turning to experts in the field of housing, be sure to draw up a contract.  It is a contract, not a fake receipt.  Everything should be spelled out in detail.  Better yet, take a lawyer to sign the contract. </p><p>  Nobody can probably give you a 100% guarantee that you will not become a victim of scams.  Criminals still find new ways to trick gullible citizens.  Just be careful, demand to show all the necessary documents from the owner of the apartment and a realtor, rewrite passport data.  Do not see very cheap and dubious options.  Turn on the mind and logic and everything will surely work out for you! </p></div></article>
