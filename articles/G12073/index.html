Components of the coat of arms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since the advent of heraldry, the form of emblems has been an important part of the entire emblem composition.  They changed depending on the culture and nationality of the owner. </p><h2>  The origin of the arms </h2><p>  From the point of view of heraldry, the forms of emblems are forms of the heraldic shield.  This element is the basis of any drawing accepted as a symbol by influential families and states.  In medieval Europe, coat of arms figures located on it also depended on the form of emblems. </p><p>  In the knightly era, the most popular was the triangular shield.  It was he who became the harbinger of all classical heraldry.  Over time, other configurations began to appear, which increasingly depended on the imagination and fiction of the artist.  The first emblems only copied their forms from real shields, which, in turn, changed with the development of medieval weapons. </p><p>  When the real shape began to yield to the fiction of artists, heraldic books began to replete with a huge number of variations.  Since this was already a symbol, each owner of his own coat of arms tried to get a unique combination of elements and shapes.  Because of this, even national schools with their own patterns and traditions were born. </p>

    <h2>  Forms and types of emblems </h2><p>  In modern heraldry, classic shields are highlighted.  There are nine of them: Varangian, Italian, Spanish, French, Byzantine, English, rhombic, German and square.  Such forms of emblems were most popular.  Some of them were named according to national tradition, although in reality they also had geometric analogues.  The heraldic shield in the shape of a triangle was called Varangian, the oval - Italian, rounded at the bottom of the square - Spanish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There were more intricate figures, but they were much less common.  The right and left sides of the coat of arms are determined from the point of view of the person who holds the shield, and not from the viewer.  This is one of the most important rules in heraldry that newcomers often do not know. </p>

    <h2>  French shield </h2><p>  The most common was the French coat of arms.  Its shape corresponded to a quadrangle with a pointed bottom.  Such emblems were especially popular in Russia.  Symbols with these outlines took the famous noble families and provincial cities of the 19th century.  The modern form of the Russian coat of arms is also made in the French tradition. </p><p>  How can one explain such popularity?  The form of the coat of arms of Russia (i.e., French) provides maximum free space for the heraldic figures in the figure.  Such a shield is most practical from the point of view of the artist.  On the French coat of arms you can depict the most complex and original composition. </p><h2>  German shield </h2><p>  The most difficult was the German shield.  In its form, there was a notch on the edge.  This heraldic tradition was born as a re-drawing of a real German shield.  It is also called tarche.  It was used by the Western European knights of the 13th ‚Äì 16th centuries.  Tarch appeared even in Russian squads.  A recess in it was needed in order to fix the spear, which could defeat the enemy.  Coats of arms of the knights of Germany especially often included this artistic feature of the form. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tharchy spread throughout Europe in the 13th century.  They could be made from available wood.  This material was much more accessible than iron.  For greater security, the tarches were covered with fur.  Therefore, in heraldry, the figure often imitates the skin of animals.  The description of the coat of arms could not do without mentioning the material from which the shield is made.  This feature emphasized the owner's belonging to a particular genus.  Rich knightly families could afford iron; accordingly, it was depicted on their symbol. </p>

    <h2>  Dissection </h2><p>  To understand how to make up the coat of arms of your family, you need to know not only the forms of shields, but also other heraldic artistic features.  One of them is the tradition of dividing figures into several parts.  Artists use dissection, intersection, as well as diagonal lines.  They allow you to split the heraldic shield so that several colors are present on it at once.  A diverse palette is one of the most popular heraldic tools necessary to give a picture a uniqueness and recognition. </p><p>  Using diagonal lines, you can cut off and emphasize the importance of a certain part of the shield.  For example, this separates the head or top of the coat of arms.  If the diagonal strip intersects the entire shield, then this technique is called a bandage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Cross </h2><p>  Another important heraldic figure is the cross.  Coats of arms of the knights often included an image of this symbol.  It is logical to assume that in Europe the cross was the main sign of Christianity, which is why it was so often used.  However, over time, this heraldic symbol received a second wind.  He began to depict without regard to the original Christian meaning.  The universality of the cross can easily be confirmed by the whole of human history.  Such drawings were used long before the birth of heraldry.  For example, among the Gentiles, the cross was synonymous with sun worship. </p><p>  If you connect two dressings on the coat of arms, you get the symbol of the fleet that is familiar to Russians.  This is the so-called St. Andrew's Cross, which can also be found on the <span>flag of Scotland</span> and in many other heraldic compositions.  Other types of this common symbol may have intricate shortening or other decorative extensions (rounding, notches, etc.). </p>

    <h2>  Other geometric shapes </h2><p>  In addition to cuts and a cross, in heraldry there are several more common heraldic figures drawn on the shield.  This list includes: a square, a border, a triangle, a tip, a rectangle, a circle, a rhombus, a spindle, etc. The description of the coat of arms necessarily contains a reference to the drawn figures.  In the late Middle Ages, a tradition appeared to depict geometric elements in the corners of a shield.  This "free part" is a common heraldic device. </p><p>  In addition, the main shield, which forms the entire shape of the coat of arms, may have a smaller shield inside.  Such recursion was the norm for heraldry.  With the help of shields, the knightly origin of the owner of the coat of arms was emphasized. </p><h2>  Non-heraldic figures </h2><p>  There is another large group of components of the coat of arms.  These figures are also called non-heraldic.  They are divided into three types: artificial, natural and legendary.  As a rule, the most recognizable element of the coat of arms is a unique pattern.  Therefore, the knights (and then the cities) tried to depict on their shield something rare and original. </p><p>  Natural figures include drawings of animals and birds.  Coat of arms emblems picked them according to the fauna of their native lands.  In addition, the rules of heraldry did not at all prohibit the image of rivers, mountains - in general, all that nature created.  Artificial figures are drawings of weapons and armor.  They were especially popular with knights and warriors, who thus emphasized their love for military craft. </p><p>  Finally, the most curious and extraordinary group can be called legendary figures.  These are drawings of fictional creatures popular in heraldry.  Even the most zealous Christians could depict centaurs, griffins and other characters of ancient mythology on their coat of arms.  The most famous in this series is probably the figure of a <span>two-headed eagle.</span>  This mythical bird was depicted on the <span>coat of arms of the Byzantine Empire.</span>  From there, together with Orthodoxy and other Greek realities, she switched to Russia.  The first two-headed eagle as a symbol in Moscow began to use Ivan III in the XV century. </p>

    <h2>  Stamp motto </h2><p>  An important part of any coat of arms at all times was the motto.  As it was used a short catchy phrase, which became a symbol of the clan, city or state.  From heraldry, the mottoes migrated to military affairs and everyday life. </p><p>  Regardless of the shape of the coat of arms of the family, he always had a special ribbon below.  The motto was written on it.  In Catholic countries, Latin winged expressions were used.  Quotes from the Bible or other ancient scriptures were popular.  The ribbon and the inscription on it copied the color of the coat of arms metals. </p>

    <h2>  Shield holders </h2><p>  Especially magnificent coats of arms (usually royal or princely) often used such a heraldic element as a shield holder.  He supplemented the main composition.  The shield is in the center, and the shield holders are depicted at the edges.  At first, human figures were used in their quality.  This tradition came about thanks to <span>jousting tournaments,</span> which were always attended by the assistant warriors who held their family shield. </p><p>  However, over time, these figures began to be replaced by mythological creatures and animals.  This technique allowed to further decorate the heraldic composition.  To know how to draw up a coat of arms, one must precisely imagine who can be portrayed as shield holders and who not.  In any symbolic drawing, they personified the stamina and strength of their owner.  Therefore, as shield holders, they often depicted powerful creatures: lions, eagles, giants, etc. Their selection has always been treated very carefully. </p><p>  There are cases that shield holders differ from each other.  This, for example, is the case with the <span>emblem of Great Britain.</span>  On it, on the right, is a majestic crowned lion, and on the left is a mythical silver unicorn.  The figure of an angel as a heavenly protector and patron was popular among Christian knights in the Middle Ages.  Therefore, before the battle, the warrior always made a prayer, while holding a shield with him.  For many superstitious emblem owners, their design was a happy talisman on the battlefield.  Breaking his shield with a heraldic image was considered an unlucky sign. </p>
