    <h2>  The birth of an heiress </h2><p>  Goering Edda was the first and only child in the Goering family.  Her mother, Emma Johann Annie Sonneman?  Before marriage, she built a career as an actress, but, having married, she became the first woman in Germany.  After all, Hitler, at the time of Goering’s wedding, was not yet married, and Hermann Goering was the second person in the country after him. </p><p>  Witnesses noted that Emma was indeed charming and graceful, she conquered her naturalness.  At the time of the daughter's birth, the woman was more than 40 years old.  Since she did not give birth before, pregnancy proceeded with complications, taking all the strength from the woman in labor. </p><p>  Emma was constantly under the care of both her sister and her husband's sisters.  Supported by a woman and her closest friend - Ebba Johannsen, a famous actress. </p><p>  The whole family was determined to have a boy, but when a girl was born on June 2, 1938, according to eyewitnesses, Hermann Goering was so happy that he even burst into tears. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edda goering" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1277701.jpg" width="600"></div>

From all over the world congratulatory telegrams began to arrive, more than 628 thousand of them arrived.  A huge number of gifts for the child and new parents came every day.  And the happy father rolled a feast at home, gathering about 200 guests. </p><p>  However, the happy event was slightly overshadowed by rumors around alleged paternity. </p><h2>  Who is Edda’s real father? </h2><p>  Immediately after the appearance of the baby, rumors began to circulate that Goering could not be her father, because he was considered impotent.  In history, a case was recorded when this person was injured in the groin, and he repeatedly admitted that in this connection he has problems in his sexual life. </p><p>  Hermann Goering was very sensitive to such conversations.  There are cases when people were sent to concentration camps for dissolving this kind of gossip.  Gauleiter of Franconia <span>Julius Streicher,</span> one of the members of the party, immediately after losing the word that Edda was a test tube child, lost his rank. </p><p>  All doubts were dispelled by Willy Frischauer, who worked on writing a biography of the Nazi leader.  He was well acquainted with all members of the family and noted that Goering's daughter Edd was so similar to her father that all rumors about her birth, looking at this similarity, became baseless. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Edda Goering photo" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1282920.jpg" width="564"></div>

At first there was a version that the girl was named in honor of the daughter of Mussolini, who was called the same.  Having married and becoming Countess Ciano, the daughter of Mussolini and her husband very often visited the Goering.  However, after Count Ciano betrayed his famous father-in-law and was shot, his wife became an enemy for the Goering family. </p><p>  Then a version appeared that the child was named in honor of his mother’s friend, Ebba Johannsen.  Only this name did not like his father a little, and he changed it to Edda.  So there was Edda Goering. </p><h2>  The collapse of the great family </h2><p>  Edda grew up in Berlin.  Father was considered the successor of Hitler himself, a seemingly happy future in Edda Goering in his pocket.  However, fate turned a completely different side. </p><p>  The Goering family was arrested on April 23, 1945 by SS men because the head of the family attempted to remove Hitler from power.  By order of the Führer Goering expelled from the party and stripped of all posts and ranks.  The events took place shortly before the end of World War II, and Hitler himself did not have to live long, so just a few days later the family was released from custody. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goering's daughter Edda" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1280668.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Goering decided to surrender to the Americans.  This led to the fact that the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced him, where he was recognized as one of the most important criminals of the Second World War.  Goering was sentenced to death by hanging. </p><h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  Goering Edda <strong> </strong>  at first she had the opportunity to visit her father in prison.  After September 13, 1946, these dates were banned. </p><p>  Goering himself died on October 16, 1946 from <span>potassium cyanide.</span>  He committed suicide on the eve of his execution, leaving a note: "Marshals are not hanged."  His daughter at that time was only 8 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edda goering is alive" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1277926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When the trial ended, Edda and her mother spent about 4 years in prison in the Western Allies of the anti-Hitler coalition. </p><p>  A few years after these events, the girl’s mother noted that this period in their life was the most difficult. </p><h2>  Life after liberation </h2><p>  When the women were released, and this happened in the early 60s, they continued to live in Munich.  The girl graduated with honors from school, and after her graduation she became a law student.  However, she did not like the chosen profession, and after studying for only 2 semesters, she abandoned her studies. </p><p>  Edda's mother wrote a book called Life with My Husband, but this work was of no value, neither from the point of view of history, nor from the point of view of art and literature.  Emmy Goering died in 1973. </p><p>  Edda, having matured, got a job, she worked as a laboratory assistant in one of the hospitals in Munich.  Married Edda Goering (photo in the article) never got married. </p><p>  The woman never wrote any memoirs, avoided journalists, limited communication with people who were interested in the identity of her father.  All her life she eschewed politics and did not start close relations with anyone. </p><h2>  Edda and her father </h2><p>  Edda Goering is alive <strong> </strong>  and now, in recent years, she lives in South Africa.  Throughout her life, a woman has accused the United States of convicting her father and committing suicide.  When she was presented with irrefutable evidence that he was implicated in many war crimes, she rejected this information, considering him an ideal person and a very good father.  She never criticized him for being implicated in the mass extermination of Jews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hermann Goering's daughter" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40750/1277934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hermann Goering "became famous" not only as a war criminal, but also as a robber of state and private collections.  During the Nazi regime in Europe, he appropriated many works of art.  His daughter believed that the wealth taken from his father did not belong to him, but to her mother.  She tried to prove that the order of inheritance was violated, and they should compensate for what was lost. </p><p>  Goering Edda often said that if her father had not been a politician, they would have been together. </p><p>  In a petition to the Bavarian legal commission, it was said that Mrs. Goering asked to return at least part of her things for personal needs, because now she is in poverty. </p><p>  In 2010, in order to improve her financial situation, Edda sold at an auction a dress embroidered with swastikas, which Hitler gave her on her baptism day. </p><p>  Despite this wording of the petition, the legal committee considered the case for only a few minutes and refused to grant Edde Goering the petition. </p>
