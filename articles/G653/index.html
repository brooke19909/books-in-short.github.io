It is more environmentally friendly than polyethylene and plastic.  In many stores, such packaging can be bought ready-made, and if you wish, you can make a paper bag with your own hands at home. </p><h2>  Where are paper bags used? </h2><p>  Paper packaging is used as containers for various products.  Bags for popcorn, ready-made pastries and other food products are made from inexpensive paper.  These packages sell loose tea.  Even coal for lighting bonfires is packed in paper.  Most often, such paper bags are made of kraft paper or parchment and look pretty simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kraft paper bags" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27896/665799.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  There are other packages that are made of thicker paper and covered with a laminated layer.  They are used for gift wrapping and have beautiful colors.  Today, branded paper bags with a logo and contacts are very popular.  This is a kind of successful advertising.  Designers are engaged in their development.  Some of these packages are a real <span>work of art.</span> </p><h2>  What is needed to make a paper bag? </h2><p>  Making paper bags does not require special skills.  First of all, you need to decide on the paper.  If you want the bag to last a long time and not tear, it is recommended to use laminated paper, which is a moisture resistant material.  You can also take a tight packing list of the required size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Still, to make a paper bag with your own hands, you will need scissors, a pencil, a ruler, paper glue or <span>double-sided tape</span> (9-12 mm), eyelets, a machine for punching them, a <span>decorative cord</span> (or tape for pens) and cardboard.  It is not always used and serves for greater durability of the package. </p><h2>  How to make a paper bag? </h2><p>  First of all, you should outline the size of the future package in height, length and width.  On the reverse side of the prepared sheet of paper, a drawing is applied using a pencil and a ruler. </p><p>  Start with vertical lines.  We put the first mark, departing 1.5-2 cm from the left edge of the sheet.  This area is necessary for bonding.  Next, measure the distance from the first mark, equal to the length of the packet, and draw a second line.  The next label will determine the width of the packet.  Then again mark the length and after it the width.  Each subsequent mark begins to be measured from the previous one.  Thus, we should get a drawing of the package in a spread on a sheet of paper. </p><p>  Now you need to draw horizontal lines.  For the first, about 3-4 cm should be retreated from the top of the sheet. From this line we measure the distance equal to the height of the packet, and put marks for the next, where there will be a bottom.  Its size depends on the width that the paper bag has.  The diagram below shows what the finished layout should look like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="package paper scheme" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27896/665798.jpg" width="527"></div>

To do this, glue or adhesive tape is applied to a small vertical strip on the left side.  The right edge is glued to it.  When working with glue, be sure to ensure that it does not protrude on the front of the package. </p><p>  Next, we make bends along all vertical lines.  On the sides you need to make the bend exactly in the middle.  After that, we bend the upper line and, having straightened the workpiece, we fill the upper part inward. </p><p>  It remains to make the bottom of the paper bag with your own hands.  We cut out a rectangle from cardboard, which in size will correspond to the bottom.  We make a fold along the line that is at the bottom of the package, and open it.  We put a piece of cardboard inside and apply a little glue to its middle.  First, lay the short sides, and then the long ones.  Coat the edges with glue and iron the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper bag" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/668038.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Making pens for the bag </h2><p>  Most often, handles for paper bags are made of decorative lace, but you can use <span>satin ribbons,</span> braid or other materials.  The main thing is that they be durable.  It is necessary to cut two pieces of cord of the same size.  Their edges are recommended to lightly singe, so that they do not bloom. </p><p>  Now you need to punch holes into which the handles will be inserted.  To make the bag more durable, glue the strips of cardboard under the bent top.  Using a grommet machine, two holes should be made on the front and back sides of the bag, breaking through paper with cardboard.  Holes should be located in the place where you plan to mount the handles.  If there is no machine for eyelets, you can make holes with a hole punch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper bag" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27896/665801.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It remains to insert the handles.  Thread a lace or ribbon through both holes located on one side of the bag.  At the ends we tie knots in such a way that they are on the inside.  That's all, a paper bag is made by hand. </p><h2>  Additional decor </h2><p>  Bags can be decorated with any improvised means and materials.  It can be various applications cut out of colored paper, bows, buttons and even dry leaves.  In this case, it all depends on your imagination.  In general, the manufacture of paper bags is a creative process and requires an appropriate approach. </p><p>  In addition to decorating the package itself, you can come up with unusual pens.  They can also be from any suitable material.  You can not insert the handles at all, but simply wrap the top of the bag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper bag making" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27896/665800.jpg" width="400"></div>
