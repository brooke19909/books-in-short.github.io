Especially those with good screen resolution.  For example, Lenovo A7600.  10.1 inches allow you to watch movies and videos, surf the Internet and communicate on social networks without straining your eyesight.  But this is not all that distinguishes the tablet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo a7600" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In its price category (8-11 thousand rubles), the Lenovo A7600 stands out for its design.  Firstly, his back panel is rubberized.  And this allows you to conveniently hold the device in your hands, not being afraid that it will slip out with careless movement.  It is noteworthy that the back panel is really rubberized, so many owners think that the tablet is very pleasant to the touch.  And there are almost no traces on it. </p><p>  Secondly, the tablet itself is made of high-quality plastic, which does not creak, does not play.  This creates the feeling of a monolithic product in the hands, since the upper glass (without <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> unfortunately) smoothly "spreads" over the device.  There are no gaps between the screen and the side faces. </p><p>  Thirdly, the tablet‚Äôs spread is landscape.  For a diagonal of 10.1 inches, this is the most optimal and convenient option.  Two cameras (external and front) are tailored precisely to landscape screen orientation.  Which also adds convenience when using the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet selection by parameters" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048969.jpg" width="600"></div>

If only because the devices were originally designed not for this.  <span>The front camera</span> of the Lenovo A7600 is presented with a resolution of 2 megapixels.  Not the best, but for a tablet this is enough to communicate via video.  The external camera acquired a resolution of 5 megapixels, which is also enough to make good photos in good light.  Autofocus is not provided for the tablet, but this is not the main thing in devices of this kind. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the main advantage, despite the small resolution of 1280x800 pixels.  Viewing angles and brightness make the Lenovo A7600 tablet really cool even with such a screen.  Firstly, even when installed on a book-case, the device does not lose its clarity.  Everything is visible in the same way as in direct viewing.  Secondly, in bright sunlight, the brightness of the screen is not lost, like many models in this price category.  Everything is clearly visible, which is very important in the summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet software" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  There are not so many of them.  It is important to familiarize yourself with them with those who choose the tablet according to the parameters.  So, for example, there is a microUSB connector, which is also a USB host.  What does it mean?  This means that the tablet supports the work of additional accessories.  For example, a removable USB flash drive with a microUSB connector.  Or any other device through a special adapter.  There is also an output for standard size 3.5 mm headphones.  But the video output is not provided by the manufacturer, so connecting the tablet to the TV will not work.  A microSD card slot is present, which allows you to increase the internal memory up to 32 GB.  Unfortunately, a larger volume is not supported.  The internal memory is 16 GB, of which only 14 GB is available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo a7600 price" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048967.jpg" width="551"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Speakers and sound </h2><p>  Two speakers are located on the front side of the tablet, which provides sound to the user, not from him.  But when using it, many owners noted that one of the speakers periodically turns out to be covered with fingers, which degrades the sound.  The latter, by the way, is not too good: there is not enough bass.  Therefore, some tracks do not sound very interesting.  And sometimes even flat and dull.  But good headphones can fix the situation, the main thing is that they have bass and the ability to control the equalizer.  In this case, even game explosions and pops will seem deafening and realistic. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The manufacturer installed Android 4.2 on the tablet.  For 2015, this is a fairly outdated system, although stable.  If desired, the user can independently upgrade the device to a more modern version or <span>flash it.</span>  <span>The firmware</span> can be found on the official website of the manufacturer.  Programs for the tablet will have to be installed from the "Play Store", although some are already pre-installed.  For example, Skype or Kingston Office.  You don‚Äôt have to download them already, you can safely use it.  Some tablet programs can slow down slightly if you do not upgrade the operating system to a more recent version.  This should be considered in advance, even before installation.  It is recommended to update the system immediately after purchase, so that using the tablet brings only pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo a7600 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048966.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  It depends on him how well the device will pull games and programs, how stable it will work.  And here, it should be noted, everything is not so bad for a budget model.  <span>The</span> 1.3 GHz <span>Mediatek MT8121</span> - although standard for many, is pretty good.  Firstly, all games (even WoT) work without lags and brakes.  Secondly, when playing videos in both online and offline mode, no noticeable minuses are noted.  Everything works clearly and smoothly.  Nevertheless, among budget models, the tablet loses slightly to those with a more advanced processor (for example, Qualcomm).  On the other hand, the price of devices with such color rendition and screen will be different.  Here, Lenovo A7600 wins against its competitors. </p><h2>  Owner opinions </h2><p>  Budget ten-inch tablet ‚ÄúLenovo A7600‚Äù, reviews of which are mostly positive, is popular.  And this is due to the fact that his price is relatively small.  And the tablet pulls, according to reviews, and heavy toys, and good programs.  Not to mention the fact that it is convenient to watch movies and surf the Internet on it.  Vision does not suffer, everything is convenient to watch.  The only thing that confuses users somewhat is the random scrolling instead of touching on the screen.  The sensitivity is so strong on the display that gestures are recognized a little distorted. </p><p>  Another thing that does not suit the owners too much is the battery.  Despite the fact that its volume is 6340 mAh, this is still not enough.  IPS matrix requires too much.  Especially if you set all the settings to maximum.  On average, a tablet can work for about six hours, and in standby mode, up to fifty hours. </p><p>  The camera on tablets is generally not considered a key aspect, since in most models it remains not the best.  What is frontal, what is main (external).  ‚ÄúLenovo A7600‚Äù, the price of which is relatively low, deserves the attention of those who are looking for a decent and inexpensive large model for games, watching social networks and movies, communicating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo a7600 n tablet" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1048965.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  3G version </h2><p>  The version described above supported only the Wi-Fi communication standard.  And this creates certain difficulties when using the device where there is no free wireless Internet.  It is noteworthy that there is also a version with 3G.  Manufacturers took care of this.  The Lenovo A7600 N tablet has a SIM card slot.  Standard size, no trim needed.  The stability of the signal depends on which operator is used, since the coverage area is different for everyone.  And the quality of communication, too.  In general, the 3G model does not differ from the previous version, the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù remains exactly the same, but the price is slightly higher: mobility requires investment.  Therefore, the version with a SIM card slot came out three thousand rubles more expensive than the same only with wireless Internet (Wi-Fi). </p>
