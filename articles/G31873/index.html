Regardless of which one is chosen, the result depends mainly on the efforts made, the ability to handle the material and perseverance.  When it comes to children's creativity, it is necessary to use the simplest options.  For example, carving a horse along a contour created using a stencil.  Older children and adults will surely like origami or papier-m√¢ch√©.  An application can interest a person of absolutely any age. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper cut horse" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/340471.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Horse cutting paper </h2><p>  This, at first glance, the simplest way allows you to create flat animal figures that can be further used to form various compositions on any background.  If you use cardboard or another dense <span>type of paper</span> as the starting material <span>,</span> then you get very funny toys for children. </p><p>  A horse template made of paper can be taken, for example, from a children's book.  It is transferred to cardboard with a simple pencil, and then with the help of scissors and a <span>clerical knife, the</span> figure <span>is</span> carefully cut out. </p><p>  If you choose a complex option, in which there will be not just a silhouette, but an ornament inside the figure, then it will not be so simple to create it.  For this, in addition to scissors, you will need a sharp clerical knife and a substrate for work.  And the resulting figure will be a real work of art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Applique </h2><p>  Another, no less interesting option for working with paper is to create a mosaic.  First, on the selected <span>background (plain</span> or color) you need to draw a horse silhouette.  And then fill it with small fragments, sticking them. </p><p>  Application can be performed from small multi-colored pieces or using larger parts, cutting them out of colored paper (body, legs, tail, mane, hooves).  Small elements (eyes, nose) are usually drawn with a marker or felt-tip pen.  The resulting horse paper panel is framed, covered with glass (optional), and an excellent souvenir is obtained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper horse pattern" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/340583.jpg?1392987188189" width="340"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Origami </h2><p>  This ancient Japanese technique allows you to create animals, flowers, people and fictional characters.  The principle is that work is carried out with a single sheet of paper, which is folded according to a certain pattern.  For those who have never made origami out of paper, creating a horse will not be easy.  This figure is considered complex.  To create it, you will have to do several dozen operations. </p><p>  Therefore, beginners are recommended to either start from the head of the animal, which is obtained as a result of several simple manipulations, or with a simplified form.  It does not really resemble a horse, but rather an unprecedented beast.  But for a start it will be very good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once the head or a simplified silhouette is obtained, you can begin to create a recognizable horse shape from paper using the origami technique.  Animals made this way are surprisingly resilient.  So it‚Äôs quite possible to expose them on some flat surface so that you can admire the result of your own creativity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origami paper horse" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/340466.jpg?1392987236180" width="450"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Papier mache </h2><p>  This is the most painstaking technique.  But with its help create real, durable souvenirs.  They are subsequently covered with acrylic paints and the pattern is fixed with varnish.  Papier-mache, in addition to the paper itself, requires the presence of glue (paste, PVA or other). </p><p>  First, a horse frame is made of wire, slivers or other dense material.  It can be sketchy and used to create several different animals.  Then it is pasted over either with small pieces of paper, dipping them in PVA (paste), or they work with the finished mass according to the principle of creating a sculpture. </p><p>  It is created by soaking paper in water (or even boiling it).  Then the resulting slurry is squeezed and diluted with glue to the consistency of the test.  It turns out pretty docile mass.  She is wrapped around the frame, forming the shape of a horse.  It will be easier to create it from paper, but a more natural object is obtained from the mixture.  Of course, small details (ears, face) of an unprepared person will not be easy to fashion.  But over time, everything will surely work out.  Having painted the figure bright and unusual, you can create a variety of funny horses.  Painting should be started only after the paper has completely dried. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  In addition to the described techniques, a horse can be created in a simpler way.  In particular, when it comes to children's creativity, a sheet of paper, scissors, pencils and glue will be enough for work. </p>

The body is made of a paper cylinder.  As a blank for him draw a rectangle and shade with pencils.  Then scissors cut out each element.  The square is rolled up by gluing the edges.  Head and legs are attached to it.  It turns out a funny horse figure.  Of course, it is not very similar to a living one, but even a preschooler can perform such a composition.
