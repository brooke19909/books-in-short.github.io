    <p>  Food is always enough, it is fresh and tasty.  Those who are going to Phuket for the first time should not even worry about food, having heard the stories that they serve only beetles and worms.  This is utter nonsense.  In all restaurants and hotels the food is normal and does not differ from the standard set of any resort. </p><p>  Not far from Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * (Phuket) there are local restaurants where you can have a tasty and inexpensive dinner and lunch.  Here you can find dishes for every taste.  There are even Russian establishments where you can order kebabs and okroshka. </p><p>  The main restaurant of the Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * hotel (Phuket) offers many wonderful dishes.  In the evenings, live music is played here, theme nights are organized for guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Rim Hama (Restaurant) serves <span>Thai specialties</span> with many spices.  This establishment works from lunch until late at night, but the most romantic atmosphere is observed in the evening, when special lighting is turned on. </p><p>  The Drift Beach Bar is in the open.  Sitting on the sofa, you can enjoy the ocean.  Here, at any time you will be treated to delicious cocktails. </p><p>  "Brazier" - a restaurant that prepares for visitors a lot of seafood, steaks and other variations of the barbecue.

The amphitheater organizes shows and discos in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arinara bangtao beach resort 4 phuket" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439978.jpg" width="500"></div>

Right next to the complex is a city beach with beautiful fine sand.  Bang Tao Beach is one of the longest <span>beaches in Phuket,</span> its length is more than seven kilometers.  It is on its territory that there are hotels located on the first line.  There is no road between the Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * hotel <span>(Thailand, Phuket)</span> and the coast, which is very convenient.  From the complex you immediately get to the beach.  On the shore there is a lot of space and spacious, few people.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid (200 baht). </p><p>  The bathing approach is gentle and comfortable, the water is warm, but often muddy and with algae.  The beach is pretty clean, but algae are rarely cleaned.  However, this is not the hotel's fault, since the coast is municipal. </p><p>  Nearby there is the beach of a neighboring hotel, there are practically no people on it in the daytime, so those who seek solitude can safely take advantage of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 photo gallery" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439977.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * boasts a pool with various exotic fish, which children love to feed.  Such entertainment does not bother them. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Those who chose Phuket and Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * (Thailand) as their vacation destination should definitely think about what sights are worth seeing.  Phuket is a rather large island, there are many interesting places and attractions.  These are natural beauties - mountains, waterfalls, bays, wild jungles and nature reserves - and cultural, historical monuments - museums, temples.  Any tourist will be able to find something interesting for himself. </p><p>  But how to get to the sights?  There are only two options: you need to rent a transport, call a taxi or buy an excursion.  You should not rely on public transport, since it is poorly developed on the island.  You will simply lose a lot of time and will not see anything.  It‚Äôs quite convenient to purchase sightseeing tours, which are distributed by many agencies, and go on a trip as part of a group.  In addition, you need to understand that many attractions are not located on the island itself, but on the mainland or the nearest islands.  It is easier to get to such places by an excursion group. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  The Talang Museum (national) will tell tourists about the history of Thailand and its modern realities.  Six rooms are dedicated to various periods in the life of the country. </p><p>  No less interesting is the museum of sea shells, which contains an incredible number of all kinds of shells, more than twenty thousand. </p><p>  The statue of the Big Buddha at an altitude of more than 370 meters is especially popular among tourists.  This attraction is still under construction, but there are always a lot of people around it.  The height of the statue is forty-five meters, it is perfectly visible from the southern beaches.  At the moment, this is the most popular and visited local attraction, which is certainly worth a visit.  Near the statue there is a temple, an observation deck, which offers a beautiful landscape of the island.  The size of the statue itself and breathtaking views are very impressive. </p><p>  Chalong is the temple complex, the most important on the whole island.  It is a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists.  Here is a large shrine - the bone of the Buddha.  It is located in the sarcophagus and is available for viewing by people.  Once a year, a huge fair is held in the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arinara hotel Bangtao beach resort 4 tours" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439974.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Near the <span>beach of Kata</span> Noi there is an observation deck Karon.  It offers a unique view of three large beaches: Kata Noi, Kata and Karon.  Numerous guests come here to meet the sunset, because it is here that the sun hides beyond the horizon. </p><p>  Khao Phra Thaeo National Park is a nature reserve that preserves the wild jungle.  Here in natural wild conditions live gibbons, wild boars, monkeys, bears, more than a hundred species of birds.  The park has the largest waterfall on the island. </p><p>  It is believed that while relaxing on the island, you definitely need to visit the Similian Islands.  They are located off the coast of Thailand, in the <span>Andaman Sea.</span>  All nine islands are included in the national park of the country.  They are called a paradise.  Experts say that here are the best places for diving and the best beaches. </p><p>  Younger tourists will love the Phuket Zoo.  He is really amazing, only tickets to him are expensive.  Here you can see crocodiles, butterflies, birds.  A special delight in people is the park of beautiful orchids and an aquarium.  In the zoo you can not only admire wild animals, but also watch shows with their participation.  During such programs, animals do amazing things.  All this is worth a look. </p><p>  In the <span>aquarium of Phuket,</span> you can see hundreds of inhabitants of the deep sea.  And the butterfly garden will simply amaze you and your children with an incredible amount of insects.  The park is recognized as one of the best in the world.  More than forty species of butterflies and many bugs, grasshoppers, bees, dragonflies, flies live here. </p><p>  But the botanical garden is a new place that was opened in 2011.  Here, under the open sky, many tropical plants and animals are collected.  There is also an orchid park, theme gardens, palm grove, orchards, cacti, exotic butterflies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arinara bangtao beach resort 4 hotel description" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439973.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  There are several bird parks on the island, which are home to more than a thousand species of birds brought from different continents. </p><p>  The famous Phuket Fantasy Park is one of the most important entertainment complexes.  It is definitely a must visit.  This is a small Thai city in which its own life flows, has its own culture and history.  Bright events are held here daily.  We can say that this is a family attraction filled with a variety of games, shops, carousels with Thai motifs. </p><p>  The vast territory is divided into three parts.  The first zone hosts half-hour shows for adults and children.  In the second there is a restaurant.  And in the third part is the "Palace of the Elephants."  The park is somewhat reminiscent of Disneyland, only it is made on the basis of Thai culture. </p><p>  We have listed only some of the attractions that are in Phuket, in fact there are many more.  For one trip, do not review everyone. </p><h2>  Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who visited Phuket.  Is Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * really so good?  Tours offered by companies are sometimes so diverse that it is difficult for tourists to opt for something.  It is reviews that play a big role in the final choice of tourists. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * hotel, the photo of which will not leave anyone indifferent, is quite good for a family holiday.  There are always a lot of kids.  The hotel has a beautiful well-groomed area, on which there is a lot of greenery and there are no yellowing plants at all.  It can be seen that the attendants are watching this. </p><p>  The rooms at the hotel are quite spacious.  Half of them have their own access to the pool, it is very convenient and practical.  Very nice apartments with internal sliding partitions, this option is perfect for couples with kids. </p><p>  Room cleaning is done regularly and fairly high quality.  The staff is very good-natured and helpful.  A lot of Chinese and other foreigners have a rest at the hotel, and there are few of our compatriots.  The atmosphere is quiet and calm.  The hotel has a pronounced family orientation.  Lovers of parties and noisy parties here will probably be bored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 photos" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439991.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 *, reviews of which we are reviewing, operates on an all-inclusive system.  According to holidaymakers, the food in the hotel is good, the chef prepares delicious European and local dishes.  Even with food, the kids have no problems. </p><h2>  Infrastructure Reviews </h2><p>  Around the hotel there are local cafes where you can have a tasty meal at very reasonable prices.  Here you can find several Russian institutions with traditional dishes.  Therefore, those who only have breakfast at the hotel may well eat in the nearest cafes. </p><p>  But as for adult animation, it is not enough at the hotel.  They work well with children, but there are practically no evening shows for parents.  In general, the hotel has a quiet and calm atmosphere.  As an entertainment, tourists go on excursions, since there are many beautiful places and attractions in Phuket.  However, experienced vacationers recommend being careful with the choice of tour operators, since not all of them are conscientious and honest.  As a rule, some try to make money on tourists, including unnecessary insurance or other tricks in the cost of excursions. </p><p>  Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * (reviews confirm this) has an excellent location, being on the beach.  Here is a convenient entrance to the water.  The entire coast is covered with the finest white sand.  Sunbathing and swimming here is a pleasure.  To admire the most beautiful exotic landscapes and splash in the ocean, you should definitely visit the sights of Phuket.  As a rule, tourists are very pleased with sightseeing tours. </p><p>  The hotel is located a bit far from infrastructure, so you can‚Äôt count on many establishments around it.  More precisely, they are, but not so many, as if the hotel was located in a big city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel arinara bangtao beach resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1439992.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  While relaxing at the hotel, you don‚Äôt notice the language barrier, there is always a staff who speaks Russian, so knowledge of English, in principle, is not necessary.  At the hotel, cosmetics are replenished daily, and a separate set is also issued for a child.  Towels are also changed every day. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Arinara Bangtao Beach Resort 4 * (reviews will help you make the right choice) is a perfectly acceptable place to stay in Thailand.  There is an excellent price-quality ratio.  In general, it should be noted that the hotel by the standards of Thailand has a very good number of rooms and a normal level of service.  Therefore, this hotel may well be considered as an option for relaxation. </p>
