Knowing what contribution he made to the development of science, one involuntarily comes to the idea that he had to devote himself entirely to the study of chemistry.  However, if you get a closer look at his biography, it becomes clear that this is completely not so.  Moreover, Mendeleev‚Äôs hobbies were very far from his usual world, although they affected science to some extent. </p>

    <h2>  A man who knows how to make suitcases </h2><p>  Around the <span>famous chemist</span> there were always a lot of ridiculous rumors and conjectures.  So, having heard the question of what kind of hobby Mendeleev had, most people immediately answered - suitcases.  However, they without a shadow of doubt believe that this was indeed one of his greatest passions in life.  However, the truth is that this was far from the main hobby of Mendeleev.  Simply, being in Simferopol, he found himself in a situation where he had nothing to do.  At that moment, his gymnasium was temporarily closed due to the outbreak of the Crimean War, and no other work was forecast in the near future. </p><p>  Therefore, the <span>great chemist</span> decided to make some money by gluing cardboard suitcases.  Noteworthy here is that his creations were to the liking of customers.  Thanks to this, he even got the nickname "Master of Suitcases."  Therefore, you should not believe that this activity was Mendeleev‚Äôs main hobby.  In his free time, he was engaged in other things that aroused much more interest and inspiration in him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Genuine craving for art </h2><p>  For some reason, there is an opinion that people working in the world of exact sciences are passionless in relation to works of art.  This is pure fiction.  And the second hobby of Mendeleev is a vivid confirmation of this.  So, at the age of fifty, Dmitry Ivanovich discovers the amazing world of art.  According to him, he himself did not expect his heart to beat so anxiously at the sight of the grace of the artists' works. </p><p>  Therefore, since 1880, Mendeleev began to collect the most successful, in his opinion, paintings.  At the same time, he appreciated the work of his compatriots much more than gifts brought from abroad.  Such a passion led to the fact that in 1894 he was elected a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts.  In addition, thanks to a hobby, Dmitry Mendeleev gets acquainted with Repin.  And this friendship leads to the fact that the gifted artist draws a portrait of an equally gifted chemist. </p>

    <h2>  Under the "brand" of Mendeleev </h2><p>  Another funny hobby of Mendeleev was that he sewed clothes.  Naturally, he did this not every day, but quite often.  The hobby could be explained by the fact that the chemist had an exceptional designer taste, as well as a completely logical need for quality clothes.  But that is far from all.  It is known that Mendeleev participated in the creation of the Yermak icebreaker.  In particular, it was he and his colleagues who were engaged in the development of drawings and the appearance of the vessel.  Therefore, we can safely say that this pride of Russia was also designed according to the design of Dmitry Ivanovich. </p>

    <h2>  The scientist‚Äôs great passion </h2><p>  If all the previous hobbies were just hobbies, then the chemist's next passion can be safely called a matter of his whole life.  From an early age, Dmitry Mendeleev dreamed that he would someday rise in the sky.  Therefore, he devoted a lot of time to the study of aerodynamics and mechanics.  And his dream came true.  In 1887, he first flew in a balloon.  The event, which occurred on the day of the solar eclipse, marked a new stage in the world of balloons.  In addition, the scientist‚Äôs feat was appreciated by the French Academy of Aeronautics.  He was even awarded a diploma on which the inscription proudly appeared: "For the courage shown during the flight to observe the solar eclipse." </p>
