    <p>  One of the most popular trips is visiting Santo Domingo.  This is the most famous and ancient city of America, which was founded in 1496 by the brother of Columbus.  This is where the history of the New World began. </p><p>  During the walk, tourists can see modern Santo Domingo, the presidential palace, the colonial city, which is declared a UNESCO heritage. </p><p>  Gourmets should definitely go to the small fishing village of El Cortecito, located next to Punta Cana.  She is known for her restaurants serving dishes made from freshly caught fish. </p><p>  For guests of the country it will be very interesting to visit the show ‚ÄúTrocalissimo‚Äù.  This is the most famous show throughout the Dominican Republic. </p><p>  Among the tourists, the Costa del Barn area is popular, which translates as "amber coast".  This place is famous for amber deposits.  Here you can also see the ruins of the house of Columbus, the church of San Felipe. </p><p>  One of the main <span>attractions of the Dominican Republic</span> is the lighthouse of Columbus.  However, this is not the lighthouse that would be customary to see on the seashore.  This is a museum that stores the remains of the great navigator.  The building is completely unlike a lighthouse, in shape it resembles a cross and is made of white marble. </p><p>  Of interest to visitors is not the building itself, but those artifacts that are stored within its walls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel luxury bahia principe ambar 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1437269.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You definitely need to see the A. Bermudez National Park, which was created in 1956.  It is located in the center of the island in the province of Santiago.  The park is bordered by other reserves.  It is here that the three highest peaks of the Dominican Republic are located.  In addition, the twelve most important rivers of the country originate here.  Deep gorges, alpine meadows, fast rivers, beautiful landscapes attract many connoisseurs of natural beauty.  For fans of extreme sports there are also entertainment, for example, to climb the Duarte peak.  And for naturalist photographers, this region is just a real find, because an endless number of amazing birds live in the local jungle. </p><p>  The local relief features created a large number of stunning landscapes.  The foothills of the mountains are richest in vegetation, which led to the formation of real jungle.  Cedars, palm trees, creepers, juniper, almonds, mahogany, dates, olive, ebony grow here. </p><p>  But a national park called Los Aities will be appreciated by ecotourism fans.  It was created in 1976 and is located on the Saman Peninsula.  The park is covered with mangrove swamps, cotton and palm trees, beautiful green islands and mysterious caves with ancient rock inscriptions.  The peculiarity of this place is a unique alternation of sections of wild untouched nature with a landscaped area with good infrastructure (restaurants, hotels, bars). </p><p>  In the south of the Pedernales Peninsula, the Haragua National Reserve is located.  This is the largest park in the Caribbean.  He is famous for the fact that turtles have been living on its islands for a long time to extend the genus.  They need local desert beaches in order to bury masonry in the sand.  Turtles living in the reserve are rare species and are protected by law. </p><p>  Samana Peninsula attracts lovers of lonely relaxation.  Here, untouched nature is everywhere (clean rivers, coconut groves, caves and waterfalls) and desert beaches.  And in the sea waves you can see manatees and dolphins, in January and March - even humpback whales. </p><h2>  Hotel Luxury Bahia Principe Ambar 5 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  To have a complete picture of the hotel, you need to refer to the reviews.  What do tourists who have visited Luxury Bahia Principe Ambar 5 * think?  Description of the hotel indicates the availability of luxury apartments.  Is it really? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel luxury bahia principe ambar 5 photos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1437274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Indeed, the rooms of the complex are spacious and good, with appropriate equipment.  The bathroom has a shower and jacuzzi, cosmetics and bathrobes.  The apartments are cleaned daily and very high quality.  Towels also change every day. </p><p>  The territory of the complex is not just large, it is huge.  Electric cars run on it, on which you can drive up.  The Ambar Hotel is conveniently located, of all the buildings in the complex it is closest to the ocean.  And there are also such buildings from which it takes quite a long walk to the sea or you need to drive up.  The beach is something amazing and incredible.  It is very large, if not huge.  It has free sunbeds, umbrellas.  In addition, beautiful palm trees grow throughout the coast.  Therefore, there are no problems on the beach because of the shade, everyone has enough space.  The beach bar staff offers cocktails.  The ocean is very warm (29 degrees), but there is always a wave, you need to get used to it.  The coast is so beautiful, just paradise.  Nature here has created unique landscapes. </p><p>  I would like to note that the hotel has some peculiarity: only adults (adults) can rest in Luxury Bahia Principe Ambar Blue 5 *.  Guest reviews confirm this fact.  Apparently, this is some kind of hotel feature. </p><p>  But with regard to food, the tourists are very satisfied.  The buffet menu changes daily.  The chef prepares a large number of dishes.  On the tables you can see a lot of seafood.  Sometimes, they even serve lobsters.  The menu includes a variety of fruits.  In general, tables are full of abundance.  The only negative in the diet is the service.  Locals are not very quick.  They got used to calmly, without haste to move around and at the same time to hum something to themselves.  In the same style, they serve guests.  Well, apparently, they do not know how otherwise.  But this does not interfere at all; on the contrary, their pacified state raises their spirits. </p><p>  On the territory there are many pools.  All of them are clean and beautiful, it is nice to plunge into them, but spending a lot of time around them is not worth it, since such a beautiful ocean makes noise nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luxury bahia principe ambar 5 hotel dominican republic" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1437276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some tourists point out that it was difficult to schedule dinner at the √† la carte restaurant (the administration says there are no places).  And the food in it was not as tasty as in the main hall.  Guests of the Luxury Bahia Principe Ambar Blue 5 * hotel (reviews of tourists are given in the article) can use the facilities of the entire huge complex.  But the residents of other hotels in the chain cannot visit Ambar restaurants and a spa complex. </p><p>  Spa treatments are something to treat yourself to, especially since their price is included in the price.  Employees offer especially interesting programs for couples in love (romantic massage, etc.).  Therefore, it is certainly worth a visit to this place. </p><p> Dominican Republic is a beautiful country with exotic tropical landscapes.  Local guides offer many excursions and entertainment.  If you want to see a little island, then you should take more money, because the tours here are expensive.  So, for example, a trip to San Domingo will cost at least eighty-five dollars per person, the rest of the trip more than a hundred dollars.  Experienced vacationers are certainly advised not to spare money and ride a helicopter over the coast.  In their opinion, these are simply unforgettable impressions.  Tourists love to visit local national parks, which boast sites of untouched nature.  In general, the Dominican Republic has something to see. </p><p>  But to go outside the hotel is not recommended on your own, so as not to become victims of local criminals.  For trips, it is better to book sightseeing tours with local guides, which are offered by the hotel staff at the reception. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Ambar 5 * is a good place for a romantic getaway for adults.  Beautiful spacious rooms, well-groomed territory and, of course, endless white beaches and the ocean will create an unforgettable experience.  If you dream of a vacation on the exotic coast, then here you are. </p>
