    <h2>  Zvenigorod </h2><p>  There are many versions about the origin of its name.  The most common one was associated with bells.  It is them that Zvenigorod has long been famous for.  In the chronicles it is said that the ringing of the bell, especially the Great Evangelical, was heard even in Moscow, which is sixty kilometers away.  According to another version, this signal always warned residents about a fire.  There is another opinion according to which Zvenigorod is so named after the numerous streams located on its territory that ring everywhere.  Against the backdrop of such beautiful assumptions, one more version is not perceived in any way: supposedly earlier pigs were bred here in every yard, and therefore the settlement was called Pig Town, and over time the name was transformed into Zvenigorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery is rightfully considered the first place that tourists are invited to see.

    <p>  The Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery was built on a hill at the confluence of the Storozhka tributary into the Moscow River.  It was founded in the middle of the fourteenth century by the Monk Savva at the behest of Yuri Dmitrievich - heir to Prince Dmitry Donskoy.  The complex has recently been completely restored, and today it is considered operational. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Some experts argue that it was thanks to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich that the Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery (Zvenigorod) received the status of the first Russian laurel, both in importance and in terms, and only then the Trinity-Sergius and Kiev-Pechersk Convents were awarded the same title. .  At first, a wooden church was built in honor of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The main transport route to the west from Moscow to Zvenigorod was chosen as a place for it.  The Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery became the place where its founder, the monk Savva, a follower of St. Sergius of Radonezh, sought solitude.  To this end, he even dug up a small cave, spending many hours in it in prayer. </p>

    <p>  At first, the monastery was small in number of flocks and in area.  However, when over time the monks began to increase in number, the Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery in Zvenigorod expanded territorially. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Zvenigorod has many interesting architectural monuments.  The Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery is the main one.  The reason is that this complex, built many centuries ago, stands on a hill and, as it were, rises above the rest of the sights.  Its dominant is considered the Nativity Cathedral.  Interesting architectural solutions typical of the seventeenth century are presented in the bell tower and the royal chambers. </p><p>  The Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery in Zvenigorod is painted by thirty icon painters.  Church of the Nativity of the Virgin - a unique monument of monumental painting.  The surviving fragments of the earliest paintings of its walls date back to the fifteenth century and belong to masters from the circle of Andrei Rublev.  Disclosure of the painting layer and work to save the most ancient paintings of the cathedral, for example, the altar barrier, was carried out by restorers of the highest category, including Bryafgin and Burov.  Under the guidance of the latter and the technology developed by him, it was possible to remove the painting from the internal galleries from the completely corrupted state, the Savvinsky side chapel and its vestibule, which the Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery in Zvenigorod is proud of today, were also restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=", Zvenigorod attractions Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/995654.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Worship services </h2><p>  One of the main shrines of this temple of God is the relics of the Monk Savva.  It was he who founded the Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery (Zvenigorod).  The schedule of services here is compiled twice a month.  A public prayer service is held at six in the morning, the Divine Liturgy and Akathist according to the Monk Savva of Storozhevsky are held at 7.45, and Vespers and Matins at seventeen.  The rector of the Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery is His Holiness Moscow Patriarch Kirill, and the governor is Archimandrite Savva. </p><p>  One of the main aspects of the ministry of this monastery was the creation of a spiritual school under it.  This tradition dates back to 1775, when, by decree of Catherine the Second, a lower seminary was founded here.  She was subsequently transformed into a spiritual school, which has four classes.  Pupils of the monastery are not only teachers, mentors or clergy.  Many representatives of the episcopate came out of the walls of the seminary. </p>
