It was founded by Polish Jews in 1890 as an agricultural commune.  It got its name in honor of the deep well dug out by the biblical character Isaac, symbolizing the fertility of the area and the vast expanses that once surrounded the 135 thousandth city. </p><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  Rehovot in Israel was founded in 1890 by Polish Jews of the first wave of immigrants to the "Holy Land" who fled from pogroms in Tsarist Russia.  Refugees bought a wasteland, dug a 23-meter well, the water from which they began to use to irrigate the surrounding lands.  As a result, a commune was founded where agricultural products were grown.  At an early stage, the settlement consisted of two parallel streets. </p><p>  In 1904, a large citrus grove was laid, a stable, a packaging factory were built, an irrigation system was established.  Water flowed into the irrigation pool through the aqueduct, and from there through the canal system into the fields.  This allowed the expansion of vineyards and almond orchards.  In 1908, a program for the resettlement of emigrants was launched.  The first families from Yemen arrived in Rehovot, and later from Ethiopia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jacob_Street.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central District of Israel" class="if uuid-2484731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2484731.jpg"></div><h2>  Today </h2><p>  Many tourists purchasing permits to Israel visit the city on the way to Tel Aviv.
