    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  I immediately want to note that this hotel, located in the Bulgarian Golden Sands, is often confused with the Strandja 3 * hotel of the same name (Sunny Beach).  Meanwhile, apart from the name and location on the Black Sea, these establishments have nothing in common.  The distance between Strandja (Golden Sands) and Strandja (Sunny Beach) 3 * is more than a hundred kilometers.  As for the hotel under consideration, it was built a long time ago.  Several years ago, large-scale repair work was carried out here, so today the hotel meets its guests with updated rooms equipped with everything necessary.  It consists of two three-story buildings connected by a hall and a restaurant.  In total, the hotel has 110 rooms.  Among them are both standard rooms and studios and apartments.  It offers guests a restaurant, bar, pool, a terrace for sunbathing, sports fields, a picturesque garden and playgrounds.  This hotel is suitable for an excellent holiday for all categories of guests. </p><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the housing stock of the Strandja 3 * hotel (Bulgaria) is located in two three-story buildings.  In total there are 110 rooms in the following categories: standard rooms (maximum accommodation 2 + 1, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã14 square meters), studios (maximum can accommodate 2 + 3 guests, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã35 square meters) and one-bedroom apartments (maximum accommodation - 2 + 3 people, area 35 sq. Meters). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Hotel Strandja (Chaika) 3 * is located on the second coastline and does not have its own beach.  Previously, on the way from the hotel to the sea, vacationers had to overcome the roadway.  However, several years ago, this area was made exclusively pedestrian, which only added peace and comfort to tourists who came to this resort.  As for the beaches, they are mainly municipal.  Therefore, for the use of sun loungers and parasols, as well as other beach equipment, you will need to pay.  The beaches here are mostly sandy, but stones can be encountered when entering the water, so you should be careful and watch out for the children. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In addition to a beach holiday, Strandja 3 * guests can have a great time at the hotel's pool.  It is open and large enough.  There is also a section for the youngest tourists.  Near the pool there is a sun terrace with plenty of sun loungers and parasols.  While sunbathing, you can enjoy a drink at the bar. </p><p>  At the height of the tourist season, the hotel has animators.  They will offer you to do water aerobics, take part in funny contests, play boccia, futsal or darts.  Also on site you can play billiards, volleyball, tennis, visit the gym or aerobics classes.  Those who wish to relax can have a good time in the local SPA center, where there is a sauna, jacuzzi, massage room and beauty salon.  Please note that some of the listed services are provided for a fee. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  The cost of accommodation at the Strandzha Hotel (Golden Sands) is consistent with the services provided here and the level of starryness.  So, a day of staying here for an adult guest in high season (July-August) will cost 20 euros (double standard room, type of food - breakfast only), 23 euro (studio, type of food - breakfast only), 32 euro ( standard room, all inclusive) and 35 euros (studio, all inclusive).  In other months, the price of accommodation will be slightly lower. </p><h2>  Strandja 3 * (Golden Sands): reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more complete picture of the Bulgarian Strandzha Hotel, we bring to your attention the opinion of our compatriots who have already stayed here.  In general, we can say that most tourists were quite satisfied with this hotel.  However, they would not recommend choosing it for the elderly, travelers with sore joints and problems of the musculoskeletal system, as well as families with small children.  But let's figure it out in order. </p>

    <p>  As for the location of the hotel, due to the fact that it is located relatively far from the center of Golden Sands, you can relax here in peace and quiet.  In addition, there are noisy roads near the hotel, so you won't be bothered by the sound of passing cars either day or night.  For some tourists, the minus of the Strandja (Golden Sands) 3 * hotel was its remoteness from the sea.  Despite the fact that the distance to the nearest beach is only three hundred meters, you will have to go down rather steep ladders along the way.  In this regard, as already mentioned above, travelers with small children are not recommended to come here, since the constant need to carry the stroller up the stairs can create discomfort.  It will also not be easy for older people and tourists with diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  As for our compatriots, the majority were even happy with such physical exertion, since delicious food at the hotel and large portions have the potential to quickly gain excess weight during the holidays. </p><p>  For the most part, the Russians were also satisfied with the rooms.  So, our compatriots found the rooms quite spacious and well renovated.  Furniture and appliances here, they say, are not new, but in excellent condition.  Some guests were embarrassed by the lack of curtains in the bathroom, which caused a lot of water to fall onto the floor during bathing.  But this trifle can be ignored.  The rooms were cleaned daily, and bed linen was changed a couple of times a week. </p><p>  As for meals in Strandja 3 * (Bulgaria), then its level, of course, can not be compared with hotels with more stars.  However, according to our compatriots, the menu here is quite diverse, and the dishes are delicious and of high quality. </p><p>  Very satisfied with the tourists were the staff of the Strandja hotel.  So, according to our compatriots, all employees without exception are very friendly.  Also pleased with the fact that most of the staff is fluent in Russian.  Therefore, you will not have any language barrier here. </p>
