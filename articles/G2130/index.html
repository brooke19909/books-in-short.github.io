You can, of course, purchase this factory-made product.  But sometimes not only the result is important, but also the process itself, the emotions that you can experience, for example, crocheting shawls.  In this case, you have the opportunity not only to create the product of the desired size, color, but also to control its quality. </p><p>  <span>Crocheting a shawl</span> can be done in various ways.  You can find a very large number of patterns that allow you to crochet this product from the middle to the ends.  Production begins with the formation of a ring of air loops, from which the main pattern then begins to be knotted.  In this case, it turns out that in the middle of the shawl there is a central pattern, around which the main one is tied.  The shawl is formed due to the features of knitting a pattern. </p><p>  If you want you to end up with not only a beautiful, but also a very warm shawl, you can first knit the so-called base of a triangular shape with columns without crochets, which is then complemented by any openwork pattern.  Crocheting a <span>shawl</span> in this case can be done in three ways: </p><p>  1. The openwork pattern is knitted directly along the edge of the shawl.  This can be done not only by crocheting, but also by typing loops with knitting needles.  In the latter case, the lace will look especially gentle; </p><p>  2. The openwork pattern is knitted separately, and then either sewn or joined by arches from air loops to the base.  In the latter case, a specially connected path of air loops can be a beautiful addition to your shawl; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. The openwork canvas is made using the Irish lace technique: various elements (leaves, flowers, stems) are knitted separately by crocheting, which are then connected to each other and the base using an openwork mesh or matching sewing threads.  Such a shawl will look especially impressive. </p><p>  The next way is knitting from the bottom corner.  The formation of the shawl also occurs due to the pattern in which the loops are added along the edges of the future product. </p><p>  Sometimes you can find models that, on the contrary, knitted from top to bottom.  In this case, at first a chain of air loops was dialed equal to the width of the future shawl, and the pattern was knitted from top to bottom. </p><p>  Crocheting a shawl requires certain skills and knowledge.  For example, you need to know that the threads that you buy to make your shawl should contain a minimum amount of acrylic.  It is better if it is 100% wool, mohair or angora for a warm shawl, or 100% cotton for summer.  The more acrylic there is in the threads, the worse the finished product will keep its shape.  The thickness of the threads should be no more than 240 meters per 100 grams.  It is better to knit from thinner yarn (550 m / 100 g).  Otherwise, the finished product will look bulky and rough.  Of these threads, it is better to knit a warm sweater. </p><p>  If you do not know how many threads you will need, navigate as follows.  If you want a very large shawl, then you need to buy at least 600 grams of yarn.  If you plan to make brushes, add another 100 grams.  Remember, the denser the pattern, the more yarn you need. </p><p>  Compared to knitwear, crocheted shawls are unique and airy.  It is very difficult to create so many delicate transitions with the help of knitting needles.  Each shawl is unique and exists in a single copy, because each craftswoman has her own peculiarities of knitting the same patterns. </p><p>  Well, now you know about the basic techniques and methods of knitting this unique female accessory, but you should decide for yourself how to crochet a shawl. </p>
