    <p>  We see that this is a relatively small, low-rise hotel with a pleasant design and colorful landscape surroundings.  It is located really close to the sea, within a few minutes walk.  Infrastructure objects are concentrated on the territory of the complex quite conveniently from the point of view of periodic visits by tourists several times a day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Regarding the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, there are two different methodologies for determining it.  According to the first, it belongs to the region of Ras Um El Sid.  In accordance with another methodology, the hotel complex should be attributed to the Hadaba area.  Therefore, the full coordinates of the location of the hotel in some sources may sound like Royal Grand Sharm Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) Sharm El Sheikh Hadaba.  Many tourists are very impressed with the Hadaba area, and therefore it becomes one of the factors in choosing the hotel complex under consideration.  We will explore the sights of the Hadaba area a little later. </p><p>  In many sources, the hotel is associated primarily with the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula.  Therefore, the name of the hotel may sound like Royal Grand Sharm Resort Sharm El Sheikh South Sinai Egypt. </p>

    <p>  If you examine the comments made by tourists about the rooms - some of them referred to the lack of kettles and utensils in the apartments.  But other travelers, even if they noted such facts, did not consider this a significant drawback of <span>hotel service.</span> </p><h2>  Beach rating </h2><p>  Tourists positively assess the beach, which belongs to the hotel complex.  The beach is clean, pleasant.  The concept of its landscape is also highly appreciated by tourists.  Tourists believe that guests of all ages can spend time comfortably on a local beach.  True, not all guests liked the fact that full swimming is possible when using pontoons.  But for many of the hotel guests, such an organization of access to the beach was quite impressive.  In addition, corals adjacent to the coast, caused many tourists sincere delight. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Regarding catering, reviews vary greatly.  And this is quite logical: food is one of the most subjectively assessed aspects of relaxation.  Some tourists refer to the uniformity of the "buffet" diet, while others note that the composition of dishes within the framework of all nutrition formats is optimal.  But the quality of products, regardless of their diversity, is estimated by tourists as high.  Some of the guests lacked fruit, while others, on the contrary, found the diet overly saturated with them.  Many noted the high quality of baking, as well as its wide enough range.  In general, tourists do not express any particular complaints about the quality of products and their freshness. </p><p>  Opinions vary regarding the quality of service at local restaurants.  Some tourists cite the lack of free utensils and appliances during a mass visit by travelers of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Others did not feel such problems. </p><p>  Many tourists note the variety and high quality of soft drinks.  This is a particularly significant factor for relaxing in the hot Egyptian resorts.  A comfortable pastime under the sun by the sea should be accompanied by the ability to cool in time and with pleasure.  Hotel guests have no problems with this, judging by the reviews. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  We noted above that tourists highly appreciate the quality of service for the staff of the Royal Grand Sharm Resort 5 * hotel. The reviews regarding the qualifications of the staff of the complex are extremely positive.  Tourists are pleased to observe that there are no problems with the timely replacement of linen in the rooms, with the service during the organization of the buffet. </p><h2>  Entertainment rating </h2><p>  The hotel infrastructure offers a large number of opportunities for enthusiasts of discos, bars, sports enthusiasts.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Judging by the opinions of tourists, regardless of preferences in terms of the way of rest, hotel guests can always choose for themselves an excellent option for spending time in comfort. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Corresponding infrastructure is evaluated in extremely positive tones.</font></font></p><p> Tourists praise the team of animators working at the hotel.  It is noted that the corresponding type of entertainment program can <span>cheer up a</span> person of any age.  Also, according to many tourists, the work of animators is moderately noisy.  It turns out that lovers of discos, enjoying a noisy vacation in the respective institutions, do not interfere with guests who want to stay in silence, enjoy the magnificence of the Red Sea, take a walk through the complex or in the Hadaba area. </p><h2>  Terrain and appearance </h2><p>  For many tourists it is important how the hotel and the surrounding area look like.  Regarding the Royal Grand Sharm Resort hotel, we can say that most of the guests evaluate its design extremely positively, both in terms of architecture and in terms of room interior.  Positive ratings were also given to the landscape adjacent to the hotel. </p>
