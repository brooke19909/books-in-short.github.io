Today it is very popular.  What is the reason for this, we will consider a little later.  It should immediately be said that the model is quite convenient, and also it does not have a high cost.  Therefore, it is quite suitable for those who do not want to spend a lot of money on really serious equipment, given that it is only purchased for the purpose of listening to music at home. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  In the box offered by the supplier, you can find the Sennheiser PX 100-II headphones themselves, as well as a carrying case.  This device is considered among the entire model range of the manufacturer the most famous and cheapest overhead device.  It is perfect for home listening to music, but on the street it is undesirable to use headphones.  This model is intended for people who prefer to have a convenient device with silicone insulators.  Headphones are great on ears and give a high-quality sound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser px 100 ii" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1663259.jpg" width="598"></div>

It is quite easy to get Sennheiser PX 100-II headphones from a blister.  They are in it in a folded state.  There is nothing more in the box except a cover.  It is made of fairly coarse fabric, which allows it to be durable.  It has special ties.  In order for the headphones to fit in it, they need to be folded only when assembled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser px 100 ii black" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1663261.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and operation </h2><p>  Most of the design of the Sennheiser PX 100-II is made of plastic, the headband and hinges are made of metal.  It is the latter that allow folding the headphones.  If we evaluate the design of the device as a whole, we can say that the design is rather discreet, and the quality of the materials used is not bad.  With prolonged use of the headphones, the folding and unfolding process will take an average of several seconds.  It should be noted that all movements are smooth, clear and performed without problems.  There are no backlashes.  After a while, there is a slight chance that key nodes will loose.  However, this will not happen quickly. </p><p>  The cups are not pressed very tightly.  But this is enough to make a tight fix.  The headband is adjustable in a wide range, so it is suitable for any consumer.  The ear pads are made of a material such as foam.  To ensure high-quality use and the most convenient for the buyer, the manufacturer preferred to attach the Sennheiser PX 100-II Black headphone cups using hinges.  The device does not weigh very much, the speakers also do not fit snugly, so wearing it is quite convenient.  Headphones have an open acoustic design.  Accordingly, among the disadvantages of this model, noise isolation can be designated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To distinguish the right earphone from the left, you need to look at which side the wire is.  The designations ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúleft‚Äù are applied to the plastic located on the upper part of the headband. </p><p>  It is also necessary to say a few words about the cable.  He is unattractive.  In order to use the headphones as a portable device, the length of the wire will be quite enough.  The plug is completely straight, its dimensions are small.  Therefore, you need to handle it as carefully as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser px 100 ii reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1663262.jpg" width="412"></div>

    <h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  It should be noted that these Sennheiser PX 100-II headphones (reviews about them are generally positive) do not differ in increased sound quality.  This can be fully justified by the price category.  Mids do not sound very distinct.  Therefore, they bring a little discomfort.  Sibilants are absent.  High frequencies also do not reach the optimal level.  As for the low ones, I must say that they are forced, so some melodies sound, to put it mildly, poor quality.  Often not enough bass.  Even with the fact that the headphones have an open acoustic design, they got a not entirely successful stereo panorama.  There is no volumetric effect, the instruments sound at an average level.  The detail of this model is poor.  The bass in many heavy melodies completely covers the frequency range, that is, the middle and high notes are almost inaudible.  You can safely enjoy simple electronics, pop music, and rap. </p><h2>  Compatibility with other devices </h2><p>  A popular phone is the Apple iPhone, so let's talk a little about it.  Headphones work quite well with this device.  You do not have to increase the volume to the maximum to enjoy playback.  Of course, it is not worth comparing the Sennheiser PX 100-II Black headphones with the native ones from Apple, however, in general, for the banal listening to melodies, the capabilities of the device will be quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  In Russia, this device costs about 1,500 rubles. Therefore, many well-known models are its competitors.  The closest rival can be considered Koss Porta Pro. </p><p>  These models are compared by many on ergonomics, since it is almost identical.  They differ slightly in design, but this question is debatable, because each consumer has his own taste.  If we consider subjectively, then the described model has a more modern design.  Speaking of sound, Porta Pro is becoming the clear leader.  They have more controlled lower frequencies, although the higher ones are also muffled.  In the Sennheiser model, the sound is a bit unclear.  However, due to a more successful design and ease of use, it clearly wins. </p>
