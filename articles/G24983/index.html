As a motivation, we offer this article, in which we will talk in detail about how to knit a fashionable jacket with knitting needles.  After all, for this you need to not only buy tools and materials, but also take measurements, choose a pattern and more.  So let's get started! </p><h2>  A few words about the preparation </h2><p>  In magazines, on the pages of Internet sites, on the television screen, and even in everyday life, we can observe various styles of the product being studied.  They vary depending on the season, destination and other features.  Therefore, thinking about how to make a fashionable jacket with knitting needles, you need to imagine the desired model.  To facilitate the task, you can go shopping, find, try on and photograph a suitable option.  After that, pick up a pattern, knitting needles and yarn. </p><p>  Professional craftswomen advise to beat simple models with interesting threads, and complex ones, on the contrary, knit in plain colors.  To obtain a clear pattern, you should choose knitting needles no more than one and a half times thicker than the thread.  For the rest, you can rely on your own taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion jacket" class="if uuid-2898682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898682.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the sample for? </h2><p>  A huge number of master classes begin with preparing a fragment of all the patterns that will be used in the conceived product.  Beginners very often skip this step.  And make a big mistake.  Indeed, without it, it is impossible to correctly calculate the loops and rows.  And that means that knitting a fashionable jacket, suitable in size, may also not work out.  For this reason, choosing a pattern, acquiring knitting needles and yarn, it is important to prepare samples (approximately 10 x 10 cm) of all patterns.  After that, we attach a piece of paper to each, count the number of loops and rows and divide all the values ‚Äã‚Äãby ten.  Then we paint on each sample the number of loops and rows in one in a centimeter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fashionable knitting jacket" class="if uuid-2898685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898685.jpg"></div><p>  To connect a beautiful and fashionable jacket, you should determine a lot of important parameters.  The most important of them are the lengths of the product and the sleeves.  It‚Äôs also a good idea to think in advance what the gate will be.  After that, we proceed to take measurements: </p><ul><li>  jacket length; </li><li>  armhole level; </li><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  neck width; </li><li>  the length of the sleeve; </li><li>  girth of the widest part of the forearm. </li></ul><h2>  Loop set </h2><p>  Even beginners know how to loop on knitting needles.  But far from everyone is able to calculate their number for a particular product by themselves.  Therefore, in the current article, we propose to study detailed and simple instructions.  However, first, we note that professional knitters are advised to design the edging of a fashionable jacket with a different pattern.  The simplest of them is a 1 x 1 elastic band (a series of front and back loops).  To make this piece beautiful, you need to knit the whole product in a special way.  But first, you need to calculate the number of loops, which should be typed at the very beginning of the work. </p><p>  We again turn to the prepared samples.  We consider the main pattern.  Multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by the circumference of the chest.  Then we subtract 20 units from the resulting number, which we then compensate in Kant.  After that we take ring knitting needles and the chosen yarn, we collect loops.  We continue to work on the product to the level of the armhole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket" class="if uuid-2898692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898692.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a slot for a sleeve? </h2><p>  Professional knitters do not spend a lot of time on this part.  However, for many beginners, this detail is rather complicated.  In addition, fashionable knitted cardigans have recently gained enormous popularity, in which the armhole is not properly designed.  This is the option we will consider in the material presented. </p><p>  So, to make a slot for the sleeve, you need to calculate the number of loops for the back.  To do this, consider the desired pattern.  After we multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by half the circumference of the chest.  As a result, we get the number of loops that is required for knitting the back.  We separate them exactly in the middle of our canvas.  Then we tie the back with a simple rectangle, without reducing and adding loops, decorating the gate. </p><h2>  How to make front shelves? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan knitting" class="if uuid-2898698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898698.jpg"></div><p>  Earlier, we mentioned that the gates in different models of fashionable and exclusive knitted cardigans may vary.  The classic option is a semicircular.  It is formed on the last seven rows, in which the loops defined for this part are evenly reduced.  There is also a triangular neckline.  Such a jacket is more like a cardigan.  This neckline should begin approximately under the chest.  Hinges for the gate by mathematical calculations are scattered on the remaining rows, after which they are reduced in the course of work. </p><p>  A less popular cut is a square.  It is easiest to complete.  At the right level, the hinges for the gate close all at once.  And then the straps of the left and right shelves are tied separately.  However, when calculating the hinges for the gate, it is important to remember whether the edging is provided in the product.  If before starting work we reduced 20 loops, they should also be subtracted from those that are defined for the cut.  The same nuance can create difficulties when doing a triangular roll out.  After all, you will need to start reducing the loops a little later.  And their number will be less than provided. </p><h2>  Adding Kant </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket step by step" class="if uuid-2898695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898695.jpg"></div><p>  After the main part of the product is tied, it should be joined along the shoulder seams and sew using a sewing needle or hook.  Then you need to add the edging.  To do this, take the hook and loop through the bottom edge, the vertical front shelves and the collar.  Now we should consider another nuance.  To do this, answer the question of whether the collar will be provided in the jacket.  After all, we repeat again, models of fashionable knitted cardigans are different. </p><p>  Depending on which edging is provided, the number of rows in it varies.  In any case, to frame the jacket will have to complete 4-5 rows, moving in a circle.  However, it is important to note that at the corners, you need to knit the extreme loops on both sides together.  After that, some part can be closed.  For example, I don‚Äôt want to make too long a hem along the bottom edge or a very high collar.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that on the shelves at the beginning of knitting we reduced a few loops.  They need to be compensated at this stage.  In addition, if you want to make a fastening jacket, cuts for buttons in this case, it is more convenient to make vertical ones.  To do this, close the same number of loops at regular intervals.  And above them in the next row we add air loops.  That's all the technology! </p><h2>  How to tie the sleeves? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket description" class="if uuid-2898704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2898704.jpg"></div><p>  Finally, we can only add the last detail.  To do this, we propose to study the finishing stage of the description for a fashionable jacket with knitting needles.  In it we will tell about how to tie the sleeves.  This is actually very simple.  You just need to take the hook again and use it to dial new loops on the armhole.  But it is important to add them not around the entire circumference, but only by 2/3 (through the shoulder seam).  After that we get to work. </p><p>  Transfer the loops to the circular knitting needles and perform the desired pattern, pulling new loops on the remaining part of the slot for the sleeves in each next row.  After that, we knit the sleeve to almost the desired length.  There are two ways to finish work on a jacket.  The first is to tie the cuffs with an elastic band.  The second requires switching to smaller knitting needles and supplementing the sleeve with the main pattern.  Each knitter must determine her own version. </p><p>  Having dealt with the technology of the simplest jacket, you can master more spectacular options.  The main thing is not to be afraid to try something new. </p>
