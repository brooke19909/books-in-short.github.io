  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The romance and comfort that Porto hotels can present</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is no doubt that a holiday in Porto, the northern <span>capital of Portugal,</span> as it is called, will be remembered if not forever, then it will certainly become one of the most vivid impressions in life.  In general, Portugal for the most part is not studied by Russian tourists, is not the most visited by them and popular, although undeservedly.  This country is unusual, beautiful and original, and the hotels of Porto and other cities will force you to take a fresh look at the concept of comfort and convenience. </p><p>  Porto is surrounded by picturesque rich vineyards growing along the banks of the beautiful Dourou River right on the terraces.  Only here you can feel how harmoniously the activity of modern business life can be combined with folk traditions, carefully preserved and transmitted from generation to generation.  The same principle - to combine incompatible, that is, modernity and tradition, all Porto hotels are guided.  Some of them are located in the central parts of the city, some are hidden in the labyrinths of its ancient streets.  Many hotels and pensions are located on the high steep banks of Dourou.  Before choosing a place for temporary residence, it is worth examining some reviews of Porto hotels in order to comprehensively evaluate its offers and stay at the most worthy. </p><p>  If you plan to spend a relaxing holiday, devoted to excursions, sightseeing and walks along the banks of the picturesque Portuguese river, then it is best to stay at the Cs Vintage House Hotel 5 * hotel.  This fabulous place, lost in the most mysterious and peaceful part of Portugal, will give tourists the opportunity to visit the region, famous for the same port, and of the highest quality.  The hotel is a reconstructed and restored old estate, built in the distant XVIII century.  Only here you can find the perfect combination of modern high-class service, comfortable living in spacious rooms, equipped with everything necessary for a modern person, and a unique atmosphere of sad antiquity that does not want to give up under the influence of new trends.  Experienced travelers note the peculiarity of this place - it is joyful and sad with its guests, giving them some of their feelings, and taking something into themselves.  Fans of a rich evening program will be disappointed with the rest in such a hotel - there are no nightclubs and bars in the patriarchal hotel on the banks of the Doura.  Although, perhaps, tasting excellent port and visiting the local Wine Academy with Wine Courses will slightly alleviate disappointment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From traditional to modern, without losing its identity - this is the motto of the Infante Do Sagres 5 * hotel, which successfully combines the chic of tradition and the modern level of service.  Like many other hotels in Porto, this place offers guests accommodation in elegant rooms, designed in a classic style, and the most modern entertainment, both on site and right next to it.  By the way, not far from Infante Do Sagres is Avenida dos Aliados, the central and most popular street in the whole city.  Of the main advantages, it is necessary to name fairly affordable prices and a good location of the hotel - in the very center of the city.  As for the shortcomings, this is the rare case when they are completely absent. </p><p>  The best place for families with children that Porto hotels can offer is the Le Meridien Park Atlantic Porto 5 * hotel, which provides everything for young visitors.  This includes playgrounds, and rooms for games, and special pools and the organization of picnics and city tours.  Of course, with such a scale, little is done for the entertainment of adults - but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice for mothers and fathers to leave their restless children at the Porto Hotel under the supervision of a nanny, go for a romantic walk or sit in a local restaurant tasting a magnificent port?  I would like to think that such a pastime at least slightly compensates for the lack of a full-fledged adult rest at the hotel. </p>
