After all, the voltage drop depends not only on the magnitude of the load, but also on the cross section of the supply cable, as well as the specific resistance of the conductor, multiplied by the length of the power line.  The result, as a rule, is obvious - the most colorful indicator is incandescent lamps, which lose their brightness when the voltage in the network decreases.  However, they are slightly sensitive to this mode of operation and do not fail for this reason.  This can not be said about all the electrical appliances that modern housing is equipped with.  Some of them may become worthless without the necessary protection.  Therefore, it is better to decide how to increase the voltage in the circuit.  More about this later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gandhiappliances.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase the voltage of the power supply" class="if uuid-3208473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208473.jpg"></div><h2>  The effect of voltage drop on the operation of electrical appliances </h2><p>  Household appliances may respond differently to a reduction in voltage.  To do this, the product packaging indicates the operating parameters.  Some are adapted to operate in the range from 200 to 240 volts, while others are not affected by more significant drops from 180 to 250 volts.  However, there is a third group, in the parameters of which the purpose for operation from a network of 220 V. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Electric motors </h2><p>  Electric motors are considered the most sensitive to such anomalies.  After all, they lose power under such conditions and cannot bear the established load.  A good example is a washing machine, the sound of which will immediately change.  If the rated load was applied to the engine, and it lost power as a result of a voltage drop, this will stop it.  Parking the engine under current, if you do not disconnect it from the network, is the most dangerous mode for this device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hammondmfg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like power supply voltage" class="if uuid-3208468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208468.jpg"></div><p>  Caught in such conditions, the engine does not have the necessary power to rotate the moving part.  As a result, the current strength increasing on the primary winding heats it to a critical point, and the insulation of the winding is destroyed.  The emergency mode results in an interturn short circuit, which leads to engine failure.  Thus, in modern refrigerators and washing machines designed to operate in automatic mode, protection is installed.  This preliminary stage is embedded in the drive to disconnect it from the power supply in case of distortion of the network parameters. </p><h2>  Electronic control systems </h2><p>  Various sophisticated devices that are equipped with modern communication systems that work in standalone modes include coordinating processors or microcircuits.  These key elements are also configured for certain network parameters, the boundaries of which are very limited.  Voltage drop can lead to distortion of the data generated by the control links.  This will lead to abnormal actions of the drives or disable them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tech-ops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase" class="if uuid-3208463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208463.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, there is a direct need to establish control over the supply voltage.  With a systematic voltage drop, it is necessary to apply one of the existing methods that decide how to increase the voltage of the transformer. </p><h2>  Electrical appliances related to active load </h2><p>  First of all, this applies to incandescent lamps and most heating appliances.  Their work is associated with the heating of refractory materials with high resistance.  In other words, a conductor having a large resistivity is located in the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heating device.  His job is to quickly heat up as the current strength that he passes increases. </p><p>  The refractory properties of these elements allow them to heat red-hot, generating a large amount of heat and without losing their shape.  For the operation of such devices, a voltage drop does not pose a threat, since along with it the current strength decreases (a value directly proportional to the voltage).  And this only leads to a decrease in the glow of the heating element.  Therefore, the question of how to increase the voltage on the conductor, these devices touches last. </p><h2>  Disruption of the contact of the incoming cable with power lines </h2><p>  Start the search for reasons should be from the point of connection of the power cable to the power line.  Bad contact can lead to heating of the connection, and the resulting carbon deposit will increase resistance and cause a voltage drop.  This problem needs to be fixed immediately for another reason.  With increasing resistance, the heating temperature increases, and this can lead to an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="power supply voltage" class="if uuid-3208462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208462.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to know that if a power line and an input cable make up a copper-aluminum pair, then you should not connect them by twisting.  For this purpose, special clamps with a bolted connection are used.  In addition, you should check the contact of the incoming cable with the general machine to which it transfers power.  The weakening of contact in this place is associated with similar consequences. </p><h2>  Small cross section of incoming cable </h2><p>  If all the contacts are in order and the cause of the voltage drop in the network cannot depend on this, it is worth doubting the choice of the cross section of the supply cable.  Check it out is easy.  To do this, you must turn on the appliance, the characteristics of which can be determined instantly.  An incandescent lamp is good, which can serve as an excellent indicator.  When the lamp works normally after switching on, and the next time the electric kettle and air heater are turned on, it starts to go out, the cross section of the supply cable is not enough, and it needs to be increased. </p><h2>  Malfunctioning electricity supplier </h2><p>  This is the most difficult and unpleasant reason for the voltage drop in the network.  Sometimes it continues only during the period of maximum consumer activity, which does not make it easier, and sometimes such processes can continue for several days.  The only reliable solution to the issue is the collection of all necessary evidence, the filing of a collective complaint (together with neighbors) and bringing the performer to justice.  However, this is a very thorny path that will take a lot of time, effort and money, but this is the only fundamental scheme for resolving the issue. </p><p>  If the process is delayed for an indefinite period, especially if it is aggravated by the lack of unanimity among the neighbors, you can learn how to increase the voltage in the circuit of an individual branch using technical means.  It is important to understand that such actions will have a positive effect, but to the detriment of surrounding neighbors.  For example, if everyone uses a similar trick, the effect will be reduced to zero. </p><h2>  Stabilizers </h2><p>  How many have increased the voltage on the conductor?  The simplest but most expensive solution to the problem is to use a common stabilizer at the input, which is compatible in power with the total load. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hammondmfg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="increase power supply voltage" class="if uuid-3208466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208466.jpg"></div><p>  The modern equivalent of such a device has a high market value, and for its placement you will need a separate room.  However, when the voltage drops to 180 volts, it is able to compensate for such a shortage to the nominal limit.  If you consider that the unit is necessary for many years of use, then this is a practical reason.  To increase the voltage at a point intended for one important consumer, you can use a low power stabilizer, more affordable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase the block voltage" class="if uuid-3208470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208470.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-down transformers </h2><p>  It is these devices that will help you decide how to increase the voltage with the power supply, which in combination serves as an adapter for electronic devices.  Moreover, the permissible load in this case will increase five times.  To do this, you must connect the secondary winding to the outlet, and connect the consumer to the primary winding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase the supply voltage" class="if uuid-3208471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3208471.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to confuse, it is better to use a voltmeter, although such an error will not cause harm and if it occurs, you can replay the connection.  Thus, a power supply designed for 12-volt equipment will increase the voltage of a single point by 12 volts.  Is it possible to increase the voltage with a resistor?  It is not possible to increase the voltage with a resistor, capacitor or inductor.  These elements are used to stabilize the voltage in case of drops. </p>
