It includes digital data that is published in various <span>media and</span> in special reference books.  Statistics are presented as a special scientific discipline. </p><p>  The subject of statistics is considered in three directions.  General statistics, as a universal science, considers the mass phenomena of society and nature.  As a <span>methodological science</span> does not have its own subject of knowledge, but only represents the doctrine of the method used by the social sciences.  Statistics is a science with its own methodology and subject.  She is engaged in the study of quantitative patterns of development of society. </p><p>  The subject of statistics is the quantitative side of <span>social, economic,</span> mass phenomena and their relationship with specific conditions and qualitative characteristics. </p><p>  The general theory of statistics has the following features.  This is a science that considers the quantitative characteristics of social phenomena.  She also considers mass phenomena and their quantitative characteristics, which are in constant connection with the qualitative side.  All this is embodied through a system of indicators.  Statistics consider the quantitative side of phenomena in terms of time and place. </p><p>  General statistics has its own methodology, which is understood as a system of principles and methods that implement them.  They consider the quantitative patterns that manifest themselves in the dynamics of economic and social phenomena and the structure of relationships.  The main elements of the statistical methodology are grouping and summarizing, statistical mass observation, as well as the analysis and application of statistical general indicators. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Observation is the collection of primary data about the object.  For example, during the census, <span>information is collected</span> about all people, which is entered in a special form. </p><p>  The second element that is considered by the general theory of statistics is the summary and grouping, which represent the division of the total set of data obtained at the stages of observation into groups with homogeneous characteristics according to one or more criteria.  For example, in the census process, the obtained population data is divided into groups (by education, age, gender, nationality, etc.). </p><p>  The essence of statistical methodology lies in the definition and in the economic statistical interpretation of generalizing indicators and characteristics.  The general theory of statistics includes the following <span>indicators: relative,</span> average, absolute, indicators of dynamics, variation, indices, etc. The three elements of the methodology described are also three stages that pass during any statistical research. </p><p>  The general theory of statistics basically has concepts and categories that, in their totality, express the basic principles of this teaching.  The most important of the concepts and criteria include regularity, signs, variations, aggregates. </p><p>  The statistical totality includes a mass of phenomena that are mono-qualitative in some way, which are limited in their existence in time and space. </p><p>  The most important category is the statistical regularity, which is understood as the sequence, repeatability, as well as the order of changes.  Statistical regularity is defined as a quantitative characteristic of changes in time and space of the processes of society and mass phenomena, which consist of many different units of the totality. </p>
