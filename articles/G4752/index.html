  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a candle with your own hands?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is almost impossible to imagine our life without electricity, and few are able to understand how it was possible to do without it before, and light their homes with a wooden torch or candles.  But, despite this, in the modern world, candles remain very popular, although they are used only as an element of decor or are lit in special occasions, such as a <span>romantic dinner,</span> weddings, birthdays.  In the worst case, they are lit when the electricity suddenly turns off. </p><p>  Of course, for unforeseen everyday moments in every house there is an ordinary <span>paraffin</span> store <span>candle,</span> but for especially solemn occasions you always want something special and romantic.  And what could be more romantic than a beautiful and <span>fragrant candle,</span> and even made with one's own hand, especially for the long-awaited event?  This is where the once forgotten, but safely reanimated and repeatedly improved art called candlelight comes to the rescue.  Of course, you can buy a beautiful candle in a store, but isn’t it more interesting to learn how to make a candle with your own pens, and then bring this knowledge to life? </p><p>  If interest woke up, then to begin with, you can try your hand at the cinders of used candles.  New ones will do.  Cut the wax into pieces and remove the wick or its remains, prepare a water bath.  For her, it is better to use old metal utensils, in which you will no longer cook food.  So, in a water bath you need to melt the wax, and while it is heating, prepare a form in which then fill the candle.  First, let it be an ordinary metal can of condensed milk, in the bottom of which you need to make a small hole. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, before you make a candle, you will need to make a wick for it.  It is not difficult: take any cotton threads, measure the required length of the wick (the thread can be folded twice or thrice, depending on the thickness of the future candle), lower one end of the thread into the mold, pass through the hole and fasten the outside with a small piece of wax.  Tie the other end to a pencil or any other stick that you put on top of the tin so that the thread is centered inside the can, in a slightly taut state. </p><p>  If you are thinking how to make a candle of a different color, then this is also easy.  You just need ordinary wax crayons for drawing, and the one you want to get the color is finely planed and added to the wax, mixing everything thoroughly until you get a uniform color.  For smell, you can drop a few drops of aromatic oil in the same place, but after removing the wax from the fire.  Now that the mold is ready and the wax is melted, you can carefully pour it into the mold.  After that, leave the future candle to cool as needed.  When it cools down, you can put it in the refrigerator for several hours, and then remove it from the mold.  The pencil holding the wick can be removed, the thread itself completely cut off from the bottom, and leave a couple of centimeters on top for ignition. </p><p>  Now you know the basic principle of how to make candles, and using it, you can improve your skill by inventing more and more new designs and using a wide variety of materials for their manufacture.  After all, candles are not only wax and paraffin.  Surely you have come across for sale very beautiful transparent candles, inside which "gardens are blooming and butterflies are fluttering."  These are gel or <span>glycerin candles,</span> which you can also learn to make if you have a rich imagination. </p><p>  Having studied all the wisdom and understanding how to make a candle, you can even achieve such an effect as a colored flame.  Yes, adding some components to the molten composition, you can make the candle burn with a yellow, red, green or blue flame.  But with such special effects, you need to be extremely careful, because the ingredients that make the light multicolored are nothing more than chemicals.  Otherwise, the process can become so exciting that if you look, you have to open your own business.  But each time, before you make a candle, remember the safety rules and follow them, no matter how well you have mastered your new hobby. </p>
