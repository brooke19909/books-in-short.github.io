In order for the book to be in good condition, after reading you need to use bookmarks.  For books, many variations of such useful products from a wide variety of materials have been invented.  They can be knitted, created in the form of an appliqu√©, sewed from fabric using elastic bands and ribbons. </p><p>  In our article, we will familiarize the reader with the manufacture of simple and affordable bookmarks from paper and felt.  Beautiful products are made of paper by folding and weaving strips, appliqu√©s and adding funny elements.  It is easy to work with felt sheets.

That part of the product, which will be located in the middle of the book, can be simply rectangular in shape, and you can also decorate the strip with small elements.  The upper part of the bookmark is larger.  It can be the face of any animal or the head of a bird, a character in a fairy tale or a popular cartoon.

This is to ensure that no seams are visible on the back.  They hide between the layers of fabric.  Work begins with sewing a rectangular base.  First, you need to make a template from thick cardboard, according to which two identical elements are cut from felt.  You can use various colors.  So the bookmark will be brighter and more attractive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then an owl template is drawn, as in the photo in the article.

Then it remains to sew rectangular parts together with a stitch seam and, having attached two tops to the base, fasten them together.  On the back, you can make several feathers. </p><h2>  Folded Paper Triangles </h2><p>  This bookmark has a triangular shape.  Such a product is put on the corner of the book.
