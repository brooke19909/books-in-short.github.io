For example, you need to pay for a tariff that provides 100 SMS, minutes for calls and megabytes of the Internet than if you purchased the same amount of services separately. </p><p>  Today we will talk about tariff plans from the Russian operator Megafon.  They are designed just for the purchase of "all at once" at a lower price.  The package is called, which offers "Megaphone", "All inclusive".  150 rubles a month - such a starting price it was at the start of the service. </p><p>  After some time, the cost increased to 199 rubles - it is for this price that subscribers are now ordering these services.  Nevertheless, their essence has not changed.  Read about what these tariffs are and how beneficial they are for ordinary subscribers. </p><h2>  For whom? </h2><p>  To begin with, the rates given in this article are suitable for a wide range of users, starting with those who use the phone only for calls and ending with subscribers who regularly watch movies on their tablet.  This is the advantage of the Megafon All Inclusive tariff plan: 150 rubles (or rather 199) is a single fee that is required to receive a range of services, both minutes for calls and traffic for using Internet access.  Actually, due to this, the tariff plan also attracts people of various age groups and dissimilar preferences.  This is a truly universal solution for your smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  For which devices? </h2><p>  By the way, regarding the gadget with which this tariff will ideally manifest itself, it is definitely quite difficult to say anything.  What does Megafon declare on its official website?  "All inclusive" (150 rubles, of course, it will not cost anymore) is ideal for working with a smartphone.  True, the tariff is divided into 5 more plans - XS, S, M, L and VIP.  The logic of the developers is quite simple: each subsequent plan is more expensive than the previous one, but also provides more services.  Thus, if we take, for example, the penultimate tariff in the line ‚ÄúMegaphone - All Inclusive L‚Äù, within the framework of which 8 GB of traffic in 3G or 4G format is provided (at the choice of the subscriber), we can confidently say that this is enough for online games, watching TV shows and even several movies online.  So can we say with confidence that these tariffs are exclusively for smartphones?  Unlikely.  It all depends primarily on the intensity of Internet use by the subscriber. </p><p>  Now, of course, in order to understand what tariffs provide, we must disclose information for each of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  All Inclusive XS </h2><p>  This is a basic package from Megafon.  ‚ÄúAll-inclusive‚Äù (it cost 150 rubles a long time ago, now the price has increased to 199 rubles) marked XS is the first in terms of price and volume of services provided.  As part of it, the subscriber is given 300 minutes to talk with the numbers of the same operator located in the subscriber's region.  In order to communicate with friends from other territories of Russia, the user will have to pay 6.5 rubles per minute. </p><p>  As for calls to numbers of other operators, then when it comes to the home region, their cost in the framework of "Megaphone - All Inclusive" for 150 (or rather, for 199 rubles) is only 2 rubles.  In the event that the subscriber wants to call the number of another operator in another region, he will need to pay 10 rubles per minute. </p><p>  SMS messages cost 1.9 rubles for numbers in the home region and 3.9 rubles for someone else‚Äôs. </p><p>  It is also important to note that the operator "Megaphone" All Inclusive for 150 (already - 199 rubles) offers 500 megabytes of Internet.  This is enough to periodically view mail or check messages on social networks on your mobile device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  All Inclusive S </h2><p>  The next in the line is a package with the designation S and a cost of 390 rubles.  ‚ÄúAll Inclusive S‚Äù ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù at the time of writing this article is promoting through a special promotion.  According to its conditions, the subscriber pays 190 rubles for the first month of using the tariff.  Thus, you can try its advantages, evaluate this plan, and then switch to XS. </p><p>  The data that is provided as part of the package is already much more.  The number of minutes for calls to subscribers in their region increased to 400. In addition, the operator allocates another 100 SMS messages for sending to subscribers of its network in the same region.  As for the Internet, now we have more of it: we are talking about the allocation of packages in the amount of 3 GB. </p><p>  If you want to call users of other operators from your region, you need to pay 2 rubles per minute, to communicate with the Megafon number from another region - 3 rubles, and for calls to other numbers anywhere in Russia - 10 rubles.  The cost of SMS within the framework of the All Inclusive S package, Megafon set at 3.9 rubles per message. </p><h2>  All Inclusive M </h2>

    <p>  The average tariff plan in the operator‚Äôs line is M. Its cost is 590 rubles per month.  For this fee, the user receives 600 minutes of calls to his network numbers and in the region, 600 SMS.  Megafon provides 4 GB traffic on the All Inclusive M package.  In principle, watching TV shows with him is already possible. </p><p>  The cost of other services that are provided in excess of the allocated data package is equal to that which was given for tariff S. </p><h2>  All Inclusive L </h2><p>  The penultimate tariff in the line, which we already mentioned today, with the designation L, will provide the subscriber with 8 GB of traffic for working in 3G / 4G format.  In addition, the user receives 1,500 minutes and 1,500 messages for communication with Megafon subscribers in his region.  The cost of the tariff is 1290 rubles, while the price of services provided above the allotted rate does not change. </p>

For a <span>subscription fee</span> of 2,700 rubles, the client is provided with 5,000 messages (SMS) and the same number of minutes for talking in the home region of the Megafon network. </p><p>  The cost of additional services remains the same as it was in the previous tariffs. </p><h2>  How to go? </h2>

    <p>  If you liked the All Inclusive service, Megafon gives you the opportunity to switch to the selected plan.  You can do this in several ways, the main thing is to remember the package identifier.  They are: for tariff XS - 95, for S, M, L, VIP - 33, 34, 35, 40, respectively. </p><p>  You can transfer the phone to one of them by creating a short USSD request * 105 * 00XX #, where instead of ‚ÄúXX‚Äù, you guessed, the identifier we need should go.  You can also connect your favorite tariff using SMS to 05009XX, where the last two digits are the same plan identifier. </p><p>  Finally, in addition to this, you can contact a specialist on the hot line, an employee of the communication salon, and also leave a request for a change of plan on the Internet (using your personal account).  The method of how to connect "Megaphone - All inclusive", you choose. </p><h2>  Tariff Features </h2>

    <p>  An important nuance in working with this set of plans is debiting and charging data.  In the event that at the time of the transition to the service or its activation by the end of the month exactly half of it remains, the user is charged a monthly fee divided in half.  The same rule is observed if the proportion changes: how many days remain until the end of the service period ‚Äî the subscriber will pay the same part of the monthly fee for the tariff.  Funds are withdrawn in full in one payment. </p><p>  Another important point concerns the Internet.  Formally, within each tariff, the user is provided with a certain amount of traffic, for example 4 GB.  However, after it is consumed, the service does not turn off - just <span>the data transfer rate</span> drops to 64 kbps.  This, of course, causes inconvenience to the subscriber, but allows you to download the page of the site or update the application of the social network. </p><h2>  International challenges </h2><p>  Billing international calls for subscribers served on plans "All inclusive" is the same.  The main criterion for how much a minute of call will cost is the user's territorial location.  In particular, calls to neighboring countries - the CIS, Abkhazia, Georgia and Ukraine, are charged at 20 rubles per minute.  Calling to European countries, as well as to such popular destinations as the USA and Canada, is possible at a price of 30 rubles per minute.  A minute of calling to Australia costs 40 rubles, and to Asia - 50. Other countries are charged roaming at 60 rubles per minute.  The most expensive for calls can be called territories where only satellite communications are active.  A minute of a call from there will cost a subscriber of Megaphone 313 rubles.  Recall that these figures are equivalent for each of the five tariff plans in question today. </p>
