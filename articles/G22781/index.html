    <h2>  The emergence of the largest pool in the world </h2><p>  This pristine pool is spread out (yes, it was spread out) on the <span>Pacific</span> coast in Chile in the small town of Algarrobo.  Many people are immediately interested in the question: ‚ÄúWhy create a pool, albeit so large, on the ocean?‚Äù.  Indeed, logically, plunging into the ocean is much more interesting than swimming in the pool, this can be done at home, right?  However, not all so simple.  In order to understand the meaning of the largest basin in the world on the Pacific coast, you need to familiarize yourself with its history.  So, in 2001, businessman Fernando Fishman (a biochemist by training) decided to open a magnificent resort on the Pacific coast in Chile.  Friends were perplexed: Fishman chose a place completely unsuitable for a tourist recreation area, because the water in that region never heats above 17 <sup>¬∞</sup> C, swimming is generally forbidden ... However, the entrepreneur turned out to be more savvy than <sup>his</sup> comrades: he planned a grandiose project - to build an ‚Äúocean by the ocean‚Äù .  So the hotel complex appeared, on the territory of which the largest pool is located.  After five years of work, the resort was open to visitors who immediately appreciated the unusual idea.  Today, San Alfonso del Mar is in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest and <span>deepest pool in the world.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="largest pools" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12194/314844.jpg" width="600"></div>  Dimensions and parameters of the largest pool in the world </h2><p>  Let's move on to the numbers.  To understand how huge this pool is, you need to imagine a <span>football field.</span>  But the area of ‚Äã‚Äãour water giant is 16 football fields - 80 thousand square meters.  meters.  The length of the San Alfonso del Mar basin is slightly more than a kilometer, so not everyone will be able to swim it up and down.  The deepest point of the pool is about 40 meters.  And to fill it with water, it will take no less than 250 million liters.  Two billion dollars were allocated for the construction of the pool, and 4 million for the annual maintenance of the champion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the largest pool" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12194/314843.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, such dimensions allow the hotel to hold boats, yachts, catamarans and special boards with a motor for surfing.  The pool has areas for outdoor activities, and for a relaxing swim with children.  Another plus of this giant is the water that is taken from the nearby ocean, cleaned and filled with its pool.  In the sun, it heats up to 26 <sup>about</sup> , which is especially for heat-loving tourists. </p><p>  Probably, a new leader will appear soon in the list of ‚ÄúBiggest Pools‚Äù in the Book of Records, because to ‚Äúcatch up and overtake‚Äù such a miracle of engineering is very difficult.  In any case, the San Alfonso del Mar swimming pool is a place that is definitely worth writing on your Where to Visit list. </p>
