At the same time, the user feels divorced from family and friends.  What to do and how to send SMS if an iPhone refuses to send text messages? </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  In the Messages application on your iPhone, you can send text as iMessage messages or as a regular SMS.  Problems sending messages are related to bad authentication.  Many users are interested in the question of why SMS is not sent from an iPhone and what to do in this situation? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Common mistakes" class="if uuid-3085710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3085710.jpg"></div><p>  Smartphone owners often see an exclamation mark that appears when sending messages.  This reminder indicates that the message failed to be sent to the recipient. </p><h2>  Why aren‚Äôt SMS sent from an iPhone? </h2><p>  It is important for owners of Apple mobile devices to be aware that it is best to contact a service center with any problems.  However, simple manipulations described in this article can help users.  There are several reasons why SMS messages are not sent from an iPhone.  The first (and most obvious) is the lack of a cellular signal.  In addition, the user may simply not have enough money in the account.  However, there are problems of a different order that need to be fixed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone recovery" class="if uuid-3085697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3085697.jpg"></div><p>  The user can force a reboot of the device.  In some cases, deleting a message and resending it may help.  The listed methods will help to organize sending messages on an iPhone.  In some cases, the reasons for the incorrect sending of messages may not be completely obvious, so many people ask: "Why aren‚Äôt SMS sent from the iPhone?" </p><h2>  Force reboot </h2><p>  First of all, you should turn to the most effective way.  It is enough for the user to perform a forced reboot of the device by holding down the power button and the Home button.  Carrying out a hard reset will help get rid of the problems associated with the inability to send SMS messages to the iPhone.  If this method does not help, you must use other methods. </p><h2>  Reset Network Settings </h2><p>  The owner can try resetting the network settings in the mobile device.  To do this, go to the "Settings" section, select the "General" item and click on the "Reset" button.  Then the user needs to confirm this operation and check the correct sending of SMS messages.  It‚Äôs important to be aware that resetting your data involves automatically deleting all saved passwords for Wi-Fi networks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Check iOS settings </h2><p>  The easiest and most effective way to restore the function of sending text messages is to activate the corresponding option in the iPhone settings.  The user will need to go to the "Settings" menu and open the "Messages" item.  Make sure that the toggle switch is in the active position. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edumobile.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Message sending errors" class="if uuid-3085693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3085693.jpg"></div><p>  Using this function allows you to send SMS messages if iMessage is not available.  If this option has been activated, you must turn it off and wait a few seconds.  Then you need to re-enable the function "Send as SMS". </p><h2>  Delete messages </h2><p>  If the above methods did not lead to the desired result, and the owner of the device does not know how to send SMS, you can use this simple but effective method.  It‚Äôs enough for the gadget user to delete the problem message, retype the text and try sending it again.  The implementation of such a banal procedure will allow you to restore the correct sending of text messages. </p><h2>  Move SIM card to another device </h2><p>  This is one of the most non-standard methods that can help out if the above methods have been ineffective.  The user will need to rearrange the SIM card in another smartphone and configure the SMS center.  Five minutes later, the owner of the gadget can remove the SIM card from the mobile device and install it in your smartphone.  After completing these manipulations, the user can send SMS messages without problems. </p><h2>  Call to the operator </h2><p>  The user can ask the operator to enable sending text messages.  The specialist will provide the necessary information and the number of the current SMS center.  Employees provide this information without any problems, since it is not confidential. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniteconferencing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call to the operator" class="if uuid-3085713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3085713.jpg"></div><p>  After receiving the number, you will need to reset the SMS center number installed on the device using the command ## 5005 * 7672 #.  Then you need to set the current SMS center number, you need to dial ** 5005 * 7672 and add the sent number.  If after entering the command the user sees an error, do not pay attention to it.  As a rule, a new number is immediately successfully installed.  This can be checked using the key combination indicated by the first. </p><h2>  IPhone Recovery </h2><p>  Before you begin restoring your iPhone, we recommend that you back up it.  This method will solve any problems associated with sending text messages.  If the initial activation of the smartphone was carried out with another SIM card, then the problem with sending SMS-messages is quite obvious.  In this case, the settings on the smartphone are not performed correctly.  The gadget owner will need to restore the iPhone and activate it using a new SIM card. </p><h2>  Disabling SMS sending from other devices </h2><p>  The release of the iOS 8 and iOsX operating systems allowed gadget owners to send messages from the SIM card that is on the iPhone using an iPad or Mac.  Using this function can have a negative effect on sending regular SMS messages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nexmo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Expert Advice" class="if uuid-3085703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3085703.jpg"></div><p>  For the device to work correctly, just open the "Settings" section, select the "Messages" item and click on the "Message Forwarding" button.  The user must disconnect all devices specified in this paragraph.  Then you should restart your smartphone. </p><h2>  Internet disconnection </h2><p>  If the user does not have Internet traffic, then iOS can establish an Internet connection without the user's knowledge.  As a result, the iPhone will send messages using the iMessage protocol in automatic mode.  It‚Äôs enough for the device owner to open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù section, click on the ‚ÄúCellular Communications‚Äù button and turn off the slider from the ‚ÄúCellular Data‚Äù position. </p><h2>  Verify Settings </h2><p>  Date and time settings affect many other functions.  In this regard, incorrect settings in the iPhone may be the main reason why text messages are not sent. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  The appearance of various instant messengers has led to the fact that the demand for SMS messages is steadily declining.  Therefore, many users do not send SMS from an iPhone, and the cause of incorrect sending can be difficult to find.  In certain situations, gadget owners simply need to use the SMS messaging service.  Having studied the information in this article, the user will quickly solve the problem of why SMS messages are not sent from the iPhone. </p>
