  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Honey Valley": reviews, overview, features and layout</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It will not be a secret for anyone that everyone dreams of having their own comfortable housing.  Due to the fact that new buildings are constantly being built in our country, it will not be difficult to purchase an apartment.  The most important thing is to have finances to fulfill your dreams.  Residential complex Barkli "Honey Valley" is a full-fledged comfort-class residential district, aimed at middle-income citizens.  The project is being implemented by one of the largest domestic corporations working in the field of reconstruction of various real estate and construction of residential buildings.  The company has many successful projects and extensive experience.  A distinctive feature of the "Honey Valley" is that, despite the relatively low cost of housing, it has a good finish and provides maximum comfort for living. </p><h2>  Location and transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kvartirny-control.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pros and cons in lcd barkley" class="if uuid-2974571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974571.jpg"></div><p>  Overview Barkley LCD "Honey Valley" should begin with its location.  The place for construction was chosen very successfully.  The housing complex is located in the village of Krekshino, located only 26 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Therefore, it will be very convenient for residents to get to work, and the travel time will be no more than half an hour, taking into account the absence of traffic jams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With transport accessibility, everything is just fine.  On one side of the village is the Kiev highway, and on the other - Minsk.  Both motorways have been recently expanded, so the flow of cars does not slow down even during busy hours.  Among the minuses, we can only highlight that at the very entrance to the "Honey Valley" is a railway crossing.  In addition, there are no overlapping parking lots near the village, so the residents will have certain problems with where to leave the transport if they suddenly decide to take the metro. </p><p>  As for pedestrians, they will get to the Honey Valley residential complex (reviews about the microdistrict will be presented at the end of the article) is much more complicated.  The thing is that there are no public transport or metro stations nearby, and only a train goes with a certain frequency.  From it you still have to walk about 20 minutes.  Regular buses go to the city from neighboring settlements, but they are quite far away.  Thus, in terms of transport accessibility, ‚ÄúHoney Valley‚Äù loses to many other residential complexes.  If you work in Moscow, then getting to the office will be very problematic in the absence of a personal vehicle.  In the future, they plan to build a new railway station near the village of Krekshino, but when this happens, it remains unknown. </p><h2>  Ecological environment and living conditions </h2><p>  Barkli LCD "Honey Valley" in Marushkino is located near the railway lines, and Vnukovo Airport is also located ten kilometers from it, so you should not count on peace and quiet.  The neighborhood is quite noisy, although it is surrounded by forest.  As for the environmental component, then everything is much better.  There are no industrial enterprises and factories in this area that release harmful and dangerous substances and chemicals into the atmosphere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth saying a few words about water supply.  In the village itself there is no centralized water supply system, which worries many people interested in buying housing in the area.  As for the ‚ÄúHoney Valley‚Äù, it will be fed from a separate artesian well, the field of which is located at a depth of 200 meters.  At the same time, water undergoes additional filtration through a specialized treatment system. </p><h2>  The structure of the microdistrict </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nic-expert.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="features lcd honey valley" class="if uuid-2974579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974579.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Honey Valley" (you can study the residents' reviews at the end of the article) consists of nine buildings, each of which has 3 residential buildings with the number of floors from 4 to 7. The designers took care not only that all the buildings were rationally located .  Much attention was paid to infrastructure.  The territory of the residential complex includes a kindergarten, a shopping center and entertainment facilities. </p><p>  The project was launched in September 2015, and a year and a half later the apartments were handed over to the rightful owners, recorded on the first receipt.  The construction of the 2nd and 3rd phases began in the middle of autumn 2016, and in the winter of 2017 the construction of the last facility was completed.  The scope of the project is estimated at 7.5 billion rubles, of which 40 percent is the share of the company.  The rest is borrowed funds issued by Sberbank as a loan.  Thus, in Moscow LCD Barkley "Honey Valley" has become one of the largest projects of our time.  The capital has not seen anything like this for a long period of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Materials and characteristics of houses </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rusmonitor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd barkley honey valley" class="if uuid-2974566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974566.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  New buildings in the new Moscow LCD "Honey Valley" Barkley are being built from thermal blocks "Porotherm".  This is a modern building material with excellent performance.  For facing facades, brick of various colors is used.  People who have never heard of fuser units before can meet them at the office of a construction company. </p><p>  Stylistic solutions for the houses were developed by the Dutch agency, headed by a well-known world-famous architect Arjen de Grot.  However, a common concept with European buildings is not observed.  On the contrary, the houses are made with a share of minimalism, in which boring and dull colors prevail.  There are no architectural elements, and dullness and gloom dilute the alternating blocks of various shades. </p><p>  The facades of houses in the residential complex Barkli ‚ÄúHoney Valley‚Äù (unfinished construction met the expectations of investors, since the project was completed ahead of schedule) have a rather attractive appearance.  In each building there is a through entrance, going into which you find yourself in a spacious hall.  They will have a place for the concierge and a room where tenants can store baby strollers and bicycles.  An elevator is provided at each entrance, but for some reason the developer did not take care of the presence of a garbage chute. </p><p>  On the facades of buildings there are special baskets designed for the installation of air conditioners.  This is a very successful solution, because the external units of household appliances will not violate the general concept, which will keep the appearance of buildings attractive.  Thus, the LCD "Honey Valley" (reviews of real consumers you can study a little later) is a modern microdistrict, built in accordance with current market realities and providing fairly comfortable living conditions. </p><h2>  Apartments and layouts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in lcd barkley" class="if uuid-2974612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974612.jpg"></div><p>  In total, Barkli LCD "Honey Valley" (the pros and cons of the neighborhood will be given below) is designed for 2,100 apartments.  On each floor there are from 4 to 6 dwellings, with the exception of the first.  Here, some of the apartments are reserved for commercial premises, in which various shops, beauty salons and other important infrastructure will be located.  The following housing options are available for buyers to choose from: </p><ul><li>  Studios </li><li>  odnushki; </li><li>  dvushki; </li><li>  treshki. </li></ul><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments varies from 22 to 82 square meters.  As for the layout, there are already 44 options, so each buyer will be able to choose the home of their dreams.  About 70 percent of the apartments are sold with a fine finish.  This approach is very bold, since the finished repair leads to a significant increase in the cost of real estate, but the strategy has fully justified itself, since the demand for apartments is quite high. </p><h2>  Floor plan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="advantages of lcd honey valley" class="if uuid-2974614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974614.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect in more detail.  All houses have interior partitions, so the owners will be able to make any changes to the layout of the apartments only after the housing becomes their legal property and the deed of transfer is signed.  But since most options require the presence of a fine finish, then at such events do not pay attention. </p><p>  The layout of the apartments in the residential complex Barkley "Honey Valley" from the developer is quite thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing.  Free space has rational design, and attention is paid to living rooms and common areas.  In studios and one-room apartments, the change house and toilet are located directly at the entrance.  Such a solution allows you to save a little free space near the windows, so that a good level of natural light is achieved in the kitchen. </p><p>  Two- and three-room housing is also available, there are several layout options - traditional and European.  The latter was developed most successfully, since there are no passage rooms and sharp corners.  Two-sided two-sided apartments look very original.  They have a living room area, as well as cooking and eating areas, almost 2 times the size of a bedroom and a bathroom. </p><h2>  Stylistic interior design solutions </h2><p>  In Barkli LCD "Honey Valley" (reviews of residents fully confirm the high quality of houses), 3 repair options are provided for customers to choose from.  The author of all stylistic decisions is the famous domestic designer and TV presenter Yegor Somov.  You can get acquainted with each of them on the official website of the developer.  When buying a home, you can independently choose the materials and colors that will be used for decoration.  However, it is important to consider one caveat.  No matter what type of housing you purchase, it will be possible to move into it only after the completion of the construction of all complexes and individual buildings and their commissioning. </p><p>  According to studies, the LCD "Honey Valley" (customer reviews and participants in shared construction will be presented at the end of the article) is aimed at middle-aged people or young families who do not yet have children who purchase housing in order to improve the quality of life.  But this is not surprising, because for average families this housing complex will not be the best option for choice, since quite a bit of space is allocated to the living space. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  As in the case with most other modern residential complexes, "Honey Valley" was built on the principle of "yard without cars."  This modern concept has recently been very popular.  For motorists in the surrounding area provides free parking for up to 1000 cars.  The disadvantage is that a specific parking number is not assigned to the residents, which is associated with certain difficulties.  Thus, the parking is 2 times less than the number of apartments. </p><p>  Given that there are no public transport stops nearby, and shopping centers and places of employment are at a decent distance from the village, it will be difficult for residents who do not have their own car to get to the city on business.  Nevertheless, this does not stop buyers, since the ‚ÄúHoney Valley‚Äù has created truly excellent living conditions. </p><h2>  Housing purchase conditions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novoselovo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd barley architecture" class="if uuid-2974602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974602.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to participate in the shared construction program in order to profitably purchase high-quality housing, then the Honey Bar residential complex is best suited for this.  Feedback from equity holders argues that the main advantage in favor of investing is the reliability of the company.  For all the time of work, she did not give reason to doubt her honesty, and she always implemented projects on time.  You can buy an apartment both in cash and in a mortgage.  13 credit organizations cooperate with the developer, so there will be no special problems with the choice of the most favorable conditions.  As for the size of the average interest rate, it is at the level of 11.5 percent per annum, which, given the current market realities, is not too much.  In addition, you can take advantage of state support and apply for a mortgage on more favorable terms. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  If you are considering the option of buying a home in a new village, then such a solution has certain pros and cons.  Quite a lot of people already live in Barkli LCD "Honey Valley", who appreciated the area.  Among the main advantages of buying an apartment here are the following: </p><ul><li>  large selection of layout options; </li><li>  closed courtyard from cars; </li><li>  developed infrastructure; </li><li>  good environmental conditions; </li><li>  free parking; </li><li>  houses with good heat and sound insulation; </li><li>  relatively low cost per square meter. </li></ul><p>  Despite the large number of pluses, unfortunately, there were some minuses as well.  Near the residential complex there is a railway and an airport, so you can not even dream of a quiet and peaceful life.  As for free parking, yes, there is no need to pay for places, but there are very few of them, given that public transport does not go to the village.  As for everything else, everything is just wonderful. </p><h2>  What do residents say about the residential complex? </h2><p>  Customer reviews of LCD Barkley "Honey Valley" are practically all united and agree in one opinion that this housing complex is perfect for life.  The convenient location of complexes and buildings, a well-designed staircase and well-developed infrastructure will allow you to forget about the daily bustle of the metropolis and enjoy a little peace and solitude.  As for the shortcomings, they are insignificant, and given the affordability of housing, they completely disappear. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyman.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd barkley honey valley pros and cons" class="if uuid-2974576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974576.jpg"></div><p>  Once you visit the Honey Valley residential complex, you will fall in love with it at first sight.  Despite the minimalism in which the facades of buildings are filled, and the lack of bright colors, it is especially cozy here, and it creates the feeling that you are at home.  Apartments will especially appeal to those who are looking for a unique layout and author's interior design.  You do not have to spend time, effort and money on repairs, as you immediately get modern, stylish and comfortable housing.  However, if you work in Moscow, it makes sense to consider buying a property somewhere closer, since getting to work from the ‚ÄúHoney Valley‚Äù residential complex every day will be quite problematic, especially during peak hours, when many kilometers of traffic jams form on the Moscow Ring Road. </p>
