If the client does not have time to repay the debt in a timely manner, then a commission is charged on the balance of the debt, which is greater than on a regular consumer loan.  Usually banks offer 1.5-2 months of grace period.  Recently a new product has appeared on the market - a credit card with a grace period of 12 months.  How to get a Conscience card? </p><h2>  Product Brief </h2><p>  QIWI Bank launched an interesting new product - the Conscience card.  The principle of its operation differs from standard credit cards - the interest in using the funds is returned to the bank by the store where the customer made the purchase.  How many partners are transferred to the bank is not specified.  In case of timely age of funds, no commission is charged at all.  It will not work to cash out, as the card is intended only for non-cash transactions. </p>

    <h2>  Installment conditions </h2><p>  Each partner of the bank has its own grace period.  So, the stores in the Cafe and Products categories provide installments within 30 days, as the <span>average bill</span> in institutions is small.  That is, for gatherings with friends in a cafe you can pay in 30 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Stores from other categories mainly provide installments for 3 months.  However, there are several outlets that set a grace period of two, four, or six months.  You can get a Conscience card and immediately get a loan for the purchase of furniture.  In this case, the installment plan will be one year. </p><p>  The amount of goods is divided by the specified number of months.  In order for the purchase to become interest-free, monthly payments must be made in a timely manner. </p><p>  The official website of the card contains a complete list of partner banks with an indication of the validity period of the grace period for each of them.  This list and terms of service of the loan are constantly updated. </p><p>  In case of violation of the terms of the refund accrued: </p><ul><li>  one-time fine of 290 rubles.  for each delay; </li><li>  interest in the amount of 10% per annum. </li></ul><p>  When paying for goods, the card balance is reduced by the amount of the purchase.  Within the limit, you can perform an unlimited number of operations.  Each transaction is divided by the number of installment months. </p><h2>  Example 1 </h2><p>  The transaction amount is 18 thousand rubles, the grace period is 3 months.  Every month, 6 thousand rubles must be transferred to the account.  Reporting date - the day of the transaction.  If the purchase was paid on December 20, the first payment should be paid before January 20.  If the installment plan is only 30 days, then for this period you need to pay off the entire amount of the debt. </p>

    <h2>  Example 2 </h2><p>  Now consider an example in which a client issued several loans at once.  In January, the card paid for the purchase of a gas stove in the amount of 24 thousand rubles.  (installments - 4 months), sneakers for 8 thousand rubles.  (installments 4 months) and food for 7 thousand rubles.  (installment 30 days).  Monthly payments will be: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  February = 24/4 + 8/4 + 7 = 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  March = April = May = 24/4 + 8/4 = 8 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Why then need a card? </h2><p>  The process of processing and using plastic is very similar to a regular loan.  What is the difference? </p><p>  It is easier for people who often use borrowed funds to get a Conscience card once.  The advantages of the card is that each purchase turns into an installment plan.  And such operations can be done a lot.  At the same time, it is not necessary to sign any additional documents, as in the case of a loan.  Just pay for the services with plastic. </p><h2>  Refill </h2><p>  It is not enough just to know where to get the Conscience card; you also need to know how and where to replenish your account: </p><ol><li>  Cash through QIWI terminals.  To do this, just select the item ‚ÄúCONSCIENCE Card‚Äù, enter the number of the payment instrument or the phone number of the holder.  The operation is carried out without commission. </li><li>  Transfer of funds between cards is paid at the rates of the service used.  Today, Tinkoff, VTB and other lending institutions offer such a service.  To complete the transaction, it is enough to indicate the account numbers of the sender and recipient. </li><li>  Through a QIWI website or application.  Funds are debited from the electronic wallet.  As details you need to indicate the card number and phone number of the holder. </li><li>  You can replenish your account in the same way as you get a ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù installment card, that is, through the site of a payment instrument.  Funds can be debited from any bank card or electronic wallet.  The operation is not charged. </li></ol>

    <h2>  How to get a Conscience card? </h2><p>  Plastic processing is carried out remotely, since the payment system does not have offices for customer service.  This approach slightly affects the timing, but does not affect the quality of service. </p><p>  When processing plastic, the previous credit history and the load on loans already taken are taken into account.  But these are far from all the parameters.  If the borrower has a constant and confirmed source of income, then the probability of receiving a card with a higher limit increases.  How can I get a Conscience card? </p><p>  You must fill out an application for release.  The online application consists of three parts: the applicant‚Äôs contact details, passport details, and income information.  The decision to provide plastic will be made in a few minutes.  If the application is approved, the client will immediately be informed of the limit provided and an appointment will be made with the courier who will deliver the plastic and a package of documents. </p><p>  The next step is to activate the card.  The specified phone will receive activation instructions and a PIN code.  The procedure itself will be launched after the first purchase.  Until this moment, the card is not valid, service charges are not charged.  Here's how to get a Conscience card. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  The holder will receive information about all operations in the form of SMS.  Reminders about the next payment will be sent in the same form.  Even if the client has issued several loans.  The service is provided free of charge. </p>

    <p>  If the client constantly uses the card and repays the debt on time, the bank can unilaterally increase the limit.  For complete information about the conditions of servicing the card, you can contact the bank hotline.  Also, when applying for a card, the client will have access to the "Personal Account", which contains complete information about the status of the account and the conditions for paying off installments. </p><p>  Unlike other banks, QIWI Bank does not impose any voluntary-compulsory services in the form of insurance. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><ul><li>  Quick clearance.  How and where to get a Conscience card in Moscow has been described in detail earlier. </li><li>  The ability to pay by installments. </li><li>  The commission for the use of borrowed funds is paid by the store. </li><li>  Interest-free service. </li><li>  High maximum limit - up to 300 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Lack of required services. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><ul><li>  Inability to cash out funds. </li><li>  The card is valid only in partner stores.

    <h2>  Other nuances </h2><p>  The deadline for payment is the 5th day of the month following the loan.  However, bank employees recommend depositing the amount before the end of the current month.  A reserve of 5 days was taken to delay the transfer of funds to the account.  The day of debt repayment is the day the money is received.  The lack of the possibility of instant debt repayment is not liked by all customers, but all banks establish this requirement. </p><p>  In the event of a systematic violation of the terms of payment, the card may be temporarily blocked until the full repayment of all loans.  Early repayment of the loan does not incur any fines.  Information on the occurrence of delay immediately goes to the credit bureau. </p><p>  If a client paid several purchases with a card at once, and one of the loans was overdue, then the interest-free period for the remaining loans does not disappear.  However, the priority of payment repayment is changing.  Firstly, a technical overdraft is charged 10% per annum.  Secondly, all receipts to the card will first be sent to pay off this commission. </p><p>  The agreement says that when making regular purchases with a card, the bank may suspect a customer of entrepreneurial activity and block the account.  Moreover, what exactly is meant by a ‚Äúlarge sum‚Äù and ‚Äúfrequent purchases‚Äù is not specified. </p><p>  Closing an account will cause a lot of difficulties.  The bank has only one branch for the whole country.  Those who wish to cancel the account will need to send a notarial application by mail.  Moreover, in the same letter it will be necessary to return the card itself. </p>

    <p>  Expiration of the card does not mean termination of the contract.  For early re-release of plastic you will have to pay 590 rubles. </p><p>  Perhaps the biggest danger to potential borrowers is the following.  In the general conditions for servicing the card, it is said that the credit institution may change the tariffs for servicing the account as agreed with the client.  The latter refers to any customer actions regarding the bank (even a regular phone call) within 5 days from the date of publication of new tariffs. </p><h2>  How to get a Conscience card: reviews </h2><p>  The approval of the credit limit is carried out in two stages.  At the first, the client fills out an application on the site, and at the second, the security service checks the documents transmitted through the courier.  In case of inaccuracies with the data provided, the loan will be refused.  In this case, the client simply will not be able to activate the card, that is, to pay for goods with it.  Or after handing the envelope, a bank employee will call and inform you that the limit has been refused. </p><p>  The first limit will be no more than 15 thousand rubles, but if you use the card constantly, then it will increase over time.  Under the same conditions, a Tinkoff Bank credit card is provided.  The good news is that the limit cannot decrease, even if the client does not use the card.  On the other hand, the approved limit can be very small, and you can‚Äôt use the card as a full credit card. </p><p>  In case of violation of the terms of debt repayment, the balance will be charged 29% per annum.  Compared to the offers of other banks, we can say that QIWI Bank has a little conscience. </p><p>  The terms of the agreement clearly stipulate that all cardholders give their consent to receive advertising messages not only from QIWI Bank, but also from its partners.  But if cardholders can and do need to know about promotions, not everyone wants to receive notifications from taxi services or fast food restaurants. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Given all of the above, we can conclude that the new credit card from QIWI Bank is an interesting product that you need to be able to use.  Therefore, before you learn how to get a Conscience card in Moscow, check out the bank‚Äôs current tariffs. </p>
