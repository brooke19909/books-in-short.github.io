Its population is small, and the influx of tourists here even during peak season is not the same as in other regions, for example, in Phuket, however, this resort is considered one of the most popular destinations.  The Krabi coast, starting from the southern island of Lanta and ending with northern Phang Ng, is a series of picturesque limestone rocky mountains, overgrown with palm trees and exotic plants, and pristine beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anyavee railay resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1062115.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Krabi </h2><p>  Vacationing in this paradise will be interesting for almost all categories of vacationers: the shallow warm sea, numerous national parks, beautiful lakes, amazing animals found on hiking trails, kayaks, diving with fame throughout the world, surrounded by magnificent colored fish and starfish ... This is not a complete list of what can be seen on Krabi. </p><p>  The province is positioned by tour operators as one of the most successful and at the same time expensive vacation spots.  Every year thousands of travelers come here who equally want to get acquainted with the rich and mysterious Thai culture, personally see the most interesting places on Krabi and, of course, get their ‚Äúportion‚Äù of the sun, sunbathing on a clean sand and swimming in the gentle sea.  At the same time, there are not so many beaches.  Apparently, therefore, in the high season they literally do not bump into them, because there are plenty of people who want to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular beach - Railay - is surrounded by a rocky cape.  It can only be reached by sea transport.  Here, beautiful snow-white sand, several viewing platforms and caves and a real lagoon.  The beach is especially popular among young lovers and honeymooners who come here on their honeymoon.  There are no roads, cars do not drive, but there is a jungle. </p><p>  Another beach - Klong Muang - is perfect for those who avoid noisy companies and want to relax in peace and quiet.  Nearby, several hotels have been built with high "stardom", designed specifically for such a tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anyavee Railay Resort 3" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1062121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the Krabi province is unevenly developed.  There are still deserted beaches here, you can settle in detached bungalows that are practically isolated from the whole world, taste the local cuisine, which is based on rice and soy, fruits, coconut milk and, of course, seafood. </p><p>  Getting to Krabi is very easy.  A modern international airport has been built here, from which regular transport departs.  Almost all hotels in Krabi operate with a transfer.  Reseeding on a boat, tourists swim to any island that attracts attention, on which 2-3 hotels are built on the strength, and where, except for electric generators, nothing reminds of civilization anymore. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Far from the small cost of tourist trips to Krabi does not scare the Russians at all.  Experienced travelers know that a huge advantage of staying here is a wide choice of hotel.  You can choose the type of accommodation for almost any wallet and taste.  If you wish, you can stay in a chic five-star apartment, or you can simply rent a bungalow on the beach or go to a relatively inexpensive hotel with a 3 * category, for example, Anyavee Railay Resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anyavee Railay Resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1062119.jpg" width="600"></div>
