    <p>  On the coast of the Costa del Maresme region is a small resort town, namely Calella.  This place is ideal for an active and relaxing beach holiday.  On the area of ‚Äã‚Äãjust over 8 square kilometers, all the necessary infrastructure facilities fit: hotels, bars, restaurants, large shops and supermarkets, there are even excellent medical centers.  Perhaps the main advantage of the resort is the benefit of its geographical location: it is located on the Mediterranean coast almost in the neighborhood of Barcelona and Girona - the most beautiful cities in the country.  This is a decisive factor for many tourists, especially couples who want to be in a really beautiful place and have access to all objects of its infrastructure.  If we talk about hotels, then there are quite small hotels surrounded by greenery, offering good service.  We offer an overview of the budget hotel - Marisol Calella 2 *.  Reviews of real vacationers will help provide the most objective information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  If you are looking for an inexpensive hotel located in the center of the resort area, Marisol Calella 2 * (Spain) will definitely suit you.  The hotel is just 150 meters from the coast and 100 meters from the center of the spa town.  The hotel offers good service, friendly and pleasant service.  It is equipped with an elevator, so it will be quite easy for tourists to get to the necessary floor: you do not have to carry heavy suitcases on the stairs. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Check-out time at the hotel is 12:00.  Such information is indicated on many tourist portals.  Of course, the flight is far from always chosen in such a way that the tourist arrives strictly at the agreed time.  Nevertheless, after a long and tiring journey, I want to get the room keys as soon as possible, put things out, put myself in order and begin to relax.  What can tourists say to us?  Most of those who arrived earlier than 12:00 note that early check-in at the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel is not even a question.  All that vacationers can offer here is to leave things in a small snack and take a walk not until 12:00, but until 13:00.  Quite often, tourists have to wait for their number for several hours, which really tires, and sometimes even annoys.  By the way, the hotel staff speaks only English and German, so sometimes there are problems with explanation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  This is a fairly large hotel by local standards, offering tourists to stay in one of 63 comfortable rooms.  All rooms of the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel are equipped with air conditioning, providing freshness and coolness in each room.  Moreover, all vacationers can rely on heating, which makes the hotel suitable for relaxation not only in the summer, at the high season, but in the fall and even in the winter.  By the way, in Spain there are amazing ski resorts that are popular among modern tourists and vacationers. </p>

    <p>  Fully equipped with all necessary bath accessories and plumbing, the bathroom impresses many vacationers.  There is no hairdryer in the bathroom, which for some tourists has become a significant drawback.  Do not forget that you are going to a hotel of a low category, so do not expect more from the arrangement of rooms.  For two people, 4 towels are issued: 2 medium-sized and 2 bath towels.  Tourists complain that these towels are simply impossible to use: traces of repeated use have been identified, quite a few spots.  That is why tourists are better off taking towels from home.  Plumbing is far from new, but it works properly at the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel.  Photos of tourists demonstrate that the bathroom is small in size, but pretty clean.  Suitable for water and hygiene procedures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A chic terrace with stunning views of the resort's beauty is what the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel can offer vacationers.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that the hotel rooms are very small, but quite comfortable.  Of the furniture there are beds, bedside tables, a wardrobe, however, without hangers, a table with chairs and a mirror.  Of the shortcomings identified by vacationers, I want to note the non-standard size of the beds.  People above 170 cm will experience discomfort during sleep, as their legs will simply hang from the bed.  Bedding, in particular pillows and blankets, is not the latest, which can also spoil and disturb sleep.  For lighting in the room meets a small sconce.  The door to the terrace is tinted, and the curtains are so dense that sunlight hardly enters the room, due to which it is always very dark here. </p>

    <p>  The rooms do not have a TV, but, in principle, it is not needed on vacation in such a beautiful sunny country.  The lack of a refrigerator for many vacationers is substantial and tangible: there is nowhere to store soft drinks, wine, fresh fruits.  Being in the room, the products quickly lose their freshness. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  The staff is polite, friendly, but with cleaning and room service copes with the "C grade".  The rooms are not cleaned every day, and the presence of staff in the room is formal.  Some tourists complain about the tactlessness of employees who literally burst into the room in the late evening, disturbing peace and relaxation.  The maids just throw out the trash, occasionally change towels, there‚Äôs no question of any wet cleaning.  Tourists who spend 2 * weeks at the Marisol Calella Hotel may not even expect to be changed with bedding.  Actually, it‚Äôs stupid to expect a perfect service from a 2 * hotel </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Marisol <span>Calella 2 * (Calella),</span> despite the low category, tried to create all the necessary conditions for a quality stay.  That is why a nice outdoor fresh water pool appeared on its territory, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  It is located on the roof of the hotel.  Of course, in the season you can rarely see tourists here: most of them prefer to spend time at sea.  But as soon as it gets cool, vacationers take pleasure in sunbathing by the pool.  They clean it regularly, water of a comfortable temperature - what else do tourists need?  The swimming pool of the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel (Calella) is suitable not only for adults, but also for children.  That is why quite often couples consider this option for their vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  All vacationers can spend evenings in a public relaxation room, quite often they turn it into a full-fledged cinema.  Marisol Calella 2 * took care of the presence of an entertainment program with live music and artists - the quality is noted by many vacationers spending their holidays in this hotel. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Wireless internet is available only in the lobby for free: the speed is excellent, there are no connection problems.  At the reception you can use the fridge and safe for valuables for an additional fee.  The information desk works around the clock, due to which the solution of problems occurs at any time of the day or night.  Here you can get acquainted with the excursion program of the resort, learn all about how to get to Barcelona and other cities on your own.  At the reception, an airport shuttle can be arranged for an additional fee. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food that tourists purchase as part of the tour is organized in the neighboring Continental Hotel, located just a few minutes away.  Even the lunches that tourists order from the evening before the morning tour will have to pick up everything in the same neighboring hotel. </p><p>  The food is not the most varied, but quite high quality.  Breakfast includes fresh pastries, jam, cereal with milk, cheese and meat cuts, and drinks to choose from.  For lunch and dinner, tourists can taste chicken, fish, vegetables and fresh fruits - modestly, but quite tasty and satisfying.  Alcoholic beverages are available for a fee.  Tourists note that it is much more profitable to buy wine in local shops, and even in the resort's restaurants a glass of wine is much cheaper than in the Continental hotel. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  If you are looking for a place from which the beach is literally within easy reach, you should definitely look at the Marisol Calella 2 * hotel (Spain).  Reviews of tourists only confirm that walking to the coast for 6 minutes is a calm step.  In the mornings, the sound of the surf comes from the window - you can‚Äôt even dream of more.  The beach is sandy, the sea is clean at any depth.  The cool sea wind makes staying on the beach comfortable for both adults and children: it is never hot here. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  In general, the budget hotel Marisol Calella 2 * is a good option for tourists who rely on a good location of the hotel and expect to spend only a night in it.  He is often chosen by couples, including with young children.  Of course, the hotel is not without flaws, but for the money that it asks for accommodation, it‚Äôs silly to count on something more.  That is why we strongly recommend that you look at this option and evaluate it from all sides.  This is a great opportunity to save on your vacation. </p>
