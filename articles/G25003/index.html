Madara Park Hotel is located in the heart of the seething atmosphere of relaxation.  But at the same time, those who like a relaxing holiday or come with children who need a healthy sleep, will also be satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  This article will provide a comprehensive description of a four-star hotel in the center of Golden Sands.  We will talk about rooms, food, entertainment and services at Madara Park.  By the way, until recently, the hotel was called differently.  His name was "Smartline Madara."  It is no secret that tourists travel to Bulgaria and, in particular, to Golden Sands to swim in the sea.  In this regard, the hotel we are describing is not directly on the shore.  It is on the fourth line.  But this circumstance makes staying in it cheaper, and rest - calmer.  The reviews - and they served as the main source of information for writing this article - claim that the resort's promenade remains noisy around the clock.  And the park area in which the Madara Hotel is located gives peace.  How nice to wake up to the singing of birds, among the greenery!  What about the sea?  It‚Äôs six to ten minutes to go to him.  And if someone even finds this distance excessive, hotel transport runs to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madara park hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1402645.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The specifics of the resort Zlatni Pyasitsi </h2><p>  The Golden Sands resort, where the Madara Park Hotel 4 * is located, appeared on the map of Bulgaria relatively recently - in the middle of the last century.  However, from that time on, he managed to turn into the most popular resort in the country, stably crowded with tourists every summer.  And why?  A long and wide strip of golden sand stretches along the western coast of the Black Sea.  She gave the name to the resort, conveniently located between the cities of Varna and Kavarna.  The distance to the airport is small - about thirty kilometers.  The beaches in Zlatni Pyasitsi (the place is called in Bulgarian) are awarded the Blue Flag every year for cleanliness and comfort.  The resort has all the necessary infrastructure for a standard vacation: discos, restaurants, cafes, shops, sports facilities, amusement parks and other entertainment.  But that is not all.  In Golden Sands, you can not only relax, but also heal on thermal sulfur springs.  Despite the fact that the resort is new, there are also historical sights here.  Tourists mention excursions to the rock <span>monastery Aladzha,</span> caves and cute, typically Bulgarian villages where you can buy handicrafts.  Immediately beyond the beaches, a natural, state-protected park begins, consisting of hilly terraces covered with forest.  The tourist season is classic for Bulgaria: the summer months and September.  What is the specificity of Golden Sands?  Due to the shallow sea, they are considered a children's resort.  Balneotherapy hospitals attract those wishing to overcome joint diseases.  A variety of entertainments make Golden Sands the most party place in Bulgaria for young people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madara Park Hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1402639.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  Madara Park Hotel was built in Golden Sands one of the first - in the sixty-fifth year.  Naturally, since then the building has undergone a complete reconstruction more than once in order to bring the rooms in full compliance with the changing standards of European leisure.  The last repair took place last year.  The seven-story, curved hotel building is located on the fourth line from the sea, among a beautiful park.  The hotel reviews the territory of the hotel as extensive - eight thousand square meters.  In addition to the residential building, it houses a spacious swimming pool with a sunbathing terrace, a bar, a children's playground, and a parking lot.  Next to Madara Park Hotel is the Mimosa Hotel, passing through the territory of which you can shorten your path to the sea.  So you can walk to the beach in six to eight minutes.  And if you follow through the main entrance, then the road to the sea will take about ten minutes.  But reviews say that because of the temptation to buy inexpensive gizmos this way stretches for half an hour.  The center of Golden Sands is even less to go.  Reviews call Madara Park a rather large hotel.  But the soundproofing in the rooms is good, and the neighbors from Tagil will not spoil your vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madara Park Hotel 4 Bulgaria" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1402640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated at the Madara Park <span>Hotel 4 * (Bulgaria,</span> Golden Sands) </h2><p>  In the seven-story building there are two hundred and forty-two rooms.  Almost all of them are designed to accommodate two people (with the possibility of sharing a child).  The hotel has only ten rooms of a higher category - ‚ÄúApartment‚Äù, and even small bedrooms with a bathroom and shower for one guest.  There are twin rooms for families.  On the ground floor there are terraces adjacent to the guest rooms.  The upper rooms have balconies.  The decoration of the rooms meets the requirements of the Quartet.  The bedroom has air conditioning, which allows you to leave the summer heat outside the window, a safe and a minibar (their use is paid), telephone, satellite TV.  The bathroom comes with a hairdryer and toiletries.  Madara Park Hotel lounges in the shower.  Bed sheets are changed three times a week, and towels are changed every day.  Also, once a day, maids clean the rooms - judging by the reviews, carefully and diligently.  In general, many tourists mention the cleanliness of the hotel, which increases its rating among other Golden Sands hotels.  But there is a fly in the ointment in this barrel of honey: reviews complain that the code for ‚Äúwi-fi‚Äù in the rooms is provided for a fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madara Park Hotel Bulgaria" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1402643.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Madara Park Hotel 4 * (Bulgaria) accepts "package" tourists under the "All Inclusive" program.  When a treasured color bracelet is put on your wrist, you will have access to all the gastronomic pleasures that only the cooks and bartenders of the hotel are capable of.  However, the reviews warn, this is All Inclusive in Bulgarian.  That is, food and drinks are not available around the clock, but according to the regimen.  So let's get it right.  Breakfast is served in the main restaurant from half past seven to ten in the morning.  So, late birdies, hurry.  Accordingly, lunch and dinner are served from noon to two hours and from six to nine in the evening.  What to do if you do not have time for a meal?  To do this, the Madara Park Hotel operates a pizzeria from noon until half past four.  In this restaurant, in the buffet mode, you can taste not only the delights of Sicilian cuisine, but also other light meals and snacks, coffee, tea, fruits, ice cream, pastries.  But in the bars (one is located in the lobby, the other - by the pool) alcohol and soft drinks are free and in any quantities.  But - warned reviews - only local production.  Cuban rum or French champagne will have to pay.  The lobby bar is open until eleven in the evening, and the pool closes at sunset.  Buffets are served in the restaurant and pizzeria.  If you want an evening romance, inform the reception about this.  After all, the hotel also has a restaurant serving √† la carte guests.  You can reserve a table there once a week.  But even in an a la carte restaurant, imported alcohol is served at an additional cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Madara Park Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1402644.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  Almost every review of a stay at Madara Park Hotel mentions how delicious, varied, and nutritious food is at this hotel.  <span>Bulgarian cuisine</span> is excellent in itself, and many Russians, having tasted the dishes, became its followers.  The main restaurant often hosts themed dinners.  But if you are a strict adherent of traditional healthy breakfasts, you can always find cereals, yoghurts, cereals, sausages, scrambled eggs, fried eggs and the like on the tables - at home.  Reviews highly recommend going to a la carte restaurant.  It offers sophisticated cuisine, impeccable service and a romantic atmosphere overlooking the illuminated pool.  The reviews also note that if you arrived late when dinner is already over, you will still be fed.  And this attention of the staff to the guests is very nice.  The kids liked the ice cream - there were always five or six kinds to choose from. </p><h2>  Beach and pools at Madara Park Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  Golden Sands is famous throughout Bulgaria for its ideal coast.  A wide strip of the beach stretched for many tens of kilometers.  Only on the first strip of the sea in the resort there are about seventy hotels.  Madara Park Hotel is not one of them.  It is located on the fourth street, which runs parallel to the shore.  Nevertheless, tourists do not at all denounce the long and exhausting road to the beach.  After all, the relief in Golden Sands is flat, and you will not need to go down the stairs and climb the hill back to swim in the sea.  The beach is six hundred meters, if you go through the main entrance of Madara Park Hotel 4 * and further along the street.  But you can go through the Mimosa Hotel and fall on the golden fine-grained sand of the beach in six minutes.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are there in huge numbers, but, unfortunately, for a fee.  The hotel promises a transfer to the beach, but none of the tourists who wrote reviews used it - the distance was too insignificant.  The hotel itself has an outdoor swimming pool with a section for children.  The terrace around it is lined with sunbeds with soft mattresses and umbrellas.  Using them for hotel residents is free.  But the hotel also has an indoor pool with heated water up to twenty-seven degrees.  Access to it by hotel guests is free from nine in the morning until six in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madara Park Hotel Bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1403076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Madara Park </h2><p>  Madara Park Hotel (Bulgaria), receiving guests on the All Inclusive catering system, of course, takes care of their leisure.  The animation team works from morning to evening, igniting the guests with their enthusiasm and encouraging those to play boccia, indoor soccer, beach volleyball, table tennis, darts, chess, do aerobics or aqua gymnastics in the pool.  The fun does not subside in the evening.  Live music is played in the lobby bar, discos are organized.  But, say the reviews, exactly up to twenty-three hours.  Since Madara Park is positioning itself as a family-run hotel, they strictly monitor it so that nothing interferes with the peace of the guests.  There is also a small spa center on site.  There you can calcify the bones in the Finnish sauna or relax under the sensitive fingers of a professional masseur.  And also at Madara Park Hotel (Bulgaria) - reviews mention this repeatedly - you can play Russian billiards.  If hanging out at 23:00 seems like a cruel rule to someone, then outside the gates of the hotel, in Golden Sands, the fun does not subside until the morning.  In walking distance from the hotel is a disco "Bunker". </p><h2>  Excursions from the Madara Park Hotel </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, Golden Sands is a fairly new resort.  But it is located on the ancient land of Bulgaria, where it is full of diverse historical, cultural and natural attractions.  The Madara Park Hotel reviews are called a convenient starting point for small excursions in the region.  First of all, tourists highly recommend visiting at least one of the ancient coastal cities of Bulgaria - Sozopol or Nessebar.  There you can see the beautiful architecture and swim.  A tour of Varna on a bunk bus will leave the most vivid memories.  Also unforgettable will be a trip in a boat to zero kilometer along the Ropotamo River, the banks of which are covered with real jungle.  Guidebooks of Veliko Tarnovo are called the true spiritual <span>capital of Bulgaria</span> .  Although the ancient capital of the country does not lie on the coast, and it is two hundred and fifty kilometers from Golden Sands, it is the most visited city by tourists.  Cape Kaliakra is a tourist attraction that attracts both those who are interested in history and nature lovers.  A narrow ridge of a cliff protrudes into the sea for two whole kilometers.  The sea, splashing far below, seagulls overhead, the wind in the face ... And at the end of the cape are the remains of an ancient fortress, the capital of the medieval princedom, the chapel of St. Nicholas and a viewing platform from which you can take wonderful photos.  <span>Cape Kaliakra</span> is located only fifty kilometers from Golden Sands, but public transport does not go there.  You can only get your own or as part of an excursion group.  And very close to the resort - fifteen kilometers - is the Aladzha monastery dug in the rocks. </p>
