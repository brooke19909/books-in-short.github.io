  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Controlling an iPhone from a computer or phone from a PC: how to provide?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the introduction of new information technologies, more and more device management capabilities are emerging.  One of them is the remote control of a telephone from a computer and vice versa.  This feature is not new, but recently more and more relevant.  Using remote control, you can perform actions on the phone, having a computer at hand or vice versa.  This is very useful, because the device you need is not always with you.  This article will discuss how to control an iPhone from a computer. </p><h2>  Iphone firmware </h2><p>  Unfortunately, at the moment, Apple has not presented users with an original program for connecting to a computer.  Therefore, you need to reflash the phone, in other words, set root rights (as on "Android").  It should be noted immediately that such actions immediately void the iPhone's warranty, if any, so the actions are done at your own peril and risk. </p><p>  To flash the phone you need to download the Cydia Impactor application, and then follow all the instructions in the application for a successful installation.  It can even be considered a program for controlling an iPhone from a computer.  Since without this application it will not be possible to provide communication between devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cydiainstaller.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone app" class="if uuid-3169460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3169460.jpg"></div><p>  To control an iPhone through a computer using icloud, you need to create a backup copy of the device.  All operations are unstable, which is why a copy of the iPhone is created to secure.  To do this, you need to go to your phone‚Äôs settings and select iCloud.  Find the "Back up" button and click it.  This operation will require a Wi-Fi connection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Providing remote access to the phone </h2><p>  To control an iPhone from a computer, iOS 6 or higher firmware is required.  You also need to install the VNC Viewer extension on the Google Chrome browser.  This is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  In the browser in the upper right corner there are 3 points, clicking on which you need to find the item "Settings". </li><li>  At the very bottom of the settings, click the "Advanced" button </li><li>  Also at the end of the list is the item "Add accessibility".  When you click on this button, the Chrome Web Store will open. </li><li>  In the search you need to enter the name VNC Viewer and check the box "Extensions". </li><li>  Then you need to install the extension, following the instructions. </li></ol><p>  Now on iPhone you need to download the Veency application from Cydia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ios.gadgethacks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Management program" class="if uuid-3169468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3169468.jpg"></div><p>  After preparing the devices on the phone, go to Wi-Fi and remember the IP address of the iPhone.  To do this, you need to connect to your Wi-Fi network and see additional network information, where the device address will be written.  It must be entered in the Adress field when opening the extension in the computer browser (in the upper right corner near the search line).  Now you need to confirm the actions on the computer and on the iPhone.  After the operations, a window with a telephone display that can be controlled appears on the PC monitor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Controlling an iPhone through a computer also allows you to monitor the device‚Äôs camera.  To do this, on a PC, you need to select a camera in the phone.  Now all the shooting will be broadcast on the computer screen, however, this feature requires high speed Internet so that the two devices can quickly synchronize. </p><h2>  Preparing the computer for control from the phone </h2><p>  Controlling an iPhone from a computer is considered.  Now we will analyze the reverse process, that is, managing the computer from the phone. </p><p>  First you need to prepare your PC for operations.  Namely: enable the remote access function and set a password. </p><p>  To provide remote control on a computer, go to the control panel and find the "System" button.  On the left there is the item "System Security", in which you should also select the tab "Remote Access" and click on "Advanced".  A window opens in which you need to make sure that there is a check mark on the line "Allow remote control of this computer."  The PC is now ready for remote guidance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Remote control" class="if uuid-3169399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3169399.jpg"></div><p>  You should also put the password on the account with which you are working on the PC.  To do this, in the control panel you need to find and click on "User Accounts".  In the window that opens, click on "Manage another account", double-click on your account and select "Create Password".  Now you need to enter a convenient password, which is best written on a piece of paper, so as not to forget. </p><p>  The next step is to determine the name of the computer.  You need to go to the control panel and select "System".  At the bottom there will be a line with the name of the PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="PC name" class="if uuid-3169433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3169433.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing your phone for computer management </h2><p>  Now you need to prepare an iPhone for working with a computer.  To get started, you should download the Remote Desktop application from Microsoft from the AppStore.  In the installed program, in the upper right corner there is a button in the form of a plus, on which you need to click and select "Desktop".  In the corresponding field, enter the name of the PC, which was defined above.  Click "Save."  Now you need to log in to your account in this application by entering your username and password. </p><p>  It remains only to press a button that allows you to start broadcasting and controlling the PC, and enter the password given by the same program.  Now the user has the ability to control the computer from the iPhone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  With the help of the above manipulations, you can quickly synchronize the PC and iPhone and manage each other.  This article described the best practices for managing an iPhone from a computer and vice versa.  All others are less fast and irrelevant. </p>
