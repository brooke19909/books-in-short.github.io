They are enthusiastic about the appearance of new clothes in their wardrobe and are ready to demonstrate a pretty little thing to everyone around.  Moms can please their babies by knitting knitting a <span>sweater for the girl</span> with their own hands.  In just a few free evenings you can make a very beautiful and warm outfit. </p><h2>  What you need to knit a sweater </h2><p>  Having a desire and basic knitting skills, you can safely take on the manufacture of knitted clothes.  <span>You can knit a sweater</span> for a girl with knitting needles in a rather short time, the main thing is to decide in advance what the product will be.  The sweater can be warm, in which your little daughter will feel comfortable even in the coolest weather.  You can also make it light and delicate by choosing a suitable pattern.  Having decided what the little thing will be, you need to choose the right yarn.  If the threads are already in stock, then you can start knitting, otherwise you will need to buy them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweater for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1055695.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <p>  Before going for yarn, you first need to determine how much it will be needed.  On average, you can knit a sweater for a little girl of 450 g of thread.  If the thing will be knitted for a teenage daughter, it is better to purchase at least 800 g of yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The right choice of knitting needles </h2><p>  To make the knitted product soft and beautiful, you need to choose the right knitting needles.  If they are too thin, the canvas will turn out to be thick and rough.  It is also better not to use too thick knitting needles: it is unlikely that it will be possible to knit a warm thing with them. </p>

    <p>  To make sure knitting needles are suitable for a particular job, you need to try to knit a small sample with them.  If it turned out to be of good quality, you can safely start knitting a sweater for the girl with knitting needles.  If the obtained example does not look satisfactory, you need to choose knitting needles of a different size for work. </p><h2>  Pattern selection </h2><p>  To knit a beautiful <span>sweater for a girl with knitting</span> need to choose the right pattern.  The product can be knitted with one specific pattern, according to the scheme of which all elements will be made, including the front and rear shelves, sleeves.  You can also use a combination of different patterns.  For example, "Scythe" looks very original on a simple <span>hosiery knitting.</span>  They can be placed on all parts of the sweater or decorate only the front shelf and sleeves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweaters for girls" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1055586.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Knitting an openwork sweater for a girl with knitting is better from thin yarn.  The pattern should be appropriate.  Its scheme can be found in the literature on needlework.  Sites on which craftswomen share their knowledge of knitting can also help.  There you can find many ideas and, using them, knit a sweater for a girl with knitting needles.  The circuit should be easy to read, avoiding unnecessary difficulties. </p><p>  If the pattern is too intricate, you should try to knit it separately, and only then proceed with the manufacture of sweaters.  This will also allow you to see how approximately the product will be in the final result. </p><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  In order for knitted <span>children's sweaters with</span> knitting needles for girls to get the right sizes, it is necessary to make a pattern for the product before starting work.  If the needlewoman‚Äôs many years of experience allow it, she can also knit a suitable thing by eye.  But for beginners to practice knitting, it‚Äôs better not to risk it, so as not to waste time later on remaking.  An example for knitting can also be a sweater already in the girl‚Äôs wardrobe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork sweater for girls knitting" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1055697.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now you need to calculate how many loops you need to dial for each element of the product.  To do this, you need to connect a small example with the same pattern that will be used to make the sweater.  To do this, you need to dial about 20 loops and knit about 20 rows.  Then you need to use the ruler to measure the example and calculate how many loops are in 1 cm. Now the width of the pattern needs to be multiplied by the number of loops obtained earlier. </p><p>  When knitting, it is also worth considering that you will have to make an increase in loops for the sleeves and decrease in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe armhole and neck, so the fabric needs to be checked with the pattern. </p><h2>  Staple preparation </h2><p>  After all the individual parts are connected, they must be prepared for stitching.  To do this, you need to align the canvas of each element.  This can be done in different ways, depending on the yarn used. </p><p>  Items woven from wool or cotton thread are steamed.  To do this, you need a special board and a steam iron.  The item must be pinned to the board, bring the iron and use the steam function.  In this case, you can not put the iron on the canvas: from this it can be deformed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweater for girls" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1055696.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If artificial delicate yarn was used for knitting, then the fabric is leveled differently.  The details need to be pinned to the board using stainless steel pins and sprayed well with water using a spray gun.  After the canvas is well moistened, smooth it with your hands, avoiding excessive stretching, and leave it to dry completely. </p><p>  To process the elements of sweaters made of silk or other natural threads, you can use the following method: </p><ul><li>  the cloth is lowered into a bowl with cold or slightly warm water; </li><li>  After removing the part, slightly squeeze it out, avoiding twisting, which can deform it; </li><li>  the wrung-out cloth needs to be laid out on a towel, aligned and twisted into a not very tight roll; </li><li>  the resulting roll can be slightly squeezed so that the remaining water from the knitted part is absorbed by a towel; </li><li>  from the deployed roll, you need to remove the part and lay it out on a horizontal surface; </li><li>  giving the canvas the desired shape, it is left so until completely dry. </li></ul><h2>  How to sew finished parts? </h2><p>  The processed details must be sewn correctly to get a beautiful knitted sweater for the girl with knitting needles.  You need to connect them in this order: </p><ul><li>  shoulder seams; </li><li>  sewing on sleeves; </li><li>  side seams. </li></ul><p>  To connect the parts, it is better to take a not very long thread, which will avoid tangles and tears.  It is not recommended to tighten the thread too tight - this will make the seam wrinkled and too noticeable.  It is also worth checking that the seam line is flat.  If one part is a little longer than the other, then at the very beginning they need to be aligned and chopped with pins. </p><h2>  Neck processing </h2><p>  <span>Knitting a sweater for</span> girls ends <span>with a neck</span> finish <span>.</span>  To tie the collar you need to raise the hinges of the front and rear shelves, lowering every fourth.  Then the collar of the necessary length is knitted.  Often, for the manufacture of such a part, the "Eraser" pattern is used.  After making the closing element, a knitted sweater for the girl with knitting needles will be ready, and you can please the young fashionista with a new outfit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweaters for girls" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1055694.jpg" width="600"></div>
