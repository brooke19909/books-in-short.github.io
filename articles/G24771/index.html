  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oslo fjord in Norway: description, excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Norway is a beautiful country on the Scandinavian Peninsula, which is visited annually by millions of tourists to enjoy the mountains and glaciers, spacious valleys and high waterfalls.  The most famous sights of the country are the coastal fjords.  These are narrow and winding bays that go far into land.  The shores of the fjords are represented by high cliffs with many streams flowing down them. </p><p>  In this article, we introduce readers to a small Oslo fjord, on excursions in which you can go directly from the capital of Norway.  A pleasant walk will take a couple of hours, during which you will meet many small islands, Norwegian houses with a grassy roof and painted in bright red color.  The shores of the Oslo Fjord are not as high as the rest of the Norwegian bays, more like slopes, so they are so densely populated. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Most of the fjords in Norway are of tectonic origin.  As a result of sharp shifts of underground plates, cracks in the earth's crust and deep faults formed, which were immediately filled with sea water from the Norwegian and North Seas. </p><p>  Typically, the Norwegian fjords reach a depth of 800 meters or more.  Some crevices are of glacial origin, when melting of eternal ice expands river valleys and traces of tectonic destruction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.putokaz.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful sogne fjord" class="if uuid-2866269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866269.jpg"></div><p>  The most majestic and beautiful in Norway is the Sogne Fjord.  This is Norway's deepest bay.  Huge cruise ships can freely enter the fjord so that tourists from distant countries can enjoy magnificent views. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can take a <span>tour of the Norwegian fjords</span> in Oslo at any travel agency.  To get on a boat going on a tour of the bay, you need to come to Bergen or Voss. </p><h2>  Oslo Fjord </h2><p>  The capital of Norway is at the head of a beautiful fjord and is surrounded on all sides by gentle hills overgrown with forests.  In front of the Oslo City Hall, there is a seaport with pleasure boats, on which you can make educational trips to Museum Island and take a stroll along the Oslo Fjord.  The tour takes about two hours.  Its cost will be at least 32-34 euros.  The price tag depends on the type of excursion.  There are options with dinner on the ship, as well as with a stop for a walk through the woods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="people-dont-have-to-be-anything-else.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="start of fjord cruise" class="if uuid-2866258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866258.jpg"></div><p>  For fishing enthusiasts there are tours to this fjord with stops for fishing.  You can take individual tours or a trip on a wooden antique ship.  All excursions differ in price, which can be found at the ticket office. </p><p>  In any case, the reviews of tourists about the excursion to the fjord in Oslo are admired, people did not regret that they chose this type of vacation. </p><h2>  Fjord description </h2><p>  The Oslo Fjord is 102 km long.  It stretched from the south of Denmark to the capital of Norway in the north.  The surrounding mountains are in some places up to 1700 meters high.  The peaks of the high mountains are covered with snow, in many places you can see narrow but beautiful waterfalls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mylittleadventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful fjord" class="if uuid-2866218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866218.jpg"></div><p>  The Drebak Strait divides it into two parts - internal and external.  The exit from it is indicated by two lighthouses - Tornbj√∂rnskier and Ferder.  During the tour, tourists have the opportunity to admire the many small islands.  Along the bay are small towns and villages, in which about 2 million people live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing houses" class="if uuid-2866332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866332.jpg"></div><p>  Along the coast there are many fishing houses that go directly to the water of the fjord.  During the trip you can find many boats, old schooners sailing, small boats or canoes, modern boats and yachts.  If you wish, you can ride a kayak on the water surface of the fjord from Oslo yourself. </p><h2>  Ship Views </h2><p>  The sightseeing boat offers the most picturesque view of Oslo.  The town hall with two high brick towers is clearly visible, in which the famous Nobel Peace Prize ceremony is held every year.  The royal family arrives at this important event. </p><p>  Departing from the port, tourists can see the <span>Akershus castle fortress,</span> rebuilt in the 17th century Renaissance style.  It is kept in excellent condition and is surrounded by a fortress wall.  You can wander through its territory absolutely free.  Then you pass by Museum Island, where the ancient ships and historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof the country are preserved, as well as the Kon-Tiki and Ra raft, on which Thor Heyerdahl traveled through the waters of the ocean. </p><p>  Outside the capital, views of the city of Drebak and Oskarsborg Fort open.  Drammen and Halden are located on the opposite bank, as well as the fortified city of Fredrikstad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="views of the shores of the fjord" class="if uuid-2866336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866336.jpg"></div><p>  It is interesting to observe the appearance of more and more islands in the course of movement, of which there are more than 1000 pieces in the Oslo fjord of Norway.  It is surrounded by hills with rapeseed fields, on which are small houses and farm buildings.  If you're lucky, you can see grazing sheep or goats.  Seals are sometimes basking in the sun. </p><p>  Traveling around the Oslo Fjord is ideal for a long walk and exploring the nature of the country, especially if there is very little time to visit the large fjords. </p><h2>  Excursions from Oslo to the fjord </h2><p>  Tickets for tours to the nearest Oslo Fjord can be purchased at the marina in central Oslo.  Depending on your financial capabilities and the availability of time, you can make a trip in 2-4 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nifes.hi.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fjord fishing" class="if uuid-2866493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2866493.jpg"></div><p>  There is a short sightseeing tour, and there are long, with stops, fishing with experienced guides and a complete set of necessary equipment for fishing, including bait.  However, the cost of such a tour is almost 800 euros. </p><p>  One thing is for sure, even if you choose the minimum and most inexpensive excursion, you will be satisfied. </p>
