On its territory you can find chic palaces of the merchants and aristocrats living here, monasteries that were erected in the era of the strict Middle Ages.  The city has wide squares and narrow European streets, as well as amazingly beautiful nature.  It is in these places in the summer that you can see the sunset playing in a variety of colors.  It sets right in the ocean, leaving the skyline of Sintra.  Portugal, as the most western country in Eurasia, has a special charm that every tourist just needs to feel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sintra portugal" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279129.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This ancient city is located near Lisbon, and next to it is the famous Cape of Roca - the westernmost point of the continent.  However, unlike these two places, Sintra has a completely different climate.  The temperature here in summer rarely exceeds 30, and in winter it does not drop below 12-13 degrees.  The region is always humid and windy, but there are no real cold weather or hurricanes, since there is a mountain range nearby that protects the city from adversity.  Therefore, Sintra is the ideal place for a measured and relaxing holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Portugal is a real nature reserve, and this western town is the focus of most exotic plants.  The land here is so fertile that it delights all residents and tourists with unique shrubs and trees that are not found anywhere else in the world.  It also contributes to clean air, which is due to the mountains and waters of the ocean.  Such a green riot can hardly be found elsewhere, which is why people who suffer from respiratory ailments often come to this region to heal.  It is believed that this air and Sintra itself is the best doctor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sintra city portugal" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Portugal, like all Western European countries, is famous for its unique wines.  Many vineyards fall on the territory of this glorious town.  You can taste wonderful drinks in one of the local bars, among which the most famous are Binhoteca (a little expensive, but very sophisticated) and Lawrence's Restaurant (not to find a place more suitable for a love date). </p><p>  Sintra is also famous for its exquisite and extraordinary dishes.  Portugal in its culinary traditions inherited Italian and Spanish recipes, which were supplemented by local ones.  Therefore, here you can taste both delicious risotto and various <span>seafood dishes</span> cooked at the stake.  It is also worth noting that in Sintra, every tourist can find a restaurant to his taste.  Real palaces are also built here, which serve delicacies, and peculiar huts, colorful and national both in terms of cuisine and in terms of design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Sintra Portugal" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A separate topic is the sights of Sintra.  Portugal is a country with a rich history that has grown into architectural masterpieces in its territory.  The main palace of the city is considered Palacio Nacional da Vila, which was built here in the 15th century.  On the highest hill, the Pena Castle rises, which is a true embodiment of the tale.  Built in the 19th century and filled with the romanticism of the time, it is also surrounded by rose gardens, gardens and beautiful lawns. </p>
