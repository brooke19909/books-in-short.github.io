In order to facilitate this process, the management gave the task to the corresponding structural unit to create the official website of the tax service (nalog.ru).  This resource is an effective tool for a successful tax policy in Russia.  With its help, news in the field of taxation is brought to the payers, disputed issues are resolved, complete information is provided on the completion and procedure for submitting reports to the reporting bodies, and declaring income.  Also on this site registration of both legal entities and individuals is carried out.
