    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Gudauri is mentioned in written evidence from the 18-19 centuries, for example, in the works of N. Nefediev, A. Dumas, M. Lermontov.  This was due to the fact that here since ancient times there passed the most important transport route.  According to literary scholars, this locality, apparently, was used by Lermontov in creating the name "Gudal" from the poem "Demon".  The photographs of one of the tunnels, the post office building, as well as one of the drawings made by M. Lermontov have survived to this day.  This work depicts the so-called mystical fortress.  By the way it looks, you can determine that this gorge is near Belaya Aragvi, which is located on the other side of Gudauri.  In addition, a description of the Mljet descent is contained among the notes of A. Dumas.  Gudauri ski resort began to develop in the 70-80 years of the last century, and this process continues to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  State of slopes and lifts </h2><p>  You should definitely come here if you are looking for a ski resort in Georgia.  In Gudauri, more than twenty tracks with different levels of difficulty have been erected.  Most of them are suitable for beginners who want to learn how to ride or for children.  There is an opportunity to ride a snowmobile and at the same time not to interfere with skiers or those who ride a snowboard.  The resort also provides for inflatable sledding.  Each descent here is located above the forest, is certified and well prepared.  The resort provides continuous operation of snowplows, which at night clean more than two hundred hectares of the territory. </p><p>  Indescribable feelings will be experienced by someone who decides to use heliski - you will be delivered by helicopter to the descent, which is located among the pristine places that were not previously touched.  There is also a ‚Äúbackcountry‚Äù - at the same time you get yourself on foot.  The resort has more than one line of cable cars that potentially serve more than ten thousand people at a time.  Their work starts at 10 am and ends at 4 pm.  The expensive ropeways are equipped with their own generators, which allows the lift to function smoothly, even if an accident occurs and the power is turned off. </p>
