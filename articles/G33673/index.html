    <p>  The date of its foundation is considered the end of summer, namely August 25, 2004. Then the President of Tatarstan Mantimer Sharipovich planted the first cedar in the territory, which still pleases the eye of citizens.  With this action, the president wanted to wish the whole city and the park in particular long years of existence and great prosperity.  From the same time, the work of the Ferris wheel began, which opened to the residents and guests of the city wonderful panoramic landscapes.  Perhaps this is the first place worth visiting when arriving in Kazan.  Amusement park "Shurale" owes its name to the hero of the famous ballet.  He did not have a good reputation, but everyone appreciated the kindness of his soul. </p><p>  The base of attractions here is simply magnificent.  From many, it is simply breathtaking until the pulse is lost.  And we are talking not only about small children, but even about adults and elderly people.  The theme of cartoon characters and fairy tales is very well developed in this park, which can be seen even in landscape design and decoration of flowers and plants.  “Shurale” is a park (Kazan), which will appeal not only to those who just want to have fun, but also to lovers of national color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New name - new life </h2>

After a while, the park was renamed from "Shurale" to "Kirlay", as the authorities thought that this name more fits into the general mood and energy of the place.  The name was changed to a five-year anniversary.

    <p>  "Shurale" (park, Kazan) is equipped with all the necessary attractions and attributes of playgrounds, including swings, carousels, slides and other equipment.  It is worth mentioning that all of the above was brought here specially from Italy, which does not allow doubting the strength of the equipment.  This is famous for Shurale.  Park (Kazan) is considered an excellent place for leisure for the whole family: from small to large. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  The conditional demarcation of the territory into children's, family and extreme zones once again confirms that absolutely everyone can come there.  Among the attractions of this cultural and entertainment park, the most exciting are the Flying Saucer, the Wild Dance and the Tower of the Fall.  Children will certainly like reincarnation of cartoon characters as heroes.  All this is done with the help of skin-friendly paints of bright and cheerful colors. <br>  Also at the disposal of the kids is a multi-colored train that can take everyone to unexplored corners of the territory.  Trampolines and a Ferris wheel for children, which can provide an excursion no worse than a professional guide with a historical background, are still in great demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2>

    <p>  The park is aimed at family vacations, because there is a great deal of entertainment for adults, for example, a laser shooting range, a cafe with a varied menu, a race track, a petting zoo with the ability to touch and feed any animal from its hands, there is a chain carousel.  The cafe has developed an adult and children's menu, and there is also the opportunity to purchase cotton candy for parent and child.  There is a great demand for visiting the photo studio, which is professionally equipped specifically for commemorative photographs.  For all the time that has passed from the moment the park was founded until today, this place served as the territory for the jubilee of the journal Tele-7, and a concert in this place was given by the Lube group.  A huge number of various charity events were held, for example, a double show, an international festival on the occasion of Children's Day and other events.  "Shurale" is a park (Kazan), which often organizes health marathons and dance evenings devoted to various topics, for example, discos of the 80s and 90s. </p><h2>  Future plans </h2>

Naturally, this should lead to an increase in the flow of visitors.  It is also planned to equip the embankment near the river, which will significantly expand the usable area.  I am always glad to new guests Shurale Park (Kazan).  His address: st.  Decembrists, 1.

    <h2>  What visitors say </h2><p>  According to reviews of the park, the townspeople and guests are very pleased with this place, as well as with the cost of the services offered at the local cafe and the level of service.  The prices here are different, it all depends on the type of attraction.  <span>A trampoline for children</span> from 5 years old costs from 50 to 100 rubles.  For this price, the child will be able to jump about 10 minutes.  Guests from other cities who came to Kazan also note a loyal pricing policy.  "Shurale" is a park (the photo of the rides is presented in the article), where it is always fun, comfortable and inexpensive. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  A race track, that is karting, will cost parents only 150 rubles, a reasonable price for a fountain of children's impressions and emotions.  Mechanical carousels for children of all ages in the form of airplanes and horses will cost parents about 70 rubles per circle.  Boating is not a cheap pleasure.  He will have to pay about 150 rubles for 1 child, so it is better for large families to either stock up on finances or prefer cheaper options for children's leisure.  The Big Pirate ride will cost parents 120 rubles per adult and 70 rubles per child.  You can go to the Tornado for 130 rubles for a child, and an adult for 120. The effect is the same as on a roller coaster, so people with fear of heights should not attend this attraction. </p><p>  There are 2 <span>ferris wheels</span> (adult and child).  Prices - from 70 to 120 rubles.  Baby is spinning slowly, so there is absolutely no need to be afraid for the baby. </p><p>  Playgrounds are not recommended for visiting, since all slides and Swedish walls are already in many yards, and it’s a pity to give 60 rubles for this. <br>  The famous and beloved by many chain carousel will cost only 100 rubles for both adults and children.  Zorbing (riding inside the ball) costs 120 and 150 rubles. <br>  A lot of attractions from individuals (shooting gallery, room of fear, room of laughter and others). </p><h2>  Other services </h2><p>  Near the park there is a mini-beach, swimming is prohibited, but you can sunbathe.  There is also the opportunity to take great pictures and show off to friends. </p><p>  Often the park holds all kinds of promotions.  For example, a campaign was recently held, according to which excellent students, when presenting a diary with marks, could visit some carousels completely free of charge. </p><p>  All children and adults at least once must visit the park "Shurale" (Kazan).  Opening hours: daily, from 11.00 to 23.00, at the weekend the park receives guests from 10 in the morning. </p>
