  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Newspaper weaving</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, a very large number of people are engaged in needlework.  Some of them choose weaving to create unique, exclusive items, such as vases or baskets.  Such crafts have some advantage over purchased ones, you don‚Äôt have to spend money, you can make everything with your own hands. </p><h2>  Making the necessary materials </h2><p>  First of all, you need to figure out how to make tubes from the newspaper for weaving.  This is not difficult, the main thing is to comply with the following recommendations: </p><div class="photo" data-original="artncraftideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper rolls" class="if uuid-2259426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259426.jpg"></div><p>  You need to take any newspaper, expand and fold across.  First, the paper is folded in half, you can do this with each sheet or with all at once.  A necessary assistant in this matter will be a knife, either a kitchen option or a clerical option is used.  The newspaper needs to be cut at the fold, and then re-folded and cut again.  Thus, long strips of paper are obtained.  It is recommended that you immediately sort them into 2 heaps.  One will have colored pieces in the other white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sharingourexperiences.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving baskets from newspapers" class="if uuid-2259432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259432.jpg"></div><p>  When cutting newspapers, accuracy is important.  Notches should not form on paper, otherwise the work will not be very beautiful.  As a rule, for the production of a standard tube, a blank having a width of at least 7 cm is necessary, as for the length, it depends on how wide the newspaper is.  Such tubes can be used to make a vase, basket, box, or something else. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What paper can you use other than newsprint </h2><p>  Instead of a newspaper, office paper is also suitable.  For the manufacture of materials, the sheet is folded in half and cut.  Then it needs to be divided again and for greater convenience, bend the sheets at the edges in different directions.  The resulting strips are wound onto a knitting needle having No. 1.  It is worth noting that this technology allows you to get thin tubes that are suitable for weaving an elegant box from newspapers. </p><h2>  How important is the thickness of the knitting needles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wickerlandreni.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper weaving for beginners" class="if uuid-2259428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259428.jpg"></div><p>  Thin knitting needles are convenient when weaving newspaper tubes for beginners, but in this case the blanks are long and very thin.  It is recommended to work with knitting needles measuring 2.5 mm.  The resulting blanks are very convenient in the subsequent production of things from them, the conceived crafts will come out of high-quality and beautiful. </p><h2>  How to make white or colored tubes </h2><p>  In this part of the article, we will talk about options for colored or white blanks.  Yes, everywhere there are subtleties.  So, to get a colored tube for weaving, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Attach a knitting needle to the lower left corner of the strip and start wrapping paper on the knitting needle.  To make a good tube, you must make sure that the angle between the paper and the spoke is very small.  The twisting itself is done carefully, here you need to remember the fragility of the material, which should not be torn.  One hand rotates the spoke and the other holds the newspaper.  After the strip is fully wound up, there will be a small corner of the newspaper.  A drop of glue is applied to it to fix it.  After such a simple procedure, you can get the knitting needle. </li></ul><p>  Next, we will consider how to twist the newspaper tubes for weaving, so that they turn out white.  The trick is this: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  You need to take a strip of newspaper with white margins.  Attach a needle to the corner of the paper in the already described way and start twisting.  The white field should be on the opposite side from the place from which the workpiece is curled.  Thanks to this action, color images will remain in the inner part, and a white field will wrap them around, resulting in a blank having a white color.  It is important not to forget to glue the corner and then pull out the spoke.  White tubes are suitable for colored weaving, or in order to make the necessary pattern. </li></ul><p>  Having figured out how to prepare the necessary materials for weaving from newspapers, it is worth talking about how to perform some simple craft, such as a basket. </p><h2>  How to make a basket </h2><p>  Initially, it is worth noting that weaving <span>baskets from newspapers</span> is not so difficult and does not take much time.  The crafts themselves are of different sizes, it depends on how the basket will be used later.  For example, linen, children's toys, jewelry or much more will be placed in it, at the discretion of the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://djirecords.com/basketry-newspaper-tubes-the-best-workshops-and/"><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving newspapers step by step" class="if uuid-2259633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259633.jpg"></div><h2>  Detailed instructions for weaving newspapers for beginners </h2><ol><li>  The prepared material needs to be crushed a little in the middle and twisted criss-cross for 2 pieces. </li><li>  Then more tubes are added in an arbitrary amount, but in such a way that there is an odd number on one side of them.  To get a small basket, 5 blanks are placed on one side and 4 on the other. They are also interwoven crosswise. </li><li>  Here begins the formation of the bottom.  The tube is taken from the odd side. </li><li>  This type of weaving is considered the simplest.  The workpiece is threaded around and goes above and below the remaining tubes. </li><li>  If the tube comes to an end, then it needs to be increased, using glue for this along with another tube. </li><li>  While weaving, you need to align the braided sticks so that they lie flat. </li><li>  The work is carried out until the desired bottom diameter is obtained.  Checking this is simple by installing a form that will be braided in the next steps.  The bottom itself should have a slightly superior width compared to the shape. </li><li>  With a suitable size, you need to raise the tubes, bending them from the bottom and secure using an elastic band or rope. </li><li>  At this stage, the formation of the series continues. </li><li>  It is necessary to add to the height that is necessary, and then pull out the form. </li><li>  If you need a basket with different widths, it is recommended to change the molds as needed. </li><li>  It remains to figure out what to do with the sticking tubes.  They simply wrap themselves inside the craft and hide. </li><li>  The easiest way is to bend the blanks for each other.  If there is a desire to decorate the basket with little ruffles, then the tubes do not tighten much. </li><li>  To make it easier to thread the tips between the horizontal rows, you can use a crochet hook or knitting needle. </li><li>  All tips are fixed with glue. </li></ol><p>  So, with weaving from newspapers step by step everything should be clear.  Creating a simple round basket can be considered complete.  But if there is a desire to work a little more and make your craft more original and beautiful, it is recommended to continue acquaintance with the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving newspaper tubes for beginners" class="if uuid-2259683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259683.jpg"></div><p>  The basket is, of course, good, but so that it can be easily transferred from place to place, it should attach a pen. </p><h2>  How to make a handle for a basket </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.troomtroom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to twist tubes from weaving newspapers" class="if uuid-2259649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259649.jpg"></div><p>  There is also nothing complicated.  To make a pen, you will need 2 paper blanks and the following tips: </p><ol><li>  The tubes are inserted between the rods and bent in half.  Thus, 4 threads for weaving from newspapers are obtained. </li><li>  They are the ones who make the pigtails. </li><li>  If the process does not have enough length, then it needs to be increased.  This method has already been discussed earlier. </li><li>  At the end of the weave, those leftover ends slip through the rods, and the excess parts need to be cut off. </li><li>  The tips are tucked and seated on the glue. </li></ol><p>  Now you can inspect the craft, which currently has a white or colorful color.  It all depends on which blanks have been selected.  To give the basket a more natural look, just paint it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make straw from newspaper for weaving" class="if uuid-2259642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259642.jpg"></div><h2>  Finished product painting </h2><p>  To paint a handmade masterpiece, you need to purchase a color scheme of your favorite color and white paint with a water base.  All of these materials are sold in hardware stores. </p><p>  The selected color is applied to the basket with a brush, both outside and inside.  If desired, small stripes are formed with white paint to make the basket look even more beautiful.  For application, you can use a sponge or a thin brush.  It is important to remember that the first layer must be dry. </p><p>  And if you apply varnish, then the basket will become glossy and more attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper weaving" class="if uuid-2259687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2259687.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a little trick, so as not to paint the product and not waste your time, you can pre-paint the blanks in any desired color.  Of course, they will need to be dried before work, but it will not take much time.  An obvious plus of such preparation is that you can create colorful, colorful products using newspaper tubes of different colors. </p>
