    <h2>  When you need to know the location of the subscriber </h2><p>  Different situations happen in life.  Very often people want, but cannot find each other.  Then locating by phone number is the only way out.  For example, we agreed to meet in an unfamiliar area or city, but you can‚Äôt navigate the terrain.  Or the child after classes went to a friend, forgot to call, and parents need to find out where he is.  In this case, the help of the coordinator is needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="locate a person by phone" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/376523.jpg" width="600"></div>  As mentioned above, it is possible to find out the location by the number of the cellular device.  A very common case is to search for your own missing or stolen phone.  Here it is already possible to use special pre-installed programs.  There are situations when there is a search for the missing person or the search for a criminal who is hiding from justice - in this case, special services also resort to the help of mobile operators.  If you determine the location of the phone in your pocket, then the person can no longer hide.  "Spy games" are also not ruled out when the bearing is not entirely legal.

Locating by phone number is sometimes necessary for various reasons, so applicants may be different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to locate a mobile phone" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/376533.jpg?1397733305794" width="294"></div>  The most important condition is that the one who made the request for the service must be entitled to it.  If the search is conducted through the operator using his SMS services, then the consent and confirmation of the ‚Äúlost‚Äù party is required.  If you use a special direction finding program that uses GPS or GLONASS technology, then the person again knows that he has such a beacon.  Without the consent of the subscriber, it is possible to find it only with the sanction of special services.

    <h2>  When you can not find out and why? </h2><p>  It is not always possible to determine where the subscriber or phone is located.  How to determine the location of a person if, for example, he turned off his cell phone?  In this case, the system does not work.  You cannot find out where he is in this period of time.  In the case of a phone theft, the thief just needs to change the SIM card, and the search will become impossible.  In addition, you cannot find a person if he does not confirm his consent to the transfer of data. </p><h2>  Which operators support the service </h2><p>  Today, the largest Russian operators have the ability to locate by mobile device.  Giants such as MTS, for example, provide a service called Locator.  Its use is reduced to simple actions: you need to send a message to the short service number 6677 containing the phone number of the lost person.  Then a text notification will come to him with a request to confirm his whereabouts and consent to the transfer of such information.  This is the main condition.  If the subscriber agrees, then his location will be announced, and if he refuses, then no one will know where he is currently located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to locate by mobile" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/376545.jpg?1397733560218" width="428"></div>

You need to send a request to USSD: * 148 * No. of the missing #, and if the subscriber agrees, his location will become known to you. </p><h2>  What actions do not need to be done? </h2><p>  The Internet is replete with sites that offer programs that allegedly report on the location of the phone, bypassing the operator.  Are they worthy of your attention?  As practice shows, such programs turn out to be ordinary games.  Or, if you're not lucky at all, with dangerous viruses.  Better to use beacon programs created by trusted developers.  They are recommended to download from official sites.  Many programmers claim that with the help of their developments, you can certainly determine the location of a person by phone.  But this is not always the case in reality.  The cellular communication system has been developed for a long time and is considered one of the most reliable in terms of secrecy, so you should definitely not trust such statements. </p><h2>  How to calculate the location </h2><p>  Operators use the capabilities of their radio towers to search, for beacon programs it is necessary that both cellular devices are connected to the Internet.  The operator detects a mobile phone with an accuracy of 100-200 meters according to the layout of its base stations.  For ordinary users it is impossible to determine the location by phone number with greater accuracy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to locate a person" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/376524.jpg?1397762959963" width="266"></div>  Navigation programs send a request to the server, and from there to the satellite.  He searches for a phone with the given parameters and sends the received information to his subscriber.  Accuracy is usually higher (plus or minus 50 meters).  To use navigation systems, access to the network is required, since interactive maps are used: Yandex Latitude or Google Maps.

    <h2>  Modern technologies </h2><p>  Special services or the Ministry of Internal Affairs use other technologies to search for missing people.  When the phone is turned on, he searches for the nearest tower.  This is how his work works.  Since the towers are located on the ground more often than the base stations, and their radius of action is about 50 m, then determining which tower a particular subscriber is connected to, you can find out its location with high accuracy.  But this is the radius in which the person may be located, that is, the search area in this case is 8.5 square kilometers. </p><p>  If you connect special equipment and software, then tracking is carried out from several points.  In this case, it is possible to determine the exact coordinates on the ground, and the search area narrows to 1 sq.m.  Since the target, as a rule, is constantly moving, the points from which the bearing is also constantly changing.  Therefore, updating the operational data takes a few seconds.  Despite the complexity and high cost of such search operations, they are very effective and are used by "specialists" to detect and eliminate dangerous criminals. </p><p>  Since locating a mobile phone is quite an expensive pleasure, bearing technology is constantly changing and improving.  If earlier only special services could afford such means of tracking, then today it is available to a wider circle of people.  Groups of programmers with sufficiently good training and a strong technical base are able to create a tracking system for a particular area, simply by going to the frequencies of the stations and entering them into the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="locate the phone" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/376522.jpg?1397733459990" width="286"></div>  They develop algorithms that allow you to calculate the coordinates of the target with high accuracy.  In addition, some manufacturers of mobile phones supply them with direction finding equipment, which send a signal that is independent of the SIM card to the navigation satellite with a certain frequency.  So you can track the phone until it turns off.

    <h2>  How much is it </h2><p>  For ordinary people, the phone search service is available for a nominal fee.  This allows you to use this service to a wider circle of people, if the search is conducted using the capabilities of the operator.  Services such as Locator and analogues cost from 2 to 12 rubles per request.  Software used as a beacon is priced not much more expensive.  Thus, legal search methods are quite accessible to any subscriber of a cellular network. </p>
