What is the focus of this hotel?  How far is it from the sea?  And what is nearby, in the resort of Colva and even further in South Goa?  We learn all this from the reviews of tourists who visited the hotel.  Travelers from the homeland at this hotel are few.  Whether you consider this a huge plus or a disadvantage of the hotel complex is up to you.  But those who rested at the hotel did not complain about room decoration, food, infrastructure and animation.  Although they pointed to certain specifics of the hotel.  Which one?  Read about it below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baywatch resort 4" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1029553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location specifics </h2><p>  Where is Baywatch Resort 4 * located?  South Goa is just a part of the state of India.  But how she does not look like her northern sister!  Goa was discovered as a hippie party place in the seventies of the last century.  Gatherings to the trance music, parties on the verge of breaking the law (when it is not clear which grass is burning), huts under <span>thatched roofs</span> with a minimum of amenities, cows on the beach - all this is now left.  But only in North Goa.  In the southern part settled quite decent people with money.  Luxurious hotels stretch along the coast with a well-kept beach.  Their guests are cherished and cared for in Ayurvedic salons and spas.  Do you want to see "real India"?  Nothing is simpler: north of the mouth of the Zouari River, which is the symbolic border between the two parts of Goa, you will find it in abundance.  But do not be afraid that in the south you will not see the real luxurious Indian nature.  Under the nose of vacationers, as evidenced by the reviews, there is a real reserve.  Here you can get acquainted with wildlife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baywatch resort 4 south goa" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1029555.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Colva specificity </h2><p>  Colva - this is the name of the largest and oldest resort on which the Baywatch Resort 4 * hotel is located.  Goa (here we are talking about the southern part of the state) is a vacation destination for wealthy retirees from Western Europe.  But Colva has its own specifics.  It is the most fun resort in South Goa.  There are even night rave parties, remotely resembling those that are arranged nightly in the north of the state.  European youth loves to rest in Colva.  It is she who brings revitalization and drive to a sleepy, cozy city.  On weekends, Europeans are joined by residents of the county capital, the city of Margao.  Wealthy Indians rent luxurious <span>colonial-style</span> villas on the beach.  Another specificity of Colva (and the whole state of Goa) is the spread of Catholicism among the local population.  The fact is that until recently this area was under the protectorate of Portugal.  The colonialists left behind the Mediterranean buildings, and the missionaries left the elaborate Baroque churches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baywatch resort 4 goa" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1029564.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location specifics </h2><p>  Baywatch Resort 4 * is located on the southern tip of Colva, on the second line of Sernabatim Beach.  Tourists called this place hungry for entertainments ‚Äúa dead zone‚Äù, and lovers of a relaxing holiday - ‚Äúa paradise‚Äù.  Palm trees inclined above the azure waters offer complete relaxation.  But if you suddenly want to gulp at some party, then it‚Äôs only one kilometer to Colva.  Dabolim Airport is twenty-eight kilometers away, and Margao Railway Station is six.  If you follow to the south, you will find yourself in another resort town - Benaulim.  Sernabatim Beach, in addition to serenity and tranquility, is also famous for its excellent bathing conditions for poor swimmers.  The waves are small, there are no currents.  The sand, according to reviews, looks like semolina - white and round.  Beach infrastructure is well developed here.  But the most wonderful thing in Sernabatim is the sunsets.  Every evening people come here to admire them.  Well, those who can‚Äôt swim at all can swim in the hotel‚Äôs shallow pool.  It should be said that sunbeds, umbrellas and towels around it are absolutely free, which cannot be said about the amenities on a public beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baywatch resort ai 4" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1029585.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The specifics of the hotel Baywatch Resort 4 * </h2><p>  Reviews do not always agree with the statement that the hotel is on the second line.  Three two-story buildings are indeed located across the promenade from the sea.  To get to the beach, you need to go through the well-kept and shady area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Camil Sons Beash.  The road to the sea takes less than five minutes by walking.  But this hotel complex has villas on the front page.  This part of the hotel is called ‚Äú1 Baywatch Resort AI 4‚Äù.  Needless to say, living in villas is much more expensive than accommodation in buildings?  But the budget option, assure reviews, is very comfortable.  Two-story buildings stand in the middle of a well-tended tropical garden.  The location of these buildings is such that vacationers do not see or hear each other.  Everything here is aimed at getting a quiet and measured rest.  Tourists especially praise accommodation on the second floor. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  Three two-story buildings of the Baywatch Resort 4 * hotel accommodate seventy-six Deluxe rooms.  According to <span>tourists, these are</span> spacious rooms with a balcony.  The filling of the room as a whole corresponds to the stardom of the hotel.  It has silent air conditioning, a safe, a minibar and a TV with satellite channels.  In the bathroom, in addition to hygiene items, vacationers will find a hairdryer.  In addition, there is always a kit for making coffee or tea yourself.  Every day, the servant puts a new liter bottle of drinking water.  Tourists happily note the presence of "Wi-Fi", and free of charge.  The villas on the first line accommodate sixteen suites.  These rooms are even more spacious (thirty-nine square meters versus twenty-five).  Terraces adjoin them.  The equipment of these rooms is somewhat better than the "deluxe". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baywatch resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/88648.jpg" width="600"></div>
