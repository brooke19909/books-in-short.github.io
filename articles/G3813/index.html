Mobile Phone Nokia 222</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not so long ago, any device under the Nokia brand evoked trust and delight.  But, like for many contemporaries of this company, the pursuit of fashion and saving on vital elements of devices brought the brand rating to the very bottom.  ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù was resold to other owners, but this did not significantly improve the condition of the once popular company.  Smartphones with this name are no longer available. </p><p>  However, not so long ago, a regular mobile phone called Nokia 222 was introduced, the price of which is below $ 40.  This phone has fallen in love with all lovers of the classics.  Of course, this is not a budget smartphone, which we are so used to.  However, there is something in this device that will make you think about purchasing it. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  About "Nokia 222" specifications, reviews are pretty clear - the perfect device for calls and SMS.  A high-quality housing that is not afraid to lie in your pocket with small things or fall flat on the ground.  Of course, scratches cannot be avoided from such frauds, but you won‚Äôt have to worry about the operability of the device. </p><p>  As usual, the company offers to purchase Nokia 222 in several color variations - white and black case.  If the second option is monotonous, then the white phone has a black frame around the display on the front panel.  But this is rather a virtue, because visually the phone looks pretty stylish and interesting.  By the way, white does not collect fingerprints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Large, comfortable keys will appeal not only to older people.  Those who like to type text ‚Äúblindly‚Äù will appreciate the softness of pressing keys and their bumpiness. </p><p>  On the back cover of the Nokia 222 phone is a grill for the speaker and camera.  The logo itself flaunts in the center.  Everything is very reserved and stylish.  In a word - Nokiev classic. </p>

    <h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  At the top end is a medium power diode flashlight.  There you can also find a standard headphone jack or headset.  I am glad that accessories with a classic plug are suitable for the device.  On the other side of the flashlight, you can easily find the standard micro-USB port for charging the device and connecting it to a computer. </p><h2>  Models </h2><p>  In fact, this model came in two variations.  One of them is Nokia 222 Dual Sim, the other is just 222. What are their differences?  The name of the first speaks for itself - two SIM cards.  This is undoubtedly a great solution for those who always want to stay in touch and not drag a few devices.  But there is a drawback.  Unfortunately, in talk mode, the second card becomes unavailable.  But this, alas, is part of almost every modern mobile device.  According to the inscription under the battery, "Nokia 222" specifications, reviews and reviews on which the Internet is flooded, is done in Vietnam.  Those who do not like the technique from China will be delighted with this news.  It is curious that even replacement parts are delivered from Vietnam, although the repair of the device is a rare occurrence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The device is classic for Nokia.  Standard candy bar with a 2.4-inch display.  It is noteworthy that the developers took care of a good resolution - 320 by 240 pixels.  The screen is capable of delivering up to 65 thousand colors, because there are 167 pixels per inch. </p><p>  As for weight, a phone with a battery weighs less than 80 grams.  And this despite the fact that its dimensions are 116 by 50 by 12.9 millimeters.  Such indicators are identical both in a simple model and with support for two SIM cards. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The most striking "Nokia 222" specifications (reviews confirm this) is the presence of a lithium-ion battery.  Not only is it a BL-5C class, it also has a capacity of about 1100 mAh.  Simply put, in constant load mode the device is able to work autonomously for at least 20 hours.  In standby mode, a simple model will last about a month, and Duo Sim - 20 days.  Not bad for a simple dialer, is it? </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Even if you need a device exclusively for calls, it‚Äôs nice to realize that the developers made sure that the device supports a memory card up to 32 gigabytes, which, if necessary, you can download your favorite music and listen to it on the way to work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The phone was not deprived of the native memory either.  Although 19 megabytes cannot be called chic, several tracks and a rather spacious phone book are a minimum necessary for a modern person. </p><h2>  Games </h2><p>  About the games for "Nokia 222" is worth mentioning separately.  Of course, the Internet is full of sites with various toys and programs for any device, but Nokia concluded an agreement, according to which, when you purchase a Nokia 222 mobile phone, you automatically get the opportunity to download one free game from Gameloft per month.  You can use this service during the year, then the games become paid. </p>

    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  This is not just a phone.  Manufacturers themselves have repeatedly emphasized that it has a number of advanced features, namely free access to the Internet. </p><p>  In Nokia 222, the technical specifications made it possible to enter a number of applications specially adapted for Nokia Series 30+ - the operating system of this device.  Among them are Opera Mini, the favorite browser for everyone, weather applications and several popular social networks, and the Bing search engine. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs call is polyphonic.  But this does not stop to challenge your favorite music.  By the way, the phone is "friendly" with the most popular formats - MP3, AAC and, of course, MIDI.  Therefore, some craftsmen have learned to install interesting players and are very proud that there is such an opportunity on the phone. </p><p>  If you focus on what they say about the "Nokia 222" specifications, reviews, the phone is quite loud, but with a somewhat "barrel-shaped" sound. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Given the Nokia 222 cameras specifications, user reviews are paying off.  Only 2 megapixels!  For a modern person, such indicators are nothing.  Nevertheless, if you buy the phone for an elderly person, then the camera is unlikely to be useful to him, but for the rest it‚Äôs a dialer with advanced features, remember?  For a few urgent shots this will be enough. </p>

    <h2>  Nice bonuses </h2><p>  The rest, average in quality, but surprising in relation to the price of the device, features include: </p><ul><li>  Bluetooth 3.0  Such an addition will allow you to use the bluetooth headset and transfer files to others with pretty good speed. </li><li>  FM radio  Headphones act as antennas. </li><li>  The ability to flash the device.  Surprisingly, modern craftsmen already today offer several interesting options to change not only the design of the menu or screen, but to completely change the firmware. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Of course, when deciding to purchase a Nokia 222 phone, specifications, user reviews should interest you, they play one of the decisive roles.  Let's try to put everything on the shelves. </p><p>  Aspects against the purchase include the following items: </p><ul><li>  Weak operating system.  Many reviews claim that the system is inferior to the previous one. </li><li>  Little native memory.  Yes, 19 megabytes is not what you expect to see on the phone in our century. </li><li>  The size of the SIM cards is standard.  Most modern smartphones and phones support micro-SIM devices, so you will either have to look for an adapter, or change cards at all. </li><li>  Lack of wifi module.  Say what you like, and wireless Internet access has become something of a must for most users. </li><li>  Small screen. </li><li>  A weak camera is only 2 megapixels and no flash. </li></ul><p>  But if you analyze that this model is offered exclusively as a phone, and the rest is just additional bonuses, then the disadvantages fade, and the advantages take on a completely different shade: </p><ul><li>  The Nokia 222 has a price of less than $ 50. </li><li>  Sufficiently capacious and autonomous battery. </li><li>  A high-quality browser, adapted to the system, without disproportionate pages and poor-quality data reflection. </li><li>  Support for large memory cards. </li><li>  Little weight.  Some compared it to the weight of an aluminum bumper on an iPhone. </li><li>  Loud speakers, both primary and conversational. </li><li>  Impact resistance.  No one offers to be a hammer on it, but nothing catastrophic will happen from falling onto the asphalt. </li><li>  Readable TFT screen.  Colors do not hurt the eyes, and letters do not look ugly dots.  This is rare for <span>push-button phones.</span> </li><li>  Practicality.  The phone is distinguished by its ergonomics, functionality that is pleasant in relation to the price and simply easy, pleasantly lies in the hand. </li></ul><p>  And this is the little that admires this model.  Each of the shortcomings is justified by the low cost of the device and its purpose - calls and messages.  Let Nokia be the wrong one and the concept has changed.  This phone reflects the spirit of the brand - simple, elegant, reliable and, best of all, does not bite the price.  Such a device will serve a long service to people with whom it is most necessary to keep in touch - elderly parents and young children.  This phone will be no less appropriate for those who share the concepts of entertainment and communication, buying a phone and gadgets separately. </p>
