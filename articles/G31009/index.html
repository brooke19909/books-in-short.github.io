    <p>  Greece is a relatively small country and can be compared in size with the Orenburg or Kirov region.  Going round it yourself will not be particularly difficult, given the fact that the transport network is well developed.  We will tell you about how to get to Epidaurus, what to see in the ancient city, and also give some tips that are useful before visiting the theater. </p><h2>  About city </h2><p>  The history of the city of Epidavros is rooted in the Mycenaean era.  In the old days, he was quite active and had a certain political influence.  Colonies were founded on the islands of Kos, Aegina, Tenedos and Nisyros.  Decline occurred in the sixth century BC, when the trade conducted by Epidaurus began to decline.  Power passed into the hands of the oligarchy, which in the Peloponnesian Wars acted as an ally of Sparta.  As a result, the city was repeatedly raided by the Athenians and their allies.  In the future, he completely disappeared into obscurity, retaining its significance only as a port at the great temple and Asclepius sanatorium (the ruins in the photo below). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  His cult first appeared in these places in the 6th century BC.  e.  After a hundred years, numerous pilgrims rushed into the city, praying for healing.  Already in the 4th century BC.  e.  the sanctuary at Epidaurus has become one of the most revered and largest in all of Greece.  It flourished under the Romans.  The pagan temple was closed in the 4th century during the reign of Christianity Theodosius I the Great. </p><p>  Now Epidavros is a small fishing village.  An ordinary tourist can get to him in three ways. </p><h2>  Theater in Epidaurus: how to get there by bus? </h2><p>  Epidaurus has a rather favorable geographical position.  The distance from the country's capital city of Athens is only 130-140 km.  Nearby are Corinth (60 km) and Nafplio (30 km).  You can get to Epidaurus from Athens by public transport.  To clarify the availability of tickets and their price should be at bus stations.  During the festival season, a special bus travels from Athens.  He takes tourists to a concert, and then takes him back to the city.  The cost of such a ticket is 23 euros, and the journey takes about two hours. </p><p>  In addition, you can get to the theater in Epidaurus (photo from the text of the article) on your own or rented vehicles. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2>

    <p>  The easiest way to visit the ancient city is to buy an excursion and comfortably get to the place.  As a rule, local tour operators offer to visit Epidaurus as part of a combined tour of Argolis (prefecture in the Peloponnese administrative district), which also includes excursions to Nafplio (the ancient capital of Greece) and Mycenae.  The cost depends on whether the trip will be individual (1-3 people) or group (10-15 people).  Tentatively, you can say that a visit to the theater in Epidaurus, the city itself, as well as Nafplio and Mycenae will cost about 90-100 euros.  This is provided that a full group of 10-15 people is recruited.  The duration of the trip is about 9 hours, i.e.  you need to count on all day, the number of objects to visit - 6-8. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, visiting attractions is limited in time and it is unlikely to be able to consider the ancient ruins thoroughly.  Rather, it is a superficial acquaintance. </p><h2>  From the history of the theater </h2><p>  Description of the theater in Epidaurus should begin with the phrase "very ancient."  The antique building was erected between approximately 340 and 330 BC.  The creative idea belonged to the famous ancient Greek architect Polycletus the Younger.  This was possible to establish thanks to the records of the writer and geographer Pausanias.  The theater was erected for entertainment by nobles from Asklepion - a temple erected in honor of the god of medicine, who also served as a hospital.  It was believed that theatrical performance favorably affects the physical and mental health of patients. </p><p>  One of the most ancient theaters of ancient Greece in Epidaurus accommodated more than fifteen thousand spectators and was divided into two parts.  There were 55 rows in total, of which 21 were intended for ordinary people, and 34 lower for nobles and priests.  The diameter of the building is 116 m, while it has amazing acoustics.  In the photo, the plan of the theater, with the words parodos denotes the exits, skene - stage, orchestra - orchestra pit. </p><h2>  Theater today </h2><p>  The theater was opened as a result of excavations conducted by archaeologist P. Cavadias in 1870-1926.  Just a few years after his rebirth, in 1938, he already received the first guests.  The tragedy of Sophocles Electra was set.  In the early 50s of the last century, restoration work was organized in the theater.  Since 1955, it became the venue for the annual theater festival.  Every summer, performances are held on its stage.  Some of them were attended by the greatest Greek and world artists, including  opera singer <span>Maria Callas.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Ancient Theater at Epidaurus is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><h2>  What is remarkable about the theater? </h2>

    <p>  If you are not impressed with the description of the building dating back to antiquity, then you should go to Epidaurus to take a look at it live.  A visit to the city is recommended to be included in your tourist itinerary even for those who are not a real theater-goer.  It is noteworthy that for a long time the theater was hidden under a layer of sand from human eyes, its find can be called accidental.  It has been perfectly preserved and, having undergone a small restoration, has been hosting guests for over 40 years, as 2500 years ago. </p><p>  In tourist guides in Greece, this theater is most often mentioned due to its incredible acoustics.  It is amazing what engineering knowledge people possessed in the 4th century BC.  Even if the artists perform without special equipment, the spectators of the very last rows do not feel any discomfort, as there is excellent audibility. </p><p>  However, this is not his only feature.  Take a look at the photo and how the theater in Epidaurus looks like from a bird's eye view.  Nature itself serves as the natural backdrop for the scene, and a panoramic view of the surroundings opens from the upper rows, the height of which is comparable to an 8‚Äì9-story building. </p><h2>  Hellenic Festival in Epidaurus </h2><p>  The Hellenic festival in Epidaurus is perhaps one of the most famous in the theater world.  For a month, a small cozy village turns into a large platform and receives a huge number of tourists.  The festival starts on the last Friday of June and lasts until the first August Saturday.  Theater groups from around the world come together with plays by the most famous playwrights.  Despite the fact that all representations are staged in Greek or Ancient Greek, the audience is going international.  Art knows no boundaries, especially when it is created within the walls of an ancient theater, and myriads of stars shine in the sky.  The viewer is important atmosphere of what is happening. </p><h2>  Performance tickets </h2>

In these hot summer days, the small village seems to be gaining a second wind, convening talents from around the world to its oldest scene. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the sights </h2><p>  Those who still doubt the expediency of a trip to one of the oldest parts of Greece should read the reviews about the theater in Epidaurus, left by travelers who have already visited it.

    <p>  Visitors to Epidaurus who did not manage to get to a performance or a concert of classical music say that they will return here as soon as possible, and those who succeed write that surrounded by bright stars, coniferous aroma and pristine nature, you simply forget about that you don‚Äôt understand Greek.  Actors in general, in principle, can be silent - this is already enough to spend an unforgettable summer evening. </p><p>  The magnificent acoustics of the theater also delight tourists.  According to them, even a whisper from the stage can be heard without much effort in the penultimate rows. </p><p>  In their reviews, tourists who visited the theater in Epidavros mention that you should not be afraid of the scorching Greek sun.  All performances begin after nine in the evening when coolness descends on the city.  The only threat is wind and rain, so it will not hurt to look at the weather forecast and, if anything, take an umbrella with you. </p>
