    <p>  In the distant past, people did not think about what water is and what its origin is.  It was believed that this is an element, but now it is known that it is a chemical compound. </p><p>  In 1932, the whole world spread the news that on planet Earth, besides simple, there is heavy water.  It is now known that there may be 135 of its isotopic varieties. </p><p>  <strong>Composition</strong> </p><p>  Heavy water, also called deuterium oxide, does not differ in chemical composition from ordinary ordinary water, but instead of the hydrogen atoms contained in the water, it contains 2 heavy isotopes of hydrogen, the so-called deuterium.  Heavy water has the formula 2H2O or D2O.  Outwardly, there is no difference between a heavy and a simple liquid, but they differ in their properties. </p><p>  Chemical reactions in heavy water are weaker than in ordinary. </p><p>  Heavy water is slightly toxic.  Scientific experiments have shown that replacing light hydrogen atoms with deuterium by 25% causes infertility in animals.  If you increase its content in water even more, the animal dies.  However, a number of organisms survive at 70% deuterium <span>(ciliates shoe).</span>  A person without health consequences can drink about a glass of such a liquid.  In <span>this case, deuterium</span> is excreted from the body within a few days. </p><p>  Heavy water has the property of accumulating in the remainder of the electrolyte if repeated <span>water electrolysis is</span> performed <span>.</span>  It absorbs vapors of a simple liquid in the open air, i.e.  it is hygroscopic. </p><p>  One of the most important properties of this type of water is that it almost does not absorb neutrons, and this allows it to be used in nuclear reactors for the process of neutron deceleration, and in chemistry it is used as an isotopic indicator. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Heavy water getting</strong> </p><p>  In 1933-1946, the only enrichment method was electrolysis.  Later, more advanced technologies appeared.  Modern mass production in the input stream uses a liquid distilled from an electrolyte with a heavy water content of 0.1-0.2%. </p><p>  The first stage of concentration uses the two-temperature countercurrent hydrogen sulfide isotope exchange technology, the concentration at the outlet of heavy water is 5-10%.  The second stage is cascade electrolysis of an alkaline solution at zero temperature, the output concentration is 99.75-99.995%. </p><p>  Russian scientists have developed original technologies for the production and purification of heavy water.  In 1995, a highly efficient installation was put into commercial operation.  Production fully meets the demand of enterprises with heavy water in any volume, and also allows you to export it abroad. </p><p>  <strong>Application</strong> </p><p>  Heavy water is used in various biological and chemical processes.  Scientists have determined that such a liquid prevents the development of bacteria, fungi, algae, and if it contains 50% deuterium, it acquires antimutagenic properties, promotes the growth of biological mass and accelerates puberty in humans. </p><p>  European scientists conducted experiments on mice with a malignant tumor.  Heavy water killed both the disease and its carriers.  It was found <span>that such water has a</span> bad effect on plants and animals.  In subjects who were given heavy water, their kidneys were destroyed and their metabolism was upset.  At high doses of water, animals died.  With a small volume (up to 25%), the animals gained weight and brought a good offspring, and the laying of eggs increased in chickens. </p><p>  The question of what happens if you completely get rid of deuterium is still open. </p><p>  <strong>Comparison of the properties of light and heavy water</strong> </p><p>  The answer to the question of the difference between natural light and heavy liquid depends on who was given it. </p><p>  In terms of chemical properties, there is practically no difference between them.  In each of them, sodium equally emits hydrogen, during electrolysis both water and water decompose equally, their chemical properties also coincide, because they have the same composition. </p><p>  <span>The physical properties of</span> these liquids are different: <span>their boiling</span> and freezing <span>temperatures</span> are not the same, and they also have different vapor densities and elasticities.  Heavy and light water decompose during electrolysis at different speeds. </p><p>  From a biological point of view, this is a rather complicated issue, there is still work to be done. </p>
