    <p>  1992 was drawing near, and the day before, in the fall of 1991, Vakha agreed with the actions of the congress during the confrontation between the republican authorities and the National Congress of the Chechen people.  During the reign of Dzhokhar Dudayev, Vakha became a People‚Äôs Deputy of the Chechen Parliament.  In combination with the main activity, the man was the head of a special committee to control the sale and purchase of petroleum products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Events of the Second Chechen War </h2><p>  According to the data received, shortly before the start of operations of militants in Dagestan, in the summer of 1999, Vakha Arsanov refrained from conducting military operations.  Moreover, it became known that the vice-president of the Republic of Ichkeria left the territory of Chechnya and went to Georgia.  His departure was associated with the necessary treatment for a damaged spine.  However, after some time, despite his open conflict with the head of the CRI, Aslan Maskhadov, Vakha played a role in military operations against the Joint Group of Forces of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <p>  Since the vice-president of the named Republic of Ichkeria did not advertise his direct intervention in military operations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chechnya, Usman Ferzauli, officially declared in the fall of 1999 that Arsanov was hiding from the outbreak of the war and had removed himself from his direct duties.  In 2004, Vakha Arsanov stopped any conversations with the press and for a long time was hiding in safe houses in Grozny. </p><h2>  Fighting </h2><p>  During the first military operations in the CRI, Vakha Arsanov was elected commander of the northwestern front of the armed forces of Ichkeria, and later received the post of commandant of the Staropromyslovsky district of Grozny.  The man showed himself to be a responsible, wise and judicious commander.  During his tenure as commander of the Republic of Ichkeria, Arsanov Vakha reached considerable heights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Between winter 1994 and spring 1995, Arsanov carried out several important and successful military operations, commanding a detachment of militants.  One of such victories is the defeat of the formation of the Russian army near the village of Dolinskaya, which is located near Grozny.  Also, Vakha Arsanov acted as the head of military operations for the defense of the small village of Petropavlovsky in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGoragorsk and during the capture of Argun.  In the storming of Grozny, in August 1996, he took an active part. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Arsanov </h2><p>  With the advent of <span>Aslan Maskhadov, the</span> leader of Chechnya became a candidate for the post of vice-president of the republic, after which he successfully received this position.  According to unofficial data, Vakha Arsanov took an active part in kidnapping in order to further demand a ransom.  Most often, such people were NTV and ORT journalists, workers from Slovakia, as well as Italian businessmen.  During an operation in the village of Ivanovo, Staropromyslovsky District of the Chechen Republic, in May 2005, he was killed by Russian troops.  At this time, there are two versions of what happened, the first tells us that Vakha was killed during a special operation of the Russian troops, and the second indicates a pre-prepared counter-terrorism measure.  The purpose of this event was to capture the field commander.  It was also reported about operational surveillance, arranged for the place where the militants were supposed to take refuge. </p><p>  As the saying goes, Vakha has done his job; Vakha Arsanov may die. </p>
