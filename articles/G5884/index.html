It is not visible as such an area, but the place is quite pleasant and cozy.  The soul in this place is resting, freeing itself from everyday worldly worries. </p><p>  It is advisable and useful to come here when one is completely unbearable from the everyday monotonous fuss and wants to be alone, alone with one‚Äôs thoughts.  This locality plunges into itself and into thoughts about the dramatic history of the last century. </p><p>  Victory Square in Moscow (photo presented in the article) has an interesting history. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  For most residents of the capital, this square is one of the most remarkable places in the Dorogomilovo area. </p><p>  Many memorable places in all of Russia.  And Victory Square in Moscow for many years has been a traditional meeting place for veterans who come here annually on May 9 in order to once again recall the harsh war years and honor the memory of those who could not share the joy of the great Victory with them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square of victory" class="if uuid-2941941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2941941.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The square is located on the territory of the Dorogomilovsky district of the Western Moscow administrative district.  This is the intersection of Kutuzovsky Prospekt with the streets of General Ermolov, 1812 and Barclay.  It should be noted that since the time of Peter the Great, the intersection of two roads leading to Tsarskoye Selo (now Pulkovskoye Shosse and Moskovsky Prospekt) and Moscow (Moskovskoye Shosse and Krasnoputilovskaya Street) has been located at this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7377563" data-lng="37.522300599999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/1/2/2/11122.png"></div><p>  Today, oncoming roads of Kutuzovsky Prospect diverge in this area, since in the middle of this wide carriageway there is a square where the Triumphal Arch is located in its very center, after which these lanes converge again. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Victory Square in Moscow is the same square, which is located in the middle of the avenue, as well as 2 small squares between residential buildings and the avenue to the south and north of it.  From the eastern and western parts, the area does not have clear boundaries.  Victory Park originates in the southwestern part, and in the northwestern part there is the terminal trolleybus station with the same name with the area name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecuriousexplorers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triumphal Arch" class="if uuid-2941862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2941862.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the arch is the main part of a single memorial complex along with the panorama of the Battle of Borodino.  On Victory Square is the Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War, containing 50 collections, which in total includes 50,000 items. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About the origin of the name </h2><p>  Such an eloquent name of the square was given in April 1975 in honor of the anniversary (30 years) of the victory in the Second World War.  The Arc de Triomphe was built in memory of the heroes of the war of 1812. </p><p>  It should be noted that, among other things, on the day of celebrations on Victory Square in Moscow, a monument was opened to the soldiers who defended Leningrad (the authors are famous sculptors and architects Anikushin M. and Speransky S.) </p><div class="photo" data-original="dic.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Triumphal Gate at Tverskaya Zastava (1848)" class="if uuid-2941947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2941947.jpg"></div><h2>  Triumphal Arch </h2><p>  The real pearl of the square is the Arc de Triomphe towering in the center.  The author of the project is the famous architect Osip Bove.  Until 1936, for more than a hundred years, the arch was located at the Tverskaya Zastava, from where it had to be removed in connection with the reconstruction of the square. </p><p>  One curious fact should be noted.  The first Triumphal Gate was dismantled in 1936.  Thanks to the preserved sculptural decorations that were used in the process of creating an exact copy of this architectural structure, in 1968 the arch was recreated on Victory Square in Moscow.  A team of authors worked on it - architects Libson V. Ya., Ruben I.P., Vasilyeva G.F., Kulchinsky D.N. </p><p>  At the top of the arch is the chariot of Glory, on which stands the goddess of Victory, holding a <span>laurel wreath</span> in his raised hand <span>.</span>  And six horses carry a chariot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chariot of Glory" class="if uuid-2941943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2941943.jpg"></div><h2>  Other noteworthy structures and buildings </h2><p>  In addition to the famous Arc de Triomphe, other historically significant buildings are located at the crossroads of several streets of Moscow (Victory Square). </p><p>  The well-known director of theater and cinema P. Fomenko lived in apartment building No. 1 (building A), and the famous ballerina Nina Sorokina also lived in the same building (building E).  House number 2 (building 2) is associated with the name of the theater and film actor Sergei Stolyarov, who lived in it from 1958 to 1969.  Building B of house No. 3 is an Orthodox church at the end of the 20th century - it is the Church of St. George the Victorious, built on Poklonnaya Hill on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  You can get to this historic place by metro, following the station of the same name with the square, as well as by trolley buses and buses. </p>
