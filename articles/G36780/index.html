Today, tours to the CIS countries are becoming increasingly popular, and all thanks to their obvious cheapness and ability to spend time no less than in Cairo or Ankara. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Tbilisi, like other ancient settlements, has its own legend telling about the emergence of a settlement.  It is said that king <span>Vakhtang Gorgasal</span> hunted in these places and wounded a pheasant who plunged into a healing spring and was mysteriously healed.  At the behest of the king, a city was built near him, which was called Tiflis. </p><p>  It was back in the 5th century AD, when the first fortress appeared near sulfuric hot springs.  The city began to grow, becoming the residence of Georgian kings.  The Metekhi fortress, built on the banks of the Kura River, has become their home for many centuries. </p>

    <p>  Throughout the history of his existence, he was under the rule of the Persians, he was ravaged by the soldiers of the Khorezm Sultan Jalaliddin Manguberdi, he was raided by the troops of Genghis Khan, was subjugated by the army of Tamerlane, survived the Great Plague and the invasion of the Turks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only in 1800 after the signing of the manifesto on joining Russia in Georgia did the long-awaited peace come, and the city began a new stage of development.  Today, a vacation in Tbilisi (tourist reviews confirm this) is a trip both to the distant past (when exploring the old part of the city) and to the present (in its modern areas with new cafes, discos and hotels). </p><h2>  Gourmet Holidays </h2><p>  For many travelers, a visit to Georgia is associated with its healing springs, for example, Borjomi or Abanotubani, a complex of baths built in the 17th century and today is a landmark of the country's capital.  Experienced tourists note that rest in Tbilisi can be perfectly combined with health care.  Pushkin admired these baths; at one time many famous poets, writers, artists and musicians visited them when trips ‚Äúto the waters‚Äù came into fashion. </p><p>  Local cuisine is no less popular, and in Tbilisi there are whole streets dedicated to gastronomic establishments.  For those who want to try khinkali in a relaxed atmosphere, the Shemoikhede restaurant chain is suitable.  Khachapuri lovers are expected in Machachel, where they are prepared for every taste - from classic with meat and cheese to vegetarian with vegetables. </p>

    <p>  For foreign guests, rest in Tbilisi is associated with the Taglaura restaurant chain, which has its own breweries, which also prepare kvass and lemonade.  Sweet tooths will surely enjoy the sale of <span>Georgian sweets</span> directly from the windows of houses or in private courtyards on Oniashvili Street, well known for small private cafes offering everyone who wishes national dishes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As the guests of Georgia note, rest in Tbilisi (reviews of city guests are full of such comments) is a combination of gourmet and aesthetic pleasures that have left their mark in the soul for many years. </p><h2>  Georgian traditions </h2><p>  Tbilisi was able to maintain its traditions, even becoming a modern metropolis.  Here, as before, all the joyful events are accompanied by dances and songs.  Music for Georgians is another way to tell about their love for the world. </p><p>  Many travelers combine holidays in Tbilisi with the search for original handmade souvenirs.  Surprisingly, in the old part of the city numerous artisanal productions have been preserved, where you can buy amazingly beautiful coinage, decorative daggers and handmade carpets. </p>

    <p>  Pottery workshops have been preserved in Tbilisi, still producing pottery, which foreign tourists love to buy.  Leather goods are no less popular, but all this can be interesting only to a real traveler.  It is they who seek and find masters of their craft in order to take away with them not a souvenir with a price tag bought in the nearest shop, but a work of art worthy of decorating any collection. </p><h2>  Attractions Tbilisi </h2><p>  Each guest of the <span>capital of Georgia</span> begins a tour from its historical part.  The old city will surprise travelers with its baths, the construction of which began in the 16th, and was completed in the 19th century.  Despite the old age, they are quite convenient, and the quality of services does not differ from that of the best balneological resorts in Europe. </p>

    <p>  After visiting the baths, you should definitely go to Mount Mtsatminda, which is sacred for Georgians.  Here is the ancient <span>fortress of Narikala,</span> built in the 4th century.  Today, ruins remained from it, but observation platforms were built near them, from which a magnificent view of Tbilisi opens. </p><p>  Also, travelers with experience recommend visiting the former residence of Georgian kings - Metekhi Temple.  It was built in the 12th century at the burial place of St.  martyr of Queen Shushaniki Rana, who died in the 5th century.  In the Old Town, there is another attraction that Georgians are proud of - this is the Zion Cathedral, which began to be built in the 5th century, but was completed only after two centuries.  This is the most ancient architectural monument preserved on the territory of Tbilisi, in which many relics are represented today. </p><p>  No less popular with holidaymakers is <span>Shota Rustaveli Avenue,</span> where the main museums of the city and numerous cafes are concentrated, where you can relax after sightseeing. </p><h2>  City beaches </h2><p>  Who happened to visit the capital of Georgia in the summer, he could not help but come to the famous Turtle Lake - a favorite vacation spot of the local population. </p><p>  Trestle beds and umbrellas await guests, and in numerous cafes you can taste national cuisine and taste local wine.  It is here that beach holidays in Tbilisi are concentrated.  There is a playground for children on the lake, and adults can rent a boat and take a walk on the water. </p>
