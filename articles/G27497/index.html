She firmly entered our lives.  Favorite tracks accompany almost everyone at home, at work, on travel, regularly updated and becoming more beautiful and more enjoyable.  However, for their comfortable listening, you need a technique that can cope with the task of reproduction in the best way, and at the same time it should suit your rhythm of life.  One of the best options, ready for extreme loads, is <span>the JBL</span> Flip 3 <span>speaker system</span> , reviews of which will help determine whether to purchase this portable speaker for yourself.  However, before we get to know the opinions of users, let‚Äôs take a look at its detailed characteristics. </p><h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  JBL itself has been familiar to portable speakers for a long time.  Many praise it for its quality, because often users can still find those first models, which are still working properly and delighting their owners with high-quality sound.  The only prophylaxis that has been required for all this time is the replacement of the battery, because after all it is subject to wear and tear and has a certain number of charge-discharge cycles. </p><p>  The company is constantly trying to update the lineup, trying to follow the latest technical trends.  That is why new items acquire additional useful features.  For example, one of the series can be used as an external battery.  In addition, almost all speakers have a built-in microphone, which allows you to talk on the phone without getting it.  The only drawback is the loss of confidentiality, because people can hear the conversation.  However, given the fact that most of these speakers have moisture protection, and the phone may not have it, in some situations this will still be the best solution.  Consider what the JBL Flip 3 column got from this, which we are talking about now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A brief list of characteristics of the model in question </h2><p>  The column, despite the relatively low price, is an excellent representative of the budget class.  With a relatively low price and high power, <span>portable speakers JBL</span> Flip 3 is endowed with the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  The ability to choose a sound source between wireless broadcasting via bluetooth version 4.1 and the linear input for a standard cable with a mini-Jack type connector (3.5 mm). </li><li>  The built-in battery has a capacity of 3000 mAh.  According to the manufacturer, this capacity should be enough for 10 hours of continuous playback of music tracks. </li><li>  As mentioned above, this column is no exception and supports the ability to use it for talking on the phone.  The built-in microphone not only receives an audio signal, but also processes it using noise and echo cancellation. </li><li>  JBL Flip 3, customer reviews which we will review at the end of the article, received protection from water.  Acoustics can not be immersed in water for a long time, but it can withstand a short-term drop into it.  Do not damage flying spray or raindrops.  To clean dirt, the column can be washed under running water. </li><li>  Thanks to the modern wireless protocol, up to three sound source devices can be connected simultaneously. </li><li>  The use of new BassRadiator technology allowed us to make the low frequencies of the portable JBL Flip 3 speakers more powerful and voluminous, despite the compact size of the case itself.  Due to this, the lower bar of the reproduced frequencies starts from 85 Hz.  The highest possible high frequency has remained standard for most such systems and is 20 kHz. </li><li>  The total power of the speakers is 16 watts. </li></ul><p>  This entire list creates a positive impression of this electronic miracle.  However, for some users, technical specifications are not so much important as the design of the device.  We‚Äôll talk about him now. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and ergonomics </h2><p>  This moment can be especially interesting to those who like to stand out from the crowd.  This is what designers thought about, adding eight different colors to the line at once, each of which can emphasize your personality and make life a little brighter.  It hit such colors as blue, yellow, red, mint, orange, pink, gray and black.  However, color is not the main advantage. </p><p>  No matter how beautiful the design, it should be practical.  The use of passive low-frequency emitters (the same as can be found in the more expensive Extreme and Charge series) added zest and expanded the possibilities of using speakers.  In the off state, the emitters on the JBL Flip 3 column may not be noticed, but their movement is clearly visible during playback.  They seem to dance to the beat of low frequencies. </p><p>  Thanks to their use, the speaker can be installed on any of the ends without loss of sound quality.  However, it can be put on one side.  Despite its cylindrical shape, it will not roll anywhere - the cord will interfere.  It seems to be such a trifle, but not every manufacturer also cares about users, because with its help the column can be mounted on almost any surface.  For example, given its water resistance, it can come in handy for lovers to sing in the shower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The case is made of interesting material.  As they say about the portable speaker JBL Flip 3 reviews, it looks like a fabric woven with <span>chain mail.</span>  It is quite durable to the touch, which can guarantee no damage even after years of use.  Where there are smooth elements, you can see a nice matte plastic with some shockproof properties. </p><p>  The controls are made slightly convex, which allows you to comfortably use the column even in the dark.  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of a charge level indicator, because it, although it is also a trifle, is not on every model.  However, the thing is quite useful, because it can help to correctly calculate the intensity of use of the speaker system depending on your plans. </p>

    <h2>  Speaker Association </h2><p>  If you look closely at the controls, you will notice an interesting symbol that cannot be explained by standard rules.  This is an hourglass icon that you will not find on any speaker system from another manufacturer. </p><p>  If you carefully read the instructions for the columns, you can see that they support the ability to combine.  So, if you and your friend have the same speakers, you can connect them in parallel to achieve a better effect and increase power.  This can be especially true during picnics in nature, where a large number of people are present, and, accordingly, the area on which they are located is quite large.  Despite the fact that not many people managed to take advantage of this function, there are already a sufficient number of 3 reviews regarding the JBL Flip column, showing the benefits of this solution. </p><h2>  Moisture protection </h2><p>  As noted in the user manual, this column is not recommended to be immersed in water, as its performance may be impaired.  However, if you look at the video reviews, you can see that many bloggers did this, and the speaker system continued to work without losing its characteristics.  This suggests that it is capable of coping with heavy rain or accidentally spilled large amounts of water on it without any problems. </p><p>  Also, as they say about the <span>wireless speakers JBL</span> Flip 3 reviews, she is not afraid of sand, so she is optimally suited for use on the beach.  The phone may lie in a waterproof bag or case. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the presence of a key to answer a call.  If you swim and listen to music, and then an important call comes in, then you can answer it without any problems without fear of harming the phone, which may not have moisture protection.  The microphone quality is at its best, and you can speak without raising your voice, that is, as usual when making a call. </p><p>  It is worthwhile to be careful and always, when the interface connectors of the linear input or charging are not used, cover them with a special rubber plug.  If this is not done, water entering them can seriously damage the acoustics. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery, as mentioned above, is set to 3000 mAh.  For most users this will be enough.  When playing at an average volume level, it really lasts about 10 hours to work, when connected via a linear input and deactivating the bluetooth module, this time can be slightly increased.  To fully charge from a powerful power supply, as they say about JBL Flip 3 customer reviews, it will take about 3-3.5 hours. </p><h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  Girls who are used to compactly placing everything in their small backpacks can pay attention to this particular model.  Given the rather high power and autonomy, it will be the best candidate, because its dimensions are only 64 * 169 * 64 mm.  It is a little longer than a 5.5-inch smartphone.  The thickness is equal to its width.  Thus, it is easier to imagine the overall dimensions, and to understand that this will be a good choice. </p><p>  Regarding weight, you can also not worry, because for such a device it can not be called large.  The weight of the speaker system is 450 grams.  For comparison: this is approximately the weight of three smartphones.  Agree, this is not so much, given the ability to comfortably listen to music anywhere. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  This parameter should not be missed, because the device can be as beautiful as you like, but nevertheless, its main task is to play pleasant music. </p><p>  When you read about JBL Flip 3 reviews, they all come down to one thing - compared to previous versions of the budget speaker options from this manufacturer, the sound has improved significantly.  It has become more voluminous and clean, without any interference or artifacts.  This is not to say that it is perfect, and audiophiles will definitely find flaws in it.  And yet, for widespread use, this speaker system is very good. </p><p>  The ability to connect three devices at the same time is very handy if you are going to a company, and everyone wants to boast of something new from their playlist.  Then you can connect to the column at the same time, and then turn on the necessary tracks in turn. </p><p>  Two modern speakers are used in acoustics, each with a power of 8 watts and a diagonal of 40 mm.  The volume is enough to easily listen to music in the open, for example, relaxing in the forest or on the beach.  This suggests that in a room or car, you are unlikely to turn the volume to maximum, since the sound power level will be too high. </p><p>  The frequency range, as you can see when reading about JBL Flip 3 reviews, is fully disclosed, so the column is well suited for different types of music, ranging from rap or electronic to heavy metal.  It is nice to note that there are no dips when the volume in the track itself rises or falls sharply. </p>

    <h2>  Column setup </h2><p>  With the first connection, there will be no problems at all.  Turning on the column, you can immediately find it in the list of devices available for pairing on your smartphone.  If you want to connect another device, then just click on the button with the Bluetooth icon, and the acoustics will again appear in the search. </p><p>  The transition to the operating mode via a linear cable is carried out automatically immediately after its connection.  In this case, the bluetooth module is turned off to save battery power.  More detailed points regarding the setting can always be found in the attached detailed operating instructions. </p><h2>  Factory equipment </h2><p>  The column comes in a small box where you will find not many things.  However, all branded accessories are made with high quality, so they can last a long time with careful handling. </p><p>  So, in addition to the column itself, you will find one cable in the box.  This is a micro-USB, designed to charge from a power supply.  The unit itself is not included, but any one with a charging current of about 1 ampere will do. </p><p>  That‚Äôs all, there‚Äôs nothing more than a warranty card and instructions.  However, it is thanks to this that it turns out to reduce the final cost of the device.  The manufacturer allows you to decide for yourself which accessories to purchase separately and whether you need them.  However, many users, when they write reviews about portable speakers JBL Flip 3, note their dissatisfaction with such a meager bundle. </p>

    <h2>  Positive speaker reviews </h2><p>  All the above information is official data from manufacturers and the results of review tests of large publications.  She presents dry data, a kind of thematic JBL Flip 3 review.  Reviews provide an opportunity to see a lively picture.  Nothing can give the most complete information about a particular device, like the ratings of users who already had the opportunity to check it in action.  So, we can now consider the positive and negative sides of the device, and then compare the information received with the manufacturer's statements to verify the quality and determine whether to buy such a column for yourself or for a gift. </p><p>  After analyzing the reviews written about the JBL Flip 3 column, you can see that among the positive aspects, users most often call the following: </p><ol><li>  <em>High-quality sound.</em>  Despite the fact that the column is small and belongs to the budget segment, its sound is really pleasant and allows you to fully enjoy your favorite music. </li><li>  <em>Good gamut of colors.</em>  It's nice that the manufacturer gives you the opportunity to choose which column you want, and all this without a difference in cost.  This allows you to be unique, even if friends have the same model.  Anyway, it‚Äôs easier not to be confused with different colors, where is whose gadget. </li><li>  <em>Light weight and dimensions.</em>  For its characteristics, the speaker system received really low indicators of these parameters, which makes its use more comfortable.  It will not interfere in a hiking backpack, and it certainly will not pull your back. </li><li>  <em>Moisture protection</em> .  Thanks to its presence, the column can really be used on beaches and in places of active recreation.  It is not necessary to heat it in water, but it will cope with the main problems of being on land, whether it be sand or spray.  This option is clearly not superfluous in JBL Flip 3. The bluetooth column, the reviews of which we are now considering, owes much of its popularity to it. </li><li>  <em>The ability to connect multiple (up to three) devices at the same time.</em>  In a large company, this function cannot be neglected, because everyone can have different musical tastes, and this option helps to smooth out such a different opinion. </li><li>  <em>High volume and power.</em>  The speakers are enough to sound quite large living quarters or use outdoors and in noisy places. </li><li>  <em>Good autonomy.</em>  According to users, the operating time is really about 10 hours, and turning on the maximum volume is often simply not necessary. </li><li>  <em>Ability to connect to another JBL Flip 3 Black speaker.</em>  The reviews show that although this function is rarely used, it still caused a positive response from the few users who have already managed to use it. </li></ol><p>  This list could still be continued, but the main parameters, which are especially critical for most of those who plan to purchase this speaker system, are already listed in it.  As you can see, the manufacturer really tried, and launched a practical and high-quality product on the market.  However, there are quite significant disadvantages, which also should not be silent. </p>

    <h2>  Negative sides based on user reviews </h2><p>  Among the minuses, the main one can rightly be called the appearance in some columns some time after the start of the use of wheezing during sounding.  Most likely, this is a factory marriage.  The good news is that, according to most thematic reviews of JBL Flip 3, it often appears almost immediately after purchase, so the gadget can be exchanged or repaired under warranty on time. </p><p>  The second minus is the meager factory equipment.  Many users are unhappy that it does not have a cable for transmitting a linear signal, since this option is provided in the speaker system, but in fact it can be used only after additional investments in a suitable high-quality cable. </p><p>  Well, the third nuance, which is noticed by many buyers, is the lack of the ability to even additionally purchase a cover in which you could listen to the speaker, and not just transfer it.  However, given its good opposition to water and sand, this can not be considered a serious problem. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> <span>The JBL</span> Flip 3 <span>speaker system</span> , the reviews of which we just analyzed, is perfect for those who want to always be on their own musical wave and do not want to part with their favorite artists.  It will allow you to enjoy music everywhere and always, given the good autonomy and compactness. </p><p>  However, there is a chance to encounter a defective option and subsequently exchange it through the service.  If you are ready for this, then you can safely take this model - it certainly will not disappoint you. </p>
