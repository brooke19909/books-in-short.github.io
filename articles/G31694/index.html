The liberation of Prague from the Nazis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Second World War was bloody and brutal.  Many European countries suffered from her merciless blow.  The losses of relatively small Czechoslovakia were astounding: 35 thousand soldiers, tens of thousands of civilians ... Seeking cheap <span>labor, the</span> Germans forcibly took 550 thousand young people to forced labor in Germany.  A large chunk of territory was disconnected from the country: Carpathian Rus, Sudetenland and Tishino oblast.  The state as an independent unit ceased to exist, turning into a German colony: the so-called protectorate. </p><h2>  An occupation </h2><p>  At the end of the war, the Center army, a fairly large German group, was stationed in Czechoslovakia.  Its composition was estimated at the whole million officers and soldiers.  Field Marshal Sch√∂rner commanded the invaders.  He was firmly convinced that the Czech Republic should become a completely German country.  The incoming information that the Russians are preparing the liberation of Prague, the fascist considered absurd and unrealistic.  As for the capital itself, in May 1945 it became a training ground for the sixth German combat squadron.  Particularly carefully, the invaders guarded the airfield, where their planes stood, as well as the surrounding territory, built up by soldiers' barracks. </p>

Historians divided into three camps.  Some believe that local rebels cleared the city of fascists, others speak of a brilliant offensive by the Vlasovites, while others emphasize the decisive maneuvers of the <span>Soviet army.</span>  There is also a version that by the arrival of the Russians Prague was already free.  Is it so?  Let's try to figure it out.

Of course, the operation plan was developed by the Red Army.  Already in April 1945, headquarters carefully studied maps of the capital‚Äôs area made from reconnaissance aircraft: they could see the positions of the Germans, their firing points and ammunition depots.  These tactical objects were supposed to fall under the main blow. </p>

The department, consisting of communists, claimed to lead a mass uprising, the foci of which continually flared up in the country.  But there was no time left to organize the operation, therefore, he did not play a decisive role in the clearing of the capital.

    <p>  At the same time, on May 5, the Vlasovites, soldiers of the First Infantry Division of the ROA, entered Prague.  The combat unit, under the leadership of Major General Bunyachenko, marked the beginning of the liberation.  In a matter of days, they managed to clean the western part of the city, thereby opening the SS ring. </p><h2>  Americans actions </h2><p>  While the Vlasovites began the liberation of Prague from the Nazis, on the other hand, American troops approached the capital under the leadership of General Patton.  From the US president, he was instructed to put forward positions on the Pilsen-Karlovy Vary-Ceske Budejovice line.  The Germans did not particularly resist the Americans, but the Red Army, advancing from the side of Slovakia, they fiercely rebuffed.  Knowing the US loyalty to the prisoners, they preferred to fall into their hands than to the peremptory Communists.  Therefore, the speed of advancement of the allies was different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  General Patton took Pilsen.  Residents of the city even erected a monument to him after the war.  The Americans stopped at this: the Red Army was moving towards, so in order to avoid confusion, they decided to wait.  And the US government did not consider Czechoslovakia a political goal.  As a result, they decided once again not to risk the lives of soldiers.  When the Russians realized that the Allies were backing down, they continued the liberation of Prague on their own. </p><h2>  What happened next? </h2><p>  Meanwhile, after a successful operation to liberate the western part of the city, the Vlasovites retreated.  Historians believe that they took Prague for two reasons: firstly, they wanted to impress Americans, and secondly, they hoped for amnesty after active cooperation with the Germans.  But, having failed to agree on union status with the CNS, they left the capital. </p>

The offensive was commanded by <span>Marshal Konev.</span>  His units had just finished cleansing Berlin, as they were immediately transferred to the Czech direction.  Without a day's rest, the soldiers began to break through to the city.  The battalions of the First Ukrainian Front also took an active part in the hostilities.  In one of the hot battles over the next bridge, Lieutenant Ivan Goncharenko was mortally wounded, who was later named after one of the streets of Prague.  The liberation of the Czech capital lasted several days: from May 6 to 11.  This was the final major operation of World War II in Europe.

    <h2>  Offensive </h2><p>  Prague was the last major hotbed of fascist resistance.  Despite the signed surrender, the local invaders did not want to give up.  Instead, they planned to reunite with a huge German unit called the Mitl Group.  The enemy unit continued to engage in active battles, resisting at every turn.  The Mitl group pushed to the south decided to join forces with the fascists who occupied Czechoslovakia.  To prevent the enemy forces from strengthening, our soldiers rushed into battle.  To take this position has become a matter of honor and conscience. </p>

At first, the Red Army tirelessly pursued Sch√∂rner‚Äôs units to prevent them from completing their plan.  The stake was made on tankers who were under the command of Generals Rybalko and Lelyushenko.  It was these brave guys who were ordered to break through the line of the retreating Nazis, leaving them in the rear and cutting them off from the SS hiding in Prague.  The plan was this: when the Mitl group reaches the capital of Czechoslovakia, there will already be Russian soldiers.  The main problem for our fighters was only the steep mountains hanging in front.  Overcoming this line was the main task of the tankers.

    <h2>  The end of the middle group </h2><p>  The historical operation began tank regiments of the First Ukrainian Front.  They paved the way through narrow, winding and dangerous passes.  In pitch darkness, tracked vehicles swept away enemy barriers set by the Germans at every turn.  When there was a need, the crews left the tanks: the soldiers rebuilt the bridges with their own hands, cleared mines. </p><p>  Finally, throwing away all the barriers, the steel wave of equipment crossed the ridges and rolled down the slope - straight to the Czech capital.  The appearance of Soviet tanks on the horizon was so unexpected for the SS men that they did not even have time to provide proper resistance.  On the contrary, distraught with fear, the Germans ran in a panic, wherever they look. </p>

The date of the significant event is May 11.  On this day, the capital of Czechoslovakia was completely cleared of the invaders.  Our tank crews pursued separate groups of fascists for another two days, after which, capturing all the fugitives, they worthily completed a responsible combat mission.
