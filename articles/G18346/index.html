Often, this attitude is caused by errors that manufacturers made earlier.  Approximately the same story happened with HTC smartphones - due to a number of unsuccessful models, the demand for the equipment of this manufacturer dropped sharply.  To restore its good name, quite a lot of attempts have already been made.  Some were successful, others the opposite.  Talk about the company's coup - this is the <span>HTC Desire 728G Dual Sim</span> smartphone <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> and a full overview of the characteristics will help to see the picture and help determine whether to buy this smartphone. </p><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  As the HTC 728G reviews indicate, the smartphone comes in a box made of thick cardboard, which is ecological, as it is almost completely decomposed.  This excellent PR move helped consolidate the status of environmental pollution fighters.  Of course, this factor cannot be attributed to obvious pluses, since this does not affect the smartphone in any way, but it is nevertheless nice to contribute to preserving the ecology of the planet. </p><p>  As for the configuration, then everything is modest: </p><ul><li>  <span>Headphones in-ear</span> firm. </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  Power supply for 1 amp. </li><li>  Instruction </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><p>  Depending on which store the order is placed in, it is possible to receive all kinds of accessories as a gift, such as a cover, protective film, admission to the program, and more. </p>

    <h2>  Visual perception </h2><p>  There are different reviews about the HTC Desire 728G Dual case, since not all users like that the device‚Äôs case is made of solid polycarbonate matte plastic and is not separable.  But at the same time, it is assembled quite well and does not publish any extraneous creaks, which, undoubtedly, is a plus of this smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design also pleases a lot.  The HTC 728G smartphone is available in two colors - white with a rose gold trim and classic black with a gray metal frame.  If we talk about the white case, then, contrary to prevailing stereotypes, the phone does not get dirty and does not collect fingerprints, and a matte mother-of-pearl shade only improves visual perception.  The smartphone is lightweight and stylish. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  On the front of the device below is a fairly wide chin.  In addition to the speaker and logo, there is nothing on it and this spoils the design somewhat, although it does not play a key role.  Yes, and not very happy that the sensor does not have additional protection, which is why HTC 728G is not recommended for purchase by children or sloppy teens. </p><p>  It is noted that the design of the HTC 728G is extremely positive.  Especially when it comes to facets.  Many people say that the power key lies nicely under the thumb, and due to the fact that the volume rocker is higher, it is difficult to accidentally hook them.  From the other end there is a stub, behind which there are two slots for SIM cards and one for a memory card.  At the top you can find the headphone jack, and at the bottom - under the micro-USB for connecting to a computer or charger and the main microphone.  Everything looks very appropriate and organic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about the front panel of the smartphone, then it has a proximity and lighting sensor, a front camera, the display itself and two speakers, because it is not in vain that the HTC 728G is called a <span>music smartphone.</span>  The main camera is located behind, framed in a gold or silver (depending on the color of the case) ring, a second microphone for noise reduction and a huge HTC logo.  Concise and simple. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This model is one of the few that has such a large screen for HTC - 5.5 inches.  What is even more surprising is that there are no plastic elements on the front of the smartphone.  The entire surface is solid glass.  The display is made using Super LCD2 technology.  What does this mean for you?  The light that comes from the screen is softer and warmer, which is much more pleasant for the eyes.  By its characteristics, it can hardly be distinguished from the usual IPS.  Add to this an oliophobic coating that improves color reproduction and image quality is not inferior to popular models of other brands. </p><p>  The screen resolution is a bit weak - only 1280x720.  The number of dots per inch is only 267. This means that a deep black color will not be transmitted, but at the same time, this resolution is not a huge barrier to watching movies or spending time playing games.  By the way, the screen is designed for 10 touches.  Viewing angles are not very.  And many noted it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the smartphone has a diagonal of 5.5 inches and it is obvious that it is difficult to call such a device small.  Speaking in the language of numbers, its height is 157.9 mm, its width is 77.8 mm, and its height is 7.87 mm.  And this with a weight of 153 grams.  Holding HTC Desire 728G in your hand is only convenient if it is large.  It is preferable to work with two hands. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  In search of clear sound, one cannot but pay attention to the HTC Desire 728G Dual Sim smartphone.  Reviews not in vain say that not falling in love with the sound of this smartphone is difficult, because it has on board the proprietary HTC BoomSound system with Dolby Audio Surround.  The sound in the headphones is deep and high quality.  And so, the speakers emit bright high and mid frequencies. </p><p>  For the reproduction of music meets its own player.  It is quite pleasant in the interface and has a wide range of features. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Let's talk about the quality of photos and videos that can be obtained from this smartphone.  It has two cameras - the front and the main ones of 5 and 13 megapixels, respectively.  What does it give? </p><p>  The main camera takes high-quality pictures that are pleasant to watch through a computer, and the video is shot with Full HD resolution.  In addition, the camera is equipped with autofocus and a high-quality LED flash, which allows you to take pictures in the darker hours of the day, although not without noise.  Moreover, the camera has a BSI sensor and an aperture of F / 2.2.  This is despite the fact that the lens is only 27 mm.  According to what the reviews say about the HTC 728G, the camera is not bad. </p><p>  In principle, the same can be said of the front camera.  The only thing she takes is lower quality pictures.  The aperture of the f / 2.8 front camera with the same BSI sensor.  The ability to manually adjust the pictures and the built-in photo editor application with proprietary effects help to make candy out of any picture. </p><p>  Both cameras have a nice and intuitive interface, so that the settings obey everyone. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  If we talk about the battery, then the HTC Desire 728G Dual Purple Myst reviews are, again, mixed.  Some believe that a capacity of 2800 mAh is not enough for a smartphone with such costs, but the manufacturer assures that the talk time is up to 26 hours on 2G networks, up to 21 on 3G networks, and in standby mode it‚Äôs at all about 500. Having tested Geekbench 3 application, it was noted that with a constant load, the smartphone from 100% to 0 will be discharged in just over 9 hours. </p><p>  Is the battery not replaceable?  You can‚Äôt remove it.  Therefore, there are recommendations to ensure that the phone is charged on time and correctly. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 728G DS processor and memory </h2><p>  The most important in this device is the well-proven 8-core 64-bit MediaTek MT6753 with a frequency of 1.3 GHz and Mali T720 graphics.  This gives a fairly high performance. </p><p>  The RAM is a little disappointing.  When you read reviews on the HTC Desire 728G DS smartphone, many users are indignant at why manufacturers did not expand the memory to 2 gigabytes, but made only 1.5.  However, this did not affect the performance in any way, so many buyers simply turned a blind eye. </p><p>  If we talk about the built-in memory, then its 16 GB.  But, as mentioned earlier, the smartphone has a slot for a micro-SD 3.0 memory card up to 2 TB.  These indicators are pleasant and appropriate for a device of this class. </p>

    <h2>  System </h2><p>  Android 5.1 with the HTC Sense 7.0 shell shows itself as a pretty good tandem.  Reading about the HTC 728G reviews, you can understand that the device does not pull out the maximum settings of such popular games as NFS No Limits or Modern Combat 5, so it‚Äôs worth lowering them a little.  Nevertheless, if you do not look at the device as a gadget for games, it is noted that the transition between programs is quick and smooth.  And, according to the Antutu tester, the smartphone gives out almost 35 thousand parrots.  And there is something to ponder! </p><p>  Especially in a large number of HTC 728G reviews from car enthusiasts, since GLONASS / GPS and OTG are built into it.  This system helps you navigate anywhere in the world.  The high-quality Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n module and Bluetooth 4.1 are also pleasing. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Sense 7.0 has become the real pride of HTC Desire 728G DS.  Reviews praise an interesting presentation of multitasking, which can be customized to your own taste preferences, for example, for the fifth android. </p><p>  Many noted that they like the new visualization with work with two SIM cards.  When typing a message, you will have access immediately to both SIM cards in the corner on the right.  Smartphone <span>HTC Desire 728G received</span> good <span>reviews</span> not in vain. </p><p>  No less attractive was the special Sense Home screen.  It adapts to your needs.  Its menu is divided into three points: work, home and on the go.  Switching modes depending on the location, the phone remembers which applications you use most often and will later become a pleasant assistant, since your desktop will not be loaded with a bunch of unnecessary widgets, but only those that are useful to you wherever you are. </p>
