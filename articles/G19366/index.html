It is not the largest in the country, but it is one of those places that you must visit when you come to Thailand.  Oceanarium in Pattaya allows you to get acquainted with the underwater world of the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.  About 200 species of marine life are represented here.  In total, more than 4000 animals and fish live in the aquarium.  And many of them can not only be seen, but also touched and even fed. </p><p>  It is called the underwater aquarium - Underwater World Pattaya, or "The Underwater World of Pattaya."  It works daily from 9-00 to 18-00, but the ticket office closes an hour before the end of work.  It is best to come here on <span>weekdays,</span> as there are a lot of people on weekends.  Most tourists coming to Thailand must visit the Pattaya Aquarium.  The ticket price is low - only 500 butts for an adult and 300 for a child.  And for kids, admission is free.  But you can save money and visit the aquarium with a guided tour, since it costs the same, but this amount also includes travel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Aquarium Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2132587.jpg"></div>

Nearby are the large supermarkets Tesco Lotus and Marco, so the place is famous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to get to the Pattaya Aquarium - everyone who wants to visit it on their own needs to know.

    <h2>  Communication with the inhabitants of the aquarium </h2><p>  What is unusual about this oceanarium is that you can get to know the marine life quite closely.  Near the entrance there is a shallow pool in which safe sea animals live: turtles, blue rays, many small fish and even cat sharks.  You can touch them all, only you can‚Äôt get anyone out of the pool.  Nearby is another tank where red carps live.  It attracts visitors not only the waterfall, but also the opportunity to chat with them.  These fish are very sociable, they are happy to eat from their hands.  To feed them, you need to pay 20 butts and take a special bottle with a pacifier. </p><p>  Then you can go into the tunnel, where there is also the opportunity to chat with fish.  First of all, it is a special aquarium in which there are specially designed openings.  Water from them does not pour out, but each visitor can put his hand in there and touch the marine inhabitants.  In addition, for a fee - 3,500 butts - you can swim next to sharks.  The visitor is given equipment and is accompanied by an instructor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Aquarium ticket price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2132585.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Feeding animals and fish </h2><p>  One of the most interesting entertainments for children and adults is feeding animals.  There is a schedule, they are fed at different times, so you can fully enjoy this process.  In addition to being offered to feed hand-held orange carps on their own, it is interesting to see how oceanarium personnel feed sharks, stingrays, turtles and otters.  Moreover, regular feeding often turns into a show.  The staff is always happy to chat with visitors, entertain children. </p><h2>  Entertainment for visitors </h2><p>  If you come to the aquarium with a guided tour, then the visit time will be limited.  Therefore, some get to the aquarium on their own and spend almost the whole day here.  After all, there is something to see in this place.  In addition to pools and aquariums with outlandish fish, the Pattaya Aquarium offers plenty of fun.  Therefore, you won‚Äôt be bored. </p><p>  In addition to self-sightseeing and communication with marine life near the entrance, you can watch shows with sea otters or feeding sharks.  This happens several times a day, and the schedule can be found at the box office.  Especially many people like the extreme attraction - swimming with sharks.  It costs quite a lot - 3,500 butts, but it delivers a lot of thrills.  In addition, educational programs and lectures on marine life are often held for children.  At local schools, a visit to the aquarium is even part of the program. </p><p>  You can relax in one of the several cozy cafes where you can enjoy goodies and cold drinks.
