  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Leader Park" (Mytishchi) - a modern residential quarter located near the main city of the state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is a huge metropolis located in the heart of the state.  People from other cities flock here in the hope of earning money or moving to a permanent place of residence.  But the cost per square meter of housing in the capital is too high for a simple layman.  Therefore, many prefer to purchase housing outside the Moscow Ring Road, within transport accessibility.  New buildings in the Moscow region are growing very fast.  For example, "Leader Park" (Mytishchi). </p><div class="photo" data-original="lookuprealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo &quot;Park Leader&quot; Mytishchi" class="if uuid-2260581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2260581.jpg"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  The developer of the complex chose a very good place for his project.  Just a little more than six kilometers separates the complex from the Moscow Ring Road.  An undoubted advantage is the possibility of a direct exit to the Volkovskoye highway, which connects with the Moscow Ring Road.  Travel time does not take more than 15 minutes.  You can get to the LCD "Leader Park" in Mytishchi and on other highways - Yaroslavsky and Ostashkovsky. </p><p>  In addition, the future residents of the complex are offered picturesque views of the Rupasovsky Ponds, Pirogovsky Forest Park, where it is so nice to relax with your family in the fresh air, fry the barbecue.  Not far from the "Leader of the Park" in Mytishchi, the Klyazma River flows, where you can plunge on a hot day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="m.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New building &quot;Leader Park&quot; Mytishchi" class="if uuid-2260583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2260583.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  ‚ÄúLeader Park‚Äù in Mytishchi is a residential quarter, consisting of five 17-storey buildings.  Buildings are erected using monolithic brick technology.  Everyone will find an apartment to their taste and budget.  The developer offers a choice: from small studios to spacious three-room apartments designed for a large family.  For the convenience and ergonomics of the living area, the project provides for the combination of the living room and kitchen, which allows you to use the room not only for eating, but also for relaxing or playing. </p><p>  The territory of the residential complex will be landscaped as much as possible, equipped with lawns, benches, which will allow its residents to enjoy leisure or walks along the paths.  The developer even envisaged the equipment of special sites for walking dogs near houses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvartirazamkad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about &quot;Leader Park&quot; Mytishchi" class="if uuid-2260584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2260584.jpg"></div><h2>  Internal and external infrastructure </h2><p>  The project provides its own infrastructure: a kindergarten, school, underground parking, children's and sports grounds, shops and other facilities.  Residents of this complex will not have to travel to the city to purchase the necessary food and other things.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about your children who will be able to attend educational institutions on the territory of the Leader Park complex in Mytishchi. </p><p>  The location of the residential complex directly within the city will allow its residents to take advantage of its entire infrastructure.  Nearby is a gymnasium, several secondary schools, kindergartens and many supermarkets: Pyaterochka, Magnit, Perekrestok.  Also nearby are sports facilities, theaters and everything that everyone needs for relaxation and development. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  At the moment, the hulls are only being commissioned.  Therefore, there are still very few reviews about Leader Park in Mytishchi.  The most burning issue of interest holders is the timing of putting the facility into operation, as there is a slight delay in the construction schedule. </p>
