    <p>  It was believed that Seth initially had good qualities and was not the patron saint of evil.  But envy of his elder brother sharpened the heart of God more and more, eliminating all good from him.  Mythology tells about the confrontation of the brothers.  Seth tried to get rid of Osiris.  And once he had the most insidious of all ideas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Betrayal of Seth </h2><p>  At a time when they believed in the <span>gods Osiris</span> and Seth, it was customary to start taking care of their afterlife in advance.  Even in their youth, they ordered sarcophagi and built tombs.  When the construction was completed, it was possible to celebrate.  So Seth ordered a sarcophagus for himself.  But only he turned out to be god not in size. </p>

Then all the guests of the treacherous god took turns trying on a gift.  But he only came up only to Osiris.  As soon as he lay in the sarcophagus, the lid closed.  Seth poured lead on the sarcophagus and threw his brother's body into the waters of the Nile.

    <p>  The wife of Osiris Isis put on mourning.  She was looking for her husband for a long time and wandered around different lands.  Finally, she found out that the coffin of her husband became a column in one of the palaces.  Isis hid her divine origin and became a nanny, just to be near the body of her husband.  But her deception soon opened.  And then Isis asked to give her the coffin. </p><p>  The goddess was able to hide her wandering and its outcome from a cruel brother.  She also did not tell Seth about her pregnancy, and then about the birth of her son Horus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Seth vs Horus </h2><p>  According to mythology, Gore grew up a strong youth, a powerful warrior.

    <p>  The stories of the gods include the eternal opposition of good and evil, like any other mythology.  Seth appears in her as the personification of the evil, but they did not forget him and worshiped him.  It was believed that he was capable of any deceit.  But he could protect against evil.  He was considered the patron saint of soldiers, but was also associated with mysterious lands beyond the borders of Egypt. </p><p>  There are many myths about Set.  And not in all he appears as a villain.  One of the most important gods is Set.  The mythology of Egypt tells the story of its rise and fall. </p>
