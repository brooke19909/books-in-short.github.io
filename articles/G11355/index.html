And although these countries are completely different, there are differences that add extra points towards spending a vacation, for example, in Monastir. </p><h2>  Monastir - the history of the city </h2><p>  Nature herself did everything in her power to make Monastir a resort town: </p><ul><li>  It is located among the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </li><li>  The beaches with pure white sand seem to be inviting tourists. </li><li>  Wonderful climate, not annoying by sweltering heat. </li></ul><p>  These natural little things make your vacation in this country very enjoyable.  Although many tourists are afraid to travel to Muslim countries on beach vacations, as they are new to their laws and traditions, this is not the case in Tunisia. </p>

    <p>  You can swim in swimsuits here, but it is better not to appear on the streets or in the mosque in shorts and open tops. </p><p>  Once this town was the residence of Caesar, and its name is familiar to everyone who at least superficially studied the history of the Ancient World.  Carthage was part of the Phoenician state.  Brave travelers from the city of Tira, led by Queen Didona, who escaped from the treacherous brother of Pygmalion, founded the city, buying cunningly a large piece of land from a local tribe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the request of the tsarina, local Aboriginal leaders agreed to sell her as much land as the skin of a bull could cover.  Perhaps such a prospect amused them, but they did not know what the clever Phoenician queen is capable of.  Cutting the skin into thin strips, she overlaid them with such a large piece of land that it was possible to build a powerful fortress, which the fugitives from the Phoenician city of Tyra did.  This fortress was called Birsa, which in translation from Phoenician means skin. </p><p>  Convenient location of Carthage and its strategic importance as a port on the way of ships from different countries, always made it a ‚Äútidbit‚Äù for those who wanted to seize its wealth. </p><p>  Today it is a resort that will not offer its guests entertainment until the morning, but will allow you to relax in peace and quiet, enjoying nature and local hospitality.  For example, the Tropicana Club <span>(Tunisia), the reviews</span> of which are the most controversial, makes it possible to spend the maximum amount of time on the coast, since it‚Äôs only a few meters away. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Tunisia, with its ancient history, there is something to see, but most often any excursion begins with a visit to the ancient Ribat fortress on the seashore.  It was built in 796 by Hartam bin Ayyan and even now one can feel the power of its walls, so strong and magnificent.  They rise above the coast, like a thousand years ago, only at that time their function was to instill fear and thought into the enemies and sea robbers that this fortress could not be conquered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You can visit it on your own, but it is better to do it accompanied by a guide who will give information about how, and who built this building, about its strategic importance in various historical eras. </p><p>  Club Hotel Tropicana (Tunisia), located in Sakhlin, organizes excursions for its guests to the most significant sights of the region.  Fortress Ribat among them. </p><p>  For a quiet walk during the daytime, when the beach is too hot, the old part of the city of Medina is suitable, where numerous shops with local ceramics, silver, wood and leather products are concentrated.  Real souvenirs impregnated with the spirit of Tunisia need to be bought here. </p><p>  The harbor of the city is a favorite place not only for its guests, but also for local residents.  It is especially impressive at sunset, when the white stones of the pier and the yachts acquire a beautiful pink hue. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  It‚Äôs good when you are staying on vacation at a hotel that has its own beach.  Club Tropicana is located within walking distance from the coast, which makes it even more attractive, although it has a level of only 3 stars. </p><p>  The beaches of Monastir have their pros and cons: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, they are covered with white sand, which is cleaned daily. </li><li>  Secondly, a gentle entrance to the sea and a rather long shallow water make these places an ideal place for families with children. </li><li>  Thirdly, the purest water, in which it is so pleasant to engage in various types of water sports. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the minuses should be noted: </p><ul><li>  The presence of algae, which throws every morning on the coast.  They are either cleaned by hotel cleaners, for example, the <span>Club Tropicana 3</span> hotel <span>(Monastir)</span> does this, or people specially hired for this, but when city guests come to the beach, the sand is already clean. </li><li>  Jellyfish that migrate every year to a new place, so you can‚Äôt guess in advance which beach they will settle on again.  They can sting hard enough.  There have been times when people were hospitalized with severe skin burns that cause their tentacles.  Allergy sufferers, people with a weak heart, and children should be especially careful. </li></ul><p>  In an extreme case, in order not to spoil the impression of a beautiful country, you can spend time in a sun lounger by the pool, compensating for the troubles with cocktails and fruits. </p><h2>  Sakhlin </h2><p>  It is here that the Tropicana Club Hotel (Tunisia) is located. Hotel guest reviews about the village are the warmest. This Arab village is located just a few kilometers from Monastir, but its shops have completely different prices. </p><p>  Reviews from those who have been here about the local population are full of warmth.  If the guest of the country has some problem, then they will solve it together with the whole village and will certainly help.  It so happened that the confused tourists were faced with the fact that in the evenings there was no taxi from Sakhlin, so the locals took them on their transport for free to the city. </p>

    <p>  Club Hotel Tropicana (Tunisia) is also distinguished by its responsive and patient staff.  Given that people with completely different habits and needs come here, this is especially important.  So Tunisians should learn tolerance.  They are especially patient with children, even the most moody.  Apparently, this is in the blood of the Arabs.  A child is a messenger and a gift from God, so you should treat him with respect. </p><p>  Otherwise, this region is especially attractive when there has not yet been intense heat, which is simply unbearable in August, the hottest month in Tunisia. </p><h2>  What to do on vacation </h2><p>  For those who love noisy parties and club life, Tunisia is hardly suitable.  Hotel Club Tropicana 3 offers its guests a measured calm rest, during which time flows slowly and more attention can be paid to local attractions. </p><p>  For example, in order to understand the Tunisians, one should visit the small but very substantial museum of the history of Hammamet, where one can get acquainted with the life and interests of the local population. </p><p>  Fans of the George Lucas Star Wars movie series will be curious to visit the movie sets built in the Sahara Desert.  To do this, just go to the reception of the Club Tropicana hotel and book a two-day excursion to the hottest terrain of the planet. </p>

It is an ideal place for families with children.  No noise from nightclubs, but each day lived in with fun and full of impressions. </p>

    <p>  The club has a great work of young animators who ‚Äúslow down‚Äù customers and call for an active lifestyle.  For example, thanks to them, every morning at the hotel begins with gymnastics near the pool with subsequent water procedures and elements of water aerobics in the pool. </p><p>  So they say about the "Tropicana Club" (Tunisia) reviews of vacationers.  Numerous rallies and attractions, which are arranged by animators, give a charge of vivacity for the whole day.  Especially happy are the little hotel guests. </p><p>  The beach, owned by the club, also pleases with its cleanliness, free sun loungers and umbrellas.  If suddenly stinging jellyfish ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù the beach, you can have a great time near one of the club‚Äôs pools. </p><p>  Although it is rich in luxury hotels in Tunisia, the Club Tropicana hotel, which has a 3-star category, is always popular with customers of different income levels.  Excellent service and developed infrastructure make every client feel great in it. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Club Tropicana 3 * shows its hospitality already at the reception.  For example, there are cases when travelers came to it at night, and the administration arranged a light dinner for newly arrived guests, and only after that they were escorted to their rooms.  Is this not an example of Tunisian hospitality? </p><p>  In addition, at the disposal of guests: </p><ul><li>  barbecue areas and pools; </li><li>  a terrace for sunbathing and a beautiful fragrant garden for walks; </li><li>  2 restaurants and bars where you can order, if necessary, a diet menu; </li><li>  free internet and parking; </li><li>  animation and evening entertainment; </li><li>  night club and karaoke; </li><li>  own beach and mini-golf course; </li><li>  billiards and table tennis; </li><li>  children's playroom; </li><li>  SPA and hot tubs; </li><li>  sauna and fitness center; </li><li>  tennis court and massage room. </li></ul><p>  In addition, guests are offered comfortable rooms, which are cleaned daily.  Two accommodation options are offered - double and quadruple apartments.  A day in a double room will cost a tourist about 80 dollars.  By the way, payment is not required for reservations.  Settlement is made upon arrival at the hotel. </p><p>  Like the whole of Tunisia, relaxation (Tropicana Club 3 * is no exception), travelers will remember their impressions for a long time. Probably, the reason is in a sunny, beautiful country inhabited by a wise and patient people who justify all the tales of oriental hospitality. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The entertainment of hotel guests is primarily expected on the beach.  Windsurfing is well developed here, which you can do all day.  Hotel guests can rent catamarans and scooters, as well as boat rental or yacht trips. </p><p>  No less interesting will be diving, especially for beginners.  There are no extreme sites for diving, and the underwater world is not as diverse as near the coral reefs, but to learn the basics of diving and get acquainted with the underwater inhabitants of the Mediterranean is real. </p><p>  In the evenings, you can listen to a concert by local artists, and DJs are awaiting guests at the nightclub.  Of course, Tunisia (Monastir, "Tropican Club" 3 *) is not so rich in various shows and performances as Turkey or Egypt, but lovers of a relaxing family vacation can do this. </p><p>  If you "dilute" the entertainment on the territory of the hotel with numerous excursions in the cities of the country, then we can assume that the rest was a complete success. </p><p>  It will be interesting and informative to visit local shops and markets where you can buy real masterpieces from Tunisian craftsmen who adhere to the traditions of antiquity.  This is especially true of silver jewelry, which are famous for local jewelers. </p><h2>  Thalassotherapy </h2><p>  A special pride of Tunisians is the ability to rejuvenate people and restore their vigor and strength.  The local thalassotherapy is based on the very algae that workers on the beach so carefully collect every morning. </p><p>  Tunisia is known for its spas throughout Europe.  High-quality services, unique wellness services and procedures and their moderate cost annually attract thousands of men and women to this country who take care of their body and monitor their appearance. </p>

Even if it doesn‚Äôt go out in finance, to take a course of thalassotherapy, which costs from $ 600, you must definitely go through a trial procedure for $ 20-30. </p><p>  The result will be visible almost instantly, which is often just an incentive for customers not to save money, but to afford everything at once. </p><p>  Among the procedures, wraps, cryotherapy, applications, bu-marin and various types of hot tubs are especially popular. </p><h2>  From Tunisia with the best mood </h2><p>  The Tropicana Club (Tunisia), the most enjoyable holiday reviews, has its own SPA center, where you can undergo any anti-aging treatments or cleansing programs if you wish.  The specialists of the center offer their patients not only relaxation, but also healthy activity, for which the fitness club trainers create stimulating programs for strengthening muscles and joints, as well as sets of exercises for losing weight. </p><p>  Today, Tunisia is not only a relaxed vacation on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, but a real spa resort, where each client can choose for himself the type of procedures and loads that he needs. </p><p>  Such resorts are becoming especially popular all over the world, and the club ‚ÄúTropicana‚Äù (Tunisia) does not lag behind this fashion.  Hotel rating among its categories is consistently high.  The hotel is on the list of ten best three-star hotels in the country. </p><p>  So it makes sense to experience all the charm of this place and its service. </p>
