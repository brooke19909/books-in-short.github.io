    <h2>  Establishment of the Order of the Red Star </h2><p>  <span>The award of the Order of the</span> Red Star became state after the Plenum of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR adopted and signed the Decree.  This happened back in the 1930s. </p><p>  In the future, various adjustments were only made to the provisions for which they give the Order of the Red Star.  So, changes were made three times in the 40s, and the approval of the new edition of the order occurred in 1980. </p><h2>  Status </h2><p>  The government established the order to award distinguished citizens. </p>

    <p>  It was supposed to be worn on the right side, after the Order of the Patriotic War II degree, if any. </p><h2>  What did the award look like? </h2><p>  The Order of the Red Star had the shape of a five-pointed star and was covered with ruby-colored enamel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the center is a shield that depicts the Red Army men in overcoats and Budenovki hats holding rifles in their hands.  On the edge of the shield one could read the inscription ‚ÄúWorkers of all countries, unite‚Äù, and on the bottom - ‚ÄúUSSR‚Äù.  Under the shield was an image of a sickle and a hammer.  The edges of all elements of the award were oxidized. </p><p>  For the manufacture of the order used high-grade silver.  Each award took more than 27 grams of metal, and the weight of the order was a little more than 30 grams. </p><p>  Its dimensions were small.  The distance between the peaks of the star was 47 or 50 cm and depended on the year in which the award was issued. </p><p>  For fastening the order on its reverse side there was a pin with a thread.  On the wrong side of the tunic, a flat nut was wound onto the pin, holding the order on the chest. </p><p>  The kit included a moire silk ribbon 24 mm wide.  A five-millimeter gray strip passed along the center of the tape. </p><p>  At first, the order was worn on the left, but subsequently they introduced slats with ribbons that could be worn on the right side, and the award badge began to be attached to the other side. </p><h2>  Order History: First Decade </h2><p>  The award is the first among the Soviet and the second combat, given the time of establishment.  The authors are the sculptor Golenetskiy and the artist Kupriyanov. </p><p>  The Order takes its history of the award since 1930.  The first to receive it was the well-known red commander, who later became the Marshal of the Soviet Union, Vasily Konstantinovich Blucher.  His merit was to repel the pressure of the Chinese army on the Sino-Eastern Railway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  After Blucher, the award received a group of pilots who made a long flight on airplanes created by Soviet aircraft designers.  The flight route passed through Moscow, Ankara, Tiflis, Kabul and Tashkent.  The final destination was again Moscow.  The total length of the flight was more than 10 thousand kilometers.  This is another example of what the Order of the Red Star is given for. </p><p>  The inventor and engineer of the military industry Kovalev, servicemen Pavlunovsky, Karutsky and others also received the Order of the Red Star.  The list of awards for the decade before World War II can be listed for a long time. </p><h2>  Presentation of the Order for Heroism in the Pre-War Time </h2><p>  Test pilots who conducted flights and repair of aircraft right in the air, earned recognition, for which they received the Order of the Red Star.  In this way, servicemen were awarded who did not perform any feats in the framework of hostilities, but were distinguished by heroic deeds committed for the country in peacetime.  A perfect example: the pilot Vykosa and the navigator Erenkov during the winter flight were able to repair the chassis mount directly in the air.  Erenkov climbed onto the wing of the aircraft, Vykosa held him with his hands without special devices.  Thanks to the courage and heroism of the pilots, the damage was repaired and the flight completed successfully. </p>

    <p>  There was experience in awarding the order to medical workers.  He was received by Pyotr Vasilyevich Mandryka - head of the central hospital of the People's Commissar - for exemplary leadership and competent formulation of the medical case. </p><h2>  Awarding of orders of aviation workers </h2><p>  In the pre-war era, it was most often workers in the aviation industry, pilots, navigators, and test engineers who received the Red Star award most often.  So, for example, in 1933, mechanical engineers <span>of the Air Force</span> Aladinsky, Michugin, Gromov and others received the Order of the Red Star, dedicated to <span>Aviation Day.</span>  Together with them, employees of military educational institutions training personnel for the air force, and employees of the construction department involved in the creation of aviation equipment were awarded. </p><p>  Among the awarded workers in the aviation industry was the name of the currently famous aircraft designer Andrei Nikolaevich Tupolev.  The wording used to receive the order was as follows: "For the creation of a number of outstanding aircraft."  But soon the outstanding engineer failed, he was arrested, and all awards were confiscated.  Just before the war, Tupolev was released, rehabilitated, and was able to return his rewards.  True, they had completely different numbers. </p><h2>  Evaluation of the merits of other industries </h2><p>  Along with the aviation industry at that time, a major role was played by the extraction of precious materials.  The order was awarded to the head of the gold mining department Serebrovsky for the fact that under his strict guidance the enterprise exceeded the program for metal mining in 1934. </p>

    <p>  In the next two years, workers in the rocket and tank industries were appreciated.  The orders were received by technicians, tank drivers, distinguished by excellent combat skills and the successful development of political training.  For example, the tanker Oshkaderov received an award for 800 hours of trouble-free tank control. </p><p>  Among others, Red Stars received newspaper staff.  In the forefront was awarded the collective of the newspaper of the same name.  He was noted for his particular success in providing training and navy.  Later, the Red Star received other medals. </p><h2>  Order of the Red Star of the Second World War </h2><p>  During World War II, the number of recipients of the award grew by more than two million.  One of the first to be awarded the order was the radio operator Belovol, who was in the rank of junior sergeant.  He alone managed to bring down 3 enemy planes when the group of Soviet planes returned from the mission. </p>

    <p>  The participants of the Second World War, awarded the Order of the Red Star, were distinguished by their heroism and dedication.  Among them were not only outstanding military personnel, but also entire army formations, and military units and subunits. </p><p>  The Order of the Red Star of the Second World War was received by both officers who distinguished themselves by their competent command of battles, and ordinary soldiers, sergeants and corporal for their heroism in defending their homeland. </p><h2>  Heroes awarded the Order of the Red Star </h2><p>  In the USSR there were many heroes who received the Order of the Red Star.  The award list also contains the names of celebrities.  For example, aircraft designer A.N. Tupolev distinguished himself by creating a unique aircraft, and actor V.A. Etush participated in the defense of Rostov and Ukraine. </p><p>  Participants of the Second World War, awarded the Order of the Red Star, were present among foreign citizens.  The merits of soldiers from England, Africa, Italy, as well as brave peace fighters among the US military were appreciated.  In total, during the <span>Great Patriotic War</span> , more than 180 foreign citizens were awarded. </p><p>  Knowing what a feat people have made for their homeland for many decades, the question of why they give the Order of the Red Star to one or another engineer, officer or soldier becomes an uncomplicated one. </p><h2>  Other military awards of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  During the USSR, a number of medals were instituted, which were awarded to servicemen of the army, navy, <span>internal troops</span> and border guards.  Among them, the <span>medals ‚ÄúFor Courage‚Äù</span> and ‚ÄúFor Military Merit‚Äù earned special honor.  They were received by those who showed courage and courage in the fight against enemies for the preservation of borders, the integrity and sovereignty of the country. </p><p>  Separate medals were established for sailors, midshipmen and officers of the Navy: named after Admirals Ushakov and Nakhimov. </p><p>  During the years of World War II, after successfully defending cities from invaders, the head of the Union, Joseph Vissarionovich, issued orders for awarding the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the City‚Äù to particularly distinguished soldiers and residents of the liberated cities.  So, the awards were received by the defenders of Leningrad, Sevastopol, Moscow, Stalingrad and other cities of the country. </p>
