The set includes wooden blocks with a rectangular section, each of which differs slightly from the other in size.  All of them are made of natural hypoallergenic materials, therefore they are safe for children and people prone to allergic reactions.  Before starting the game, you need to assemble a tower of these parts, laying them perpendicular to each other in three pieces.  The task of the players is to take out one bar at a time from any floor of the tower and move it upstairs. </p><h2>  Features of the game and the reason for its popularity </h2><p>  The rules of the game "Jenga" seem very simple, but this process of shifting the details is very exciting.  Each wooden part due to its rough surface is quite tightly adjacent to the neighboring ones, so it can be difficult to remove.  But due to the difference in size, some bars are taken out more easily than neighboring ones.  You can only find out if the selected block is sufficiently mobile, you can only try to push it out.  The most important thing is to prevent the building from collapsing during the player‚Äôs action. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jenga game rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2078557.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Jenga is one of many equilibrium games.  But it is one of the most popular due to the simplest rules and versatility.  You can safely take it with you to nature or to gatherings with friends, without worrying that the details will break or be lost.  There are many competitions in the game "Jenga".  Players train a lot to reach heights in pulling bars from the lower floors.  Some people use special clicks for this, knocking out the lower bars so quickly that the tower remains almost motionless. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jenga dice rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2078558.jpg"></div>

It doesn‚Äôt matter if the piece of wood is ‚Äútight‚Äù; it needs to be removed.  But if at this time the tower collapses, the player will be declared defeated.  The rules of the Jenga board game are sometimes changed by the players themselves.  For example, the bars can be numbered, painted in different colors and come up with some kind of prize for the player to draw out a bar of a certain color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rules of the game jenga with numbers and dice" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2078555.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Varieties of board games for balance </h2><p>  On sale you can find similar equilibrium games: ‚ÄúLeaning Tower‚Äù, Tower and ‚ÄúBucks‚Äù are almost identical in appearance I see with ‚ÄúJenga‚Äù.  ‚ÄúVilla Paletti‚Äù, ‚ÄúBausak‚Äù, ‚ÄúPack Donkey‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrash‚Äù are created according to the same principle, but differ in the shape and number of bars.  The parts that make up the tower can be square in cross section, which facilitates the pulling process.  But because of the appearance, the number of bars in each version is very different.  There are many variations within the Jenga line of games.  One of the most popular is Jenga Boom.  The structure includes the same wooden bars, but additionally in the set there is a special stand with a timer, which greatly speeds up the process and makes players nervous, distracting with a loud tick.  The rules of the game "Jenga Boom" are not much more complicated: if the player does not have time to make his move before the "bomb" works, the stand begins to vibrate and destroys the tower.  The one on the move this is considered a loser. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board game jenga rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2078556.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is a variation of the game "Jenga" with plastic parts in the form of figures "Tetris".  To play such a "tower" is much more difficult, since the configuration of details is not visible inside it, and by pulling the wand, you can extend, for example, a zigzag shape and bring down the building.  The rules of the game ‚ÄúJenga‚Äù with numbers and dice are a little more complicated than in the standard version: players need to roll four dice and get a part with a number from the tower, which is the sum of all the points that fell on the faces.  In this version, all faces will be numbered. </p><h2>  What is useful for adults and children </h2><p>  The rules of the game "Jenga" with cubes can be changed at your discretion.  Although the process of building a tower and its destruction seems simple, it captivates players of all ages, allowing adults and children to compete on equal terms.  In addition, the process of extracting parts from the design develops fine motor skills, attentiveness and accuracy, and the Jenga Boom version will be an excellent stress resistance trainer and will teach you how to respond quickly in an emergency when ‚Äútime is running out‚Äù.  Perhaps, it will become even more interesting for small players to play with wooden bars, if you combine the rules of the game "Jenga" with numbers and dice and the presence of a timer.  Or apply various colors to the details, taking an additional cube with multi-colored faces, which will further complicate the game. </p>
