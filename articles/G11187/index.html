    <p>  Caracas is considered a fairly densely populated city, because almost a sixth of the country's population lives in it. </p><p>  The capital of Venezuela was founded by Diego de Losada, a Spaniard by nationality, in 1567.  Then it was called Santiago de Leon de Caracas, but later the difficult name was changed to a much simpler one - Caracas. </p><p>  The city was built on the site of a burned Indian settlement, he repeatedly suffered from the attack of pirates.  It was in Caracas in 1811 that the National Congress was convened, proclaiming the independence of the country, and after 20 years the capital moved here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Venezuela" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/48176.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <p>  Venezuela, which is also called "little Venice", is considered the sixth largest state in <span>South America.</span>  Its main attractions are the highest waterfall in the world and the longest river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of Venezuela is located among the ridge of mountains towering under the sky, in the valley of "singing birds."  Caracas is truly mysterious: it perfectly combines the new and the old.  Huge skyscrapers and ultra-modern buildings look great against the background of old streets and squares.  Despite the fact that it is growing very quickly, and its territory is already very built up, however, there are many green parks and plantings. </p><p>  In 1900, the capital of Venezuela was severely destroyed as a result of a powerful earthquake, which claimed numerous lives and caused huge losses.  But after <span>oil fields</span> were discovered on the outskirts of Caracas, a heyday began for the city.  Multi-storey modern buildings, express roads, residential complexes and centers were built for oil revenues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Venezuela" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/48178.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But despite such rapid growth, the capital of Venezuela carefully guards its historical places, such as Bolivar Square, in the center of which there is a monument to the Liberator, the 17th-century cathedral, and the Natal Palace. </p><p>  In general, there are many places connected with the name of Bolivar in the city: a museum, a palace where his childhood passed, an avenue, two skyscrapers connected among themselves are named in his honor. </p><p>  The capital of Venezuela is rightfully proud of its Botanical Garden, which contains a rare collection of cacti, and between the sea and the city there is a huge reserve - a favorite place of citizens. </p><p>  Of no less interest is the city hippodrome, located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than five hundred hectares. </p><p>  In Caracas there are also a university, a music academy, many theaters, museums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caracas" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/48175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tours in Venezuela are quite rare today.  We, Russians, know little about this country, but almost everyone has heard of Hugo Chavez, her late but very charismatic president, who brought his country out of a protracted war.  And therefore, today tourists can already witness with their own eyes the unique nature of Venezuela, its <span>Angel Falls,</span> which is the most magnificent natural miraculous creation on the continent. </p><p>  Fans of beach vacations will appreciate the magnificent beaches of this Caribbean coast, and those who prefer an active pastime can enjoy rafting, safari and jeeping in many protected parks of the country. </p>
