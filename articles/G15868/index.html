One of these is the city of Sol-Iletsk.  The route Izhevsk - Sol-Iletsk can be reached in several ways. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.86186009999999" data-lng="53.2324284" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/8/1/7/16817.png"></div><h2>  Option with a change in Orenburg </h2><p>  At 17:30 from the central bus station of Izhevsk, a bus leaves for Orenburg.  A ticket for it costs from 2000 rubles.  Flights are not daily.  To the destination go 17 hours.  The bus itself is 44-seater, Volvo brand.  In Orenburg, he drops off passengers near the Armada bus station on the Sharlykskoye highway (this is the northern part of the city) near a large shopping center.  Far enough from the center of Orenburg. </p><p>  From Orenburg to Sol-Iletsk can be reached in three ways: by bus, train and long-distance train. </p><p>  A bus ticket costs 250 rubles, and it takes about 80 kilometers to go, that is, the fare is quite high.  The trip takes 1 hour and 15 minutes. </p><p>  Flights depart from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. from the intercity bus station (Elevatornaya St., near the railway station), and also at 2 a.m. from the suburban bus station, which is located near the Cathedral Mosque on Tereshkova Street.  GAZel buses depart from the intercity bus station, and passing flights from Samara depart from the suburban bus.  For them, the final destination is the city of Aktobe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, a bus ride from Izhevsk to Sol-Iletsk will cost about 2,250 rubles.  Given the time for a transfer, the following flights are relevant: </p><ul><li>  13:45. </li><li>  3 p.m. </li><li>  3:30 p.m. </li><li>  6 p.m. </li><li>  18:46. </li></ul><p>  The local train leaves at 20:35 and arrives in Sol-Iletsk after 1.5 hours.  A ticket for it costs 153 rubles, cheaper than a bus, and nine hours of time for a transplant can be spent on a walk in Orenburg. </p><p>  With a change on a long-distance train, the situation is worse.  Firstly, tickets are many times more expensive, and secondly, they depart late in the evening or at night.  When planning a trip from Izhevsk to Sol-Iletsk, it is hardly worth considering a transfer option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train at the station" class="if uuid-3196805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3196805.jpg"></div><h2>  Transfer trip in Ufa </h2><p>  A more interesting option is a trip from Izhevsk to Sol-Iletsk, as part of the way is actually flying by plane. </p><p>  Flights from Izhevsk to Ufa are operated by KrasAvia and Orenburg airlines.  The flight on the Yak-42 or Let-410 aircraft takes 50 minutes.  Departure at 11:20, but not every day, there are flights at 02:30, they are rare.  The price depends on the current offer of the airline. </p><p>  It takes 4.5 hours to get to Ufa by bus, but it may not depart from the bus station, but belong to some private company.  These pick up customers right from the entrance.  Departure schedule is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  07:00 a.m. </li><li>  2 p.m. </li><li>  7 p.m. </li></ul><p>  A ticket costs from 850 rubles. </p><p>  Flights from Ufa to Sol-Iletsk depart from the southern bus station according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  06:50. </li><li>  07:00 a.m. </li><li>  7:30 a.m. </li><li>  12:35. </li><li>  23:00. </li></ul><p>  The trip will take from 6 to 9 hours.  Buses can be small - 19 seats each, as well as large - up to 45 seats.  Tickets cost from 900 rubles.  In Sol-Iletsk, passengers are landed near the bus station and cultural development center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station in Izhevsk" class="if uuid-3196792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3196792.jpg"></div><h2>  Option with a change in Samara </h2><p>  Perhaps this option of organizing a trip from Izhevsk to Sol-Iletsk is also suitable for someone, since you can visit Samara and the Samarskaya Luka National Park along the way.  From Izhevsk to Samara at 18:00 and 19:00 buses depart, which are in transit from 11 to 14 hours.  Ticket price - from 1600 rubles. </p><p>  The plane of the Orenburg airline departs from Izhevsk at 18:00 and lands at the Kurumoch airport in Samara after 1.5 hours. </p><p>  From Samara to Sol-Iletsk there are buses from the central bus station.  They leave at 17:00 and are in transit for about 10 hours.  A ticket costs 800 rubles. </p><p>  Trains depart at 12:48 and 17:08.  On the way, they are 9-10 hours.  A ticket costs from 1200 rubles in the reserved seat and from 2400 in a compartment.  The trains may be formed by Russian Railways, as well as the railways of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Sol-Iletsk" class="if uuid-3196818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3196818.jpg"></div><h2>  By car </h2><p>  By car from Izhevsk to Sol-Iletsk go about 800 kilometers.  You should plan about 10 hours to travel. </p><p>  You need to leave the capital of Udmurtia to the south-east along the R-322 highway to Sarapul, and then through Neftekamsk to Dyurtyuli, where there is a turn onto the M-7 highway, which leads to Ufa. </p><p>  In the capital of Bashkiria, you need to turn onto the R-240 highway and move along it to the Orenburg region, where it goes onto the R-239 highway and leads directly to Sol-Iletsk. </p>
