It is unlikely that you will now meet a person who has never in his life heard of him.  Why so?  What is the reason for this popularity?  Let's try to figure it out together. </p><h2>  Section 1. City of Zurich.  general description </h2><p>  This locality is a <span>global financial center,</span> where many commercial and industrial institutions are concentrated.  Plus, Zurich is the main center of the cultural life of the country. </p><p>  However, despite this, the city has preserved many neighborhoods with narrow and winding streets, narrow houses made in the Gothic style.  In them today are small, but very cozy cafes, fragrant pastry shops and stunning antique shops. </p>

    <p>  Zurich has approximately 50 museums and more than a hundred small galleries where various exhibitions and shows are held.  It is here that many excursion trips around the country originate, among which it is especially worth highlighting the journey on panoramic trains. </p><p>  Given all of the above, it becomes clear why <span>Zurich Airport</span> never suffers from a shortage of passengers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, among other things, the settlement actually boasts an amazing location.  It is located on the northern shore of Lake Zurich.  Walking around its surroundings, one wonders how beautiful Mother Nature is in those places where she is actually cared for and protected.  ‚ÄúZurich.  Switzerland ‚Äù- a photo that necessarily becomes worthy of the family archive of even the most avid travelers. </p><h2>  Section 2. How not to get lost in the city: public transport </h2>

    <p>  The most popular and, importantly, comfortable transport in Zurich is represented by trams.  Here this network is so developed that there are no delays even during peak hours.  Why?  In particular, this is due to the so-called "dedicated" communication paths. </p><p>  Also, anyone can use the bus, trolley or ride a train.  In particular, Zurich (Switzerland as a whole) is proud to be able to pamper its passengers with an excellent level of service.  Local administrations strive to ensure that nothing prevents residents and numerous tourists from enjoying their stay in their city. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that absolutely at all stops you can find schemes of public transport, its schedule, an automatic machine for buying tickets and a map of the surroundings located next to the stop.  It should be noted that the schedule is made in a simple and understandable way for everyone, even a foreign language will not be required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Section 3. Features, or Things to Look For </h2><p>  The capital of Switzerland - Zurich - public transport is always clean.  But that is not all.  There are many so-called "low-floor" trams, the entrance to which is facilitated for the disabled and mothers with strollers. </p><p>  Ordinary trams, by the way, have an extended rear door, which also makes it easier to enter if necessary.  According to certain rules, if there is no one to help a woman with a stroller, the driver of the transport takes this responsibility. </p><p>  If we talk about stops, then their requirement is carried out by pressing a special button.  In order to open the doors, you also need to press a certain button, often located on or near the doors. </p><p>  You should also know that you need to stock up on tickets in advance, at the bus stop, since there is no possibility of purchasing and composting them in public transport. </p>

    <p>  The capital of Switzerland, Zurich is punctual in everything.  For example, it‚Äôs better not to be late for transport.  He goes strictly on schedule and does not intend to wait for anyone.  Therefore, do not count on the driver to regret, stop and pick you up, running, somewhere in the middle of the route. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you see orange lights blinking on the side of the tram, know that he was about to leave, and it is impossible to open the closed door.  However, a certain rule applies here: until all future passengers enter the transport, the doors will not be closed and he will not go anywhere.  Therefore, if suddenly your companion does not have time, just stand in the doorway and not let them close. </p><p>  Public transport starts at five in the morning and ends around midnight. </p><p>  Naturally, there are also night buses, a ticket for which you need to buy directly from the driver.  This <span>type of transport</span> usually comes to the rescue of tourists on a walk or those who need to arrive at Zurich airport, say, in the middle of the night. </p><h2>  Section 4. The main attractions of the city </h2><p>  It should be noted that this city is quite large and geographically complex Zurich.  The card here will definitely be needed by all those who decide to get to know him as best as possible. </p>

    <p>  Let's try to list what you need to see first. </p><p>  <em>1. Bahnhofstrasse</em> </p><p>  From this place you need to start exploring the city.  This is where most of the public routes cross. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is impossible to drive along this street by car, only by tram or on foot.  Also here is just a huge number of all kinds of shops, restaurants, banks.  Consider one important nuance: if you move forward, then the level of shops rises, and in the end, closer to the lake, you can see only luxury brands.  The main hotels of Zurich are also located here, but not every average traveler can afford the price level. </p><p>  If the weather is clear on the street, then do not neglect the opportunity to walk.  Why?  Judge for yourself: in summer, an amazing aroma of <span>blooming linden</span> reigns here <span>,</span> and in winter there is a beautiful illumination of shops, a balanced color scheme reminiscent of the <span>northern lights,</span> at least for a while they will present an almost fabulous holiday atmosphere.  Presented?  Now add hot mulled wine and the incomparable aroma of <span>roasted chestnuts to it.</span> </p><p>  If you go to the very end of this street, you can go straight to Burkliplats - an area located near the lake.  If you are lucky enough to get here on a summer Saturday afternoon, then you will probably want to walk around the flea market, and in the spring carousels sometimes open here. </p><p>  It is worth noting that ships periodically sail away from this area - especially for those who want to swim in Lake Zurich.  This is information for those in whom romance still lives mixed with a thirst for adventure. </p><p>  <em>2. Zurich Lake</em> </p><p>  If the weather on the street is favorable, then perhaps you should go to the embankment of the well-known lake, take a walk along it from Grossmunster to Bellevue and further along the reservoir. </p><p>  Here you can relax body and soul in complete silence, as well as engage in such an interesting thing as feeding swans, because they in Zurich are quite brave birds that can freely eat from hands.  Of course, closer to the evening of the weekend they are already overfed so much that they don‚Äôt even want to look at the food, but on weekdays a fight can freely begin because of a piece of the loaf. </p><p>  If you wish, you can go further along the lake to the place where it expands and forms from the coast something similar to a green park zone.  It is especially interesting there on Saturday, because you can meet such a wonderful audience as clowns, magicians, gymnasts, musicians who are trying to amuse the idly staggering crowd.  Also, the so-called "free" artists are engaged in creative work right on the lake, collecting various bizarre compositions of coastal stones. </p><p>  If you suddenly have patience and walk to the end of the promenade, you can see a cozy restaurant that offers a snack and at the same time enjoy views of the lake. </p><p>  Upon returning, you can look into the Chinese park or turn from the lake to the tram line, from where it is very easy to get to the city center. </p><p>  <em>3. Mount Uetliberg</em> <strong></strong></p><p>  If there is a free day, be sure to visit Mount Uetliberg, which will open a beautiful view immediately to the whole of Zurich, the mountains located nearby - the Alps - and the lake. </p><p>  The only minus of this visit is the surcharge for a ticket for two zones, since formally this is no longer the territory of the city, therefore, a regular ticket for travel is not valid here. </p><p>  You can get to this place by train in 25 minutes, which will take you directly to the top of the mountain.  If you climb a little more on foot, you can climb to the observation tower with a stunning view.  Or you can just spend time in a cozy restaurant, enjoying the view of Zurich.  Traveler reviews guarantee a great time. </p><h2>  Section 5. Where to go with the baby </h2>

    <p>  Went on a journey in the company of a child?  Wow!  This is the right decision for those who went to Zurich.  Switzerland as a whole and the capital in particular are ready to do everything possible to make such a trip remembered by both baby and parents. </p><p>  <em>1. Zoo</em> </p><p>  You can look at amazing animals in almost natural conditions, as well as plunge into the amazing world of wildlife by going to the zoo, which is open not only for children but also for adults all year round. </p><p>  <em>2.

There are many water attractions for both the smallest and the most cautious pensioners. </p><p>  In addition, adults will surely enjoy the so-called Wellness zone. </p><p>  <em>3. The Technorama Museum in Winterthur</em> </p><p>  This museum is one of the most amazing places that everyone should see.  He will introduce you to interesting mechanics and electricity, show what is meant by the word "plasma", by what principle magnetization works, and tell you about many more interesting things. </p><p>  Here visitors will discover an entertaining and amazing world of science, displayed in all kinds of visual presentations and experiments.  You think that time is not running so fast?  Zurich will certainly prove how wrong you are!  It‚Äôs not like hours, days fly by like minutes. </p><p>  <em>4. Museum of Culture</em> </p><p>  This museum will clearly show the development of mankind.  Here you can trace the evolution of humans and various animals over an impressive time period: 600 years.  All this is displayed in very visual aids. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 6. We spend time in the fresh air.</strong> </h2>

    <p>  <em>1. Lindenhof</em> </p><p>  This place is one of the most beautiful in Zurich and offers a beautiful view of both the city itself and the Limmat River.  It is located on a hill, not far from St. Peter's Church, in the center of the old city. </p><p>  If the weather on the street is clear, then a wonderful view of the Alps opens from here.  In addition, you can swing on a swing or play chess.  Both the first and the second are equipped with special platforms. </p><p>  <em>2. Chinese park</em> </p><p>  This park is located near the lake promenade, far beyond Bellevue.  It is worth noting that, although the entrance here is paid, you need to go here, because only in this park there is the opportunity to look at a typically Chinese exterior, pleasantly pleasing to the eye, and take a break from the noisy crowd. </p><h2>  Section 7.

    <p>  In Zurich, all kinds of holidays are held all year round.
