The answer to an exciting question</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More and more often teenagers think about how many years they can get a SIM card.  This is quite normal interest.  After all, the process is very serious, especially for operators.  Buying a new number is an official deal.  And it implies compliance with certain rules established in a particular country.  What can be said about Russia in this area?  At what age is it allowed to completely buy telephone numbers from Russian operators? </p><h2>  The eternal question </h2><p>  The answer is not as simple as it seems.  The thing is that people thinking about how many years they can get a SIM card will not find a definite answer to their question.  And this fact is easily explained. </p>

    <p>  In Russia, there is no clear indication of how old children are allowed to enter into transactions with mobile operators.  Therefore, it is difficult to find an answer regarding the topic being studied.  But worth a try.  What options can each teenager face? </p><h2>  According to law </h2><p>  For example, children are often denied the sale of SIM cards.  As already mentioned, the conclusion of a contract with the operator is a transaction.  Children cannot always imprison them.  Until adulthood, the bulk of the issues are resolved through legal representatives - parents.  This means that when asked about how many years you can draw up a SIM card, the answer will sound like this - from 18.  Only an adult and fully capable person in Russia has the right to conclude any transactions.  And the purchase of a phone number is no exception.  Also, in some cases, you can buy SIM cards from 16 years old.  But only on condition that the citizen received emancipation or, for any other reason, became 100% capable.  There is no other way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Individual approach </h2><p>  Nevertheless, to date, disputes around the topic under study are still underway.  All this is due to the fact that children still use mobile devices.  Moreover, as practice shows, more and more often.  For some operations with SIM cards, the presence of the owner of the number is required.  And so I want to know exactly how many years you can draw up a SIM card in the name of a person so that in the future you do not have to activate certain functions through your parents. </p>

    <p>  In Russia, the answer to this question often depends on the operator to whom the person turned.  In practice, many companies are willing to sell sim-cards to minors, but under certain conditions.  They are recommended to be specified in each locality at a particular corporation.  How many years can I get a SIM card "Tele2"?  To date, it is allowed to carry out a similar operation after fourteen years.  And the company "MegaFon" transactions with phone numbers are allowed only from the age of 18.  Therefore, one cannot speak with confidence about when teenagers are allowed to buy SIM cards. </p><h2>  Conclusions and Conclusions </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear how many years you can draw up a MegaFon SIM card or any other.  The main thing is that the approximate limitations remain clear.  Yes, a definite answer to this question cannot be found, but it is recommended to focus on some tips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="since how many years you can draw up a sim card megaphone" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1645145.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Each person is obliged to remember that without fail when concluding an agreement with the operator a passport is required.  While he is not there, you can completely forget about purchasing a SIM card yourself.  According to the legislation, an identity card in the form of a passport of the Russian Federation is issued to all children from the age of 14.  From that moment, it is often allowed to make some transactions with organizations. </p><p>  How many years can I get a SIM card?  This is best done with full legal capacity.  Then no operator can refuse to conclude a contract.  Otherwise, there is always a risk that the purchase will fail. </p>
