    <h2>  Bellapais Abbey: history </h2><p>  When Jerusalem was captured by the Cairo sultan Salahaddin Ayyubi, and this happened in 1187, representatives of the Augustinian order were forced to flee the state.  So in this Cypriot village appeared the shelter of the monks of the Augustinians. </p><p>  The construction of the abbey began in 1198.  More precisely, the church of St. Mary of the Mountain was not built immediately for the monks.  She was transferred to the order only some time after the completion of construction.  However, the premonstrates contributed to the name of the future complex: due to the fact that the monks wore white robes, the monastery was called the ‚ÄúWhite Abbey‚Äù. </p><p>  The complex grew literally before our eyes.  New buildings were erected quickly enough, especially for the time when there was neither specialized construction equipment, nor certain technologies.  Pilgrims left generous donations, so the active expansion was more than real.  The greatest contribution to the construction of the abbey was made by King Hugo III.  For his own money, he equipped the monastery courtyard, erected a huge refectory room, created several pavilions.  Already in the XIV century, Bellapais Abbey was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The monastery complex did not receive its name immediately, but only during the reign of Cyprus by the Venetians.  Literally, the name translates as "abbey of the world." </p><p>  Bellapais survived both bright and gloomy times.  Sometimes it was hard, at other times the abbey flourished.  He was robbed and ruined, organized morally indecent acts, then restored, and life again flowed into a light channel.  When the Ottomans conquered Cyprus, the monks were expelled from the abbey.  The territory was transferred to the Greek Orthodox Church. </p><p>  Today, the abbey, made in the Gothic style, is poorly preserved.  But it still remains one of the most popular Cypriot attractions and a favorite place for the citizens living here.  In the village - measured life.  No one is in a hurry.  And tourists, calmly strolling through the abbey and streets of the settlement, looking at the clock, will see that time has stopped somewhere there, in the distant XIII century. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Since the Augusta brothers founded Bellapais Abbey and only later handed it over to the Norbertians (or Premonstrats), the emblems of the Lusignan family can be seen above the entrance to the refectory.  This huge hall is the pride not only of the monastery, but of the entire Middle East, as many historians call this building one of the best examples of Gothic architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the period of British colonial rule, the building became a shooting gallery, as indicated by bullet marks in the walls.  From the refectory you can get into the room, the true purpose of which is not fully known.  But it is assumed that there was a warehouse.  This room is also quite large.  From this it can be judged that the abbey could indeed exist autonomously for a long time, having closed itself from the outside world if necessary (for example, during epidemics or wars). </p><p>  Bellapais Abbey, which belonged to different rulers at different times, constantly acquired some new features.  So not all the details can be attributed to the XIII century.  For example, on one side of the courtyard there is a church that is best preserved.  Its construction dates back to the 1200s.  But the fresco, which can be observed on the facade, appeared presumably in the XV century. </p><p>  The tower, made in the Gothic style, meets the guests of incredible beauty, like everything else.  She lets tourists into the courtyard, which, in turn, is surrounded by eighteen arches leading to the square.  On the north side, under one of them there are 2 Roman sarcophagi.  One once played the role of lavabo. </p><p>  From the sarcophagus you can directly get into the refectory, which was described above.  There is also a pulpit in this room, and 7 large windows illuminate it - 6 from the north side and one more from the east. </p><p>  The western wall has a door leading to the kitchen and basement (it was also mentioned above).  Between the refectory and the kitchen there are vacant rooms, which are supposed to be toilets. </p><p>  On the eastern side of the courtyard there are rooms equipped several hundred years ago which served as the abbot's house and workrooms.  Previously, there was an administrative center.  In the heart of the courtyard stands a column.  According to some reports, she was brought from an old Byzantine church.  And upstairs, on the second floor, are cells. </p><p>  Bellapais Abbey, a photo of which is posted in this article, is densely planted with cypresses.  There is a legend that under them lie buried women of monks. </p>

    <h2>  Bellapais Abbey today: what is there? </h2><p>  Concerts are often held at the refectory, and a five-star restaurant with a beautiful summer veranda adjoins the monastery directly adjacent to the monastery.  Opposite the entrance to the abbey are souvenir shops with various goods. </p>

    <h2>  Bellapais Abbey: how to get there? </h2><p>  The village of the same name is located near Girne (Kyrenia), just a 20-minute drive.  You can also walk to Bellapais on foot.  But this is not the easiest task, as you have to climb the mountain.  It‚Äôs better to stop a ride or order a taxi - it‚Äôs not long to go, so you don‚Äôt need to pay a lot for the cab. </p><p>  There are no direct flights from Russia to Girne, which significantly complicates the trip.  You must first fly to Larnaca, and then take a taxi to Girne or immediately to Bellapais.  The trip will not be cheap - ordering a car will cost 70-100 euros.  Cheaper only by bus, but, firstly, you will need to make a lot of transfers, and secondly, with luggage it is very difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Opening hours and ticket prices </h2><p>  Entrance to the abbey is approximately 2.5 euros.  From March to November it works from 8 am to 6 pm, and from December to February - from 9:00 to 14:45.  On Thursdays, the abbey is open until 15:30. </p><h2>  Tourists about Bellapais Abbey </h2><p>  On the Internet, you can find many reviews from people who have visited this small village.  Bellapais Abbey (Cyprus) impresses with its unusual beauty, and its dilapidated state attracts lovers of antiquity.  In addition to visiting the territory of the monastery, you can take a walk around the village - although it is small and unremarkable, a mini-trip through the narrow streets past the old houses will be memorable. </p>
