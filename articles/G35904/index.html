There are more than 700 species.  Of course, not all of these knots are widely used in everyday life, but it’s better to be able to knit at least a few basic ones in order to apply these skills in life if necessary. </p><p>  Knitting knots is a simple matter.  But to learn how to do it accurately and with good speed is much more difficult.  Some nodes need to be tightened under load, while others do not.  Under the influence of force, some nodes can slowly untie, but there are those that tighten so tight that it is almost impossible to loosen them.  Even to such a simple occupation you need to have a predisposition.  It’s difficult for someone to tie a knotting scheme, but someone will easily connect the simplest knot the first time. </p><h2>  Binding ropes.  Straight and weaving knots </h2><p>  To begin, consider the rope nodes that are used to connect the ropes (ribbons, laces) to each other.  At the same time, we will pay attention to their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to cases in which one or another species can be used. </p><p>  Straight and <span>weaving knots are</span> very easy to tie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  However, their major drawbacks are strong tightening under the influence of the load;  spontaneous untying at variable loads (especially if the ropes are wet, hard and icy).  The ropes must have the same diameter.  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that it is impossible to use these types without control nodes.  In case of heavy loads, you should insert some object (a small stick, branch, climbing carabiner, etc.) into the center of the unit, which will prevent strong tightening. </p><h2>  Counter node </h2><p>  This rope knot knits quite easily, is durable and does not untie spontaneously.  But just like the nodes described above, it is very tightened when under load.  The diameter of the ropes does not matter.  It is often used if you need to tie a tape and a rope, a cord and a fishing line, that is, materials with different properties.  It is widely used when knitting all kinds of loops, braces, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rope knot called “oncoming eight” is similar in execution technique and properties to the previous one.  However, its peculiarity is thoroughness in binding, which significantly slows down this process. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rope knot name" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1031389.jpg" width="256"></div></h2><h2>  Clew, bramshkot knots </h2><p>  These simple rope knots are very reliable, do not tighten under the influence of load.  But they crawl strongly if the loads are variable.  Cannot be used without control nodes. </p><p>  The use of <span>clewed knot is</span> possible only when the ropes have the same diameter, the knotted knot is knotted at different diameters. </p><h2>  Grapevine </h2><p>  This rope knot, whose name in various sources may sound like "grapevine" or "flu", belongs to the category of more complex knots.  To properly knit it requires practice.  Reliability and level of aesthetic perception on top.  They are used regardless of the diameter.  Perfect for tying fishing lines, knitting loops and guy lines.  The only drawback is the strong tightening under load. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rope swing knots" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1031397.jpg" width="308"></div></h2><h2>  Hunter Knot </h2><p>  It is especially suitable if the ropes (ribbons, threads) are soft, on such materials they are not tightened too much (unlike hard ropes).  The execution algorithm is difficult enough to remember, so practical training is required.  If the loads are variable, it may crawl. </p><h2>  Snake knot </h2><p>  Due to its reliability and lack of lack of spontaneous untying, it is often used on kapron ropes that are soft and thin.  The performance is not easy, therefore, it requires practice.  If used to tie fishing lines, tightly tightens. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rope fasteners and knots" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1031398.jpg" width="291"></div></h2><h2>  Snapping and vyblenochny nodes </h2><p>  The nodes that connect the rope to the support are called binding.  They will be discussed later. </p><p>  Such knots of rope, like tie-and knotted, are similar in properties, but are tied in completely different ways. </p><p>  In both cases, the difficulty of tying is low, there is no undesirable ability to tighten under load.  At variable loads, they crawl. </p><p>  In order to increase reliability, it is recommended to use a control unit.  When using the anchor type knot, you can fix the free end of the rope using the <span>oncoming knot.</span>  And if we are talking about a vyblenochny node, then it is more expedient to make an additional revolution around an existing support using the free end.  <span>It is</span> convenient to use the <span>whisker knot</span> when the rope needs to be connected with several supports (pillars, trees, etc.). </p><h2>  "The noose" and the "boa constrictor."  Python and double python </h2><p>  The rope knot, whose name is “noose”, fits easily.  It can be easily untied after the load is removed.  Of the shortcomings, it should be noted that under variable loads it crawls quite strongly, which is why it is forbidden to use when organizing outboard crossings.  The proper level of reliability is achieved when the number of turns is more than four, especially at constant load. </p><p>  The “boa” knot, both single and double, is distinguished by good reliability.  Almost "not creeping."  Complex enough, so a beginner is unlikely to manage to tie such knots on the first try. </p><p>  They are strongly tightened, as a result of which, to facilitate the untying, they knit a loop with a free end not shorter than one meter.  Subsequently, loading this end, you can untie the knot itself. </p><p>  Particularly suitable when it is necessary to tie various wooden frames, including  raft frames at an angle of 90 °.  The necessary rigidity is due to the fact that under heavy loads, these nodes tighten tightly.  They are also often used in the repair and tying of metal frames of kayaks, catamarans, etc.  It is convenient to use if you need to attach a fishing hook to the fishing line. </p><p>  A “double boa constrictor” differs from a single boa in that, in this case, the free end wraps around the subject not once, but two. </p><p>  The rope knots, which are called “python” and “double python”, have the same properties as the “boa constrictor” and “double boa constrictor” described above.  As a result of this, their scope is the same. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simple rope knots" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1031405.jpg" width="304"></div></h2><h2>  Swing unit </h2><p>  To build a simple attraction for children, nodes are very useful.  A rope swing with a seat in the form of a board is not so difficult to do.  It is enough to have a good strong rope, support poles with a crossbeam and a regular rectangular shape board with a flat surface. </p><p>  When you need to fix the board in a horizontal position and at the same time ensure maximum strength, it is worth using the so-called swing unit.  <span>How to knit</span> rope knots of this type?  To do this, double-wrap the short end of the rope around the board.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account that the loop at the second revolution is located closer to the edge of the board.  This is necessary for subsequent laying between the two loops of the long end of the rope.  Next, the loop of the first revolution is pulled up, laid over the laid ends of the rope and overwhelmed by the end of the board.  At the end, you need to raise both ends of the rope and tie them.  Ideal in this case, the node is a non-tightening loop. </p><p>  The suspension structure in the form of ropes and a wooden board is attached to the crossbar by tying any of the knots, ensuring perpendicular fastening of the rope and support (for example, a “boa constrictor”). </p>
