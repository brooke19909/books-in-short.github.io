The first thing anyone is afraid of is a simple and banal unknown, but once you see a detailed step-by-step instruction of the whole process of work in order to understand: in fact, nothing is simpler. </p><p>  It is also important to decide what type of hardware you need.  If you are planning to sew a sports-style jacket, then a zipper closure is best for you <span>.</span>  If suddenly there is no way to get a zipper, replace it with buttons.  And if you do not have access to them, then take the buttons. </p><h2>  Jackets for women, their types and features </h2><p>  First of all, decide what exactly you want.  After all, all the jackets are so different, each in its own way is unique and beautiful.  Each fashionista in the wardrobe, as a rule, can find not one, not two, and even not five jackets and fur coats of various styles and tailoring.  And no matter how many of them, each of them means something and is intended for a special occasion.

    <p>  When patterning parts, do not forget that you need to leave 1 cm to the seams.  Transfer the pattern to paper. </p><p>  From the fabric for the jacket and the lining we cut out the following details: </p><ul><li>  Back - 1 pc. </li><li>  Before - 2 pcs. </li><li>  Sleeve - 2 pcs. </li><li>  Hood - 2 pcs. </li></ul><p>  <em>Tailoring jackets</em> </p><p>  We connect the back and sleeves.  From the main jacket fabric we sew both sides and sleeves at the same time.  We do the same actions with the lining. </p><p>  On the back of the jacket we mark the middle.  We connect the seam of the hood with the middle of the back.  We put a lining inside the hood.  1 cm wide allowances should remain on the front parts for stitching zippers.  Gently bend the remaining edges at the bottom of the zipper. </p><p>  We fold the rubber cuffs in half and sew them in the same way as the hood. </p><p>  After that, carefully attach the zipper, while stepping back from the bottom of the jacket 3 cm. <br>  It remains only to carefully hem the bottom of our jacket.  The product is ready. </p><h2>  Leather jackets </h2><p>  Let's learn how to sew a leather jacket. </p><p>  Many people think that a leather jacket is a terribly difficult task.  But if you set a goal and approach this question as correctly as possible, then in fact there are no difficulties. </p><p>  If you have basic sewing skills, know how to work with patterns, then perhaps it's time to try something new.  There are some peculiarities in working with skin: </p><p>  - In no case should leather fabric be wound with a needle, since the puncture places with the needle will remain forever. </p><p>  - In order to fasten two parts together, you can use superglue or different clamps. </p><p>  - When working with patterns, you need to take into account the density of the skin.  If it is too soft, then more space should be left for the seams. </p>

    <p>  Quilting every detail along the marking lines, marking them on the front side of the fabric in advance.  For this, of course, artificial leather is better suited, since making notes on the front side, they are then easily washed off.  If you are working with another fabric and cannot make marks on the face, then do it from the inside of the fabric, then sweep, and only then sew along with synthetic winterizer. </p><p>  To make the side pockets of the jacket you will need: <br>  - 2 details of a pocket from the main fabric, lining and insulation (moreover, you need to take only half the insulation layer, i.e., the synthetic winterizer layer is carefully divided into 2 equal thicknesses manually). <br>  - 2 pieces of strips (to give volume) of the main and of the lining fabric. </p><p>  For each part, do not forget to leave space for stock - 1.5 cm. </p><p>  We quilted, and then we sew the details of the strip to the pockets of the insulation.  We do the same with the details of the strips and pockets of lining fabric.  We connect the details of the pockets from the lining and the main fabric with the front sides and sew them together.  Turn finished pockets through the slice. </p><p>  We sew ready-made pockets to our jacket, bending the edges, in order to hide the lining. </p><p>  All prepared and pre-quilted parts of our product are neatly joined and sewn together. </p><h2>  Sewing a hood </h2><p>  We cut out the details of the hood from black cloak fabric and sew them.  For the inside of the hood, we cut the same parts from another fabric and carefully sew them into the middle of the hood, then turn them out.  We attach both lower parts of our hood to the middle of the neck of the jacket. </p><p>  We cut out the details for the bottom of our jacket and hem.  We connect them with the front sides with the bottom of the jacket and sew. </p><p>  For a hanging loop, you need to cut a part from a fabric in the form of a 1x8 cm strip. Of course, you can buy a finished part, for example, in the form of a chain. </p><p>  Sew it in the middle during the connection of the details of the grinder and the rebounds. </p><p>  In order to sew a zipper in the product, we apply our zipper face to face on the left and right parts of our jackets and carefully sew them.  Before applying the zipper, step back from the bottom of the jacket 1 cm. This is done so that the finished product does not protrude from the bottom due to the fastener. </p><p>  In the same way, we carefully sew the lining details of our jacket.  Sew on the lining starting at the bottom of the jacket.  Then we sew the sleeves from the main fabric and the lining and connect it to the jacket. </p><p>  Now the jacket is ready. </p><h2>  Demi-season jackets </h2><p>  It will also be useful to learn how to sew a jacket for spring with your own hands. </p><p>  With the onset of warm days, I want to take off my heavy fur coats and jackets and put on light and spring ones.  If you are tired of your old things, you can try to make such a jacket yourself. </p><p>  To work you will need: </p><p>  - synthetic leather; </p><p>  - synthetic winterizer; </p><p>  - lining fabric; </p><p>  - a zipper fastener; </p><p>  - short zippers for pockets. </p><p>  Samples of patterns are transferred to paper.  Then carefully redraw on the fabric and cut it out. </p><p>  Parts List: </p><p>  - back - 2 children.  middle part, 2 children  sides, 1 child  cut with a bend; </p><p>  - shelves - 2 children.  sides, 2 children  middle part, 2 children  central part, 2 children  strips; </p><p>  - collar. </p>

    <p>  When you think about sewing outerwear with your own hands, the main criterion for you is the quality and style of the product.  Sew such a thing yourself ("out of the head") you will not succeed.  So you first have to stock up on patterns. If you spend your time and effort on work, you will succeed in a quality manner.  And you can proudly brag to your friends that this is exactly your job. </p>
