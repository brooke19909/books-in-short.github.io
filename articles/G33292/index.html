Located along the banks of the Guayas River, a colorful metropolis, which celebrated 475 years since its foundation in 2012, is known for historical monuments that reflected traces of past eras. </p><p>  The local municipality takes care of the improvement of the city and does everything possible to turn it into the main tourist center of the state, and in 2009 twinning relations were established with St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  The history of the modern metropolis </h2><p>  Founded by the Spaniards in the 16th century, Guayaquil (Ecuador) appeared on the site of an Indian settlement.  At first, the conquistadors peacefully agreed with the tribe and founded their colony, but later expelled from their homes, outraged by the greed of uninvited guests demanding gold and women, massacred and killed the Spaniards. </p><p>  A detachment of armed warriors dealt with the Indians, and soon on the hill of Santa Anna a new city was laid down, where the Spanish immigrants sought.  All the riches of the world flocked to the large port, where trade was in full swing, and the young settlement was often attacked by pirates.  At the beginning of the XIX century, the city declared its independence, which was a turning point in the acquisition of freedom of Ecuador.  In Guayaquil, many sculptures were erected in honor of prominent people who contributed to the eventful history. </p><p>  In the last century, the city turned into a large economic and commercial center and gained fame as the cradle of navigation.  Locals call their favorite city "the mirror of Ecuador", which is justified, because the history of the whole state was created here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and temperature </h2><p>  Tourists choose an exotic pearl as their holiday due to the comfortable climate from May to December, when it is warm and dry.  The average temperature is kept at 20 degrees, which is suitable for those who can not stand the intense heat.  But January and February are recognized as the rainiest months. </p><h2>  City of Contrasts </h2><p>  The large economic and tourist center of the smallest country in South America can rightfully be called a city of contrasts, which combines modern quarters and the remains of colonial buildings with narrow streets and wooden houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guayaquil ecuador what to bring" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1447981.jpg" width="600"></div>
