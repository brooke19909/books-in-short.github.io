  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OneClickMoney: reviews, loan terms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people have situations when they need money urgently, literally any minute, and the salary is still not long.  An even more difficult situation arises when unforeseen expenses arise in connection with a car breakdown, the need for urgent repairs in an apartment or illness of a family member. </p><p>  Not everyone is happy to borrow money from friends and acquaintances.  Moreover, not everyone has friends who could lend a large sum.  Banks do not issue loans if a person has a bad credit history.  In these cases, MFIs are very helpful, one of which is OneClickMoney.  Reviews about this method of obtaining money are rather mixed.  Let's analyze in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="metsmerizedonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money in dollars" class="if uuid-2831309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831309.jpg"></div><h2>  What is an MFI? </h2><p>  MFI is an abbreviation that stands for ‚ÄúMicrofinance Organization‚Äù.  As a rule, MFIs specialize in lending to the population for small amounts: the so-called payday loans. </p><p>  Mostly, such organizations do not require guarantors and certificates of income, and also offer relatively small amounts of debt - up to 50 thousand rubles.  You can place an application on the websites of such organizations or directly in the office.  Of the documents in any case require a passport or passport data.  The remaining information is already specified directly in a specific MFI. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  OneClickMoney is one of the leading microfinance organizations in Russia.  She has her own site - oneclickmoney.ru.  Reviews, detailed information on the loan, interest rates, public offer - all located at this address.  Thanks to this, before applying for a loan, you can get to know all the data as much as possible and make a decision. </p><p>  Most reviews of OneClickMoney are generally positive, but it is worth noting that some MFIs remove negative reviews or ask their partners to do so.  Therefore, it is advisable to focus on reviews left on verified independent resources. </p><p>  To get a loan in this organization, you need to fill out a form and wait for a decision.  Mostly it is automatically accepted after processing the data entered by the user.  On average, it takes from four to ten minutes of time.  After approval of the application, the client receives money to the card or to the account of the electronic payment system within 10-20 minutes.  In addition, it is possible to get a loan through the Unistream or Golden Crown translation system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.streetwisejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Getting a loan" class="if uuid-2831314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831314.jpg"></div><h2>  Sign up for OneClickMoney </h2><p>  Without registration, only a few functions are available: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Using a special calculator to roughly estimate the interest rate on the desired loan. </li><li>  Ask a technical support specialist questions online. </li><li>  Read the general information and rules for using the service. </li></ul><p>  To apply for a loan and enter OneClickMoney you need to register.  Registration takes place simultaneously with the process of applying for a loan. </p><p>  It is necessary to pass verification and sign a public offer agreement.  The system sends a message with a code to the borrower‚Äôs phone number, which must be entered in a special field.  The introduction of this code indicates that the user agrees to the contract, and also confirms the fact that he provided the correct personal data. </p><p>  After entering all the necessary data, you are logged into OneClickMoney, in your personal account. </p><p>  Information requested by the system for obtaining a loan: </p><ul><li>  Passport data (F. I. O., date of birth, address of registration and actual residence). </li><li>  Place of work.  If the potential borrower is a student, senior citizen or unemployed, this must be indicated. </li><li>  Amount and term of the loan. </li><li>  Passport number and series, place of issue. </li><li>  Primary mobile number. </li><li>  Other contacts are additionally asked (additional phone numbers, Skype login), but this is not necessary. </li></ul><p>  After entering the OneClickMoney account, you can verify the correctness of all entered data.  It is worth noting that no one requires sending a photocopy or scanned copy of the passport.  All that is needed is the correct passport data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.brookings.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash money" class="if uuid-2831316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831316.jpg"></div><h2>  Mobile App Features </h2><p>  The microfinance organization OneClickMoney offers its customers the opportunity to use the mobile application.  Many of them have already noted the convenience of this solution. </p><p>  You can enter OneClickMoney not only with a login, which is an email address and password, but also through authorization on the State Services website.  For many, this option is much simpler.  There is the same opportunity to enter the mobile application. </p><p>  The application works on both the Android platform and the Apple platform, so it can be used by different categories of users.  In addition, the application is quite lightweight - it takes up only 25 megabytes of device RAM. </p><p>  An undoubted advantage is that you can enter your OneClickMoney account at any time, provided that you have an Internet connection and either familiarize yourself with information on debts or make a payment. </p><p>  In addition, you can apply for a loan.  Consideration of applications received from a mobile device through the application takes an average of four minutes, while the examination of applications from a computer takes about seven minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.versusbattle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit card" class="if uuid-2831320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831320.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for obtaining a loan </h2><p>  Microcredit can only be obtained by adult citizens of Russia with a passport confirming this fact.  The conditions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  The maximum age of the borrower is 80 years. </li><li>  The minimum loan amount is 500 rubles, the maximum is 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The loan repayment period is from 6 to 21 days. </li><li>  The rate is on average from 1% to 2.2% per day.  In other words, the earlier the debt is paid off, the less interest will have to be paid. </li></ul><p>  You can receive money on a bank card, on the account of an electronic payment system, through the Unistream or Golden Crown transfer systems. </p><p>  Reviews on OneClickMoney indicate that the loan application is approved in most cases, and the money comes to the borrower almost instantly. </p><p>  When you receive a loan again, you no longer need to go through the entire registration procedure again.  It is enough to enter your personal account and apply for a loan.  The data previously filled in will remain in your personal account, and they can be edited if they change (change of address, last name, passport, and so on). </p><h2>  Debt repayment methods </h2><p>  You can return the loan and interest in one of the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Payment through a personal account on the site. </li><li>  Payment by card.  Supported are ‚ÄúMastercard‚Äù, ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù. </li><li>  Internet banking: Sberbank-Online, Alfa-Click. </li><li>  Electronic payment systems "WebMoney" and "Yandex-Money". </li><li>  Terminals and cash desks of any banks. </li></ul><p>  In order to get full information on debts, you need to log in to your OneClickMoney account, where you will find all the necessary information.  There you can fully repay the debt or take the details for payment at the bank.  They are displayed in a public offer. </p><p>  To pay through your personal account, you need to enter personal data and a bank card number.  Payment at a commercial bank takes place according to the standard procedure: either at the cash desk, or by transfer through a terminal or ATM, or through Internet banking. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the delay in OneClickMoney, it is advisable to take full responsibility to the process of paying off the debt.  Since the interest rate of MFIs is an order of magnitude higher than that of most banks, the overpayment for late payment or even unpaid payment will be much higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pengeportalen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Debit cards" class="if uuid-2831377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831377.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits of Microcredit in OneClickMoney </h2><p>  Any financial institution has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Consider the main advantages of obtaining a loan in OneClickMoney: </p><ul><li>  The process of processing and reviewing the application takes a little time. </li><li>  There is no need to personally visit the organization‚Äôs office to obtain a loan or pay off debt. </li><li>  Only a passport is needed. </li><li>  The organization provides assistance even in case of bad credit history. </li><li>  The organization works 24 hours a day, so you can get a loan at any time of the day or night. </li><li>  It is possible to apply for a loan or pay off debt through a special application on your smartphone. </li><li>  Any category of borrowers can get a loan.  The main thing is to comply with two basic requirements (to be an adult citizen of the Russian Federation not older than 80 years). </li><li>  It is possible to pay off the debt ahead of schedule without imposing additional penalties for it.  Moreover, this is encouraged by the organization itself: in case of early repayment less interest will be charged. </li><li>  It is possible to use a promotional code to receive a discount.  As a rule, a discount involves a reduced interest rate on a loan. </li><li>  The organization acts in the interests of users and fully complies with the law of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúOn the protection of personal data‚Äù.  That is why the client can be calm: his personal information will not be transferred to third parties. </li></ul><p>  To perform any operations with a long client you need to log in to your OneClickMoney account.  You can log in using your email address and password.  This process is very simple and is no different from logging in to your account on social networks or email. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan reviews" class="if uuid-2831386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831386.jpg"></div><h2>  Disadvantages of OneClickMoney </h2><p>  The disadvantages of interacting with the OneClickMoney organization include the following: </p><ul><li>  Entrance to your personal account is difficult to find on the site: the login button seems hidden to some.  In practice, this feeling is created due to the design: the site is made in black, white and orange tones, and the black login button seems invisible against a bright orange background. </li><li>  The commission is quite high compared to the commission in banks.  On average, banks offer loans at 10 - 30% per year, while 21% (and this is at least) will be charged if you issue a loan for a maximum period in OneClickMoney.  The maximum rate can reach 40% in 21 days. </li><li>  The consultants on the site do not always respond promptly.  That is why customers often have to call in case of questions. </li><li>  It‚Äôs not immediately clear what kind of insurance is on the main page. </li></ul><h2>  Risks and Pitfalls </h2><p>  In fact, any options for loans and borrowings carry enormous risks: many people gradually get used to living on credit and do not notice that they are starting to give more than they get. </p><p>  In addition, obtaining loans in microfinance institutions is easier and faster, but at the same time the interest rate is much higher.  For comparison: you can find banks with an interest rate of 10% per year, while for a loan in an MFI for 20 days you will have to pay more than 15 - 20%. </p><p>  Some unscrupulous citizens find it easier to trick MFIs than a bank.  In fact, the debt in any case will have to be paid.  Judging by the feedback of OneClickMoney debtors, it is impossible to bypass the payment of debt: the organization has all the passport data of the client that makes it easy to find.  Therefore, it is better not to take risks and include common sense.  Moreover, if for some reason it is not possible to repay the debt on time, it is better to contact OneClickMoney employees and discuss the possibility and methods of solving the problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theodysseyonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank cards" class="if uuid-2831383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78264/2831383.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, reviews about OneClickMoney are quite controversial.  To see the fullness of the opinions of customers, you need to turn to independent sites, which we did. </p><ul><li>  Most of OneClickMoney‚Äôs advantages note the obvious: the speed of making a decision on granting a loan, a large selection of options for paying off debt, a convenient interface of a site and a mobile application, and also the fact of having a mobile application.  The latter is very helpful for busy people who have the opportunity in their spare time to pay off loan debt or get a loan.  The main thing is to have access to the Internet from a mobile device.  It is worth noting that the application is supported on smartphones and tablets. </li><li>  Another plus, which was especially appreciated by users is the presence of an online calculator on the OneClickMoney website and the fact that it can be used before registration.  Thanks to this calculator, you can accurately determine the size of the interest rate that will need to be paid to the loan amount. </li><li>  No less appreciated by users and the ability to get money on credit at any time of the day.  Some clients shared their stories when they needed money urgently at night, but someone did not have the opportunity to borrow.  In this case, a loan to the MFI was very helpful. </li></ul><p>  Along with the advantages highlighted some of the shortcomings. </p><ul><li>  Most users were unsatisfied with the high interest rate.  However, in reality, approximately such an interest rate is charged when applying for a loan in any microfinance organization.  The bank rate is lower, but the process of obtaining a loan is more complicated and takes more time.  Moreover, rarely are any banks willing to transfer money to an electronic payment system account and, especially, through payment systems. </li><li>  Some did not understand what insurance the system offers in addition to a loan.  Therefore, in the process of filling out an application, I had to either look for information on insurance, or simply refuse it in order to save time.  In general, insurance allows you to increase the organization‚Äôs confidence in the client, so the attitude will be more loyal. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Making loans in OneClickMoney helps a huge number of people in difficult financial situations. </p><p>  It is important to remember that the conditions of MFIs differ significantly from those of commercial banks.  First of all, this difference is related to the size of the interest rate: in MFIs it is much higher than that of banks.  However, this unpleasant difference is smoothed out by the speed of receiving money.  If in many banks a decision can be made within a few days, at the same time calling the applicant to the office and demanding additional documents, guarantors and income certificates from him, then in a microfinance organization a decision is made in a few minutes.  In addition, money can be received in a bank or electronic account without leaving home. </p>
