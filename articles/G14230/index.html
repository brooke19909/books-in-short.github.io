  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call 2013: Digital Voice Recorder Against “Presumption of Guilty”</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need to repay a debt to the homeland, to serve, to acquire military skills in Russia traditionally comes into conflict with the unwillingness to break oneself under the merciless stupidity of the army system and to be humiliated.  Now that the expression "human rights" in our country is no longer an empty phrase, there are less and less people who want to clean the snow with a dustpan, receive cracks from the "grandfathers", and daily defend their right to be called human. </p><p>  Some changes in the situation were made by a decrease in the service life.  Thanks to this decision, the number of draft dodgers began to decrease, albeit slowly.  However, this does not solve the main problem, and does not remove urgent questions - why do not children of officials, businessmen and deputies a priori need to serve in the army?  How did the law go that young people who went abroad (read — sent to study in Europe) are exempted from military service?  Why are military enlistment offices ignoring “non-conscripted” diseases and the rights of conscripts to appeal the decision of the draft commission? </p><p>  When rights are ignored, you have to protect them yourself.  You need to know that all draft measures should not be held outside the deadlines set for spring and autumn draft.  The search for conscripts, their forced transfer to the military registration and enlistment office can be challenged in court.  When undergoing a medical examination, it is necessary to make the results of the studies in duplicate, so that if necessary it was possible to prove the fact of ignoring the "non-conscript" diseases. </p><p>  In some cases, it will be useful to use a digital voice recorder to communicate with employees of the military enlistment offices.  The fact is that there are frequent cases when the persons responsible for the draft approach the task assigned to them with unhealthy zeal.  They threaten conscripts or offer them deals, promising to send them to “warm” places, arrange “ambushes”, “catch live bait” and other illegal methods of catching draft evaders. </p><p>  Another category of military enlistment office workers is those who are more concerned about their own interests to the detriment of state interests and extort bribes, offering to solve the amicable issue with the army.  For this reason, digital voice recorders can equalize the chances of a draftee fighting for their rights.  Unfortunately, at the most crucial moment - during the passage of the medical commission, you can not take the recorder with you, even if it is as tiny as <noindex>  <span>digital voice recorder e-dic</span> </noindex>  .  The fact is that at this moment the conscript walks around the military registration and enlistment office in only his underwear - what kind of dictaphone is there? </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that, passing a medical examination, a conscript is obliged to appear in negligence before a wide variety of military enlistment office personnel, including those who have nothing to do with a medical examination.  While not yet a military man, a conscript must in all his underpants stand upright in front of people in uniform, report on his arrival — in other words, do what he has every right not to do.  At this moment, the draft committee will examine him from head to toe, as an incredulous peasant examines a horse in the market. </p><p>  Serving your homeland is the duty of every young person who is healthy.  However, the fulfillment of this duty should not be a humiliation, and should not be in peacetime associated with a risk to health and life. </p></div></article>
