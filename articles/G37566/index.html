It turns out a pipe, which, after sewing, is turned on the front side.  The seam is centered and ironed carefully with a steamer.  Then the workpiece is bent in half, and the edges are sewn together at the back.  The central jumper is sewn in the same way and before stitching the ends on the back, the main part is inserted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="butterfly with tails" class="if uuid-2547853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2547853.jpg"></div><p>  To make long tails, rectangular strips are folded in half, bending the edges of the fabric inward.
