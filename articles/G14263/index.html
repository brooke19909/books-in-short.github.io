    <h2>  A lamb from pompons is a great idea for needlewomen! </h2><p>  A lamb from pompons is another reason for needlewomen to enjoy making interesting gizmos, which can please themselves and their loved ones.  Moreover, not only adults can do this craft.  A little daughter or son, most likely, will gladly join the creation of such a toy as a lamb from pompons.  With their own hands, kids love to make crafts with which they can then "mess around", and no one will have such a toy.  However, it is worth noting that the help of an adult will be necessary here, since the manufacture of crafts is not as simple as it might seem at first glance. </p><p>  Needleworkers who knit are likely to know how to make pompons.  Because, thanks to them, any knitted product, be it a sweater, hat or leggings, you can give a more original appearance.  Pompons for making sheep are made in the usual way, however, and there are a number of features that should be paid attention to everyone who does not know how to make a sheep from pompons and is going to do it for the first time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation of materials </h2><p>  Making sheep, like many other activities, should begin with the preparation of materials.  So, you need a skein of woolen threads.  Each needlewoman can choose their color in accordance with her wishes, however, the most realistic looking animal made of white or beige yarn.  In addition to threads, you will need cardboard, a pencil and scissors to create patterns, a small piece of black yarn and small dark buttons (to form the muzzle of a sheep), a hook or a needle, and also glue to connect all parts of the toy.  It is worth noting that felt is another excellent material from which the muzzle of such a toy as a lamb from pompons can be made.  With your own hands it is quite easy to cut this part.  Therefore, those who choose just such an option for making the head of an animal need to stock up with felt, preferably black or brown.  Legs can also be made from this material.  But first things first! </p>

    <h2>  Template making </h2><p>  After preparing the materials, it is necessary to create templates from cardboard.  Their size should depend on how large the toy should be as a result.  The template for the body should be in the form of an oval.  Inside, it is necessary to cut a hole so that the distance from the extreme line to the center line is 2-3 cm. There should be two such parts - during operation they will fold together, so it is very important that their contours completely coincide.  To make the head, you will need the same two ovals, but their size should be smaller than those intended for the manufacture of the body.  If it is planned that a sheep from pompons will have a head made of felt, then you will also need a template for this - you need to draw a muzzle with ears on cardboard, then cut and use it for convenience of further work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Lamb torso </h2><p>  So, the templates for the body are ready, you can go directly to its manufacture.  To do this, put two large ovals on top of each other and, passing the woolen thread through the hole of both, fix it with a knot.  Next, the yarn must be wound in a similar manner over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe template until the hole inside is completely closed.  When it becomes difficult to push the thread through the hole, for convenience, you can use a needle or hook.  Then the lamb from pompons, made with your own hands, will be made faster. </p><p>  When the hole completely disappears, you need to fix the thread, and cut off the end.  Next, with the help of scissors, it is necessary to cut the threads along the edge, trying to get the scissors between two cardboard templates.  After the yarn is cut along the entire contour, you need to fold the thread two to three times, achieving maximum strength, wrap it between the patterns and tie it tightly to two or three knots, tightening it well beforehand.  Now the cardboard can be removed, and the resulting pompom slightly trimmed with scissors. </p>

    <h2>  Lamb head </h2><p>  The torso is ready, but it is not enough to make a toy - a sheep from pompons.  Do it yourself will also have to make the head of the animal.  This part of the body is made similar to the body, however, using smaller templates.  When the pompom, used as a head, is ready, it is necessary to "draw" on it the face of the animal.  To do this, use additional elements. </p><p>  You need to take a black thread, 20-30 cm long, and in its center tie another of a similar length.  After placing this triple thread on a smaller pompom and fastening it with white yarn, you can see the nose and mouth on the muzzle.  Eyes should be made with the help of small buttons or beads, fixing them with glue in appropriate places.  After that, it will already be possible to evaluate how cute the handmade sheep from pompons will turn out to be do-it-yourself.  Photo toys can also be done, but not at this stage.  If the head is made of felt, then it must also be cut out with the help of a prepared template, drawing on the product all the elements of the muzzle of a sheep. </p>

    <h2>  Making legs, ears and tail </h2><p>  Head and torso - this is not all the details necessary to make a sheep from pompons.  With your own hands, you also need to make legs, ears and tail.  To make the legs, you need to take a piece of cardboard, the height of which will correspond to their expected height.  Next, around cardboard, you need to make 16-18 turns of white yarn, then pull it out, and fix the thread across the turns and continue to wind already across.  To prevent the legs from bending, insert a toothpick inside. </p><p>  The ears are also made by winding the thread on a rectangular cardboard, however, they need to be fixed across the thread only in the upper part.  To get a tail, the thread is similarly wound on cardboard, however, it is already fixed in the middle. </p><h2>  Connection of all parts </h2><p>  That's all the parts of the toy are ready, and you already almost know how to make a sheep from pompons, because you just have to put all the previously made parts together.  First you need to tie the body and head together.  Next, using hot glue, attach the legs and tail to the body, and the ears to the head.  If the head of felt will be used, then it just needs to be glued to the body-pompom, then the ears are no longer needed. </p>
