    <p>  We all remember very well that the manufacturer ‚ÄúLenovo‚Äù bought out the company ‚ÄúMotorola Mobility‚Äù, after which it solemnly made a promise in which he mentioned his plans to divide the smartphone market.  More specifically, the Chinese company decided, if I may call it that, to crush several segments for itself in order to ensure sustainable domination over other companies.  At the same time, as expected, Lenovo announced strong ambitions: she wanted to take no less than the third place in sales at least.  The Chinese company did not even intend to reckon with <span>comforting prizes</span> instead of (minimum!) Bronze.  Such a de facto option was not even considered. </p><p>  Despite such seemingly prohibitively ambitious speeches, the company has every chance to bring its desire to life.  Currently, there are official data that can tell us that Lenovo closes the top five in the smartphone market.  Do not you think that this is really a result that is worth our attention?  Nevertheless, we will evaluate the success of the manufacturer soberly.  Of course, the bulk of the devices sold diverges precisely in China.  On the territory of the Russian Federation, devices classified as A-series are more popular.  A shift in the situation was outlined when a series of flagships called Vibe appeared on the horizon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Analysis of models </h2>

    <p>  Not only the <span>Lenovo K920</span> Vibe Z2 is rich in its corresponding product line.  One of the devices that are part of the line is Vibe X. This is a fairly stylish flagship solution.  Currently, its cost is about ten thousand rubles.  Perhaps the device can rightfully be called the best in the segment.  It supports displaying pictures in Full HD quality.  However, Vibe X is not the only solution. </p><p>  Next, right on the heels, is the Vibe X2.  It is already clear from the name that it is nothing but a follower of the previous model.  The starting price of the device fell in the range from fifteen to seventeen thousand rubles.  But even despite such a cost, the device remains very relevant and popular not only among our compatriots, but also in the international arena. </p><p>  And <span>Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, the</span> price of which at the very beginning of sales amounted to 23 thousand rubles, is in permanent shortage.  The smartphone is being released in some tricky way, and at the same time it is sometimes not enough for full sales in the warehouses of mobile phone stores.  As the Chinese manufacturer will deal with this problem, we should not worry.  Therefore, we just note that the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, the price of which has now flown up to 27 thousand rubles, continues to be the most affordable tablet among its competitors with a screen with <span>HD resolution.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Already released a stripped down version of the flagship.  Many people call it Lenovo Vibe Z2 Mini, however, the last word from the name is best removed, because this is the position of official sources and representatives of the Chinese company.  There are probably practical reasons for this.  In fact, answer just one question: can a phone equipped with a 5.5-inch screen be called Mini?  It will look illogical at least.  Nevertheless, this word still occurs in the index of the device.  That is, it is called like this: K920 Mini.  But it‚Äôs much easier to expose the device simply called Vibe Z2, which we see. </p><p>  The Lenovo Vibe Z2 Titanium smartphone got its name due to the use of exclusively metallic materials in the design.  Before us is a device that has a thickness equal to only 7.8 mm, is equipped with a sufficiently powerful and high-quality camera (built-in optical stabilization function).  The rest should be noted the support of two SIM cards, the presence and operation of a 64-bit processor family Qualcomm, a powerful battery with a capacity of 3,000 mAh.  The cost of the device is 20 thousand rubles.  But the price is justified, as prices for all mobile devices are currently rising.  Meanwhile, we move on to a more detailed analysis. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  The subject of our review is equipped with a large number of different modules, and now we will talk about them in more detail.  So, the phone works in the GSM, UMTS, and LTE bands.  The latter actually means open access to fourth-generation cellular networks.  Well, in principle, for the device of the corresponding price segment, this is more likely a rule than an exception.  4G networks will allow the phone owner to exchange data and Internet traffic at an increased speed.  Now you can faster download and upload pictures, music, videos and movies.  Do not forget that the interaction with the browser and web pages in it will also be faster. </p><h2>  International network </h2>

    <p>  Speaking of the Internet.  Access to it is provided due to 3G and 4G standards.  Options with GPRS as well as EDGE are possible.  But it is preferable, of course, the first two.  A built-in modem is provided.  If necessary, you can create a Wi-Fi access point.  Other users with wireless modules in their devices will be able to connect to it.  It can be smartphones on different operating systems, tablet computers and laptops.  It will also be possible to connect to the access point from a computer, but only if a network card with a Wi-Fi module is installed there. </p><p>  Bluetooth technology allows you to share files with other devices.  Here its module is equipped with version 4.0.  Wi-Fi works in the b, g, and n bands.  If you actively use e-mail to exchange messages with other users, then you probably use the built-in E-mail client.  It will be possible to synchronize the smartphone with a computer or laptop using the MicroUSB - USB 2.0 wire. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The hardware is represented by a Qualcomm processor family.  This is a <span>Snapdragon 410</span> model <span>,</span> under the name MSM8916.  The core consists of four cores, which meanwhile ensure the smooth operation of the operating system.  Their maximum clock frequency is about 1.2 gigahertz. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The amount of RAM is 2 gigabytes.  Let's not forget that part of it is taken away by the jealous and greedy operating system of the Android family.  32 gigabytes of long-term memory are available for storing user data.  In principle, this is not so little.  The volume can be filled with any files, be it e-books, games or applications, cache programs, music, videos or movies.  It doesn't matter, actually. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  What can the owners of this model tell about its pros and cons?  According to customer reviews of the device, it has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  good main camera with optical stabilization function; </li><li>  Excellent front camera with a resolution of 8 megapixels; </li><li>  exclusively metal thin case; </li><li>  work with two SIM cards; </li><li>  a large amount of long-term memory; </li><li>  powerful battery. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, the owners of the device talk about the presence of some small and large flaws.  For example, many users noted that a resolution with such a diagonal could have been made even larger.  The rest of the phone owners highlight the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  lack of a slot for an external microSD drive; </li><li>  protruding lens of the main camera. </li></ul>
