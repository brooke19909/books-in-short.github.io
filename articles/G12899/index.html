The natural beauty of the area is difficult to exaggerate.  This paradise, fertile place pleases with orange and olive groves, which dizzy with the aroma of spring and happiness, and huge vineyards, where raw materials for fine Greek wines grow. </p><p>  In 2007, the island was given the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3 Greece Corfu" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2002456.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Picturesque, atmospheric Kerkyra </h2><p>  <em>Kerkyra</em> is the capital of the island of the same name.  Corfu itself over a long history has been attacked and conquered several times by different civilizations.  For a rather long historical period, Corfu was ruled by Italy, which undoubtedly left an impressive imprint on the cultural and architectural features of the region. </p><p>  Kerkyra is more like a magnificent medieval city than the modern capital.  Impressive cultural diversity makes it a suitable place not only for a relaxing, abstract holiday, but also for an informative, cultural pastime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3 Corfu" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2002455.jpg" width="600"></div>

You rarely see animators, rows of buffets or crowds of guides with offers of excursions. </p><h2>  Hotel Kerkyra Village Studios 3 * in Greece, Corfu </h2><p>  This is an apartment type hotel.  This is the way the hotel business is spread and popular in Corfu.  The hotel consists of 18 family apartments. </p><p>  The villas are located in a picturesque garden, which is a great place for relaxing walks.  There are also green spaces and relaxation areas with sea views on the roof of the hotel. </p><p>  Kerkyra Village Studios 3 * - a budget hotel, one of the cheapest among those that offer domestic tour operators.  A double room with breakfast per day costs <em>29 euros</em> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2002551.jpg" width="600"></div>

Credit cards are accepted at the reception, and there are ATMs within 100 meters of the hotel where cash can be withdrawn. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The hotel is 200 meters from the picturesque village of Benitses, 12 km from the capital of Kerkyra and 13 km from <span>Corfu</span> International <span>Airport.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Benitses a dozen years ago was a modest fishing village, picturesque and peaceful, but with the development of tourism in Corfu, various objects of tourist infrastructure appeared in large numbers in Benitses.  The silence and harmony of such a place, as well as the proximity to the capital, further stimulate the growth of popularity of this small resort.  It is very likely that soon this territory will cease to be a peaceful vacation haven for travelers tired of urban life, and will turn into a bustling coastal town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2002554.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At 130 meters from Kerkyra Village Studios 3 * is the city beach.  He was awarded the European Union <em>Blue Flag</em> for cleanliness and safety. </p><p>  Group bus excursions to Corfu are just as unpopular as hotel animations.  Tourists prefer to set off on their own to discover and explore the island.  A popular way of traveling over short distances is cycling.  Two-wheeled vehicles can be rented at numerous offices located throughout the island.  The issue price is about 3 euros per day. </p><p>  Corfu is a hilly island, so it is not advisable to go for a bike ride on the mountains, it is better to take a car.  There are also a lot of rental offices on the island, the average price for a Skoda or Ford car is 45 euros per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3 Corfu" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2002452.jpg" width="586"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The Kerkyra Village Studios 3 * hotel in Corfu is breakfast-based.  Breakfast at the hotel is a continental buffet.  It starts at 07:00 and lasts until 09:30.  Includes snacks, toast, pastries, fruits, drinks. </p><p>  Most experienced travelers say that relaxing in Corfu and eating at the hotel‚Äôs buffet tables, only toasts, jams, etc. are blasphemy of food.  Kerkyra is the most diverse gastronomic region in the entire Mediterranean.  Tourists are advised to drop in lunches at local taverns held by indigenous people or Italians.  Only a person who is completely devoid of taste and smell can not pay tribute to the divine spicy local cuisine.  The highest quality olive oil, fresh cheeses, vegetables, sweet ripe fruits and fresh seafood form the basis of local cuisine.  Delicious lunches are complemented by local young wines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2002450.jpg" width="600"></div>

The beach is luxurious, well-maintained, the water is clean, the shore is wide and flat.  Not for nothing, this beach is awarded the Blue Flag.  Given that the beach is public, sometimes in the high season, especially on weekends, it is crowded. </p><p>  Umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach are paid, or rather, conditionally paid.  Those who do not want to pay for a lounger can be advised to buy a cocktail or ice cream at the beach bar, then sun loungers near this establishment will be free for the client all day. </p><p>  The beach is pebble, the entrance to the sea is also small pebbles, the water is clear and clean even at an impressive depth. </p><h2>  Reviews about Kerkyra Village Studios 3 * </h2><p>  The hotel has a rating rating of ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù on Russian-language resources and ‚Äúabove average‚Äù on English-speaking.  Does this indicate that our compatriots are accustomed to a different kind of vacation?  Maybe yes. </p><p>  But if objectively, then almost all the guests agree that the breakfast at the hotel is not very good.  The food is of poor quality, mainly served with pastries, cookies, purchased snacks and instant coffee.  Also, some tourists spoke unflattering about the service at the hotel, the workers at the reception are inconsistent, and if they are at the workplace, they react sluggishly and disdainfully to the requests of the guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Village Studios 3 Reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2002457.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of the positive, most guests confirmed that the village of Benitses and the hotel grounds are very beautiful, the maids are conscientious, they clean well.  The internet works pretty well, and it's really free.  The beach and the very atmosphere of relaxation in Kerkyra are also described by tourists in a very positive way. </p>
