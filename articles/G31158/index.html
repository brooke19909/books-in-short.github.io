Features of the water basin of the Oka River</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The river in Murom fascinates with its beauty and picturesqueness.  This is an ideal place where you can relax with the whole family or with friends, as well as successfully go fishing.  <span>The source of the Oka</span> is located in one of the regions of Russia - Oryol.  In the Kaluga region, its course is quite fast, the banks are very steep, and the width of the river is too small.  Further downstream, due to the eastward turn, the valley of the water stream begins to expand rapidly.  Already near the Moscow border, you can see that the Oka is 200 meters wide and 2 meters deep. It is the <span>mouth of the Moskva River,</span> which flows into it near Kolomna. </p><h2>  City Murom </h2>

    <p>  The main city in the Murom district is Murom.  The map of Russia clearly shows that this administrative center is located on one of the banks of the Oka River.  It is one of the oldest settlements in the country.  For centuries, about Mur, various fables, legends and myths developed.  To say why the city is called that way is almost impossible, because the etymology of the name is still unknown.  Presumably, this was the name of the tribe that lived in this territory several centuries ago. </p><p>  At the moment, few passenger ships enter the Murom River.  The Oka River most often serves for the transport of various types of cargo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the course </h2><p>  Water flow begins in the village of Aleksandrovka.  Here, its valley is small in width.  The Oka flows first to the north, connecting with Orlik, then with Upa.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãconfluence with the Ugra, the current sharply turns eastward.  And after some distance, it turns north again.  Near the village of Protvino, the current makes a bias to the east. </p><p>  Going beyond the city of Murom, the Oka River, flowing through Serpukhovo and Stupino, is the border between two regions: Tula and Moscow.  Merging in Kolomna with the <span>Moskva River, it</span> flows south. </p><p>  Changing the direction of the flow several times, conditionally dividing several regions, the Oka finally flows into the Volga near Nizhny Novgorod. </p>

    <h2>  Water flow characteristic </h2><p>  The length of the Oka River is 1400 km, the basin area is 254 thousand km <sup>2</sup> .  It is located in the European part of the Russian Federation.  It has several sleeves and old women.  The latter in the spring often either completely dry out or fill with water and overgrow.  In some places, the river in Murom serves as the visual boundary of forests and steppes. </p><p>  Oka icing occurs in December, autopsy - in April-March.  During spring floods (lasting 40 days), the water level increases several times, reaching 12 m. The high water on the river lasts no more than two months.  During this time, the Oka manages to spread in the floodplain for hundreds of meters.  Due to the climate in summer, the water level becomes low, sometimes even very critical, but after heavy rains it returns to normal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Oka, which is not the last in its length, can be proud of its settlements, especially the city of Murom.  The river is fed by groundwater, rainwater and snow. </p>

    <h2>  Animal and plant world </h2><p>  The mouth of the Murom watercourse is the Volga, so the representatives of the flora and fauna of these rivers are practically no different.  Any fisherman can say that the most common species here are pike perch, bream, perch, roach and others.  Sometimes you can meet a sterlet, a chekhon.  Due to <span>wastewater</span> that regularly <span>flows</span> into the river, the number of fish is reduced. </p><p>  The river in Murom, or rather its floodplain, is very rich in swamps, ramparts.  On its shores, vegetation species such as sedge, willow, and pike grow.  Here are often found popnik, cornflower and tulip.  The banks of the Oka River in some places are covered with forests and pine forests.  In order to preserve all these picturesque places and rare vegetation, a reserve was created.  It is inhabited by foxes, bisons, moose.  Of the most striking representatives of birds, kites, hazel grouse, and capercaillie are found. </p>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Which river in Murom is an important waterway?  Oka!  However, its environmental status has recently been experiencing serious problems.  In some areas, the Oka water is intended for technical use only.  For example, in Spassk-Ryazan district, hydrologists, having carried out special work, found that this site is as polluted as possible, and the ecosystem has completely degraded.  The main source of pollution is the mouth of the watercourse, where most of the various garbage and chemicals come from. </p>

    <h2>  Volga - the mouth of the Oka </h2><p>  One of the largest rivers on planet Earth is the Volga.  It covers 4 republics and 11 regions.  There is a river in the basin of the <span>Caspian Sea.</span>  Its name comes from the Slavic words ‚Äúmoisture‚Äù or ‚Äúvolog‚Äù.  It eats thanks to the melting of snow, ice, as well as <span>groundwater.</span>  High water occurs in the spring-summer season, often in April-June.  In winter and summer, the river is characterized by low water, in the fall - small floods due to rains.  The water level is constantly fluctuating.  In different areas of the river, the depth varies significantly.  After the construction of dams and the formation of several reservoirs, the runoff of the watercourse was fully regulated. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãmurom river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/773838.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The river in Murom is very rich in many types of fish, in particular for zander, pike, bream, ide, asp, etc. Due to its large <span>tributaries, the Oka</span> is considered a full-flowing stream.  In the nearby area there are reserves and bases, holiday homes and sanatoriums.  The river valley charms with its forests, pine forests and birch forests.  The waters are quite turbulent, in some parts of the watercourse the flow velocity reaches 0.5 m / s.  Small waves wash away everything that they find on their way: blocks of clay, shrubs on the banks, terraces, boulders, stones. </p>
