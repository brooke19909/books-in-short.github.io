  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pitsunda, the private sector: what, how much and why?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, in the sunny and hospitable Abkhazia just south of Gagra, there is a wonderful resort town of Pitsunda.  Literally at every step, world history was happening here, there is something to see, the main thing is to find a good caring guide. </p><h2>  We plan a vacation </h2><p>  When choosing a vacation in Pitsunda for the first time, you should definitely ask about the reviews of experienced holidaymakers.  First we find out that there is something curious and unique in order to later boast of acquaintances. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.16314269999999" data-lng="40.34059449999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/7/8/1078.png"></div><p>  After a week of warming up, literally frying the body under the gentle sunshine, after enjoying the salty waves of the welcoming Black Sea, I also want intellectual diversity.  After all, it is planned not just a beach holiday in Pitsunda.  Well, cafes and restaurants are more likely to help join the local cuisine, which from any will make a glutton. </p><p>  Walking along the coast, a little further from the cape you can see a five-meter sculpture "Medea".  Yes, she is where she should be - in Colchis.  It was here, in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPitsunda or ancient Colchis, that the famous Golden Fleece epic took place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain-sculpture &quot;Divers for pearls&quot;" class="if uuid-2288802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2288802.jpg"></div><p>  There, going around the cape along the coastline, you can see the sculpture-fountain "Divers for pearls", the old lighthouse, "Medea", which was mentioned just above.  And all this time, enjoy the smell of magnificent relict <span>pines of the Pitsunda</span> Reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels or the private sector? </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs no need to starve for information.  It is worth looking for a haven for the whole rest time - where to live. </p><p>  Before deciding what to give preference to, you need to study reviews about the private sector of Pitsunda or hotel complexes and boarding houses.  The good pensions and hotels - there, it would seem, you live on everything ready.  He slept, washed, went to the beach, ate in a cafe, walked and slept.  But not everyone is happy with vacationers.  For some unknown reason, the linen in the rooms does not always change, there is no daily cleaning, and other complaints about the service.  Here you need to carefully look for reviews of former guests and understand that the price does not always correspond to the declared quality of services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medea Colchis" class="if uuid-2288821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2288821.jpg"></div><p>  What is a good rest "savage" in the private sector of Pitsunda?  Well, you make the choice according to the interior - which one you like best, there are surely reviews and recommendations, well, a huge plus is that you live according to your schedule, and cleanliness and service are exactly at the level you are used to.  That is, you live at home.  In terms of service, this is perhaps the most convenient. </p><h2>  How to find? </h2><p>  The next, often paramount factor in choosing a vacation home is the price of accommodation.  There is an unequivocal advantage in the direction of the private sector of Pitsunda.  Therefore, we study reviews in the internet, visit various forums, ask friends, we are looking for relatives in those parts - who is what. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Any commodity-money relations are best documented.  Or you need a worthy and loyal mediator.  In order not to get hooked by scammers and not spoil your vacation with an unexpected surprise, it is worth using specialized sites for finding housing.  And there are promotions that are very successful for buyers of services. </p><p>  Since in Abkhazia there is no language barrier for visitors from Russia, it‚Äôs easy to agree on the conditions provided. </p><h2>  Pricing </h2><p>  Private sector prices in Pitsunda fluctuate depending not only on the month, but also on the time of year.  The fact is that there are many who want to come here in the autumn-winter period.  Well, here the prices are quite affordable.  But for the coming summer, it is worth asking in advance. </p><p>  There are budget options - for students.  These are rooms from 600 rubles per day, then you can find the economic options of small apartments - up to 1000 rubles per day.  But this is only the beginning of the season.  Further, all figures increase by an average of 300 rubles.  Therefore, it is better to book in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abhaz-otdih.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartment in the private sector Pitsunda" class="if uuid-2288833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2288833.jpg"></div><p>  This resort price level remains until September, as the school year begins, and most come to rest with their children.  Thus, prices are again falling to the May-June level. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  There are still nuances in choosing a vacation in the private sector of Pitsunda.  Houses can be located both within walking distance of the sea on the shores of Pitsunda Bay, and in the depths - in the city.  The closer the sea, the higher prices - from 1000 rubles per day.  But you can definitely count on the fact that a relaxed neighbor will not interfere with relaxation. </p><p>  Well, the apartments in the city, a little further from the beaches, also have their own advantages - you can take a walk in a relict pine grove along the road, recharge with healthy air in the shade of beautiful ancient trees.  This will allow the beach to come rested and alert, and then hold out in the hot Black Sea sun until dinner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jettravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant &quot;Abkhazian Yard&quot; in Pitsunda" class="if uuid-2288836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2288836.jpg"></div><p>  Again, if you go and see the sights or wave to the neighboring cities, in Sochi, for example, it is more convenient to rent an apartment, apartments in the private sector of Pitsunda in the high part of the city.  Hence the ruins of the Great Pitunt - an ancient fortress - within walking distance. </p><h2>  Choose a private sector </h2><p>  Since for the residents of Pitsunda vacationers coming in the summer are the only help in replenishing the family budget, then the choice will be for tourists, respectively, a large and high-quality one. </p><p>  And if you come out of season (May, September, October), then there is a good chance to relax on a budget with a maximum of amenities in the private sector.  In order not to lose even the slightest profit, the owners of apartments and rooms will be glad even of minimal revenue. </p>
