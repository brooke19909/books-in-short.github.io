The author is alive. ”  In the case of ancient Slavic myths and concepts even more interesting.  We can say that this is a Slavic myth of the V century.  The author is alive and will delight us with myths of the 5th century and even earlier times.  That is, a huge amount of literature on Slavic myths is the production of the late XX century. </p><h2>  History of the Veles Book </h2><p>  And in terms of terminology, you should understand what can be considered ancient Slavic names, what they mean and what was created in the 20th century, but is attributed to antiquity.  What is the hoax here? </p><p>  In the mid-fifties newspaper articles in America regularly began to appear articles saying that they were about to open an ancient Slavic monument.  The audience has already been prepared, and the “discovery” is being made: the text that is recorded on the tablets, the so-called “Veles book”.  True, it should be noted that no one has ever seen these tablets.  They set forth the ancient history of the Slavs, which successfully thundered across the ocean.  A professional philologist can immediately see that this is a fake.  A person who reads fluently in Old Slavic easily understands this text.  And it is supposedly written in the VIII century.  That is a living ancient spoken language.  It must be very specific material.  For example, the Novgorod letters of the 12th century are a living language, which was very different from the Church Slavonic language, which is taught in any philological university.  His philologists read easily.  The language of Novgorodian letters, of a later time in comparison with the Veles Book, a philologist cannot read without special education, even with a dictionary.  That is, since the Veles Book is easy to read, it is a fake, like the fabrications created in it: nav, reality, right. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New and old concepts </h2><p>  This conflict between scholars and publicists has taken on acute forms.  Russian philologists were forced to make a complete analysis of the Veles Book, which proved that it was a fake, which was written by Yury Petrovich Mirolyubov today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bring it right" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/997668.jpg" width="200"></div>  The Veles book enriched the neo-pagan culture with a trinity of concepts: nav, reality, right.  This is a gross mistake, according to professionals in the field of ancient Slavic mythology.  Mirolyubov makes such a contrast:

    <p>  - Reality - a kind of human world. </p><p>  - The rule is apparently a divine world.  It must be clarified that the word "rule" in ancient texts was encountered only as an adverb. </p><p>  - Nav is really an ancient term associated with the world of the dead dead. </p><p>  The rejection by official science of everything connected with mythology led to the creation of a huge number of pseudoscientific works.  Both scientific and unscientific, they went into action.  But the whole series of “nav”, “reality”, “right” <strong>is</strong> that very ancient wisdom invented already in the middle of the 20th century. </p><h2>  What is being proposed to accept under these terms </h2><p>  All three concepts are inextricably linked, being the face of God.  And they all rule the world of the living and the dead, these Nav, reality, right. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The reality, as already mentioned, is the material world, bright, by analogy with the yang in China. </p><p>  Nav, as the ancestors believed, the world beyond the grave.  According to the latest trends, it is opposed to reality, which was not in archaic cults. </p><p>  Rule is the law established by Dazhbog and by which the first two concepts are developed.  This fair law maintains the harmony of light and dark.  Beautiful, of course, but only all these are fairy tales invented in our time.  And there is no nav, reality, right in such a combination. </p><h2>  Why "glory" appeared </h2><p>  In addition, “glory” was introduced in support of the Law of God.  To prove that the Slavs had Orthodoxy almost before the Nativity of Christ, a cunning “right-glory” (Orthodoxy) was compiled.  Again a beautiful play on words to confirm fiction.  Reveal, nav, rule, glory in such a combination have never appeared among the Slavs.  There were only pagan beliefs inherent in all peoples in their archaic development, no more.  This is proved by the great archaeological work of Academician B.A.  Rybakova.  And he who tries to manipulate the combinations of reality, nav, right, glory, or he himself is mistaken, or consciously wants to mislead the masses of people. </p><h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  Initially, the fake work “Veles Book” Yu.P.  Mirolyubova overgrown with fantastic comments, presumably in order to say: yes, all peoples have preserved written sources with which historians work.  Why do we have nothing.  And so I want!  In addition, numerous magicians, sorcerers and sorcerers, who immensely bred in our troubled times, seized on her.  We have too little sustainable and reliable in life, and therefore a person is ready to cling to a straw.  Three concepts of "hereditary" magicians are manipulated to show the three sides of being.  Slavic rule, reality, nav <strong> </strong>  represent in this way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reveal glory" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/997670.jpg" width="230"></div>  And use to raise vitality.  The same symbol is made in a tree. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic rule" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/997671.jpg" width="281"></div>  It is also intended to expand creativity and creation.  This is how the symbol "rule, reality, nav" in the modern image. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="symbol rule come true" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/997672.jpg" width="320"></div>  Images can be any, because real samples do not exist.  Archaeologists have not found them.

    <p>  Different sorcerers and sorcerers differently, but closely interpret the dependence of the worlds on each other.  There was also such an option: if you behave well in this world, then endless rebirths will stop.  There is already very close to the <span>wheel of samsara</span> and the caste system. </p>
