    <h2>  Why even install an Android tablet instead of a car radio? </h2><p>  It's simple: the tablet has a larger set of functions compared to the built-in radio.  And in general, the head unit even in fairly expensive cars - these are commonplace radios and MP3 file players, which are set just for show.  The tablet allows you to make a mobile and full-fledged media center out of a car.  In addition, even large modern 2 din radio receivers have meager functionality and less convenience compared to a simple tablet.  The latter can generally replace a TV, player, GPS-navigator, and even provide Internet access.  True, for this it is necessary to choose a model with support for networks of the third and fourth generation, but today there are many of these on the market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only possible drawback of installing a tablet radio is the procedure itself.  If the owner irresponsibly approaches the installation of a tablet by himself in the car instead of the radio, then there is a chance to simply burn the tablet or break it.  By the way, most often drivers break tablets that are corny fall out of their niche when driving through holes or at fast acceleration. </p>

    <h2>  Installation options </h2><p>  Frankly, there are not many options for installing a tablet in a car in your car instead of a radio.  The device can either be installed in a special holder without touching the car radio, or you can remove the radio and insert a tablet instead.  The last option is complicated, but has its advantages. </p><p>  If you use holders, then everything is simple.  There are many different tripods on the market that are designed for different <span>tablet models.</span>  All of them have special suction cups with which the tripod is mounted at any point on the dashboard.  The owner only needs to buy a suitable tripod and install his tablet in it.  But it is worth considering that this method of attachment cannot be called reliable.  Yes, this is the easiest option to connect the tablet to the radio in the car with your own hands, and many drivers resort to it.  After all, the tablet is easy to install in a tripod, and charging can generally be connected to the cigarette lighter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, we will not consider this method.  Let's dwell on the best option: on installing the tablet in the car instead of the radio, and not in parallel with it. </p>

    <h2>  Installation process </h2><p>  There are 2 ways to install: without a third-party amplifier (in this case, the radio will be an amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãor with an amplifier.  The second method is quite complicated, so we will focus on the first.  What is needed for this? </p><p>  To install a tablet in a car instead of a radio, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Normal soldering iron. </li><li>  Crosshead screwdriver. </li><li>  A small sheet of plastic measuring 30 x 30 cm. </li><li>  Electric drill. </li><li>  The tablet itself. </li><li>  12-volt cigarette lighter plug. </li><li>  External car audio amplifier. </li><li>  Thick-walled wire with fuse. </li><li>  Audio wires for speakers. </li><li>  Mini RCA cable for tablet. </li><li>  Insulating tape. </li><li>  Epoxy resin </li><li>  Rubber couplings for wires. </li><li>  Adapter for connecting speakers. </li></ol><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  To begin with, 2 devices are connected to the car: a tablet and an amplifier.  Connection is made to the battery using a thick-walled cable.  There must be a fuse on this cable, and it should be located (a fuse) next to the battery. </p>

    <p>  To connect a tablet in a car instead of a radio, do it yourself with a hole in the engine compartment, through which a thick-walled cable will go into the passenger compartment.  A rubber sleeve is inserted into this hole so that the cable does not fray.  When driving, a cable without a sleeve will rub against metal, and this can damage it, resulting in a short circuit. </p><p>  Through this hole, a cable connected to the battery through a fuse enters the passenger compartment, where it is connected to an amplifier.  Usually, drivers install an amplifier under the seat, and lay the cable under the rugs. </p><p>  2 cables should go from the amplifier to the adapter.  It also comes with a pair of RCA cables that connects to the tablet. </p><p>  The radio must be removed from its place.  The extraction process depends on the model of the car, but usually there is nothing complicated about it. </p><h2>  Work with a seat </h2><p>  Now you need to measure the hole where the radio was previously located.  Based on the size, it is necessary to cut a sheet of plastic.  Its width and length should be approximately 1 cm greater than the measured dimensions.  This sheet of plastic is attached using epoxy in the place where the radio was previously.  Fix it at 6 points. </p>

    <p>  A cable hole is drilled in the middle of this plate.  Then it is desirable to paint over the surface of the plastic plate with a suitable color.  On the corners you need to glue the holders.  They are glued to epoxy. </p><p>  After this, the cables are connected to the tablet. </p><h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  When installing a tablet with your own hands in a car, instead of the radio, you need to consider some important points.  First of all, pay attention to the weight and size of the tablet.  A large and heavy device will not work, because it is more difficult to install, and when driving on a bad road it can come off and fall out.  Choose a compact and lightweight tablet. </p><p>  Next are the buttons.  It is desirable that the tablet had only one physical button.  So using the device in a car will be easier. </p>

    <h2>  Screen, standards support and other tablet selection criteria </h2><p>  The tablet screen should be capacitive, not resistive.  Resistive more convenient when working with the stylus.  In the car, using the stylus is inconvenient, so you have to press the buttons with your fingers.  Also, capacitive screens have a higher sensitivity.  Needless to say, the tablet must support 3G, 4G and GPS.  It is advisable to read reviews about tablets that work best with GPS, because technology support is not everything.  Many unsuccessful models often lose contact with the satellite, which is why the route goes astray.  As for color, it is inappropriate to install a white tablet in a black interior.  Although this is a matter of taste. </p><p>  Before replacing the radio on a tablet, you need to install Car Home Ultra on it.  This program will track various engine parameters, read errors from it and give sound signals when the motor is unstable. </p><p>  The speaker wires should have a screen.  Of course, they cost several times more than usual ones, but with them the driver will be guaranteed to hear clean music without interference. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The process of installing a do-it-yourself tablet in a car instead of a radio is always an individual process.  Even on the same car models, drivers can face different problems when installing the gadget.  Therefore, it is impossible to give any universal recipe, according to which it would be possible to easily and quickly carry out this procedure. </p><p>  In fact, there is nothing complicated in installing and connecting the tablet.  If you are even a little familiar with electronics, then no problem should arise with this.  However, you can turn to specialized service stations for help, where they can provide a similar service, but it will cost money. </p>
