The water park in Yasenevo is called Morion, and it is located on the site of the Transvaal Park that once existed here.  The building of the complex has been fundamentally reconstructed.  The complex, in its current form, received its first visitors this spring. </p><p>  Waterpark in Yasenevo </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in yasenevo" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/214492.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  Moreon is a multifunctional complex.  In addition to a variety of water attractions, there are steam rooms and baths of different national traditions, hydro-massage baths and wave pools, fitness and spa centers.  There are a lot of various entertainment facilities in the water park, including bars and restaurants for every taste and budget.  Designers who designed the water park in Yasenevo can be proud of how successfully they managed to put together six main attractions of the water sports complex.  The slides here are of different heights and different levels of difficulty, but the descent routes are twisted in an unexpected way.  They in certain areas pass through the open street space and abound in unexpected turns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in yasenevo prices" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/214491.jpg" width="490"></div>  The water park in Yasenevo is distinguished by both its size and the variety of contents.  In one day, it is virtually impossible to get around it.  And in this circumstance there is an additional positive effect - visitors have the opportunity to find something new and interesting that they did not notice on their first visit.  The design of the water sports complex has been completely organically decided - it does not go to the fore and does not attract excessive attention of visitors.  Muscovites and guests of the capital managed to appreciate the new water park in Yasenevo.  Reviews about it are dominated by positive, despite some complaints about private issues.  The management of the sports complex does not stop there and is steadily working to improve the service.  Continuous attention is being paid to security issues.  The operation of the complex in a continuous mode is provided by technical services, medical personnel and qualified rescuers.

    <p>  Water park in Yasenevo.  Prices and working hours </p><p>  <span>The pricing policy</span> in the Moreon water park has its own characteristics and is differentiated by a number of criteria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in ashenevo reviews" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/214493.jpg" width="498"></div>  An adult ticket for one three-hour session on a weekday costs 1250 rubles and 1800 rubles on a weekend.  The cost of a children's ticket for the same session on a weekday is 870 rubles and 1250 rubles on a weekend.  Children in Morion do not differ in age, but in height.  Those whose height does not exceed 120 centimeters receive the privilege of free access to the water park.  There is a system of benefits for students, senior citizens and the disabled.  On <span>weekdays</span> from 12-00 to 17-00 these categories of the population can visit the Moreon water park for 630 rubles.  Visitors should also be aware of the penalties provided for the loss of an individual bracelet.  The water park operates on weekdays from 12-00 to 21-00, on weekends - from 9-00 to 23-00.  A complex of water attractions is located near the MKAD, which is the easiest way to get to.  But you can also come here by metro: the nearest stations are Yasenevo and Novoyasenevskaya.
