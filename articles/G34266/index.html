For a year we are so exhausted that a source of vitality, energy, which will give peace of mind, is simply necessary.  The sea is what we are talking about.  You can sit for hours on the coast, enjoy the sound of the surf, birdsong and the rustle of trees.  Not everyone has the opportunity to visit Asian resorts, cross the ocean in order to spend several days on the coast.  That is why, increasingly, the choice falls on more budget options.  How do you like Abkhazia?  This is a country with stunning nature, picturesque views and a comfortable climate.  Yes, the tourism industry in this country needs financial investments, no one here has even heard of luxury hotels and impeccable service.  But the rest here is so budgetary that tourists are ready to close their eyes to the shortcomings. </p>

    <p>  The hotel opened in 2016, so plumbing, appliances, furniture - everything here is new, in good condition.  Plumbing works without interruption, the main thing is that there are no problems in the supply of hot water.  Of course, going on vacation, it is unlikely that you plan to spend all your free time in the room, but this option is perfect for sleeping, relaxing and taking the necessary hygiene procedures. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  At the moment, tourism in Abkhazia is on the rise, there are good options for living, great attention is paid to service.  So, in the hotel all tourists will enjoy daily housekeeping.  All those who have already managed to spend several days here rest noted that the cleaning is quite high-quality: all surfaces, floors are cleaned, towels and bed linen are changed if necessary.  It is good to see in Pitsunda such an attentive attitude towards cleanliness.  We can only hope that the hotel administration will continue to pay it as much attention. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  All vacationers are waiting for a small but well-groomed territory of the Forest Club 2 * hotel (Pitsunda).  Photos show the presence of a guarded parking lot.  A fairly large number of tourists come here by personal transport, so many will appreciate the opportunity to park their car and not worry about its safety. </p><p>  At your service a 24-hour reception desk - the hotel will help in solving problems and difficulties.  Here you can get acquainted with not the most diverse, but rather informative and interesting excursion program of the resort. </p><p>  On the territory of the Forest Club 2 * hotel (Pitsunda) there is a good playground.  That is why here you can meet a lot of vacationers with young children, whom the rest in the tent certainly does not suit. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All guests of the Forest Club 2 * (Pitsunda) will enjoy breakfast organized in their own restaurant.  Food is not the strongest side of this hotel. Breakfast is quite modest: meat and cheese slices, fresh bread, some vegetables and seasonal fruits, eggs, tea and coffee to choose from.  In order to eat in the morning, it‚Äôs not bad. </p>

    <p>  Meals can be enjoyed at one of the local cafes, bars and restaurants.  They prepare delicious dishes of national and European cuisine.  Moreover, they sell seafood, soft drinks, fruits, hot corn on the beach - certainly no one will remain hungry. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not yet have access to wireless Internet.  We hope that soon the hotel administration will solve this issue - modern tourists do not want to be left without a source of communication with the world, even during their holidays. </p><p>  At the reception you can order a shuttle to the airport or train station, as well as get acquainted with the excursion program of the resort, maybe choose something worthwhile and most interesting for yourself. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  If you want to enjoy the crystal clear sea water, the beauty of the landscapes that open, the rich coniferous aroma, Pitsunda is the ideal option for you.  Picunda Forest Club 2 * is located just 20 meters from the beach.  It is truly a paradise, ideal for sunbathing and swimming.  Sports equipment and water sports rentals are organized on the beach, so you will definitely not be bored. </p>

    <p>  The beach is pebble, with a gentle descent into the water.  For an additional fee, you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas.  Vacationers note that it is quite clean, even in high season. </p><p>  Gorgeous virgin nature is what impresses all those tourists who come here for the first time.  In combination with a unique coniferous aroma, this place becomes truly unique. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  So, the Forest Club 2 * hotel (Pitsunda) is an excellent option for unpretentious tourists.  Due to the fact that it opened for visiting recently, the condition of the rooms is excellent.  The hotel administration really took care of the comfort of all vacationers, adopted the experience of many foreign resorts, having worked on the service.  Yes, there is no swimming pool, plenty of entertainment, rooms are more than modest in terms of equipment, but the hotel is located in a picturesque area within walking distance of the beach. </p>

    <p>  If you want to save on your vacation, consider all possible options, are ready to put up with some disadvantages, be sure to look at this option.  Proximity to the coast, good infrastructure of the hotel, as well as reasonable prices, nevertheless do their job and increase the popularity of even a hotel of such a low category.  And one more thing: when going to Abkhazia, keep in mind that first of all it is a country with amazing nature, and then it is already an ideal place for a beach holiday. </p>
