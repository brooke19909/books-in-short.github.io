    <h2>  Gregor Strasser: biography </h2><p>  Gregor was born on the thirty-first of May 1892 in Bavaria.  His parents were quite wealthy officials.  My father was fond of politics and wrote in various newspapers.  He instilled his love for history and political science to children.  Gregor graduated with honors.  In addition to him, the family had two more children - Otto Strasser and Paul.  Gregor maintained friendly relations with Otto even after he entered university, since his brother shared his passion for political life. </p><p>  Strasser was interested in various radical movements in his student years.  He was critical of the Kaiser‚Äôs domestic and foreign policies.  I read socialist literature.  At that time, various interest clubs were popular in which young people discussed the works of prominent philosophers of modern times.  But their activities did not go beyond conversations.  Everything changed after the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.  The scandalous incident was a formal occasion for the outbreak of war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  After the mobilization and martial law were announced, Gregor Strasser immediately forgot about his criticism of the Kaiser policy and socialist views.  He signed up for volunteers.  After two months of training, he went to the front.  His brother Otto Strasser also went to war as a volunteer.  The war revealed the talents of Gregor.  In the trenches and trenches of Europe, his new worldview began to take shape.  He believed in the victory of Germany and in the validity of the war.  For four years he rose to the rank of captain.  Received military awards - Iron Crosses of the first and second class.  However, by the end of the war, these orders were contemptuously called "pieces of iron" among the people, since several million people became their owners. </p><p>  After the surrender of Germany, riots began in the country.  The imperial system collapsed.  Against the backdrop of a successful revolution in the Russian Empire, the Communists decided to start a speech in Munich.  The Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed.  The troops controlled by Berlin, of which Strasser was a part, came out to suppress the revolutionaries.  After a bloody assault, the BSR was abolished. </p><p>  Returning to Bavaria, Gregor Strasser became the owner of a pharmacy.  At the same time, he continued to be interested in politics and writing in newspapers. </p><h2>  Father's influence </h2><p>  According to Paul Strasser, the father had a key influence on Gregor's worldview.  Many attribute it to the harbingers of national socialism.  Peter studied political science and sociology.  He was a supporter of new trends, criticized capitalism and liberalism.  In one of the brochures was published his work "New Being".  In it, he described the political theory of the merger of classical socialism with a national and religious spirit.  Undoubtedly, he shared his thoughts with his sons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The idea was to build socialism, where the national identity will play a unifying role.  In fact, it was an attempt to symbiosis all the popular ideas of that time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otto Strasser" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1507154.jpg" width="500"></div>  In the early works of Gregor, these thoughts are clearly traced, literally word for word.

    <h2>  Acquaintance with Hitler </h2><p>  In the twentieth year, the Strasser brothers live in Deggendorf.  Otto already has experience of political struggle.  In Berlin, he leads the detachments of workers who come out for demonstrations.  There he met with the Social Democrats.  Gregor also sympathizes with the latter.  However, the party leadership‚Äôs refusal to include a clause on nationalization in its program makes Strasser leave the organization.  After that, he met with Adolf Hitler and the Thule Society. </p><p>  The new National Socialist Party seems to Gregor exactly what he has been looking for all his life.  He finds ideas close to himself in the program and completes it himself.  A noticeable bias to the right does not cause claims from Gregor.  He, like thousands of other front-line soldiers, regrets the shameful end of the war for Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="night of long knives" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1507155.jpg" width="300"></div>  Therefore, the head goes into the activities of the National Socialist German Workers Party (in Russian the abbreviation NSDAP is used).  After Otto arrived in Bavaria, his older brother introduced him to Hitler and other prominent figures.  Persuades to join the party, but Otto categorically refuses.

Armed groups created.  Then the party leadership decided to start a speech.  Gregor Strasser supported Hitler's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa rebellion in Munich.  On November 9, many members of the local government gathered in a pub where they listened to political speeches by speakers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gregor Strasser biography" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1507322.jpg" width="400"></div>  Nazi assault squads surrounded the building and then took all who were there hostage.  After that, hoping for the support of the army and the population, they moved to the central square.

    <h2>  Coup suppression </h2><p>  Instead of jubilant locals they were met by a police cordon.  A skirmish ensued.  After that, government forces attacked the rebels.  Many had to go on the run.  Hitler and Ludendrof were arrested.  After the arrest of Adolf, the new leader of the NSDAP, Strasser, was chosen.  He resumed political activity and assisted prisoners in the comrade.  At this moment, he decides to finally move into a new sphere and sells his pharmacy.  With the proceeds, he opens a printing house and publishes his own newspaper.  Otto becomes her editor.  And the secretary of Gregor is the notorious Goebbels. </p><h2>  Political activity in the party </h2><p>  The NSDAP owes its sudden take-off to Strasser. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gregor Strasser quotes" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1507162.jpg" width="600"></div>  After leading the party, he revised the program somewhat.  He began to use more leftist and socialist rhetoric.  This helped to drive the working masses to the side of the Nazis.  Gregor did not agree with racist points in the party program.  He hoped he could tip her to the left.  Because of this, there were constant disputes with the adherents of these points.  Gregor Strasser against Hitler often brought charges of excessive bourgeoisie.  Goebbels supported him.  Even the question was raised about the expulsion of Adolf from the party.  Nevertheless, the latter managed to win the support of party members.  And <span>Joseph Goebbels,</span> realizing that the majority supports Hitler, also goes over to his side.  Because of this, Gregor had a great personal hostility towards him.

    <h2>  Agitation of the masses </h2><p>  By the twenty-sixth year, the post of head of the propaganda department is Gregor Strasser.  Politician quotes are increasingly appearing on the front pages of Munich newspapers.  He succeeded significantly in his new position.  Thanks to street and print agitation, more than seven hundred thousand people joined the National Socialists in a few years.  Gregor had a serious influence within the party.  He has held various posts.  Gauleiter of Lower Bavaria continued to bend the "socialist" line.  This caused constant debate with Hitler.  Strasser also had his own views on the method of coming to power.  Once in the Reichstag, the Nazis were offered the position of vice chancellor.  However, Adolf rejected him.  Strasser believed that, having taken such a high post, it was possible to crush the entire cabinet for himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gregor Strasser vs. Hitler" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1507158.jpg" width="350"></div>  It was at this moment that the crisis in relations with Hitler intensified.  The Fuhrer removed Gregor from his post, but left the party.

    <h2>  Flight from Germany </h2><p>  The Nazis are gaining influence.  By the thirties, they already constitute a majority in parliament.  At the same time, Hitler still refuses the post of vice chancellor.  He explains this position de facto by the lack of serious influence and the possibility of a decline in sympathy from the people.  But in the winter of the thirty-third, Schleicher offers this post to Gregor Strasser.  He accepts it.  In the ranks of the NSDAP there has been a serious split.  A tough fight began within the party itself.  As a result, Gregor decides to resign and go to Italy. </p><p>  While abroad, he continues to monitor political life at home.  At the same time, he practically does not maintain contact with the NSDAP; his brother is the only source of information.  For several months in Italy, Gregor loses all his political influence.  His place was taken by <span>Rudolf Hess.</span>  For unknown reasons, Strasser returns to Germany. </p><h2>  Night of long knives </h2><p>  By the summer of the thirty-fourth begins the construction of a new state.  Having gained full control of the country, the Nazis begin a civil war.  Prominent figures of the NSDAP are fighting for spheres of influence.  One of the main forces opposed to Hitler was Strasser, and Ernst Rohme did not lag behind him.  The latter was the leader of the assault squads.  At that time, it was, in fact, the most powerful military force in Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gauleiter of Lower Bavaria" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1507170.jpg" width="600"></div>  Ryom tried to crush government troops for himself.

    <p>  Hitler and other members of the new government feared the rebel attack aircraft.  Strasser was considered as a possible ideological chapter of the coup.  However, after his return from Italy, he managed to reconcile with Hitler.  He returned him to the party and even intended to provide a ministerial seat. </p><p>  To deal with his opponents, Hitler prepared the secret operation "Night of the Long Knives".  When it began, a wave of arrests swept across Berlin.  Ernst Rohm was killed.  Goering, who hated Strasser, gave the order to kill him, which happened on June 30, 1934.  After the end of World War II, the political views of Gregor and Otto began to be called "Strasserianism." </p>
