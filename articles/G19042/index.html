Novodevichy Convent in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The magnificent Moscow <span>Novodevichy Convent</span> has a very memorable address: Novodevichy Proezd, 1. A rare visitor did not admire the stunning appearance and calm, pacifying each spirituality of this place.  Novodevichy Moscow Monastery attracts lovers of Russian history, architecture, travelers and religious people.  Everyone will find something to see in this quiet and humble monastery. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  But first things first.  Why is the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow, whose address is known to everyone in the capital, attractive to historians?  The fact is that this place is closely connected with the era of the reign of Peter the Great.  Although the first buildings were rebuilt, perhaps much earlier, even under Basil the Third, in the sixteenth century.  The first stone, where the Novodevichy Convent is located, at the <span>bend of the Moskva River</span> (according to legend, there was a selection of young Russian virgins for captivity in the Golden Horde), it was laid back in fifteen hundred and twenty-fourth from the <span>birth of Christ.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Historical meaning </h2><p>  It's funny that it was in this Novodevichy Smolensk monastery that he wanted to send his unwanted more wife, Princess Solomon, the founder of this monastery, Prince Vasily.  Some contemporaries of the Grand Duke even believed that for this purpose the monastery was erected.  There is a more magnificent version of what served as the reason for the construction of the monastery.  The fact is that it was rebuilt immediately after the capture of Smolensk, as if in honor of this glorious deed.  In addition, to the glory of the Smolensk Icon of the Virgin "Hodegetria", which inspired the military men for this feat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How many eminent representatives of the great princely family have been here in these beautiful walls!  Many sisters of the kings were tonsured here as a nun.  Ivan the Fourth himself sent his relatives here to live, including even the wife of his deceased son.  The next tsar also lived in this territory for a very long time, only from a different dynasty - Boris Godunov. </p>

    <h2>  Sofya Alekseevna Romanova </h2><p>  And if one recalls the Petrine era, the half- <span>sister of Peter the Great,</span> Sophia (she was a regent with him and his demented brother Ivan during the Dual Power for a long time) was imprisoned in one of the towers of this particular <span>convent</span> after her treacherous attempt to usurp power.  By the way, at the behest of Peter himself.  It‚Äôs good that they didn‚Äôt execute them, like the archers, with whose hands she tried to make a coup.  The heads of those poor fellows were ordered to be placed on the teeth of the monastery towers, and the supporters of Sophia and her close associates were executed.  So much so that she herself could see it all from the windows of her cell.  So that it was not inconvenient either to her or anyone else to rebel against the king. </p><p>  And in this monastery, the first wife of Peter and the former Tsarina Evdokia Lopukhina served as a simple nun.  She was displeased at the court, and Peter decided to marry for the second time Martha Skavronskaya (she was baptized by Catherine). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can tell a lot more interesting from the history of this place, but let me tell you about the architectural features.  They are also very entertaining. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural Delights </h2><p>  The whole monastery resembles an ancient impregnable fortification.  Loopholes, tall towers, the Moscow River, which, like a moat, washes the impregnable walls of this stronghold.  And with all this, the monastery is extremely elegant.  Its sophisticated buildings are made mainly in the style of Moscow baroque.  This is the richest and most elegant style of the seventeenth century.  It was at this time that most of the buildings of the complex were built. </p><p>  The place where the Novodevichy Convent is located is called the <span>Maiden Field.</span>  And the monastery is visible on it from afar.  Its bright white-red walls and golden bell towers greet travelers with cordiality and tranquility. </p><h2>  Church of the Transfiguration </h2><p>  One of the most unusual and beautiful buildings is the church, which literally soars above the main entrance - this is the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord.  The abundance of snow-white stucco molding on a bright background is truly mesmerizing.  Columns in a classic style, unusual platbands, forms of light drums.  Before the parishioners is not a simple cross-domed church, but a real ode to architectural thought.  How similar she is to the construction of the Sunday Novodevichy Convent in St. Petersburg! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Smolensky Cathedral </h2><p>  The central Smolensky Cathedral looks much simpler.  It is very reminiscent of the Arkhangelsk or Assumption Cathedrals in Moscow.  It was rebuilt in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-fifth, and it contains the spirit of the centuries-old history of Russia of those times.  White walls, silver and a golden dome - there is nothing superfluous in the external structure of the building.  Concise and regular form of the temple, erected in the ancient Byzantine manner.  But the interior decoration is amazing: the five-tier iconostasis, covered with gilding, which was made by the master of the Armory, many of the Russian icon painting masterpieces donated by the great princes are stored here.  But most of all, the Orthodox seek this temple because of the miraculous icon of the Mother of God of Smolensk. </p>

    <h2>  The bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent </h2><p>  A little further from this building rises the most beautiful bell tower of all that has ever been created in Russia.  It is as if all entwined with the finest and lightest white lace.  Here it is, baroque in all its glory.  At the heart of each tier of this tower is an octagon, it is crowned with a golden dome, but not only it is wonderful in it, but its ringing, it is heard throughout the district and for a long time remains in the memory of everyone who hears it.  The oldest bell in it is the one that was created under Ivan Vasilievich Rurikovich.  To this day, he sounds from this belfry.  Already because of it, one is worth visiting the Novodevichy Convent.  How to get to it will be described in detail below. </p>

    <h2>  Assumption Temple </h2><p>  The excursion program also includes the Assumption Temple.  It is made in the same architectural style and color with a bell.  A single-domed small temple, but beautiful, like a palace.  Red walls, unusual geometry, magnificent stucco molding on the walls and the magnificence of the interior.  This is what characterizes this temple. </p><p>  Those who decided to take a tour of this holy place will be interested to know that the monastery complex also has the Ambrose Church, a school where, even during the reign of Peter the Great, orphans were taught to weave lace according to Dutch technology, an infirmary for veterans, an old people's home and completely the chambers are different in their wealth and historical significance.  After all, here lived, as was said above, Evdokia Lopukhina, Evdokia Miloslavskaya, Irina Godunova with her brother, etc. </p><h2>  The Tower of Thrones </h2><p>  The last interesting place, but not in significance, is the tower of the Novodevichy Convent.  A carved, magnificent and bright building with a very obvious meaning: a guardroom for archers.  It is almost as tall as the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent.  In it were also the chambers of <span>Princess Sophia.</span>  There is even a legend that if you touch the wall of this tower and make a <span>cherished desire,</span> it will certainly come true.  It‚Äôs hard to say for sure from when this belief was brought up and what it is connected with, but it‚Äôs already instituted.  Many even write their desires on the plaster coating of this tower, but it‚Äôs better not to do this, vandalism after all. </p><p>  In the territory where the Novodevichy Convent is located, there is also a whole complex of burials of famous and great people.  You can personally witness the grave of the hero of the Patriotic War of the thousand eight hundred and twelve years - Denis Davydov, General Brusilov, the Decembrist Muravyov-Apostol.  Well, and, of course, on the territory of the monastery there are burials and royal persons. </p><p>  For believers, the fact that the temples of the monastery are still active is surely important, services are still held there to this day (though, divine services in the Novodevichy Convent are only in the Assumption Church every day, the Smolensky Cathedral operates all summer), and flock there every day parishioners.  Behind the monastery is a very beautiful and picturesque park.  It is located on the shore of the pond of the same name with the monastery.  It is in this place that the most picturesque views of the entire complex open.  In this square you can enjoy very original sculptural groups. </p><p>  From the foregoing, it becomes quite obvious that spending a day at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow is very interesting and useful.  To see and learn a lot of new things, to enjoy unique monuments of art, to visit nature and feel the immeasurable tranquility and grace with which this monastery is filled - this is really worth a lot.  The monastery is very reminiscent, and perhaps in some ways, superior to St. Petersburg Novodevichy Convent.  If you are faced with the question of where to spend the next weekend, then consider this option in the first place, obviously you will not have to regret it. </p>

The easiest and most economical way in terms of time is by metro.  Get off at Sportivnaya station, you‚Äôll only have to go from it for ten minutes.
