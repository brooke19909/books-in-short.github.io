  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lev Davidovich Trotsky (Leiba Bronstein): biography, political activity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Leiba Bronstein (pseudonym Trotsky) was a well-known political, public and state Russian and Soviet figure.  In addition, he became famous as a writer and a talented speaker: his literary articles, essays, books, as well as speeches brought him fame in a revolutionary environment.  He also showed outstanding organizational and military abilities, occupying various high posts both in the administrative apparatus and in the party. </p><h2>  Some biography facts </h2><p>  Leiba Bronstein was born in Kherson province in 1879.  He came from a Jewish family, his parents were wealthy landowners.  He studied at the Odessa school, where he established himself well.  Then he continued his studies in Nikolaev, where he was carried away by revolutionary trends and ideology.  Here he joined a circle, and later even became one of the participants in the workers' union.  After a while, he was arrested and exiled, but fled abroad in 1902.  During his imprisonment, he married A. Sokolovskaya, with whom he never divorced, despite the fact that he subsequently re-created a family.  Thus, Leiba Bronstein, whose youth was marked by revolutionary ideology, already in his youth established himself as an active and dangerous propagandist. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leiba Bracket" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1297534.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  In exile </h2><p>  Having visited several European countries, he gained even more popularity and fame.  He immediately attracted the attention of V. Lenin, who recommended including him in the editorial board of the newspaper.  He proved himself to be a talented author of articles, but his activities were not limited to this.  Leiba Bronstein participated in party life, was a member of congresses and at first advocated the reconciliation of the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.  However, in 1904 his break with Lenin followed, which he even criticized.  The development of the doctrine of the <span>permanent revolution</span> dates back to the same time <span>.</span>  This idea suggested that the bourgeois coup carried out by the workers should go into a new, socialist stage.  During the years of his first stay abroad, he started a family a second time with <span>N. Sedova,</span> but their marriage was civil, since the divorce from his first wife was not officially registered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leiba Bracket Awards" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1297524.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  The first revolution and the second stage of emigration </h2><p>  Leiba Bronstein took a very active part in socio-political life not only in European countries, he closely followed the events in Russia.  When the first revolution began in the empire in 1905, he immediately returned to his homeland and headed the St. Petersburg workers' council.  However, he was arrested and sentenced to a new exile, however, he again managed to escape.  Abroad, he continued his publishing activities: he actively opposed the war and called on the peoples of the warring parties to disobey the governments.  At the same time, he did not agree with the Leninist slogan about the necessity of unleashing a civil struggle.  He visited several European countries, but was constantly forced to move, because he was considered as a dangerous revolutionary.  He visited the United States, the country impressed him with his industrial power, which allowed him to approve the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits superiority over European states.  In 1917, with the beginning of a new revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and immediately joined the struggle. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leiba Bronstein youth" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1297520.jpg" width="319"></div></h2><h2>  Second revolution and political career </h2><p>  At this time, the capital of the country was engulfed in riots.  Many parties, factions and various groups fought for power.  Leiba Bronstein, whose activities during this period acquired a particularly wide scope, of course, could not remain on the sidelines.  He, along with a number of his supporters, joined the Bolshevik party and took a very active part in preparing the October coup.  Using great influence among the soldiers and sailors, he, thanks to his oratory, drew them to his side. </p>

But after Stalin gained power, he gradually lost his posts, and then was expelled from the country in 1929.  Eleven years later, Leiba Bronstein (whose reward is the Order of the Red Banner) was killed in Mexico.
