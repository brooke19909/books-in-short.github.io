This airport is very popular, it is from there that almost 50% of all flights from Moscow are carried out.  Every day, these <span>transport hubs</span> in total serve more than 50 thousand passengers, with their help you can get to different parts of Russia and Europe. </p><p>  There are a huge number of options for this route, on average it takes about two hours to overcome it.  The fastest way to do this is with your own car, but if you don‚Äôt have one, you will have to turn to public transport services, mainly we are talking about the subway and aeroexpress. </p><h2>  Tver outpost </h2><p>  The route ‚ÄúBelorussky Railway Station - Domodedovo‚Äù begins precisely on this square, where the sixth oldest railway gate of Moscow is located.  The station itself appeared in 1870, today it is possible to leave here mainly in the southern regions of Russia, in addition, there is an aeroexpress train that allows you to get to Sheremetyevo Airport.  Also from here on weekends trains leave for Berlin, a very well developed suburban traffic.  It should be noted that the station is the terminal of the Moscow-Smolenskaya station, in railway tickets it is called that way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian station" class="if uuid-2274197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274197.jpg"></div><p>  The station is located on the <span>Tverskaya Zastava</span> Square <span>,</span> which underwent a total renovation in 2017: after 70 years, the tram returned here, and it itself took on a completely different look.  But the <span>metropolitan</span> authorities have so far decided to abandon the <span>trolley bus</span> , so only bus routes can be used on the square.  Near the station is the station of the same name, on which the Koltsevaya and Zamoskvoretskaya lines intersect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Domodedovo airport </h2><p>  The end point of the route ‚ÄúBelorussky Railway Station (Moscow) - Domodedovo‚Äù is located beyond the Moscow Ring Road, 45 kilometers from the center of the capital.  As of 2018, the airport is one of the busiest in the world, it serves 54 airlines that operate flights to Europe, Asia, as well as some countries of North America and Africa.  The terminal building was built in accordance with existing European requirements, thanks to this the airport is very popular among Muscovites and visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-architect.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belorussky railway station Domodedovo airport" class="if uuid-2274199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274199.jpg"></div><p>  You can drive along the Belorussky Train Station - Domodedovo route using the federal highway A-105, which connects the city‚Äôs air gate with Kashirsky highway.  Also in the village of the same name located nearby, there is a railway station, from which you can use the express train to get to the Paveletsky station.  Here, air parades take place periodically, where everyone is allowed. </p><h2>  Aeroexpress </h2><p>  The easiest way to get from the Belorussky railway station to Domodedovo is by express train, but you can‚Äôt do without a transfer here.  First you need to go down the subway, take the Zamoskvoretskaya line train next to the Novokuznetskaya station.  Please note that at the Belorusskaya station two metro lines intersect, it is important to choose the one you need, otherwise you will have to ride the ‚Äúunderground‚Äù for a very long time and spend time on unnecessary transfers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="patstravelreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian station Domodedovo Aeroexpress" class="if uuid-2274201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274201.jpg"></div><p>  At the station "Paveletskaya" will need to go out and climb into the building of the same station.  It is there that you can buy a ticket for Aeroexpress, its cost ranges from 500 to 1000 rubles, you can also purchase a subscription for several trips and persons.  Travel time takes 46 minutes, the first train leaves the Paveletsky station at 6:00, and the last at 00:30.  The first train from Domodedovo leaves at 5:15, the last - exactly at midnight.  The interval of movement is 30 minutes. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  But what should you do if you do not have time for the Aeroexpress train, which can significantly shorten the route along the route Domodedovo-Belorussky Train Station?  How to get to your destination?  In this case, bus service can help you, we are talking about route No. 308, which connects the airport with the metro station Domodedovo, located on Kashirskoye Shosse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Domodedovo Belarusian station how to get" class="if uuid-2274198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274198.jpg"></div><p>  In the subway, you need to catch the Zamoskvoretskaya line train going towards the city center, it is he who will take you to the Belorussky railway station.  Travel time from the airport to Domodedovo will be about an hour without taking into account possible difficulties on the road, and you will spend 35-40 minutes on a trip to the metro. </p><h2>  Via Domodedovo </h2><p>  If none of the above methods suits you, you can take the Belorussky Train Station - Domodedovo route through the village of the same name.  At the airport terminal, you can take the bus number 30, which goes directly to the Domodedovo railway station.  Here (in addition to the Aeroexpress), other electric trains stop following to Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-architect.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Domodedovo airport Belorussian station how to get" class="if uuid-2274200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274200.jpg"></div><p>  You can use the trains to get to the Paveletsky station, where you can take the metro.  If for some reason the electric trains are late or canceled at all, you can use minibus No. 496, which will help you get to the Domodedovskaya metro station, and from there it will not be difficult to get to the Belorussky railway station. </p><h2>  We are taking a taxi </h2><p>  You can also take the Belorussky Train Station - Domodedovo Airport route by taxi, but the cost of such a trip can cost you a pretty penny, especially if you have luggage.  Although this method has its own advantage - there will be no need to change seats and drag things from one public transport to another, which is very convenient. </p><p>  The fare for a taxi ranges from 1000 to 1500 rubles, when ordering a car, you should take into account the presence of additional factors that can increase the fare.  These include weather conditions, the presence of extra baggage or animals, as well as the number of passengers.  On the road you will need to spend about an hour and a half, provided that the situation on the roads is calm. </p><h2>  General tips </h2><p>  Experienced travelers who have repeatedly traveled along the Belorussky Train Station - Domodedovo route are advised to choose a vehicle depending on their own goals.  If you want to save money, and you don‚Äôt have much luggage, the easiest way to get to the Domodedovo railway station by minibus is to take a ticket for an ordinary train.  Please note that the trains run here at intervals of 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, and put the waiting time in your travel schedule in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.railwaygazette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian station Moscow Domodedovo" class="if uuid-2274202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2274202.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of a ticket for an electric train is not more than 150 rubles, the cost of travel by minibus and metro is about 100 rubles in total.  For comparison - a trip by aeroexpress to one adult will cost about 500 rubles, an additional 50 rubles will have to be spent on a trip in the subway.  Thus, using minibuses you can save about 50% of the fare.  Of course, you can act radically and go from the station to the airport on foot, but you will have to walk about 50 kilometers, it will take about 10 hours. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you know everything about the route ‚ÄúDomodedovo Airport - Belorussky Train Station‚Äù: how to get from one point to another, what vehicles you can use, and even how much you have to pay for the trip, it will be much easier to use.  If you use bus service, you should be prepared for the fact that on weekends the intervals of movement of these vehicles can be significantly increased. </p><p>  You can also use a lot more transfers using tram, trolleybus and bus routes, but this will significantly increase the travel time.  Therefore, this option is more suitable for those who want to see the capital, and also has a large amount of free time. </p>
