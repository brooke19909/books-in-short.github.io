    <p>  Persian kittens, perhaps, cause only delight among all who communicate with them.  These are cute and charming animals.  Persian kittens have an unrivaled charm and the number of people who want to buy them is growing day by day. </p><p>  However, we must not forget about some of the problems that inevitably arise after the kitten becomes a member of your family.  There are a number of questions about what to feed, how to raise, how to care.  After all, a Persian kitten is not a fluffy toy, but a living creature, growing and constantly changing.  And it is important for all the owners of this charm to know that a Persian should be carefully looked after, otherwise instead of a beautiful "shag" you can get a monster. </p><p>  <strong>Possible trouble</strong> </p><p>  The primary task is to train the kitten to the toilet.  To do this, you need to purchase a tray or a tray with a special mesh designed to keep the ‚Äúpanties‚Äù on the hind legs clean. </p><p>  The toilet tray should be washed regularly with clean running water, without adding any smelling substances, and vinegar and a stiff brush will help to remove urinary stone. </p><p>  Usually it‚Äôs enough to put a kitten in a tray at the first sign of anxiety and desire to make a toilet.  Persian kittens are very smart and, as a rule, the owner will not have to worry again. </p><p>  Never hit the baby, do not poke your face into the "outrage" that happened.  The Persians cannot stand violence at all. </p><p>  <strong>Interest in indoor plants</strong> </p><p>  Cats are very curious, and they will definitely want to taste every flower or leaf.  Remember that a Persian cat can be poisoned by <span>flower</span> bulbs <span>, cacti,</span> oleanders, ivies, poppies, cloves, ficuses and cyclamens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If your favorite greenhouse gives you joy, place the flowers so that the kitten cannot reach them. </p><p>  Germinate a special meadow for it, for which wheat, oats or lawn grass, purchased at a pet store, is suitable. </p><p>  <strong>Ear care</strong> </p><p>  Persian kittens require a lot of attention. </p><p>  If the Persian <span>eyes watery,</span> they can be washed with boiled chilled water.  Ears do not need daily cleaning, but sometimes you need to look into them. </p><p>  Manicure is also an important procedure.  A kitten is taught to him from infancy.  You need to take it in one hand, and in the other with scissors or tweezers, and carefully cut the claws so as not to touch the blood vessel. </p><p>  A claw sharpener should always be in the apartment so that the sofas are safe and sound. </p><p>  Do not get involved in washing, but regular combing is necessary.  This procedure will help to keep the kitten‚Äôs fur coat in perfect condition and save him from a serious problem. </p><p>  <strong>Persian Feeding</strong> </p><p>  All Persian kittens love fish and meat.  They are not indifferent to cottage cheese, <span>yogurt, low-fat</span> sour cream.  For a side dish, try offering your pet oatmeal. </p><p>  Taurine is the amino acid that the Persians need.  Lack of it can lead to blindness, reproductive problems and heart disease.  Dry food is best given as a reward, at an exhibition or on the go. </p><p>  And, of course, with constant feeding of the cat with dry food, fresh clean water should be in his bowl. </p><p>  <strong>The "old" age of the Persian cat</strong> </p><p>  The male half of this breed of cats is playful until a certain age.  Later they become very sedate, they even need to be forced to actively run and move, which is very important for the fight against obesity, constipation and kidney stones.  In the treatment of urolithiasis, antibiotics and a diet with magnesium should be combined. </p><p>  <strong>Cat with a good character</strong> </p><p>  Persians are prone to blues and often become depressed if they do not show the attention they deserve. </p><p>  The cause of the kitten's bad behavior may be some kind of ailment.  The sick cat is trying to attract the attention of the owners.  After all, the "right" Persians usually have an excellent character, they are good companions, obedient, unobtrusive, love the company of people, affectionate and a little phlegmatic. </p>
