Before this terrible event, it was just a team that did not exist as a separate link.  The tank corps is essentially the same mechanized, but still was defined as a new kind.  These units rarely went out into battle first.  Usually all tank corps were a reserve, they left only when it was insanely necessary and urgent support was required in battle.  Later, a year after the formation of the corps, ‚Äútank armies‚Äù appeared, and the TCs were introduced into them as the main force of this same army. </p><h2>  History of the creation of the Guards Tank Corps </h2><p>  If we started talking about the corps, then we can not help but recall the guards.  "Guards" have always been different from others, ranging from use to the history of occurrence.  The creation of tank corps did not begin immediately after the appearance of the first tanks.  As such, they have existed since the 1930s, because tanks were already in the inter-arms, and the defense industry fully allowed and even supported the creation of such large vehicles with fully mobile bodies.  According to information from some sources, already in the 37th year of the 20th century there were so-called tank corps, in which there were already separate brigades, both light and heavy, but they were completely disbanded and renamed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="warthunder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tank t34" class="if uuid-2670352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2670352.jpg"></div><p>  In the 1940s, motorized divisions began to be created, which also included such heavy equipment, but due to huge losses, the Soviet Union authorities recalled the remaining cars away in order to save at least something to repel the Nazi invaders.  A few years later, when the defense industry began to show good results, it was decided to re-organize tank corps in order to form a new type of troops, completely independent of other types of land units. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The success of the teams </h2><p>  As such, the combat route of the tank corps was very simple.  They no longer appeared in land operations as part of a detachment, they were a completely independent unit, the commander of which had already sent his "subordinates".  With the help of tank corps, it was possible to break a gap in the accumulation of enemy forces, inflict huge damage, or even completely destroy enemy forces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="histografy.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Column of tanks" class="if uuid-2666832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2666832.jpg"></div><p>  They were indispensable troops during offensive operations and played almost the most important role in them, because because of their enormous strength they inspired fear in the enemy, forcing rifle units to flee, as if from fire.  Their use was very advantageous against enemy infantry, in such battles the Nazis did not have a single chance of victory. </p><h2>  Compositions and weapons </h2><p>  Already in 1942, the first tank corps were formed.  This decision of the high command gave "trump cards" to the hands of the Soviet army.  Just a few months after the tank corps were formed, they went to the front.  Among them were the first, second, third and fourth shopping malls.  These brigades fought against the Nazis with valor and honor! </p><h2>  The composition of the TC in the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  It: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  150 heavy vehicles (60 T-34, 30 KV, 60 T-60); </li><li>  4 120 mm mortar; </li><li>  42 82 mm mortar; </li><li>  20 76.2 mm guns; </li><li>  20 37 mm anti-aircraft guns; </li><li>  539 cars; </li><li>  12 45 mm anti-tank guns. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.newschamps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tanks city" class="if uuid-2666835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2666835.jpg"></div><p>  Later in the tank corps there was a place for such divisions as a guards mortar with missile launchers of the M-13 and M-8 type, a motorcycle battalion with hundreds of vehicles, as well as an reconnaissance battalion, including armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers.  In total, there were approximately 700 souls controlling these machines. </p><h2>  The fate of TC </h2><p>  The formation of tank corps was completed in May 1943.  At that time, 24 corps had already been formed, whose forces were quite enough to stop the fascist invader from moving deeper into the country and to push him away from the borders. </p><p>  After the Great Patriotic War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, all tank corps were divided into divisions, receiving a new acronym TD, and brigades became regiments.  Such changes have occurred in most CIS countries. </p><h2>  Ural Corps, or History of the most famous shopping mall of our country </h2><p>  This TK was formed by the simple Ural workers of the tank-building plant, who issued an article with the screaming title ‚ÄúAnd on top of all plans - the corps!‚Äù.  It expressed the need to produce as many tank and self-propelled vehicles as possible, as may be required for an entire corps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walldevil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="War tanks" class="if uuid-2666828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2666828.jpg"></div><p>  Not only for its courage and strength, this volunteer tank corps became famous, but also for the will to win, the desire to achieve set goals.  It is known that even the top authorities spoke positively of him, and the answer to the provocative article came from the Kremlin.  Stalin himself gave the green light to such an initiative and defined the name ‚Äú30th Ural Volunteer Tank Corps‚Äù, and he was given under the command of Rodin, an experienced tanker who already had experience in managing divisions, as well as the rank of major general. </p><h2>  The first merits of UDTK and its new name </h2><p>  Three months later, for the brave battles and courage shown by the Ural Tank Corps, Joseph Vissarionovich renames it the 10th Guards, and writes out awards for his services to the Soviet Union to all soldiers serving in this corps.  In these battles, our tanks carried out their mission with valor, which helped our soldiers in the following battles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tcservices.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Army of tanks" class="if uuid-2666824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2666824.jpg"></div><p>  After these events, the volunteer corps also participated in the battle for the liberation of Lviv, for which it was again renamed Ural-Lviv, for the courage the soldiers fought for this city, as if for their own.  Immediately after this operation, five soldiers of the Red Army received the title "Hero of the Soviet Union", and almost seven thousand people were assigned to various orders and awards for their courage and honor in the liberation of the city of Lviv. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  On the North African front during World War II, German soldiers had a ‚Äútradition of luck,‚Äù namely, moving equipment through a pile of <span>camel dung.</span>  The Allies, observing this picture, immediately realized what was happening and created mines that disguised themselves as these very heaps, and thereby blew up several tanks.  Our comrades in the fight against the fascist invaders were even more cunning and subsequently made a mine with the appearance of already manure crushed by a caterpillar as if someone had already passed here. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldwarphotos.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tank soldiers" class="if uuid-2666839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2666839.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In 1940, in England, everyone who was in the resistance, or one way or another could have been hit by the German invaders, was given a brochure that described the method of opposition.  ‚ÄúYou need to arm yourself with an ax or a heavy piece of wood and take a place on a hill like a tree or the second floor of a building.  When the tank is close, jump onto it and knock heavily on it.  When the enemy shows his head, throw a grenade inside the car and run as far as possible. ‚Äù </li><li>  When in the USSR there were not enough tanks, and their production was not yet so deployed, ordinary tractors were ordered to be turned into these same tanks.  Yes, that's right.  Sheathed with sheets of armor, with a pipe on the "tower", with flashing lights and sirens, such a "tank" drove into the enemy‚Äôs location at night, scaring and taking to flight.  For this he was nicknamed the ordinary soldiers NI-1, which meant "To Fright." </li><li>  As such, the name "tank" comes from the English word tank, which means "tank" or "tank".  The very first cars sent to the aid of the USSR by the British were disguised as these very tanks of water, because their shape and size made it easy to put them on a train and send them to help the allies.  Our soldiers, having heard the translation of the word tank, began to call the fighting vehicle nothing more than "bucket", but then abandoned this name. </li></ul>
