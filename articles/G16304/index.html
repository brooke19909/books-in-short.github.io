    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In addition, while relaxing in this resort, it is impossible to isolate oneself from history, since Budva is the most ancient city of Montenegro.  The old town is located near the resort.  There is the medieval fortress of St. Mary, houses in the Venetian style, temples and churches built in the Middle Ages.  Among all the old buildings in a special place is a complex of six temples.  Special attention should be paid to the Archaeological Museum, established in 1962.  An interesting <span>attraction of Budva</span> is the Monastery of Podostrog, which often became a place of looting and attack from various warring parties in ancient times.  The spirit of the Middle Ages is in the book kingdom of the city library.  All this is the national treasure of Montenegro, which cannot be ignored while resting there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="danica villa budva" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/784933.jpg" width="389"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Montenegro </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the description of Danica Villa (Budva), it is worth saying that along with the <span>natural beauty of the</span> landscapes, the Budva Riviera attracts tourists with its historical sights.  Rumor has it that during the beach season there are almost 20 Russian tourists per 1 local resident.  At the height of the holiday season in Budva, Russian is more often heard, rather than the local dialect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Montenegro constantly attracts tourists, despite the fact that the hotel infrastructure, their comfort and manner of serving guests leave much to be desired, compared with hotels in Turkey and Egypt.  The streets of the resort are constantly full of people, and life does not stop for a minute at the height of the season.  Rest on the Adriatic is somewhat reminiscent of a vacation in the Crimea both in style and in temperature parameters.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs positive, as it makes related and attractive.  However, a small drawback is the fact that Montenegrin resorts do not have a planned long-term planning of construction and expansion of infrastructure.  A mixture of upscale hotels and simple villas, shops, bars and private houses often spoil the picture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="villa danica montenegro" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/784926.jpg" width="600"></div>
