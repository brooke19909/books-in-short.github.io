Despite the fact that the Podvorye Hotel (Tula) is located in the city center, it is always surprisingly quiet here.  The guests are greeted by friendly staff who are ready to help with the fulfillment of any request. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today it is one of the best options for tourists in the city.

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Even before you enter the city, it is important to book a room where you stay for the night.  If the Podvorye Hotel (Tula) has become your choice, the address will best be noted on the city map so that you can easily navigate.  It is located in close proximity to the Kremlin, the main historical site that all tourists seek to visit.  But how could it be otherwise, because this is an outstanding monument of Russian architecture of the 16th century.  Exact address: Zhukovsky street, 9. </p><p>  The hotel does not have a personal transfer, but, in principle, it is not even needed here.  It is enough to have a map or a navigator on hand.  If none of this exists, then stop any taxi driver and ask where Zhukovsky Street is.  They will tell you how to walk or take the bus.  Minibuses No. 12/15, as well as 16/10, go from the railway station here.  Or you can take the services of bus number 13 and get to the stop "Pirogova street".  Then you have to walk a little.  By the way, do not forget to book a room before your trip.  It is important that you find a place for a small but very popular hotel "Compound" (Tula).  Phone 7 (4872) 38-57-58, the administrator receives calls around the clock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãcenter" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1499401.jpg" width="296"></div>

However, if you choose Compound, you do not have to seek a compromise.  Firstly, it is the center of the city.  Secondly, the hotel offers its guests inexpensive, but very comfortable rooms and friendly service.  What more could you ask for?  The economy category is single or double rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã13 m <sup>2</sup> .  There is nothing superfluous, only one or two single beds, bedside tables and chairs.  The bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet.  The cost of daily rent is from 1700 rubles, while breakfast is not included in it.  But within walking distance there are wonderful restaurants, among which you can choose the most suitable for yourself. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the rooms are also equipped with a small kitchen with stove, kettle and a minimum set of dishes.  Therefore, you can quite do a few days with homemade dishes and save on a restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in tula cheap" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1499400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Standard rooms </h2><p>  Designed for two guests.  This is the best choice that most regular tourists seek to take advantage of.  In general, "Compound" is the best offer in all respects.  It is the center of the city, but the street is so quiet that it creates the complete illusion of a village holiday.  It is very interesting to stroll around in the evening.  The houses on the street are low and most of them are wooden.  But it is worth turning to Sovetskaya, and you are already in the realm of concrete, high-rise buildings and an endless stream of cars. </p><p>  So let's get back to our number.  It is equipped with a double bed, bedside tables, a kitchenette, a fridge and a TV.  The bathroom has the same necessary set, shower, toilet, sink and hairdryer.  The room looks ascetic, but at the same time very modern.  It is spacious, bright, has a large desktop.  And, of course, happy own kitchen.  There is also a wardrobe with hangers, so placing clothes is not difficult.  Rental price from 2200 rubles per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Compound Tula Phone" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1499399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional service </h2><p>  If you need a good <span>hotel in Tula</span> inexpensively, be sure to pay attention to the Compound.  This is a universal option for couples or businessmen.  The only negative that guests note is the lack of a safe in the room.  It is for this reason that many refuse to clean the rooms, worrying about the safety of their belongings during their absence.  But it should be noted that upon check-in, ideal cleanliness always reigns here, so for a few days you can do without outside interference. </p><p>  There is no food at the hotel, but breakfast can be offered for an additional fee.  They will prepare it in one of the nearest cafes and deliver it to your room.  No buffet, just a choice of several dishes: fried eggs, porridge, casserole.  The cost of 200 rubles per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel compound tula reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1499398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Comfort category </h2><p>  This is essentially an improved standard.  Room size is similar, but there are additional options.  In particular, air conditioning and a climate control system are installed, the kitchen has an extractor fan that allows you to cook with great amenities.  In the bathroom you will find a complete set of personal hygiene products, a set of towels and a hairdryer. </p><h2>  For businessmen </h2><p>  If you gather colleagues for negotiations, a seminar or training, then an inexpensive hotel in Tula is simply necessary.  For this purpose, the hotel "Compound" is ideal.  It is located so convenient that you can get from anywhere in the city.  The area is very quiet, nothing will distract you from solving immediate problems. </p><p>  The hotel offers businessmen all the conditions for business meetings.  The cozy conference room is equipped with the latest technology.  A modern air conditioning system will give you comfortable conditions throughout your stay.  Guests are invited to use the demo board, projector and screen, laptops are provided as needed.

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  You cannot compose a complete picture without knowing the opinions of those who have already been here.  What seemed to them the hotel "Compound" (Tula).  The reviews are very good, already on the basis of this I want to recommend it to all the guests of the city.  Among the advantages, the price and location, spacious and modern rooms are especially highlighted.  Ideal for businessmen as a venue for conferences and seminars.  But for ordinary tourists it is also of interest.  If you are interested in history and want to visit the old estate ‚ÄúYasnaya Polyana‚Äù, or just wander around the surroundings, then be sure to pay attention to the ‚ÄúCompound‚Äù.  Whether you want to walk around the city center or go outside it, it does not matter much, everything is nearby. </p><p>  Separately warm reviews are addressed to the administration.  At the entrance you are greeted by polite staff who are ready to help, suggest and escort where necessary.  The hotel itself is new, clean, well maintained and very bright, I want to come back here again and again. </p>
