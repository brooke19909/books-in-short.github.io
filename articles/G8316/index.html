It is possible to devote a lot of time to clarifying this issue, but since the differences between them are too striking, the conclusion is obvious that each of the debaters defends their preferences and tastes. </p><p>  Candolim Beach, located in the village of the same name in the northern region of Goa, attracts those who like a relaxing holiday by the sea, away from noisy discos and nightclubs. </p><h2>  Beaches of North Goa </h2><p>  In this part of the smallest state of India, both the coastline and the infrastructure along it differ from the southern part.  If the last of them is more lively, crowded with tourists and entertainment complexes, then the northern region is characterized by restraint, calmness and lack of crowding. </p><p>  There is a wide coastline, which is divided into three parts: </p><ul><li>  Calangute, the longest part of the coast in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGoa. </li><li>  Candolim, which is only a little less. </li><li>  Sinquerim is the farthest part of the coast. </li></ul>

    <p>  As North Goa lovers who have visited all three beaches, Candolim is considered the cleanest, most beautiful and most expensive.  Mostly wealthy Germans and British prefer to relax here (sometimes Indians are found), since the quality of hotels, services and entertainment here corresponds to the most demanding taste.  On average, prices on Candolim Beach are 30% higher than in other Goa resorts, but a quality vacation is worth it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advantages of Candolim Beach </h2><p>  This part of the coast of North Goa is characterized by unusually white and clean sand.  A significant role in this is played by the absence of stray dogs and cows, who enjoy spending time with tourists on the rest of the resort's beaches. </p><p>  If we summarize the reviews of travelers who have been here, we can distinguish the following advantages of Candolim beach: </p><ul><li>  Here, even at the height of the season, there are not many people and you can always find a free sunbed under an umbrella. </li><li>  The availability of hotels directly on the coastline, which in the rest of Goa is very rare. </li><li>  Numerous necks serving delicious seafood and freshly squeezed juices allow you not to leave the beach all day and not starve to death. </li><li>  The lack of annoying locals who in other resorts of Goa either pester to buy something from them, or come to photograph tourists. </li><li>  Immediately after a strip of sand, gardens begin to fill with flowers of incredible beauty and exotic trees. </li></ul>

    <p>  We should also mention the level of service, which is consistently high both in two-star hotels, local bars and shops, and in five-star apartments. </p><p>  It is important to know: Candolim Beach (Goa) is equally suitable for couples with children, and lovers of outdoor activities.  Water sports are especially well developed here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  1-2 star beach hotels </h2><p>  As a rule, travelers are extremely demanding when choosing a hotel, as it is a comfortable sleep, good food and a homely atmosphere that create the desire to return to these places more than once. </p><p>  The hotels of Candolim Beach (Goa) are divided into those located just 30-50 meters from the coast, and those located a little further.  Among the available options (over 250), experienced travelers find the best, using as a hint the assessment of those who have already been there.  It is the reviews of vacationers, and not advertising, that are today the ‚Äútourism engine‚Äù.  If we take into account a private assessment, then among this choice we can distinguish several options from one to five stars.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Resort Coqueiral is one of the most economical holiday options on Candolim Beach.  Having only 1 star does not make accommodation or service in this hotel worse than in others.  For example, his guests gave him a rating of 9 out of 10, which indicates the quality of service.  Delicious breakfasts and perfect cleaning of all 16 rooms are especially excellent at this place.  For those who are interested in saving, but at the same time comfortable rest, albeit without a pool, but with a garden, this hotel is very suitable. </li><li>  Among the two-star hotels Sodder's Libton Manor Hotel Candolim with a rating of 8/10 stands out for its convenient location, because around it there is such an accumulation of various cafes, bars and restaurants that the most demanding foodie will be satisfied.  The hotel has only 14 rooms, but, like throughout North Goa, it has excellent service.  Very popular with couples. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Experienced tourists usually avoid hotels of such low categories, but since the quality of service is equally good everywhere in Goa, this Indian state can be considered an exception.  For middle-income people who have spent a lot of money on a ticket and a flight, this is the option of living that helps to know the beauty of Goa.  The cost of a room in economy-class hotels ranges from 890 to 1800 rubles / night. </p><h2>  3-5 star beach hotels </h2><p>  Goa may surprise, therefore, as travelers say, not the number of stars determines the level of service and quality of relaxation, but the attitude of the local population towards their guests.  Among hotels from 3 to 5 stars, the highest rating was given to the following establishments: </p><ul><li>  <span>Hotel Santana Beach Resort</span> *** offers its guests 2 swimming pools, a restaurant with delicious cuisine and an ocean just 30 meters from the resort.  It consists of two-story bungalows buried in verdure, and in his neck, located right on the shore, you can not only eat and drink with pleasure, but also rent sun loungers and umbrellas.  According to the hotel‚Äôs clients, who rated it 9 out of 10, the level of accommodation here is not much different from the service in five-star hotels in South Goa. </li><li>  Among the 4 stars, a rating of 9.7 belongs to Bougainvillea Guest House, which has a garden for relaxation and a terrace for sunbathing.  Hotel guests note that the large clean rooms and amazingly delicious food in his restaurant make your stay unforgettable. </li><li>  Oddly enough, the highest rating among five-star hotels (8.8) belongs to Vivanta by Taj, although here there is only a swimming pool, a golf course and a SPA center.  Apparently, the cost of rooms, with an equally high level of service for hotels all along the coast, is much higher here.  A distinctive feature of this place is the exquisite cuisine, which no gourmet can resist. </li></ul>

    <p>  This is approximately what all the hotels on Candolim Beach look like.  They are characterized by a homely atmosphere, incredible cleanliness and friendly staff.  Such a pleasure will cost a room from 2500 to 9000 rubles / night. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Restaurants - necks - this is the real legend of Candolim resort.  Each of them has its own menu, and for those who lack local delicacies, they can go to Vagator, where the most famous tavern of the state is located - "Thalassa".  It belongs to the Greek, who himself knows a lot about food, and allows others to enjoy the work of their cooks.  For the sake of lunch or dinner in this tavern, tourists are queued up for the week, as the local population also loves its cuisine. </p>

In addition to delicious seafood dishes that are caught in the ocean daily, the institution provides customers with sun loungers and umbrellas, so that you can combine the taste of taste with sunbathing. </p><p>  Although the restaurants and cafes of Candolim are dominated by local ‚Äúsea‚Äù cuisine, they serve popular European and Japanese dishes, so everyone will find their own food to their taste. </p><h2>  Entertainment and shopping </h2><p>  The resort state of Goa is so compact that you can get to the main attractions from any hotel quickly and comfortably.

    <p>  Even those who are indifferent to birds do not refuse to ride a canoe through the mangrove swamps and watch the birds, of which there are more than 400 species. </p><h2>  Goa forever </h2><p>  Although vacationing on the north coast of Goa is more expensive than on the south, there are pleasant little things here that help save money.  For example, all the beaches in the state are state-owned, but the sun loungers and umbrellas are private, so there is a rule on its northern side that a client who has bought at least a bottle of water from their owner gets the right to a free rental. </p><p>  You can also save money in local restaurants, where the portions are so large that you can take one for two.  This is the whole beach of Candolim (India, Goa).  Reviews of him say that more and more travelers are taking a one-way ticket here. </p>
