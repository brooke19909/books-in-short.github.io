The distance to the airport is about fifty kilometers.  By car to the island's capital - Phuket Town - drive about half an hour.  For those who love these places, this hotel is a great base for exploring the beautiful surroundings.  As for the price for it, it significantly covers some of the inconveniences inherent in Thai "treshki" - in particular, the fact that this hotel is on a rock, and you have to go uphill from the beach.  If you want to relax with great comfort, then you can consider a hotel of a similar category - Beach Boutique House.  Although this is also a "treshka", but it stands right on the beach, literally a few steps from the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kata beach sp house 3" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Tourists believe that the place where the hotel is located is very good.  You can walk from ten to fifteen minutes to both famous Phuket beaches.  The hotel stands on a hill with a beautiful view.  Right next to the hotel there is an inexpensive grocery store.  And a little further away - shops, cafes and currency exchange literally at every step.  Not far from the Kata Beach SP House is the famous ‚ÄúDino Park‚Äù - a mini-golf course built in the style of ‚ÄúJurassic‚Äù.  Visitors see caves, models of dinosaurs, their bones and skeletons of other minerals.  In walking distance from the hotel is located "Duke Sports Bar", where you can not only have a drink and a snack, but also watch the broadcast of a football match.  And near Karon Beach, literally a ten-minute walk from the hotel, there is a good indoor market where you can buy souvenirs, clothes, and groceries.  Shopping and entertainment complex "Dzhangeseylon", where there are cinemas, spas, boutiques and many restaurants - a ten-minute drive from the hotel.  You can rent a scooter right at the entrance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kata beach sp house" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735089.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the place of rest </h2><p>  As a rule, people fly here by plane.  <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport</span> is located at the northernmost tip of the island.  Both regular flights from Bangkok and charter flights from Russia (in season, from Moscow, Vladivostok and so on) arrive there.  Then, if the hotel does not provide its transfer, you need to look for a minibus to your resort.  The price usually depends on the moving distance.  However, as well as the time during which you get to the place.  For example, Kata Beach, where the hotel is located, is one of the most remote areas from the airport of Phuket.  Therefore, you need to drive about an hour to Kata Beach SP House 3 by car.  And on a bus or minibus this path can take twice as long.  Especially if tourists are transported to different hotels.  If you are coming from Bangkok by bus, then get ready to spend at least twelve hours in it.  Public transport arrives in the local capital or in Patong.  Therefore, you still have to spend money and time to get to the hotel itself. </p><h2>  Phuket, Kata Beach, Karon </h2><p>  This island is considered the most interesting and diverse resort in Thailand.  Families with children, go-go show lovers, and those who want to enjoy the exotic, ancient temples and amazing nature come here.  Since the island is very large, everyone will find a corner to their liking - both supporters of solitude and relaxation, and those who cannot imagine their life without civilization, nightclubs and discos.  For example, the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKata Beach, where this hotel is located, is just right for a relaxing holiday.  At the same time, it has good infrastructure - there are many shops and restaurants.  The beach itself is divided into two parts.  The most equipped and filled with tourists is called "Kata-yay."  It is good for families with children.  It is safe here, good entry into the water.  There are many shops near the beach, and once a week there is a market where local residents shop.  It is here that you can buy good fish and seafood for almost nothing.  "Kata-noi" is a quiet secluded bay.  There are few people there, and the impression of a deserted island is created.  Tourists claim that the beach itself is much cleaner and better.  If you came here in the rainy season, do not despair - the time is right for surf lovers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kata beach sp house 3 phuket kata" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735092.jpg" width="333"></div>  Hotels in Kata Beach are different - from the category "5" to "3".  Kata Beach House - one of these "three rubles", which are located on the border of two districts.  It is convenient to walk from it to Kata Beach, and to Karon - the neighboring beach.  This is a more comfortable place, which is located a little north.  The beach itself is three kilometers long, the <span>sand is white</span> and crisp like starch.  There are many shops, bars, restaurants and an entertainment center.
