However, the history of the world's largest state began with the February Revolution, or more precisely, with the crisis of tsarist Russia.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, oppositional moods have roamed in the country, which now and then spilled over into bloodshed. </p><p>  The words spoken by Pushkin in the thirties of the 19th century were applicable in the past, and do not lose relevance today.  Russian rebellion is always merciless.  Especially when it leads to the overthrow of the old regime.  Recall the most important and tragic events that took place over the years of the existence of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  In 1916, the imperial family was discredited by scandals surrounding an odious personality, the mystery of which has not yet been fully solved.  It's about Gregory Rasputin.  Nicholas II made several mistakes, the first - in the year of his coronation.  But we will not talk about this today, but recall the events that preceded the creation of the Soviet state. </p><p>  So, the First World War is in full swing.  There are rumors in St. Petersburg.  Rumor has it that the empress divorces her husband, goes to the monastery, occasionally engages in espionage.  An opposition is forming to the Russian Tsar.  Its participants, among whom were the closest relatives of the tsar, demanded the removal of Rasputin from government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  While the princes were arguing with the king, a revolution was preparing, which was to change the course of world history.  Armed rallies continued for several February days.  Ended in a coup.  A Provisional Government was formed, which did not last long. </p><p>  Then came the October Revolution, the Civil War.  Historians divide the years of the existence of the USSR into several periods.  During the first, which lasted until 1953, a former revolutionary was known in power, known in narrow circles under the nickname Koba. </p><h2>  Stalin years (1922-1941) </h2><p>  By the end of 1922, six political figures were in power: Stalin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Rykov, Kamenev, Tomsky.  But one person must govern the state.  Between the former revolutionaries, a struggle began. </p><p>  Neither Kamenev, nor Zinoviev, nor Tomsky felt sympathy for Trotsky.  Especially did not like the People's Commissar for Military Affairs Stalin.  Dzhugashvili had a negative attitude towards him since the days of the Civil War.  They say he did not like the education, erudition of <span>Leon Trotsky,</span> who used to read French classics in the original at political meetings.  But this, of course, is not the point.  In the political struggle there is no place for simple human sympathies and antipathies.  The battle between the revolutionaries ended in the victory of Stalin.  In subsequent years, he methodically eliminated his other associates. </p><p>  The Stalin years were marked by repression.  First there was forced collectivization, then arrests.  How many people turned into camp dust during this terrible time, how many were shot?  Hundreds of thousands of people.  The peak of the Stalinist repressions occurred in 1937-1938. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Over the years of the existence of the USSR, there were many tragic events.  In 1941, the war began, which claimed about 25 million lives.  These losses are incomparable.  Before Yuri Levitan announced on radio the attack of the German armed forces on the <span>Soviet Union,</span> no one believed that there was a ruler in the world who was not afraid to direct his aggression towards the USSR. </p><p>  WWII historians are divided into three periods.  The first begins on June 22, 1941 and ends with the battle for Moscow, in which the Germans were defeated.  The second ends with the Battle of Stalingrad.  The third period is the expulsion of enemy troops outside the USSR, the liberation from the occupation of European countries and the surrender of Germany. </p><h2>  Stalinism (1945-1953) </h2><p>  <span>The Soviet Union</span> was not ready for war.  When it began, it turned out that many military leaders were shot, and those who are alive are far away, in the camps.  They were immediately released, brought to normal condition and sent to the front.  The war is over.  Several years passed, and a new wave of repression began, now among the top command staff. </p><p>  Large military commanders close to Marshal Zhukov were arrested.  Among them, Lieutenant General Telegin and Air Marshal Novikov.  Zhukov himself was a little oppressed, but not particularly touched.  His authority was too great.  For the victims of the last wave of repression, for those who survived in the camps, <span>March 5, 1953</span> was the happiest day.  The ‚Äúleader‚Äù died, and with it went into the history of the camp for political prisoners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Thaw </h2><p>  In 1956, Khrushchev debunked the personality cult of Stalin.  At the top of the party he was supported.  Indeed, over the years, even the most prominent political figure could have fallen into disgrace at any time, which means that he could be shot or sent to a camp.  During the existence of the USSR, the thaw years were marked by a softening of the totalitarian regime.  People went to bed and did not fear that in the middle of the night state security officers would pick them up and take them to Lubyanka, where they would have to confess to espionage, an attempt to kill Stalin and other fictitious crimes.  But denunciations, provocations still took place. </p>

    <p>  During the thaw years, the word "Chekist" had a pronounced negative connotation.  In fact, distrust of the special services arose much earlier, back in the thirties.  But the term ‚ÄúChekist‚Äù lost official approval after a report made by Khrushchev in 1956. </p><h2>  Age of Stagnation </h2><p>  <span>The period of stagnation</span> is not a historical term, but a propaganda-literary cliche.  It appeared after Gorbachev‚Äôs speech, in which he noted the occurrence of stagnation in the economy and social life.  The era of stagnation conditionally begins with Brezhnev coming to power and ends with the beginning of perestroika.  One of the main problems of this period was the increase in the commodity deficit.  In the world of culture, censorship rules.  During the years of stagnation, the first terrorist acts occurred in the USSR.  During this period, there were several high-profile cases of hijacking passenger aircraft. </p>

    <h2>  Afghan war </h2><p>  In 1979, the war began, which lasted ten years.  Over the years, more than thirteen thousand Soviet soldiers died.  But these data were released only in 1989.  The biggest losses occurred in 1984.  Against the Afghan war, Soviet dissidents actively opposed.  Andrei Sakharov was sent into exile for his pacifist speeches.  The burial of zinc coffins was a secret affair.  At least until 1987.  It was impossible to indicate on the grave of a soldier that he had died in Afghanistan.  The official end date of the war is February 15, 1989. </p>

    <h2>  The last years of the existence of the USSR (1985-1991) </h2><p>  This period in the history of the Soviet Union is called perestroika.  The last years of the existence of the USSR (1985-1991) can be briefly described as follows: a sharp change in ideology, political and economic life. </p><p>  In May 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had held the post of General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee by that time for just over two months, uttered a significant phrase: "It‚Äôs time for all of us, comrades, to restructure."  Hence the term.  The media actively talked about perestroika, a dangerous desire for change arose in the minds of ordinary citizens.  The last years of the existence of the USSR, historians are divided into four stages: </p><ol><li>  1985-1987.  The beginning of economic system reform. </li><li>  1987-1989.  An attempt to rebuild the system in the spirit of socialism. </li><li>  1989-1991.  Destabilization of the situation in the country. </li><li>  September-December 1991.  The end of perestroika, the collapse of the USSR. </li></ol><p>  The enumeration of the events that took place from 1989 to 1991 will be a chronicle of the collapse of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Accelerating socio-economic development </h2><p>  Gorbachev announced the need to reform the system at a plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU in April 1985.  This meant the active use of the achievements of scientific and technological progress, a change in the planning procedure.  Democratization, publicity and the socialist market have not yet been discussed.  Although today the term "perestroika" is associated with freedom of speech, which was first discussed a few years before the Soviet Union ceased to exist. </p><p>  The years of Gorbachev's rule, especially at the first stage, were marked by the hopes of Soviet citizens for changes, for the long-awaited changes for the better.  However, gradually, the inhabitants of a huge country began to become disillusioned with a politician who was destined to become the last secretary general.  The anti-alcohol campaign caused particular criticism. </p>

    <h2>  No alcohol law </h2><p>  History shows that attempts to wean citizens of our country from drinking alcohol do not bear any fruit.  The first anti-alcohol campaign was carried out by the Bolsheviks back in 1917.  A second attempt was made eight years later.  They tried to fight alcoholism and alcoholism in the early seventies, and in a very peculiar way: they banned the production of alcoholic beverages, but expanded the production of wines. </p><p>  The alcohol campaign of the eighties was called "Gorbachev," although Ligachev and Solomentsev became the initiators.  This time the authorities decided the issue of drunkenness more radically.  The production of alcoholic beverages was significantly reduced, a huge number of shops were closed, and vodka prices rose more than once.  But Soviet citizens did not give up so easily.  Some bought alcohol at an inflated price.  Others were preparing drinks according to dubious recipes (V. Erofeev spoke about such a method of combating the prohibition in his book ‚ÄúMoscow - Petushki‚Äù), while others used the simplest way, that is, they drank cologne, which could be purchased in any department store. </p><p>  Gorbachev's popularity, meanwhile, fell.  Not only due to the ban on alcoholic beverages.  He was verbose, while his speeches were insignificant.  At each official meeting, he appeared with his wife, who caused particular irritation to the Soviet people.  Finally, perestroika did not bring long-awaited changes to the life of Soviet citizens. </p><h2>  Democratic socialism </h2><p>  By the end of 1986, Gorbachev and his assistants realized that the situation in the country could not be changed so easily.  And they decided to reform the system in another direction, namely in the spirit of democratic socialism.  This decision was facilitated by a blow to the economy caused by many factors, including the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  And in some regions of the Soviet Union, meanwhile, separatist sentiments began to appear, ethnic clashes erupted. </p><h2>  Destabilization in the country </h2><p>  In what year did the USSR end?  In 1991  At the final stage of "perestroika," a sharp destabilization of the situation was observed.  Economic difficulties escalated into a large-scale crisis.  There was a catastrophic collapse in the standard of living of Soviet citizens.  They learned what unemployment is.  The shelves in the stores were empty, if something suddenly appeared on them, endless lines instantly formed.  The masses grew irritation, dissatisfaction with power. </p>

    <h2>  The collapse of the USSR </h2><p>  In what year the Soviet Union ceased to exist, we figured it out.  The official date is December 26, 1991.  On this day, Mikhail Gorbachev announced that he was ceasing his activities as president.  With the collapse of the huge state, the 15 former republics of the USSR gained independence.  The reasons that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union are many.  This is an economic crisis, and the degradation of power elites, and national conflicts, and even an anti-alcohol campaign. </p><p>  To summarize.  The above are the main events that took place during the existence of the USSR.  From what year has this state been present on the world map?  From 1922 to 1991.  The collapse of the USSR by the population was perceived differently.  Someone was happy about the abolition of censorship, the opportunity to engage in entrepreneurial activity.  Someone events that occurred in 1991, shocked.  After all, it was a tragic collapse of ideals on which more than one generation has grown. </p>
