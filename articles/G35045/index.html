    <h2>  Abkhazia  Pitsunda </h2><p>  The city of Pitsunda was founded in the distant VI century BC by merchants from the ancient Greek Miletus.  Pitius - the city was named after relict pines, which grow only in the Colchis Valley (in this area).  In the 1st century, Christianity reigned in Abkhazia, and Pitsunda was the center from where the teachings of Christ spread throughout the Caucasus.  The <span>Pitsunda Church of the</span> Assumption of the Mother of God of the X-XI century is still preserved, it is still operating, it receives hundreds of pilgrims and tourists.  It hosts services, concerts of organ music. </p><p>  In the last century, in the 60s, the Soviet government decided to equip a resort area in Pitsunda.  The purpose of its existence is not only treatment, sanatorium and resort services, but also just the relaxation of Soviet citizens on the sea coast.  The city has been built many hotels, chic restaurants, equipped beaches on the sea coast.  In the Soviet Union, the resorts of Abkhazia were considered the most prestigious and in demand.  Today, in Pitsunda, the doors of hotels and resorts for vacationers are also open.  The Cypress Alley, where cozy private hotels are located, is waiting for its guests.  Everyone who rested in local cottages responds with warmth and love about the days spent here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The air in Pitsunda is really magical, it is filled with the smells of tar and pine needles.  Relict pine forests cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äã200 hectares, which ensures a clean supply of oxygen all year round. </p><h2>  Resort Climate </h2>

    <p>  The climate in the resort of Pitsunda is subtropical.  There is no cold winter here.  The average winter temperature is 3-5 degrees above zero.  Spring and autumn are warm enough: 15-20 degrees.  Summer is hot - 27-35 degrees above zero.  Precipitation most often occurs in winter (rain).  Year-round warm and mild climate allows you to constantly bloom and bear fruit to various plants.  So already in February-March, mimosa blooms, and on New Year's Eve everyone is waiting for Abkhazian sweet tangerines, which no overseas fruit can compare with. </p><p>  You can relax in Pitsunda all year round.  Those who gather here should take into account that the rainiest month is January, and August is the hottest.  Humidity reaches an average of 85 percent.  Despite all these factors, high in the mountains of the Caucasus there are glaciers that never melt.  Vacationers leave wonderful photos under palm trees where snow-capped peaks can be seen in the background. </p><h2>  Cottages on the Cypress Alley </h2>
