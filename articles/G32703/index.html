Some wonders of technology will seem incredible to children and adults.  The main thing is to know what to give preference to. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is recommended to start acquaintance of children with different gadgets closer to school.  At this age, the kids already have good coordination and understand what they are dealing with.  Nevertheless, it is better to introduce most of the devices in grades 1-2.  Many gadgets are addictive.  This fact must be taken into account. </p><p>  In any case, the bulk of these devices are not dangerous for children.  Rather, useful for parents.  These few devices will surely please both parents and children! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tablet for baby </h2><p>  The leader in the list of vehicles is the tablet.  Such gadgets for children and adults have become almost an integral part of life.  As already mentioned, such devices can cause addiction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gadgets for children 10 years old" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1617949.jpg"></div>

    <p>  However, tablets / laptops / computers for children have their advantages.  Dosed communication with a child with such devices is beneficial.  For starters, you can buy a children's <span>tablet or laptop.</span>  These gadgets are created specifically for kids and are intended for learning. </p><p>  An ‚Äúadult‚Äù tablet, while restricting a child‚Äôs use of it, can serve as a good repository of cartoons, textbooks, music, fairy tales and other useful information.  It‚Äôs not necessary to buy an expensive gadget.  You can do with a simple model.  It is recommended to give preference to tablets with high moisture resistance and impact resistance. </p><h2>  Mobile phone </h2><p>  What other gadgets are there?  For children of 7 years, you can purchase a special <span>"children's" mobile phone.</span>  It is slightly different from the "adult" counterpart.  The main function of such a device is to provide communication between the child and parents.  Often, ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù mobiles have only a few buttons on the screen that allow you to add new contacts and make calls.  No extra games and Internet access.  Such a phone will not interfere with your studies! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gadgets for children 7 years old" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1617950.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For older children, you can buy a regular smartphone.  It will allow not only to stay in touch, but also to keep up to date, taking advantage of numerous opportunities.  As a rule, smartphones are a good gift for a teenager.  Especially if you know in advance which model the child wants. </p><h2>  Books and readers </h2><p>  There are a variety of gadgets for children 5 years and older.  Usually at this age, children already begin to communicate with "adult" devices.  For example, e-books and so-called readers are in demand. </p><p>  The first type of gadget is ideal for a student of any age.  After all, the electronic book completely replaces the paper counterpart.  On such a device, you can store many textbooks, manuals and stories.  Such a thing will definitely come in handy for a schoolchild.  You can choose a model that can connect to the Internet, allows you to watch videos, photos and listen to music. </p><p>  Readers are an irreplaceable thing for parents whose children cannot read.  Accordingly, such a gadget is often of interest to preschool kids.  The reader works like a voice recorder: first, parents record fairy tales, songs and other information, then the reader plays it.  So the child will be able to hear the voice of loved ones when they are actually not nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gadgets for children 5 years" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1617952.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Watches and bracelets </h2><p>  And what are the gadgets for children 12 years old?  You can pick up a gift from the devices already listed.  But parents of teenagers will certainly be interested in ‚Äúsmart‚Äù watches and bracelets.  These are <span>fashionable devices that</span> can serve both mothers and fathers and children. </p><p>  Smart bracelets and watches are either decoration or a tool that tells the current time.  At the same time, a GPS locator is integrated in such devices.  With it, parents can instantly determine where their child is. </p><p>  Often, these gadgets can not only show the location of a person, but also make calls to pre-stored numbers.  For example, calling mom or dad is now easy! </p><h2>  Smart Remote </h2><p>  The following device will be useful to parents whose children are constantly sitting on the TV.  You can protect such entertainment from switching to "adult" channels using the "smart" remote control. </p><p>  Unlike a conventional channel changer, the gadget is smaller.  It is brighter, the buttons on it allow you to switch only to the channels allowed by the parents.  This is a great <span>gift for kids,</span> but not for teens.  Now parental controls can be made easier! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gadgets for children 12 years old gift" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1617951.jpg"></div>
