It can be a pirate ship or a huge sailboat with several masts.  By the way, such a gift is not considered exclusively male, because each girl will be pleased to receive fabulous red sails.  In addition, the ship is a symbol of wealth and prosperity, hope for a brighter future and good luck in all endeavors.  According to the Feng Shui theory, such a gift will bring financial stability to the house, freedom and constant movement forward.  The same doctrine says that if a ship is given a name, for example, "Dream", "Luck" or "Freedom", then the desires that lurk in them will soon come true.  Therefore, it would be good to make a place for a plate in the craft where you can write the name.  As an idea for a man‚Äôs gift, a bottle of cognac can be included in the composition along with sweets; in addition, alcoholic drinks in bottles of the most intricate shapes, for example, in the form of a barrel or a ball, are now available.  Such figures on the ship will look very harmonious. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  So how to make a ship out of sweets?  When the model is already selected, you need to select the appropriate materials.  A small wicker basket of oval or rectangular shape or a piece of foam, from which the base of the vessel is cut, is ideal for the frame.  You will also need packing cellophane, swords and toothpicks, a hot glue gun and sweets.  Further, to make the <span>ship out of sweets,</span> step-by-step instructions will be very helpful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Step One: The Base for the Ship </h2><p>  The hull of the ship of the corresponding form is cut out of the foam.  If the material is thin, then you need to make several layers and connect them with glue to obtain the required height.  First draw a rectangle, and then a triangle from one edge, and in this way get a body that should have a pointed nose and rounded corners of the stern.  Outlining the first finished workpiece with a felt-tip pen, the remaining layers are outlined and cut out.  The latter should have recesses inside, because it will serve as sides.  Having folded the details, they cut off all the irregularities and bulges at the joints, thus forming ideal edges.  At this stage they are not glued, this process will be a little later.  Next, proceed to decorating crafts, where, in fact, the composition of sweets begins to emerge.  For this, the ship is wrapped with paper and sweets are attached to it, but everything is in order. </p><h2>  Step two: decorate the basics </h2><p>  At this stage, you will need corrugated paper to decorate the ship's hull.  To glue it carefully, you need to alternately wrap the base, dividing all the layers into two parts.  The side is also wrapped with paper and glued all the details.  The bottom is glued to the bottom, velvet cardboard or leatherette is ideal for it.  The work will look interesting if you combine a lot of different textures in it, but you need to make sure that they all look harmonious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy composition ship" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/372899.jpg?1397316246378"></div>

    <h2>  Step Three: Attaching Chocolates </h2><p>  Then they proceed to decorate the hull with sweets, because this is a ship made of sweets!  A master class in this matter is completely unnecessary, because it‚Äôs not tricky to guess how to use a hot glue gun.  And what kind of sweets to take and how to decorate the product with them is a matter of taste and imagination.  For example, you can stick candy on the sides of the vessel, in the form of boats or <span>lifebuoys.</span>  Or completely lay out the sides of the ship with chocolate coins.  If you plan to add a bottle to the composition, then it must be properly fixed before filling the space with sweets. </p>

    <h2>  Step Four: Masts and Sails </h2><p>  The next stage of work is the construction of the <span>mast of the ship.</span>  They are made of large culinary skewers that are stuck into the body, leaving the necessary height.  As sails, you can use packaging cellophane for flowers.  More complex sailing compositions are sewn from organza, framing the slices with an <span>oblique edging,</span> separating each wave with a toothpick inserted and masked into the seams.  These waves are fixed with hot glue.  At the top of each mast, it is imperative to attach flags and pull a rope through them from bow to stern, as in real ships. </p>

    <h2>  General tips on <span>how to make a ship</span> out of sweets </h2><p>  The step-by-step instruction described above gives only a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow such compositions are made, and by fantasizing and experimenting, you can practically create works of art.  Of course, ships with three masts look charming, but the crafts can be simplified by making a small sailboat.  It is also worth noting that before you begin to work, you need to carefully consider the entire color scheme of the composition, so that a harmonious-looking ship of sweets comes out.  The master class given in this article contains a point where the body parts are wrapped with corrugated paper, but it is not necessary to use this material.  For decor, fabric or foil is suitable.  Alternatively, the housing can simply be painted over with spray paint.  The manufacturing sequence may also be disrupted.  First, you can completely glue the ship, then paint it over or decorate and glue the sweets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy ship" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/372864.jpg?1397316696699" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the composition you can use all kinds of figures of men, this will add charm to the product.  In general, to make a ship out of sweets, a master class or some other description of the work process is not necessary at all.  It is enough to know the basics of technology, turn on imagination and get to work.  The main point in such a composition is the right choice of sweets, and for a beautiful ship it is important not to have sweets, but their wrapper.  So, for example, for a pirate ship, you need to give preference to black color, and for an ordinary sailing ship you can choose any color, but again not with colorful wrappers, but with one dominant hue. </p><p>  In conclusion, we can say that the process of creating such a gift is very fascinating, and the result brings a lot of positive emotions, in addition, since childhood, everyone knows that the best gift is a handmade gift. </p>
