How to shoot a flower in macro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A close-up is a kind of shooting that seems pretty simple to execute.  But, as in other methods of photography, it has its own subtleties and nuances.  To become a professional, as in any business, a great skill is needed.  Therefore, in this article you will learn the basics of macro photography. </p><h2>  Equipment analysis </h2><p>  It is not necessary to have expensive professional equipment in order to create stunning pictures.  What is written on various sites is often not quite true.  Even a beginner with the simplest ‚ÄúSLR‚Äù can take off any flower in macro.  But there is a thing that everyone who decided to engage in macro photography must definitely have - a tripod.  You may not have lighting or other equipment, but a tripod is something that should be required.  It allows you to reduce the shaking transmitted from the hands of the camera and make the picture more clear and detailed. </p><p>  If we talk about lenses, then in the best hands for macro the simplest ‚Äúwhale‚Äù lenses will do.  Most often it is 18-55mm f4.5‚Äì5.6, for macro tasks they fit quite well.  Here is a macro shot of a flower on a Canon whale lens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scopia on clover" class="if uuid-2805746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/2805746.jpg"></div><h2>  Let's move on to practice </h2><p>  So, as you understand, in this article we will focus on standard lenses that come with the ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù and how to make good macro photos.  Naturally, photographing is recommended in manual modes or aperture priority modes.  In order for the photo to come out as sharp and clear as possible, it is necessary to apply less light to the matrix, so that the photo of the flowers in the macro is worked out and detailed, that is, it is necessary to cover the aperture in values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 4.5 to 11 depending on the shooting conditions. </p><p>  But do not forget that because of the closed diaphragm, less light began to flow into the matrix, so you need to increase its supply artificially.  There are two ways to do this: by increasing the shutter speed or by raising the ISO.  Most preferred is the first method, since noises appear with an increase in photosensitivity.  Do not forget that if the subject of your shooting is a stationary object, then you can use a shutter speed of about 1/50, and if it is a moving flower or an insect, then the shutter speed is already set at 1/500 and higher.  That, in principle, and the whole theory that you need to know, it remains only to stock up on time and patience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Blade of grass in the sand" class="if uuid-2805786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/2805786.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, macro photography is a great way to create stunning and bewitching shots showing the diversity of our nature.  It develops a sense of frame in you, since emphasis should be placed on a flower, butterfly or snowflake.  The frame should not overload unnecessary details, it should be concise and simple.  Experiment and practice, and macro will become your favorite style. </p>
