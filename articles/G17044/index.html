    <h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  Before considering individual hotel complexes, a few words should be said regarding the resort infrastructure.  Costa Brava is not only a relaxing holiday on the shores of the azure sea.  It is also the richest architectural monuments, a lot of historical attractions, various theaters, museums.  The infrastructure of outdoor activities and entertainment is also quite well developed, which is the main reason why youth companies come here.  Water sports, boat trips on yachts, <span>mountain bikes,</span> water parks, night clubs, bars, restaurants - these places will definitely appeal to people who cannot sit still.  In general, as you can see, the Costa Brava is a vacation for everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Platja Park 4 * is a fully equipped resort hotel with all amenities, which is located in a favorable quiet area just a few steps from the coast of the clear sea.  Also quite close to the hotel is the lively center of the tourist capital.  The hotel is located in Platja d'Aro - the very center of the Costa Brava.
