Solar System Exploration</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the millennia, at all times of the existence of civilization, many discoveries have often been mistaken for folly and ignorance.  However, then most of the ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù hypotheses were clearly confirmed and, after some time, were accepted by society and the scientific world. </p><h2>  Science and pseudoscience ... Where is the truth? </h2><p>  The nature of any discovery lies in the fact that this is a different knowledge, different from the generally accepted understanding.  History remembers such discoveries.  An example is Einstein's theory of relativity.  This hypothesis cast doubt on the fact that time and space are constant values.  A modern example is the agreement of official physics with the possibility of time travel.  Although a little less than thirty years ago, any scientist who tried to state this openly ridiculed or was considered incompetent. </p><h2>  The battle continues </h2><p>  Progress and our level of technical comfort arose on the battlefield of scientific conservatism and new "inadequate" knowledge.  The most difficult thing was for scientists during the existence of the Soviet Union.  Understanding a scientific idea and a patterned approach eradicated dissent.  As in any imperfect system, this approach had positive aspects - the cultivation of the existing understanding and the eradication of "wrong" points of view. </p><h2>  Great minds of Russia </h2><p>  During this period, a scientist lived and worked, who more broadly understood science and its imperfection - Kirill Butusov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyril Butus" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1611832.jpg" width="600"></div>  Astrophysicist, theoretical scientist put forward more than a dozen hypotheses about the <span>structure of the solar system.</span>  On his account more than a hundred published scientific papers.  After some time, most of the discoveries of the scientist were confirmed by astrophysicists of various countries.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How did the hypothesis arise that there is a "twin" of the Earth - the planet Gloria? </h2><p>  Thousands of years ago, in the annals of various peoples, information appears about the existence of a certain copy of the Earth.  In the Middle Ages in 1666 and 1672, the Paris Observatory reported a discovered crescent-shaped object in the Venus region.  At that time, astronomers suggested that it was a <span>satellite of Venus.</span>  However, as it turned out later, this planet has no satellites. <br>  The object appeared in the nineteenth century, but there is no reliable information and report on this event.  The reason for the appearance of Gloria due to the Sun, experts consider the action of strong magnetic storms in the period of the seventeenth century. </p><h2>  Gloria - myth or reality? </h2><p>  Based on his calculations of the motion of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and Mars, astrophysicist Kirill Butusov determined that there is another cosmic body in the solar system.  The orbits of the planets under the influence of mutual gravity coincide with the existing position only in the presence of an "invisible" planet. </p><p>  Observing the quirks of Venus, astronomers could not find out why the periodic acceleration of the body and deceleration occur.  This object must be affected by a different, unaccounted <span>gravitational force.</span>  After calculating the motion of the planets, taking into account their gravitational forces, it turned out that there should be another object in Earth‚Äôs orbit, similar in size to our planet. </p><h2>  Is the Earth's ‚Äútwin‚Äù populated by sentient beings? </h2><p>  The planet Gloria is located in an area where the existence of organic life is possible.  According to the scientist, a copy of the Earth can be intelligent life.  Her age is likely to be close to 4.5 billion years.  During this period, intelligent life could reach a more advanced level than ours.  Another development path could lead to death as a result of warrior and conflict.  It may well be that this planet is devoid of atmosphere and deserted. </p><p>  Satellites launched to study planets and stars of far space are located in the low orbit of the Earth.  They perform predetermined tasks, aimed at a specific object or sector of the sky.  Reprogramming and reorienting the device is an expensive process. <br>  Our Sun covers a huge sector of the observed sky, comparable to 600 <span>Earth diameters.</span>  According to astrophysicist Kirill Butusov, Gloria will be clearly visible from the position of Mars. <br>  In order to make sure that this information is true or inconsistent with the truth, it is worth pointing the satellite to the part of the sky that interests us.  The SOHO spacecraft is constantly surveying the Sun, but it is in low orbit, close to the Earth.  To study the desired site, you need a position fifteen times farther than the <span>distance to the moon.</span>  Therefore, we can only hope that, due to some circumstances, we will be able to see the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of the Earth or completely discard this assumption. </p><h2>  Is Planet Nibiru the sister of our sun? </h2><p>  The description of the second Sun can be traced in the mythology of almost all peoples.  The Sumerian tablets mention the second Sun, which did not set beyond the horizon.  Official astronomy refers the planet Nibiru to the field of pseudoscience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="planet nibiru" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1611767.jpg" width="506"></div>  However, recent studies by Japanese astrophysicists have confirmed Butusov's hypothesis about the presence of a massive body outside the Kuiper belt (begins beyond the orbit of Neptune).  It says that our Sun, like most stars, has a pair system.  According to his theory, our solar system had two luminaries, one of them was formed earlier and burned out completely.

    <p>  Nibiru's orbit has an elongated ellipse, with a maximum distance of about 110 astronomical units (one astronomical unit corresponds to 150 million kilometers).  According to astrophysicist Butusov‚Äôs calculations, the star‚Äôs period of revolution is about 40 thousand years.  To see this object is problematic due to the large distance and lack of luminosity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian physical society" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1611769.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Planet Nibiru (Raja Sun) is a dark massive <span>brown dwarf.</span>  Despite the fact that the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù star is an order of magnitude smaller than our Sun, its mass is still large, 6,000 times greater than that of the Earth.  According to some scientists, the elliptical orbit of Nibiru passes between Mars and Jupiter and goes far beyond the solar system.

    <h2>  Astrophysicist relied on the mechanism of acting forces in the universe </h2><p>  Butusov‚Äôs binary structure (paired objects) is based on many years of experience in the study of stars and celestial bodies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="binary structure of the solar system" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1611771.jpg"></div>  In the course of his calculations, the astrophysicist took into account gravitational perturbations within our system.  Kirill Butusov was the first to put forward the theory in 1958 on the cyclic activity of the Sun with a period of 11-17 years.  However, this work was not published due to the skepticism of its leader.  A few years later, American scientists published an identical work, reflected in the report of astrophysicist.  Kirill Butusov mentioned the difficulty of publishing the works of a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù understanding during the Soviet Union.  However, this did not stop the scientist in studying and analyzing existing planetary laws.  He relied on the "ubiquitous" gravitational force and current processes in outer space.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A rather strange story happened with the Voyager 1 spacecraft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="butusov Kirill Pavlovich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1611773.jpg" width="535"></div>  At the moment of crossing the orbit of Mars and changing the position for working with images of the Sun, according to NASA employees, the satellite lost communication and did not reach it anymore.  This is a real event or data hiding, you just have to guess.
