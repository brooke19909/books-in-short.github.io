For several centuries, she has managed to maintain an amazing atmosphere and unique identity.  In historical monuments that amaze the imagination, the remnants of former power are guessed, and travelers remember eternal values.  In colorful Portugal, pristine nature is adjacent to the tourist infrastructure, which is developing every year, and no one can complain about the lack of impressions. </p><h2>  Fairy tale city </h2><p>  Romantic Obidos (Portugal), which has retained its historical appearance, is a unique corner where every vacationer plunges into the romance of the Middle Ages.  In this open-air museum, there are only three thousand people who hospitably welcome all tourists who think they are in a fairy tale.  Skillful restorers who restored ancient buildings sought exactly this effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Obidos Portugal photo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1754903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Present for the wedding </h2><p>  Obidos, founded by Celtic tribes, is one of the oldest in the country.  For many centuries, it was ruled by Arabs and Visigoths, and only in the XII century did the new ruler establish Spanish rule here, which affected the appearance of the town, which absorbed the best from different cultures.  Obidos (Portugal), which became the center of the country's trading life, was not for nothing called a ‚Äúwedding present‚Äù, because King Dinis presented it to his beloved Isabella of Aragon on the wedding day in 1282. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since then, the incredibly elegant pearl of Portugal has become a city of weddings, and newlyweds from all over the world rush here to legitimize their relationship. </p><h2>  Castelo de obidos </h2><p>  It is very difficult for modern tourists to imagine that once this quiet corner, almost unchanged from the 13th century, was an impregnable citadel.  The powerful castle of Obidos (Portugal) was the main symbol of royal power.  Water and food were delivered to a structure located on a hill during a siege through branched underground tunnels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="obidos castle portugal" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1754857.jpg" width="323"></div>

    <p>  The local landmark acquired a modern look around the 11th ‚Äì 15th centuries, and before that there was an old fortress, which, according to historical chronicles, was erected by the Romans.  After the collapse of the great empire, the Visigoths settled in the defensive structure.  The Arabs who captured the city significantly strengthened and expanded the bastion, which played the role of the main stronghold.  When the Moors were expelled from Obidos, the king began the reconstruction of a powerful building that turned into an impregnable castle, which was later recognized as the country's most outstanding architectural monument.  It was the monarch who ordered to attach a fence of hewn stone blocks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Destruction and restoration of a national treasure </h2><p>  In 1755, the residence of the Portuguese monarchs, striking with the luxury of interior decoration, was completely destroyed by a powerful earthquake, and the stone walls were seriously damaged.  The country's authorities did not rebuild the castle, and only in the 30s of the last century did large-scale reconstruction begin.  A historical hotel complex has appeared on its territory, and every traveler who arrives in Obidos (Portugal), whose photo causes an irresistible desire to be here, will find shelter for the night and will be able to travel to the wonderful atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  However, those who are not ready to give a fortune for living in luxurious rooms will find more affordable options. </p><p>  Often changing the appearance of the castle, included in all tourist routes, it is no exaggeration to call the most popular place in Portugal. </p><h2>  Annual fair </h2><p>  Quiet Obidos (Portugal), surrounded by a dense ring of fortress walls, is declared a national monument.  The picturesque town, where there are only two streets, by all means supports the image of a medieval settlement and organizes various events that create the atmosphere of past eras.  So, every July, next to the reconstructed castle, fairs are held with jousting tournaments and performances by wandering artists.  Here you can buy for old coins, which are exchanged at the entrance, various souvenirs, try local dishes, take part in funny contests. </p><h2>  Ancient aqueduct </h2><p>  The main feature of Obidush is the complete absence of natural reservoirs, and life-giving moisture is obtained using water wells.  The oldest aqueduct, picturesquely looking, appeared in the 16th century on the orders of Queen Katarina of Austria.  Having a length of more than three kilometers, he not only provided fresh water to urban residents, but also fed magnificent fountains.  This is a very interesting architectural structure, which is a must-see. </p>

    <h2>  Chocolate festival </h2><p>  Every year in November, Obidos (Portugal) takes a sweet tooth, who come to the chocolate festival, because the city has several confectionery factories that present their products, which are made according to special recipes.  This is a very colorful event with a rich program.  Here, children and adults will find entertainment to their liking: they will try a variety of desserts made by experienced chefs, take part in contests with sweet prizes, appreciate the design of chocolate showcases and admire the skill of famous restaurateurs who performed edible sculptures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="obidos portugal" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1754864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  Cute houses drowning in flowers and narrow cobblestone streets lined with cobblestone give the impression of a good old fairy tale, which I want to capture for memory.  The picturesque Obidos (Portugal), whose sights are not so numerous, is proud of religious monuments that harmoniously fit into the look of the ancient city. </p><p>  The church of Santa Maria with a high white bell tower was erected on the site of a temple built by the Visigoths.  The real decoration are paintings on the theme of religious subjects of the artist who lived here several centuries ago.  Igreja de Santa Maria is the place where the marriage of the heir to the Spanish throne and Isabella took place. </p><p>  Not far from Obidos is the Senor da Pedra sanctuary, made in the Baroque style.  The hexagonal building was built after King Juan V, who miraculously escaped death, ordered the church to be erected in gratitude to God.  Before entering the beautiful building is a baroque fountain in white and blue shades.  Every year, the sanctuary receives many pilgrims from all over the world. </p><h2>  Obidos, Portugal: reviews </h2><p>  A journey into a real fairy tale, which was embodied in reality, leaves no one indifferent.  The miniature town, more reminiscent of a picturesque village, remained medieval, and the special atmosphere that prevails here is remembered forever.  Tourists notice the absence of the usual parking lots, and instead of them there are hinge rings built into the houses of residents.  By the way, each dwelling has been turned into a souvenir shop, because the city exists only due to tourism. </p><p>  Only in Obidush you can taste the delicious cherry Ginjinha liqueur, which the townspeople poured into chocolate glasses.  After the alcoholic drink is drunk, an edible cup is used as a snack.  No traveler leaves without branded ceramic products, and the main theme of decorated plates, trays, tureens is cabbage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="obidos portugal reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/1755236.jpg" width="330"></div>
