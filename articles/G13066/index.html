After all, as you know, it is demand that creates supply.  For some, such activities are quickly becoming the main source of income.  Masters on eyelash extension earn from 500 rubles per client.  However, this is an average figure, which may differ in a big way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.madmoizelle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eyelash extension master" class="if uuid-3254477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254477.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Unlike complex professions, which take years to master, you can become a master at eyelash extensions pretty quickly.  Of course, some costs will be required.  Training on eyelash extension costs an average of 15-20 thousand rubles.  Basic skills require only a few days. </p><p>  Despite the fact that training occurs rather quickly, this profession promises girls a rather high income with minimal investment. </p><p>  This is a fairly simple type of typical female business, which everyone can do.  These are female students and mothers on maternity, who have a lot of free time.  Even those who have the main job can master eyelash extensions and get an additional source of income. </p><h2>  Competition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.madmoizelle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="income eyelash extensions" class="if uuid-3254478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254478.jpg"></div><p>  Beginner eyelash extension master should be ready for high competition.  This is due to the fact that such a business requires minimal time and money, and is also easy to learn.  It is not surprising that so many girls rushed to learn this new and relevant profession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the good news is that not all eyelash extension masters without experience linger in this area for a long time.  Someone quickly gets tired of painstaking work, someone does not like looking for customers, etc. </p><p>  For this reason, a good specialist who does quality work has every chance of staying in this highly competitive niche for a long time and worthy of earning, ahead of competitors. </p><h2>  How much does the eyelash extension master earn? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="amelioretasante.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eyelash extension master salary" class="if uuid-3254480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254480.jpg"></div><p>  The possibility of a decent income is the most attractive factor for most girls.  Assuming that a specialist works forty hours a week, like most office workers, he can earn an average of 80-100 thousand.  Provided that the master will serve four clients daily. </p><p>  The amount seems impressive, but you need to understand that in practice it is quite difficult to create such an impressive stream of customers.  In addition, it will take a lot of practice to learn how to quickly perform work without sacrificing quality. </p><p>  Now you know how much the eyelash extension master earns.  However, do not take this information as an indisputable truth. </p><h2>  Prices in salons and at home masters </h2><p>  Let's also get acquainted with the average prices in the salons.  Beam building - from 1500 rubles.  Ciliary technique is more expensive, as it is more painstaking.  The cost is an average of 2000 rubles per procedure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Periodically, you need to perform eyelash correction, which costs from 1200 rubles, removal costs girls in the amount of 700 rubles. </p><p>  Eyelash tinting - from 600 rubles. </p><p>  Prices seem impressive, and potential earnings seem incredibly attractive.  However, you must understand that there are several factors that influence the final cost. </p><h2>  What determines the price? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pomponcerise.canalblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the eyelash extension master get" class="if uuid-3254481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254481.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, a home master takes on average 15-20% less for his services than salon employees.  This is already reducing potential earnings. </p><p>  Secondly, how much the eyelash extension master earns also depends on his experience.  Beginners usually try to set low prices to attract customers.  This is due to the fact that the build quality does not allow them to compete with more experienced craftsmen. </p><p>  Thirdly, from the payment made by the client, you need to deduct the cost of consumables.  This is an average of fifty percent.  This means that with each client you will earn only fifty percent of the payment that he makes.  If you buy expensive materials, profits will be reduced by another ten or fifteen percent.  However, even in this case, this activity remains attractive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.femmeactuelle.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="novice eyelash extension master" class="if uuid-3254482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254482.jpg"></div><p>  And the last - the region of residence greatly affects the salary of the eyelash extension master.  In the capital and other large cities, prices for such services are usually higher than in small cities.  Before bidding, study the offers of competitors who have launched their activities in your area.  This allows you to get a more objective picture. </p><h2>  Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.femmeactuelle.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eyelash extension master without experience" class="if uuid-3254483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254483.jpg"></div><p>  How much does the eyelash extension master earn is not the only question that should interest those who wish to master the wisdom of this profession. </p><p>  The work of this specialist is quite painstaking.  You must patiently perform the extension, carefully separating each eyelash and gluing an artificial one to it.  The whole process should take about two hours.  However, for this you will have to hone your skills for a long time. </p><p>  As a rule, it takes up to six hours for a beginner to complete eyelash extensions.  This is quite a long time.  Not every client has the patience to endure such a long process.  That's why masters without experience greatly reduce prices in order to attract first customers.  Not everyone immediately gets the perfect result.  It is necessary not only to glue artificial eyelashes, but also to ensure that the result looks quite natural.  At first, you may have to work completely free to get experience. </p><h2>  How to become an eyelash extension master? </h2><p>  This profession is now trending, so there are many who want to master it.  Now you know how much the eyelash extension master receives, it remains to figure out how to become one. </p><p>  So, of course, you should start with training.  However, in addition to this, get ready for the additional costs of materials and advertising to attract first customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.leseclaireuses.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the eyelash extension master earn" class="if uuid-3254484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3254484.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of the courses at which you are taught to grow eyelashes is on average from two to ten thousand rubles.  The vast majority will be seven to eight thousand rubles, which will have to be invested in the development of this profession.  The good news is that training lasts only a few days.  The bad news is that during this time, as a rule, it is not possible to hone the technique, so you have to practice on the first clients. </p><h2>  Initial expenses </h2><p>  In addition to paying for courses in which you can acquire theoretical knowledge and basic skills, the future master of eyelash extensions will have some additional expenses. </p><ul><li>  As for the purchase of materials that will be required to service the first customers, it will cost an average of five to ten thousand rubles.  Some girls prefer to buy the cheapest materials, explaining that the result will be the same as when using expensive consumables.  This issue is still controversial, so you have to decide.  In addition, the choice depends on the customers you want to attract.  If price becomes the decisive criterion for them, it is better to save on materials by offering inexpensive eyelash extensions. </li><li>  By the way, attracting first customers also requires additional costs. </li><li>  Experts do not recommend starting an advertising campaign if you are not versed in online advertising.  Better consult with a marketer.  However, this service is likely to be paid.  Your costs will average between four and eight thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  Masters who are engaged in eyelash extensions indicate that in this profession constantly have to learn new things.  That is why you should be prepared for the fact that the cost of training is not limited to taking basic courses.  In addition, additional training will be required.  The presence of various certificates allows you to achieve respect from customers who will not only contact themselves, but also bring friends.  This allows you to reduce advertising costs, but at the same time provide yourself with work. </p>
