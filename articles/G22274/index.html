This cute shoe becomes especially relevant in the cool autumn season, when it is necessary to protect the crumbs legs from overcooling.  If you are preparing for the imminent appearance of the baby and want to replenish his wardrobe with <span>things made with your own hands with soul and love, this article will be useful to you.</span> </p><p>  In it we will tell you how to crochet booties, introduce several models and describe in detail the technology of work.  We hope that even beginner needlewomen will succeed! </p><div class="photo" data-original="heteroaggression.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet baby booties" class="if uuid-2820070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2820070.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing for work.  Yarn and Hook Selection </h2><p>  It is difficult for beginner needlewomen to understand the variety of yarn and understand what size hook is suitable for work.  If you do not know how to crochet booties and where to start work, we recommend that you first decide on the yarn you like, and then carefully study its description. </p><p>  It usually indicates the required amount of thread, thickness and composition.  A suitable hook number is also registered.  We advise you to carefully follow the instructions and purchase the right amount of yarn from the specified manufacturer.  So you will protect yourself from the need to recalculate the number of loops and at the end you will receive a product of the correct size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For newborn babies, it is important to choose a high-quality, hypoallergenic thread, soft and pleasant touch.  Give your preference to trusted manufacturers - YarnArt, Alize, VITA and Pehorka.  For summer openwork booties, 100% mercerized cotton is well suited, for autumn-winter 100% merino wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.poundstretcher.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet booties for beginners step by step" class="if uuid-2817847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2817847.jpg"></div><p>  Many masters recommend the use of children's acrylic, products from it are obtained gentle, pleasant to the touch.  Acrylic yarn does not cause allergies and does not harm sensitive baby skin.  In addition, she shows herself well in a sock, does not stretch, does not fade and does not roll.  Let the yarn be a little more expensive than analogues, but you will enjoy both the process and the result.  A children's product made of high-quality threads will turn out beautiful and will last you a long time. </p><h2>  Model No. 1. Booties "Violet" </h2><p>  We present to your attention a simple master class that tells how to knit booties with a hook for beginners.  We hope that thanks to a detailed description of the technology of work and visual photographs you will not have any difficulties, and the process and result will be a great pleasure. </p><p>  To create charming Violet booties, you will need acrylic yarn in two shades of purple (thread density 100 g per 200 m), hook No. 3, a needle with a wide eye and scissors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Step-by-step master class for beginners </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to crochet booties.  We start the work by creating the sole.  From dark purple yarn we perform 12 air loops. </p><p>  First row: in the third loop from the end we knit 2 half stitches with one crochet (hereinafter PPSN).  In the next 7 loops of the base we make one PPSN, and the last - 5. We continue the work in a circle.  Again we perform 7 PPSN in each loop of the base, and in the last loop - 3 PPSN.  We check ourselves: in the first row should be 24 half columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diycraftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties for newborns for beginners" class="if uuid-2820605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2820605.jpg"></div><p>  Second row: we perform 2 PSSN in the first two loops of the previous row, then 7 PSSN, one in each loop of the base.  In the next five loops - 2 half columns.  Thanks to the increase, we form a rounded heel and toe.  We knit 7 half columns again and in the last three loops we do 2 PSSNs each.  The sole is already taking on the necessary shape.  Attention: with increments you should get 34 loops. </p><p>  We continue to crochet booties for newborns.  The third row of the sole is as follows.  In the first loop we knit 2 PSSN, in the second 1 PSSN.  Once again we repeat rapport.  We knit 7 PSSN.  Again, repeat the rapport (2 PSSN - 1 PSSN) 5 times.  We knit 7 PSSN.  Repeat rapport twice.  In the next loop we knit one half-column and 1 single crochet.  In the last loop, perform 1 single crochet and close the crochet with a half crochet.  With all the increases in the third row, there are 44 loops.  The first sole is ready.  That's how we crochet booties.  A description of the manufacturing technology of the sidewalls and the toe is presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We carry out the upper part of the product </h2><p>  Turn the sole so that the front of the product is on the outside.  Be sure to start knitting the sidewall exactly from the middle of the heel. </p><p>  In the fourth row we will work only for the back half-loop.  We start with one air loop and 1 half crochet.  Please note: the air loop at the beginning and the connecting half-column at the end of the row are not considered base loops, you do not need to knit anything in them.  We perform 43 PSSN, complete the row with a single crochet, connecting the row in a circle.  In the fourth row you should get 44 loops. </p><p>  In the fifth row we use a light purple thread and work for both base loops.  We make one lifting loop and 1 PPSN.  We knit two half-columns with a crochet, connecting them together, at one vertex.  Thus, we get a decrease.  Next, we perform 38 PPSN.  We again knit out two PPSNs with one vertex.  In the last loop we make 1 PPSN and close the row with a connecting half-column. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pretty-ideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties for newborns for beginners 4" class="if uuid-2820671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2820671.jpg"></div><p>  The sixth row starts with one VP and 1 PPSN in the same loop.  Then we knit 41 PPSN.  Close the row with a single crochet. </p><p>  Seventh row: after the lifting loop, we knit 1 single crochet.  Next, perform 11 sc.  We repeat rapport (we connect two RLS in one vertex - 1 RLS) six times.  We knit 12 sc.  Close the row as usual with a connecting half-crochet without a crochet.  Thanks to the decreases in the row, we count 36 loops. </p><p>  In the eighth row, we knit 1 VP and 1 RLS.  Next 9 sc.  We connect two PPSN in one vertex.  We connect two CHs to one vertex.  We repeat this simple procedure five more times.  We connect two PPSN in one vertex.  We knit 10 sc and get 28 loops in a row. </p><p>  The first bootie is ready.  It remains only to decorate it, and then, by analogy, perform the second.  Now you know how to knit baby booties with a hook for newborns.  For beginners there is advice: be sure to check yourself and count the number of loops in a row.  We hope you succeed. </p><h2>  We are finishing work.  Decorate booties with knitted buttons </h2><p>  As a decoration you can use any beads, sequins, satin ribbons or appliques.  We suggest knitting the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù, for which we will use a dark purple thread. </p><p>  We execute a chain of 3 VPs and close it.  We knit 6 half-columns with a crochet in a ring, we connect the first and last - half-columns without a crochet.  In the second row, we again make increases.  We skip the first loop, starting to work with the second.  In each loop of the base we knit two PPSN.  Please note: the last 2 PPSN must be tied into the connecting half-column without the crochet of the previous row.  We complete the row with a connecting loop.  We fix and break the thread. </p><p>  From light yarn we embroider a cross on the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù.  Decorate our booties.  Congratulations, half the work is done.  It remains only to tie another bootie and decorate it with a "button".  Now you know how to crochet baby booties.  We hope the description did not seem too complicated to you.  Good luck </p><div class="photo" data-original="rubyandcustard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet booties for beginners 3" class="if uuid-2820681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2820681.jpg"></div><h2>  Model No. 2.  Cute booties for girls </h2><p>  We offer novice needlewomen a simple model of charming booties.  The product is delicate, delicate and at the same time cozy and warm.  It will be possible for the baby to put on such shoes both for discharge and for a walk. </p><p>  To complete the product, it is necessary to prepare two skeins of YarnArt yarn or ‚ÄúPecherka children's novelty‚Äù with a weight of 100 g per 200 m and hook No. 3. It is advisable to use yarns of two colors, for example, white and pale pink or peach.  The size of the finished product is designed for a baby with a sole length of 10 cm (for ages from 0 to 3 months). </p><p>  How to crochet booties for beginners?  We will describe step by step the technology of work further.  Beginners are advised to clearly follow the instructions, carefully following all the details of the product. </p><h2>  Crochet booties.  Schemes and process description </h2><p>  We will start the work with manufacturing the sole.  In this case, we will be guided by a simple scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="molanmiscalcetas.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties for newborns" class="if uuid-2818295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2818295.jpg"></div><p>  We start with a chain of 13 air loops.  In the third loop from the end, we knit a crochet column (hereinafter referred to as CH).  In every 9 subsequent loops we perform 1 CH.  Last - 6 CH.  Thanks to this increase, we form a toe.  We turn the workpiece and perform another 9 CH.  In the last loop we do 5 CH.  The first row is ready.  We close it with a connecting column.  We knit the second and third rows according to the scheme, performing all the necessary increases.  The first sole is ready. </p><h2>  Step Two: Side </h2><p>  To create the fourth row, use a pink thread.  We perform one single crochet in each loop of the base (hereinafter RLS).  An important point: in the fourth row, place the hook exclusively behind the back wall of the loop.  We end with a connecting column.  In the fifth row we knit sc in both half loops of the base.  We complete with a connecting column. </p><p>  The sixth row will be knitted with a "bump" pattern.  The technique for performing the element is shown in the following figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="springcasual.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties for newborns for beginners 2" class="if uuid-2825248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2825248.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the sixth row, we carry out 2 lifting loops and 2 unfinished double crochets, knitting them together.  After doing 1 VP.  Having skipped one loop of the base, we knit the next "bump" of 3 unfinished double crochets.  Repeat the rapport to the end of the row.  We close by introducing a hook to the top of the first element of the pattern. </p><p>  The seventh row is performed similarly to the sixth.  We knit groups of 3 unfinished columns to the tops of the "cones" of the previous row. </p><h2>  Step Three: Toe </h2><p>  Having connected the lateral part, we proceed to the manufacture of the toe booties.  Take a white thread.  Fold the booties in half and determine the middle of the product.  We attach a thread to the back wall of the "bump", we knit 2 VP and 2 unfinished columns with a common vertex.  We do not do an air loop.  The next "bump" of 3 columns is performed at the top of the element of the previous row.  Gradually we reach the middle of the booties on the other side.  Check yourself: in the eighth row you should have 14 "bumps". </p><p>  In the ninth row, we are moving in the opposite direction.  We knit two air loops, turn the product over.  We knit a "bump" of two double crochet posts.  We skip the base loop and perform the next ‚Äúbump‚Äù of 3 unfinished columns.  In the ninth row you should get only 7 "bumps". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet booties for beginners step by step 2" class="if uuid-2824036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2824036.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to connect the first and last element of the row together.  Add a toe booties.  Connecting column connect the first and last "cones".  We make 2 lifting loops and 2 unfinished columns in the resulting ring.  We knit 1 VP.  The next "bump" of 3 columns is performed by introducing a hook for the leg of the nearest column on the right.  Next, we knit a pattern, moving to the right, thereby forming the back of the booties.  Repeat the rapport to the end of the row. </p><p>  We close by introducing a hook to the top of the first cone.  The tenth row is ready.  The eleventh and twelfth are performed by analogy with the previous one.  The bootie is almost ready.  The thirteenth row is crocheted with crochets, using a pink thread.  In the last row we make a beautiful binding of the edge.  We perform a single crochet and 5 stitches between them.  We close the row, fix the thread and cut it off.  Now you know how to crochet booties.  It remains only to decorate the finished product to your taste. </p><h2>  Step Four: Finish Up </h2><p>  To decorate booties we use a satin ribbon, braid or lace.  If desired, embroider booties with beads, beads, decorate with rhinestones or crocheted flowers. </p><p>  As you can see, crocheting booties for newborns for beginners is not difficult if you follow the instructions clearly.  We perform the second booties by analogy with the first one and enjoy the result.  I wish you creative success! </p>
