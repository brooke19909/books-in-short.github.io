Carolina Louise Margarita Grimaldi: biography, personal life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Grimaldi dynasty, which has ruled Monaco for several centuries, is shrouded in secrets and legends.  According to legend, the first prince who laid the foundation for the great family was cursed by the Dutch girl, and since then not a single son of a noble family has been happy in marriage.  Carolina, Princess of Monaco, is a prime example in favor of the veracity of this story.  The story of her life could be reflected in a book. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  Carolina was born on January 23, 1957.  She became the first child in the family of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace Kelly.  All her childhood passed in Philadelphia, and her youth in France, where she studied.  Perhaps that is why to this day, Carolina, Princess of Monaco, has remained attached to this country.  But her upbringing without conventions made her more like an American than a European aristocrat. </p>

Actually, this is what happened.  In her youth, she was repeatedly the victim of scandalous reporting by the paparazzi, probably no less than Princess Stefania, her younger sister.  But parents attributed everything to youth and <span>youthful maximalism.</span>

She is fluent in five languages: English, Italian, French, Spanish and German, has a diploma in philosophy.  Of course, like any aristocrat, equestrianism, dancing, music are not alien to her.  In childhood and adolescence, she dreamed of becoming a ballerina and journalist. </p><p>  Only at a more mature age did Carolina act more like her mother, Princess Grace Kelly.  Princess of Monaco is still not just a title.  Carolina must also bear certain obligations. </p>

    <h2>  First marriage </h2><p>  One of the crazy actions of youth was the marriage of a beautiful woman with banker Philippe Junot.  She is only nineteen, and he is thirty-six.  Not endowed with an attractive appearance, Philip had true masculine charisma and was known as a great rake.  However, it is such men who are always liked by inexperienced young girls.  Their romance lasted a little over a year before Junot proposed. </p><p>  Parents were against it, but they had to agree to this marriage, because otherwise Carolina threatened to move to her lover as a lover.  On June 28, 1978, the wedding took place.  The next day - the wedding.  The bride was beautiful in a dress from Christian Dior.  But cloudless happiness did not last long.  Unable to withstand constant betrayal, Carolina filed for divorce.  The marriage lasted only two years.  It took another twelve years for the Vatican to recognize the divorce. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most likely, this marriage was an act of protest against the mother‚Äôs attempts to instill decency in her daughter.  Carolina did not hide her attitude to this, saying that she was not going to go on with her parents. </p><h2>  Second marriage </h2><p>  After the divorce, Carolina had many novels.  She almost got married to Robertino Rossellini.  And her relationship with tennis player Guillermo Vilas brought a fortune to the photographer who shot their first date. </p><p>  Carolina, Princess of Monaco, married again in 1983, when the divorce from her first husband was not yet recognized by the <span>Catholic Church.</span>  The young businessman Stefano Casiraghi became her greatest love in her life.  They had three beautiful children. </p><p>  Kaziragi gravitated to extreme sports, he loved speed very much, which in the end cost him his life.  In 1990, he crashed in a yacht race. </p><p>  Carolina was very upset by the death of Stefano, her health was seriously shaken, her hair began to fall out very much.  She left with her children in a secluded estate in Paris. </p><p>  Who knows, perhaps Carolina and Stefano would still live happily ever after.  True, according to some sources, all seven years of marriage, Casiraghi had a constant lover.  But still, from the side, their family life looked very happy.  How can one not believe in the ancient curse of the Grimaldi clan? </p><h2>  And again the wedding ... </h2><p>  After Stefano's death, Carolina still had lovers.  Relations with <span>Vincent Lindon</span> lasted almost five years, but did not end there.  Most likely, Carolina needed this novel to heal a mental wound, because the next time she went down the aisle only in 1999.  The third husband was the aristocrat Ernst V of Hanover, the offspring of the British royal family, and now she became known as Carolina, Princess of Monaco and Hanover. </p>

Carolina actually ‚Äúbought‚Äù the spouse from her friend Chantal Khochuli, paying her 60 million euros.  Perhaps this was done in order to facilitate the <span>divorce proceedings.</span>

    <p>  However, this time, <span>family life</span> did not work out.  Ernst of Hanover has such a scandalous and defiant behavior that even the reputation of the princesses of Grimaldi seems impeccable against his background.  There is no closeness between the spouses, the marriage is bursting at the seams, they openly cheat on each other. </p><h2>  Children </h2><p>  Carolina, Princess of Monaco, gave birth to four children.  Andrea, Charlotte and Pierre Caseragi were recognized as legitimate in 1993, after the Vatican officially annulled the divorce from Philippe Junot.  After Stefano‚Äôs death, his father was replaced by his uncle, <span>Prince Albert II of Monaco.</span>  In the third marriage, Princess Alexandra of Hanover was born. </p><p>  Andrea Caseragi could lay claim to the throne of Monaco if Albert II did not have heirs.  His name is on the list of 50 most beautiful people in the world ... </p><p>  Charlotte Caseragi is now one of the most popular figures in the aristocratic circle of Europe.  She is considered similar to Grace Kelly.  Charlotte is passionate about equestrianism, literature, fashion.  She is a true princess, her reputation is impeccable. </p><p>  Pierre does not lag behind his sister and is also distinguished by a diversity of interests, he loves music and sports.  The prince plays the saxophone, enjoys surfing, skiing.  Apparently, he inherited a tendency to extreme from his father. </p><p>  The birth of Alexandra did not strengthen the marriage with Ernst.  The young princess is seriously engaged in figure skating. </p><h2>  Social and social life of Carolina of Monaco </h2><p>  The tragic death of Princess Grace Kelly in 1982 forced the eldest daughter to take her place in secular society.  The famous actress sacrificed her career for the family and the title "Princess of Monaco".  Her biography is reflected in books; recently a film was made about her.  Carolina led the Princess Grace Foundation, whose activities are aimed at helping sick children.  She also actively helps the Red Cross of Monaco.  His balls are attended by the whole of Europe, and the proceeds go to charity. </p>

By the way, Monaco was a favorite place of the famous Diaghilev.  Carolina is Honorary President of the Monte Carlo Ballet and Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Monte Carlo International Festival of Arts.  Her active assistance in the reconstruction of the Alexandria Library is known.  She also chairs the annual Grand Literary Prize from the Prince Pierre Foundation.
