It is a connecting element between a conventional TV and the Internet.  In order to control it, just pick up the remote control. </p><p>  The player allows you to view any video, image or listen to music without using a laptop computer.  The purchase of such a device will satisfy those who do not want to constantly configure programs on a laptop, but want to watch their favorite movie on the big screen without any problems.  The network player has one main minus - playing the game or watching the news in text mode via the Internet will not work. </p>

    <p>  It is important to remember that the reputation of the manufacturer significantly affects the price of the device.  Below we will review the models of different brands, consider their pros and cons. </p><h2>  Player functions </h2><p>  The device is connected to absolutely any TVs (CRT is no exception).  In order to enjoy all the delights of such a technique, it is recommended to use Full HD screens.  The player plays any formats that are related to HD.  In fact, if we take into account precisely this nuance, we can say that the network player is an analogue of Blu-Ray.  The significant difference between the two is that browsing is not via disks, but via the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the market you can find models that support the option of storing files and sharing them.  There is also the function of creating a personal library. </p><h2>  Inexpensive WD TV Live </h2><p>  Even with the fact that the platform for the player costs about $ 70-80, the network player itself has a price of 3 thousand rubles.  It has a nice design, advanced functionality, miniature size.  But what made the manufacturer lower the cost?  Firstly, although the player looks enticing, the design itself is modest: gray has become the dominant color, and plastic is the main material. </p>

    <p>  The external panel is equipped with several connectors and indicators, also there is the company logo.  There are no mechanical and touch buttons here, so control needs to be done only with the remote control. </p><h2>  NETGEAR NeoTV 550 </h2><p>  Compared with the previous one, this network player costs a little more - from 5 to 6 thousand rubles.  However, it is included in the list of the <span>best players,</span> according to buyers, so it fully justifies its price. </p><p>  The design is minimalistic and quite inconspicuous - the case is black, there are no bright elements.  It will not distract the viewer's attention from the film or family video, as due to its coloring it ‚Äúhides‚Äù behind larger interior items. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front side is equipped with a power button, several connectors, including microSD.  The main ports are located on the side of the chassis. </p><h2>  Medium Value IconBIT XDS7GL </h2><p>  In the list of "Best Network Players" there will always be an ideal combination of price and functionality of the iconBIT XDS7GL device. </p><p>  This model works fast enough, has many options that not every equipment can boast of.  It improves the image and allows you to watch heavy videos from the Internet and from disk. </p>

    <p>  The appearance is aesthetic and will immediately attract attention.  The body is made of aluminum, the shape is oval.  The external side of the player has a mechanical button for turning the device on and off, it is also equipped with dim lighting, there are indicators and connectors.  You must control the equipment using the remote control. </p><h2>  Appearance eGreat EG-M31B </h2><p>  When choosing a suitable player for buyers at first glance, the eGreat EG-M31B network audio player is unlikely to be of interest.  It is inconspicuous, from afar it looks like a black glossy box.  It has several connectors for plugs, indicators and a cooler.  On the one hand, the design of the device is too simple, but on the other - thanks to this, it will fit into absolutely any room.  The weight of the player is 1.5 kg, the dimensions are also small - 160x160x58 mm.  According to these parameters, it becomes clear that the device is several times more compact along the length of the DVD player, so it will take up much less space. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The minus of the device can be called a noisy cooler.  Excessive sound from it is due to its small size and high speed. </p><h2>  EGreat device EG-M31B </h2><p>  Network multimedia players of this company are equipped on the front of the case with two ports and indicators for correct operation.  One of the connectors is required for the cord from a laptop computer, the second - for the HDD.  Here you can find a button for turning on and off, as well as a place for a USB cable. </p><p>  The total number of connectors is suitable for connecting any AV equipment.  There is not enough space between them, but we are talking about a regular stationary device, which is necessary for a one-time connection, so this problem is not a serious minus.  The device connects to the TV quite easily. </p><h2>  Work with eGreat EG-M31B </h2><p>  The first time you connect network multimedia players, you need to set default settings, and the eGreat EG-M31B is no exception.  You must select the interface language, subtitle, image format, discs and other parameters.  For "arrangement" of the menu, it will not take even 10 minutes, since the functions are commonplace, and there is no need to give them too much time. </p>

    <p>  The most important point when connecting is adding content to the player.  It supports files from various external drives (flash memory) and network, as well as from the Internet.  When you connect any drives, you don‚Äôt have to wait, but if there are too many files on the disk, you will have to go about your business for a while - it may hang.  In practice, the first ‚Äúacquaintance‚Äù of the player with other devices did not last more than 30 minutes. </p><h2>  Work of the eGreat EG-M31B player with online services </h2><p>  The player is able to work not only with "their" sources of content, but also connect to online libraries.  The main portal to which the device offers to connect is MSP Community.  In addition, you can download materials from video hosting sites, music sites, and provide access to radio sites, as well as television.  However, the list of allowed sites is limited.  But it should be understood that most servers require registration, authorization, so in some cases it is easier to download video using a computer.  However, a huge plus during operation is the high connection speed. </p><h2>  Briefly about Yamaha NP-S2000 </h2><p>  The Yamaha NP-S2000 network player is difficult to compare with something, even if you take only the pricing policy into account.  It differs in that it does not have a hard drive built into the case.  However, when considering more detailed elements of the device, you can safely refer it to the list of Hi-End equipment.  The maximum capabilities of this model are very impressive, so with a small budget you can afford to fork out for it. </p>

    <p>  There are no complaints about the device in terms of sound and image quality, speed of operation and downloading of Internet connections.  The whole problem is ergonomics, so it is the only thing that the manufacturer should fix. </p><h2>  Sound Yamaha NP-S2000 </h2><p>  In order for the network player to make a very decent sound, you need to take care of setting the necessary parameters.  With the right approach to this issue, you can achieve an impressive result.  In principle, this player can sound no worse than a high-quality recorded CD-ROM.  Moreover, an ordinary music lover will not notice the substitution, and not every professional will figure out what exactly is used during playback. </p><p>  The manufacturer is located in the country of the rising sun, so their products are characterized by a calm, anemic and simplified sound, which is so characteristic of the Japanese people.  Here, a similar traditional nature is not observed.  To feel the sound of each part of yourself, enjoy the vocals and the melody, you need to buy an amplifier or speakers. </p><h2>  Player Pioneer N-50-K </h2><p>  Pioneer has a rich and interesting biography.  She began her career with a workshop for repairing conventional radios, and now she is the largest manufacturer of electronic equipment.  For a long time, since the previous century, the corporation has gained popularity as a new "inventor".  She always presented the devices in the form that their designers and developers saw, which set new standards in production.  Since the opening of the company, she has managed to release more than a dozen electronics, including audio players with an Internet connection. </p>

    <p>  Pioneer network players are in great demand.  A popular model is the N-50-K.  She is one of the best among other options from various manufacturers.  Design, build, sound and compactness are what have been appreciated.  The device software supports playback from the Internet, from CD-ROMs, flash drives.  In addition, you can connect the player directly to the computer itself or to it, but over the network or via Bluetooth.  The player is capable of reproducing HD audio and video in excellent quality.  There are several USB outputs, digital and <span>optical connectors.</span> </p><h2>  Player Denon DNP-720 AE </h2><p>  The technical characteristics of this device are somewhat similar to a similar device from Marantz.  The obvious differences between them are price, equipment, functionality.  Network players Denon hardly gain popularity, however, with a detailed examination of the models, we can say that this manufacturer is developing more powerful products.  It is unlikely that in the world market you can find a similar option with an attractive Hi-Fi design at a low price. </p><p>  The best sound can be seen in Sonos players, Logitech offers ease of use.  There is a 43 cm panel, an iPod connector and the ability to play video and music directly from an Apple device.  Of course, it is worth clarifying the very authority of the company, which, although it is not the most popular, always pleases with its visions of certain devices. </p>

    <p>  One of the sought-after features in network players is the continuous playback of tunes, which is also not in this model.  In order to establish a ‚Äúfull‚Äù sound, you will have to use Airplay, connecting your device with any Apple or iTunes technique. </p><p>  iPod, iPad and other devices are easily connected to the player using a USB cable, which will not only allow you to synchronize all media files, but also charge the device.  Unlike Marantz models, Denon does not have additional digital connectors, headphone output, tuners.  An important feature of this player is Wi-Fi support. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Network multimedia players to choose the right is not so easy and easy, so the choice must be taken with complete seriousness.  Firstly, having a figurative idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat design it should be will not be enough.  You need to fully understand what functionality is expected from the player.  There is an opportunity to purchase an inexpensive player model, however, with insufficient power and a small number of options, you will have to reflash it, and this is a dangerous procedure. </p><p>  Considering the best network players, it is worth stopping at the NetGear NeoTV 550 model. It supports Internet connection and Blu-Ray at once, and is also capable of playing heavy videos. </p>
