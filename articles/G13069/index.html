  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SBiS ++: reporting has become faster.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern system of electronic reporting SBiS ++ is a single, universal system that includes all levels of reporting, preparation, verification and analysis of any workflow.  Using this system, you can report to all bodies controlling the business process.  In addition, SBiS ++ allows you to exchange data between company employees, between various agencies, departments and organizations, without fear for unauthorized use of important data. </p><p>  The SBiS system operates in the so-called single window. <noindex>  <span>Online Reporting</span> </noindex>  It became possible simultaneously with the pension fund, with the tax service, with the Social Insurance Fund, Rosstat, with participants in other budget processes and with various contractors.  Applications of the USRLE and ION services allow you to expand the capabilities of an accountant. </p><p>  Working with the system is as simple as possible.  Everyone can deal with it.  The taxpayer, choosing the appropriate department and the necessary form of the report, fills in all the proposed lines in SBiS ++.  After this, the report must be sent for signature by EDS.  The next step is to encrypt the report and send it to the service provider.  The special operator is already sending the report to the supervisory authority.  Completes the process - confirmation from the inspection that the report has been submitted. </p><p>  Consider a step-by-step instruction on how reporting is submitted, using the example of a tax return.  Before you start reporting, make sure that you have chosen the right taxpayer for whom you want to submit a report.  Next, go to the registry of the Federal Tax Service, choosing from the list that is offered to you the month and year that is needed.  In order to choose a different reporting period, move the cursor and click on ‚ÄúReporting for the period‚Äù.  The next step is to create a report.  By clicking the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù button, the system will prompt you to select any reporting form from the list.  As soon as the form is opened, all information contained in the personal card of the taxpayer is automatically transferred to it.  This is the name of the organization or individual entrepreneur, tax authority, KPP, TIN and other mandatory details.  Filling out the form does not seem difficult.  All the usual fields for any accountant do not cause difficulties, since they are an identical version of paper media.  In this case, do not worry about whether the correct reporting form, the system automatically makes changes before the reporting period, if there have been any changes in the accounting registers. </p><p>  After all the necessary data is entered into the cells, a protocol is generated that will show if there are errors in the report.  To make corrections, you can click on the appropriate link that indicates the line number.  After the filling and checking procedure, click on the ‚ÄúSave and exit‚Äù button.  The final procedure is the transfer for signature and sending reports to the regulatory body. </p></div></article>
