Its sights for the most part have no historical value due to the fact that the city has a relatively small history.  But for a visiting tourist or city dweller, they will be interesting.  There is something to see, where to go to spend fun leisure time. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Today the population of the city is 158 thousand people.  And before the beginning of the XX century.  there were several small working villages.  After the opening of the electrometallurgical and equipment factories, the place began to be called the tract of calm.  The construction of the railway made this settlement affordable, and workers and families worked here to earn money.  In 1925, the station was named Elektrostal, and the rapid increase in population allowed the village to receive the status of a city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions steel photo" class="if uuid-2979480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979480.jpg"></div><p>  The founder of the city is a prominent Russian industrialist Nikolai Vtorov.  It was he who opened the plant here, having created, in fact, a city-forming enterprise that still works.  In Soviet times, it was a closed facility, and getting here to work was not easy. </p><p>  Today Elektrostal is a promising industrial city with a great future and a heroic past.  It bears the proud name "City of Military and Labor Glory." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Find out about the attractions of Elektrostal with a description and photos here.  There are places for walking, outdoor activities and cultural development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="v-elektrostal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the electric steel of the Moscow region" class="if uuid-2979487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979487.jpg"></div><p>  Those who come to the city by train are greeted by a monument to the metallurgist.  It was installed in November 2017 for the 100th anniversary of the Elektrostal plant.  The attraction is made in the style of constructivism.  The monument quickly won the love of citizens, because this city is held by ordinary workers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="elektrostal attractions photo with description" class="if uuid-2979484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979484.jpg"></div><p>  They honor the electricians and the founding father of the plant Nikolai Vtorov.  In 2002, a monument was unveiled in his honor, which became a landmark of the city of Elektrostal.  <span>A bronze sculpture was</span> erected on the site where a monument once stood to the leader of the world proletariat V.I. Lenin.  Times are changing, heroes are changing.  Today, the plant, founded a century ago, is the largest in Russia.  Vtorov himself, whose fortune was estimated at 60 million rubles in gold, according to Forbes magazine, was the owner of the largest capital at the beginning of the century.  He was a banker, industrialist, entrepreneur, a man of business. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The monument was erected on the initiative of citizens who wanted to perpetuate the monument to the great man. </p><h2>  Park of Culture and Rest </h2><p>  One of the popular places to spend weekends and evenings with citizens and visitors is the Park of Culture and Rest.  Here you can ride rides for children and adults, play slot machines, rollerblading or biking.  The park is divided into two zones.  Fans of leisurely walks in the fresh air make a promenade on the Quiet Alley, and those who prefer an active holiday flock to the Entertainment Alley.  The park has a summer stage where concerts and cafes are regularly held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inphocom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electric steel sights" class="if uuid-2979492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979492.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of History and Art </h2><p>  Until 1999, there was no central museum among the attractions of Elektrostal in the Moscow Region.  Expositions were exhibited in schools, the house of culture, in factory museums.  The city was closed, so there was not a large influx of tourists and visitors.  The appearance of the historical and art museum made it possible for residents and visitors to learn a lot of useful information about their native land, the formation of the production process, the difficult years of the war.  The exposition consists of paintings by local artists, historical artifacts, household items, documents, books and much more.  The collection is updated regularly.  Visiting exhibitions are also held here, which are invariably popular with the townspeople. </p><h2>  Main alley </h2><p>  One of the main <span>attractions of Elektrostal, the</span> photo of which is almost every resident or visitor, is the Main Alley.  Passers-by love to walk on its shady paths, townspeople have a rest at the fountain after a hard shift at the factory.  The decoration of the alley are flower beds.  In 2006, a flower festival was held here for the first time, which has become traditional.  Each enterprise of the city and individuals give residents a real composition of fresh flowers, which pleases with bright colors all summer.  A riot of colors, aromas and a flight of fantasy reigns here.  Walking through the park, you can see Snow White with a basket, a bright well, a multi-tiered cake of fresh flowers, hearts of lovers or a fabulous teremok.  Not to take a photo against the background of these compositions is almost impossible. </p><h2>  Cultural Center "October" </h2><p>  The city has a <span>cultural center.</span>  Here, performances of local creative groups and visiting stars are held, performances and circus performances are held. </p><h2>  Ice Palace "Crystal" </h2><p>  In 1971, the Crystal Palace was opened in the city.  Almost immediately, a youth hockey team was organized, which gained sporting fame.  This is the home sports arena for the electrostal hockey team.  Matches of various levels are held on ice. </p><p>  Here sections for children who are engaged in hockey or figure skating are open.  Citizens come here as families to cheer on their favorite team or to skate. </p><h2>  Memorial Complex </h2><p>  Elektrostal is a city with a heroic past.  During the war, more than 12 thousand citizens came to the recruiting station and went to the front to defend their homeland.  Almost 4 thousand of them did not return from the battle.  A memorial complex with unquenchable Eternal Flame, opened in 1968, is dedicated to these heroes. </p><p>  But the electricians participated in the war in Afghanistan and Chechnya.  By decision of the city authorities, their memory is also immortalized in the memorial complex. </p><p>  It has become a good tradition for newlyweds to lay flowers at this monument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elektrostal.sutochno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions of Elektrostal" class="if uuid-2979482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979482.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum and Exhibition Complex </h2><p>  In 1999, a museum and exhibition complex was opened in the city, where, in addition to the exhibition hall, there are numerous circles for children, classes for young people, and a creative workshop.  Within the walls and on the territory of the complex, various festivals, exhibitions, city holidays and other events are held that attract a lot of spectators. </p><h2>  Temple </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turbina.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electric steel sights" class="if uuid-2979490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2979490.jpg"></div><p>  Listing the attractions of Elektrostal, it is impossible not to mention the temples.  There are several of them in the city: the church of John of Kronstadt, St. Andrew's Church, the hospital church of St. Panteleimon.  Another new church is being built.  In appearance, the temples look old, monumental, in the Novgorod style.  But they were all built at the end of the 20th century. </p><p>  Let there be no artifacts dating back to the middle of the sights of Elektrostal.  But on the other hand, they are all connected with the history of the city, with everyday work and the feats of arms of ordinary people. </p>
