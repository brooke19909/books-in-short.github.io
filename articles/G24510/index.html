    <p>  <strong>Features of resort beaches</strong> </p><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that each beach has its unsurpassed features.  Zander can offer many great options.  All beaches stretch along a shallow bay from <span>Cape Alchak</span> to Mount Krepostnoy for 2.5 km.  Water warms up very quickly, and there are no strong waves in this section, as the region is reliably protected from the winds by mountains. </p><p>  All beaches are mainly sand and gravel and sand and gravel.  Unfortunately, practically no free beaches are found on the entire <span>Crimean coast</span> , Sudak was no exception.  Paid beaches have long been the norm for this resort.  Numerous sanatoriums and recreation centers can provide beautiful comfortable beaches, but with one condition - vacationers cannot avoid financial spending. </p><p>  <strong>Elite beach (Sudak)</strong> </p><p>  The beach of the sanatorium TOK "Sudak" has 400 m of territory with fine quartz pebbles.  This plot is very clean, comfortable and spacious.  However, there is almost nowhere to eat here.  To get here is also very difficult, since the entrance is carried out only by passes.  Sometimes strangers can still be allowed in, but for this you will have to fork out for an amount of 30 to 80 UAH. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea pike perch beaches" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/279184.jpg" width="500"></div>

Zander is most often filled with vacationers in July and August, so getting here in season is quite problematic.  This beach is located in the heart of the embankment, between the pier of the Brigantine sanatorium and the rescue station.  Despite the fact that it is a free beach, this place is pretty well equipped.  The beach has a good entry into the water, there are no breakwaters, and <span>quartz sand</span> on the territory has healing properties.  In general, if you are not afraid of crowds, this place is quite suitable for relaxation. </p><p>  <strong>Arzy Beach</strong> </p><p>  At the very foot of the Fortress Mountain sheltered the beach, which is covered with gray fine gravel.  Its territory has a length of 250 m, if you look up from here, you can contemplate a breathtaking view of the Consular Castle. </p><p>  <strong>Crimea, Sudak: nearby beaches</strong> </p><p>  If we are talking about beach holidays, then it is simply impossible not to mention the incredibly beautiful village near Sudak - the New World.  In the village, it is worth highlighting the beaches "Novosvetsky", "Tsarsky", as well as the beaches of the "Blue Bay". </p><p>  Many prefer to retire and choose a wild beach.  Sudak can provide many interesting places.  A wild beach can be found just to the right of the Falcon sanatorium.  The cleanest wild places are located at <span>Cape Meganom.</span>  This amazing place is closed on all sides by rocks, so nudists often like to relax here.  Of course, the wild places are not very well equipped, but here you can relax from the crowded city and enjoy swimming in the clear sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pike perch paid beaches" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/279195.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  If your main goal of relaxation is to receive positive emotions, then, in principle, it does not matter which beach you choose.  Sudak is an amazingly beautiful place that you need to see at least once in your life with your own eyes. </p>
