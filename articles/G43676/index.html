Scales are industrial floor electronic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many areas of activity where you have to use platform scales.  This group of equipment differs significantly from any other balance in size, as well as in the characteristics of the goods that can be weighed using them.  Devices have another name - commodity scales.  Various enterprises produce electronic and mechanical devices.  Consider their types, characteristics and features of operation. </p><h2>  Types of devices by measurement method </h2><p>  Platform scales can be divided into three groups.  These are mechanical devices, electronic, and also combined - electronic-mechanical.  To choose a particular group, you need to know about the features of operation, the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. </p><h2>  Mechanical equipment </h2><p>  The main working part in these mechanisms is the so-called measuring spring.  A load mounted on a working platform acts on this spring with its weight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="platform scales" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1735726.jpg" width="378"></div>  The latter is stretched, and then two options are possible - either it will move the measuring scale, or the result will be shown on the arrow moving along the fixed scale.

    <p>  To set the industrial mechanical platform scales ‚Äúto zero‚Äù, you need to spin a special wheel for adjustment.  You can find it in many models most often in the lower part of the mechanism.  The accuracy is not very high.  The division price in most cases is 1 kg.  Very rarely, models allow you to weigh loads with an accuracy of 500 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These devices are popular due to their ease of use.  Also, they do not need regular maintenance - no need to change batteries or rechargeable batteries.  The devices are able to work properly under high loads.  A striking example is industrial platform scales, weighing up to 2000 kg of cargo.  They can be found in trading companies, in wholesale warehouses and in other organizations.  Due to the fact that the mechanism of the scales is almost eternal, it has long been chosen by scrap metal receivers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial scales" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1736091.jpg" width="581"></div>  One of the advantages is the cost.  Since there is no whole range of different options that are unique to electronic models, mechanical scales are several orders of magnitude cheaper.  This is a serious plus.

    <h2>  Electronic equipment </h2><p>  Electronic platform scales are already more modern solutions that have found application in trading enterprises.  They can be found in most supermarkets and smaller stores.  But there are also industrial models that can weigh heavy loads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic platform scales" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1735722.jpg" width="401"></div>  The weighing results will be displayed immediately.  The division price can vary from 0.1 to 0.5 kg, depending on the model.  As for the principles of action laid down in a particular model, it depends on the particular manufacturer and purpose of the balance.

In the first case, two metal discs are used.  They work as an electric capacitor.  After installing the load on the working platform under the influence of this load, the plates are moved apart.  There is a change in the electric charge between the two plates, it determines the displayed measurement results. </p><p>  The design feature is that there are almost no mechanical parts and systems.  This greatly enhances durability as well as accuracy and reliability. </p><p>  The second principle involves the use of a voltage sensor.  This sensor is a thin metal wire through which an electric current passes.  Due to the load on the platform, this sensor is stretched, which means that the electrical signal that passes through it changes.  The computer according to certain algorithms calculates the weight and displays it on the display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="platform scales Price" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1735724.jpg" width="320"></div>  If platform scales, working on the basis of the first principle of operation, have a minimum number of mechanical parts, then they are not there at all.  All weight measurements are carried out using electronics only.

    <p>  For the operation of small electronic scales, batteries are used.  For models with a large "payload" used batteries and stationary power supplies. </p><h2>  Types of devices by design and installation method </h2><p>  Scales industrial, luggage, as well as commodity and postal are classified into floor, table, stationary, mobile and built-in. </p><p>  The choice of a suitable model and brand depends on what a company is doing, what products will most often have to be weighed, what should be the accuracy of the results, carrying capacity and throughput. </p><p>  The choice also depends on how much buyers are willing to pay for platform scales.  The price for a model on load cells with a load capacity of 2000 kg is from 30 000 r.  This price does not include the price of installation work, settings and equipment maintenance costs. </p><h2>  Platform electronic equipment </h2><p>  Standard models are an ordinary platform of a rectangular or square shape.  On the surface of this platform should be placed the cargo that must be weighed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="platform scales" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1736646.jpg" width="474"></div>  Structurally, these devices represent an integral platform with four <span>strain gauge sensors.</span>  These platform scales have screw supports that enable adjustment.  Durable steel is used as the material for the production of these platforms.

    <h2>  Ramp models </h2><p>  This equipment is different from stationary solutions.  The platform is equipped with special ramps on which loaders and other warehouse equipment can call.  These are mainly industrial and warehouse scales.  Devices of this level are extremely easy to use.  They are easy to transport, they can be easily moved to any other place. </p><h2>  Options </h2><p>  Almost any model of scales has in its equipment a printer for printing receipts and documents for goods.  These devices can operate in automatic mode, which almost completely eliminates manual human labor.  Thus, platform scales significantly simplify the process of accounting materials.  The equipment is reliably protected from dust and dirt.  This allows for long life. </p><p>  So, we figured out the types of scales and their principle of operation. </p>
