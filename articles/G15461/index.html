  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tricolor TV: user reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reviews about Tricolor TV are interesting to everyone who is going to use the services of this digital satellite television operator operating in Russia.  Currently, more than twelve million households are connected to it across the country.  At the same time, almost ten million have access to HD-television.  According to 2017 data, the company's total revenue from subscription payments is more than 19 billion rubles with an average check of one and a half thousand rubles. </p><h2>  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="infinance.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2969052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969052.jpg"></div><p>  About the largest operator "Tricolor TV" reviews can be found the most diverse.  Some are satisfied with the work of the company, others are not.  At the same time, the history of the company itself has relatively little time - less than fifteen years.  In 2005, it was founded under the name "National Satellite Company", and then began broadcasting.  First, only to the European part of Russia. </p><p>  Since 2008, the operator began to cover Siberian regions, and by 2009 the number of subscribers increased to five million people.  In 2012, it became known about a radical change in the company's development strategy.  At the telecommunications exhibition, which took place on the territory of Russia, Director General Alexander Makarov officially announced that he plans to include foreign television channels in the packages provided, which the operator had previously refused to broadcast for fundamental reasons.  In addition, it was decided to form a package in HDTV format. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2013, Tricolor became the first Russian operator to provide public satellite television broadcasts organized in ultra-high definition format. </p><h2>  Services </h2><div class="photo" data-original="prosmarttv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tricolor TV Provider" class="if uuid-2969058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969058.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the company provides more than ten all kinds of packages.  One of the most common is called "One."  Access to it is provided for one and a half thousand rubles a year.  It includes more than two hundred channels for every taste, including high definition.  Users can enjoy informative, musical, entertaining, news, sports programs, a variety of films.  Moreover, an active subscription allows you to control the broadcast, for example, to record or pause a TV show.  In daily mode, the collection of films from the special service "Cinema Halls" is updated.  So you no longer have to spend time searching and downloading movies from the Internet.  You can immediately watch the long-loved masterpieces and movie novelties.  Users have the opportunity to watch online when the TV channels will be available wherever there is an Internet network. </p><p>  The Extra package, in addition to the same capabilities that the One has, makes it possible to watch three additional children's TV channels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a special package for children, which allows you to watch a large number of educational, educational and educational programs, cartoons, good old tales and entertaining shows. </p><p>  Available by subscription and the TV channel "Match Premier".  He will be liked by the fans.  This is a premium channel with exclusive content entirely dedicated to domestic football.  Spectators will be able to watch all the matches of the Russian Premier League, friendly matches of the Premier League clubs, as well as reviews of all the games of the Spanish La League, English Premier League, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga, French League 1. </p><p>  You can realize your wildest erotic fantasies with the "Night" channel, which provides access to adult content around the clock.  Judging by the reviews of "Night" on "Tricolor TV", many users admit that they are disappointed when they include this package in their subscription.  Erotica, which is regularly shown, is ancient and cheap, films and videos are outdated, new content practically does not appear.  Of the six channels that are included in the package, only one shows porn, and all the others are very frivolous, but chaste videos. </p><h2>  "Tricolor Online" </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Tricolor TV plate is no longer required to be able to use the services of an operator.  Even if you can‚Äôt install a satellite dish, you can watch any of the packages via the Internet.  To do this, you need to connect your receiver to the network, so you immediately get freedom from the schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Favorite programs can be viewed at any convenient time, rewind them, pause or watch from the very beginning. </p><p>  It offers users more than 140 channels, a TV archive, that is, all programs over the past week, the Games application. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="navsegda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Advertising Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2969055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969055.jpg"></div><p>  There is also the option to connect the Internet to Tricolor TV.  According to reviews, this service is used by an increasing number of customers.  Satellite Internet is a unique opportunity to constantly stay in touch on social networks, make purchases online, watch movies, develop your business in almost any industry, and view news.  This can be done anywhere, wherever you are - in Western Siberia or in the very center of the Russian capital. </p><p>  The provider is ready to provide users with access to high-speed two-way Internet wherever even cable networks refuse to work. </p><p>  According to reviews of satellite Internet from Tricolor TV, the advantages of this type of connection are that access to the network exists even at the most remote points.  This is an ideal solution for places where other operators are not ready to work.  For example, if you live in a country house, cottage, in the country or in the country.  High-speed satellite internet is available almost throughout Russia. </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mediasat.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews of Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2969051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969051.jpg"></div><p>  According to the reviews of Internet speed from Tricolor TV, data transfer is so fast that you can do without television at all.  It is important that everyone can choose the tariff that suits him the most.  You can apply for a package with the amount of prepaid traffic.  The most affordable option is 3 GB per month for 680 rubles.  In this case, the purchase of each next GB will cost you 255 rubles.  1 090 rubles costs 5 GB per month, and 2 700 rubles - 15 GB. </p><p>  There are also unlimited internet tariffs.  At a maximum speed of 20 Mbit / s, the cost of the service will be 2,990 rubles, and at 40 Mbit / s - 4,990 rubles. </p><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  According to Internet reviews from Tricolor TV, users are not always satisfied with the service provided.  When a company promises a maximum speed of up to 20 Mbit / s, in reality it is only 5-6 Mbit / s.  This upsets the customers. </p><p>  And from the next month, the speed drops to 300-400 Kbps.  Any page on the Internet with such data transfer opens about a minute.  As a result, many users even get the feeling that the company has a rule: in the first month after connecting, provide more or less high speed, and then reduce it as much as possible, thereby forcing to switch to more expensive tariffs. </p><p>  This attitude towards their customers is openly outraged by many.  There are still a lot of negative reviews about Tricolor TV. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="astrakhan-tricolor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tricolor TV Devices" class="if uuid-2969053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969053.jpg"></div><p>  To use the services of a provider, you must connect the appropriate equipment.  Which one you need to purchase depends on your needs.  Are you going to just watch TV channels or will you still play computer games.  Are you going to connect satellite internet?  If necessary, in certain cases, you will need to purchase additional equipment. </p><p>  The most common device that you absolutely need to receive a digital television signal, and then transmit it to the TV screen, is the receiver. </p><p>  Without stocks, the cheapest set with a conditional access module will cost 4,990 rubles.  In the reviews of the receiver for the Tricolor TV, users say that they necessarily purchase it with a plate, they install everything.  Then they call the wizard, which connects and configures everything. </p><p>  After about a year of virtually uninterrupted operation, serious problems begin that are connected with the receiver.  Constantly there are updates for him, which in reality only go to the detriment of the equipment.  In addition, the design is changing, which is why it is simply inconvenient to use the services.  Over time, a new update package arrives, with which the receiver completely turns into a useless idle device. </p><p>  In the reviews of Tricolor TV, some users note that when problems become systemic, they are actually forced to switch to another provider.  They find in him much more comfortable conditions for virtually the same money.  After that, they only regret that for such a long period they collaborated with the company, depriving themselves of the opportunity to use really high-quality services for the provision of television content. </p><h2>  Conditional Access Modules </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn-----8kcg0acoixdbtfdti0pzb.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tricolor TV Company" class="if uuid-2969056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969056.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of the modules for Tricolor TV, customers say that the equipment itself is of a fairly high quality.  Which, unfortunately, cannot be said about the work of the provider.  In fact, a module is a plate into which a smart card of any digital satellite television operator is inserted.  It can be installed in any TV with a corresponding slot, a built-in satellite receiver. </p><p>  Users acknowledge that they have no complaints about the device itself, it is really high-quality.  But when using it with the Tricolor TV provider, problems regularly arise, as a result of which channels get lost, their usual order is violated, and quality is reduced. </p><p>  Because of this, it is increasingly possible to meet the opinions of customers who promise to swear that they will go to competitors as soon as possible. </p><h2>  Impressions of users about satellite television </h2><p>  It is <span>with satellite television</span> that most of the reviews about the work of this provider are connected.  In HD reviews of Tricolor TV, users acknowledge that they get really high quality for relatively little money.  The subscription fee is very democratic, at least for such a volume of services provided. </p><p>  In addition, when connecting a satellite TV in Tricolor, in the reviews they pay special attention to it, there is no monthly fee.  True, this can not be called a gift, since in reality it is included in the cost of equipment. </p><p>  The packages have a large number of really interesting channels, almost around the clock you can find at least something interesting for yourself.  In addition, the prevalence of this provider, which can be found anywhere in the Russian Federation, captivates. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on the work of Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2969054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2969054.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, the provider is increasingly promoting the satellite receiver on the market, designed to receive pictures in Full HD format.  In reviews of "Tricolor TV" with this option there are constant problems.  The model proposed by the company has not been finalized.  When connecting this receiver, no one notices at least some improvement in the quality of the transmitted picture. </p><p>  Neither numerous consultations, nor attempts to replace the cords with newer and clever ones help, the picture remains the same.  In addition, the technique is very moody when receiving a signal: after a reboot, the settings and channel order are lost. </p><p>  Problems constantly arise due to bad weather.  In heavy snow and rain, the quality starts to deteriorate rapidly, the same thing happens with gusts of wind.  The signal disappears, which is what viewers learn from TV screens together in order to watch their favorite shows.  Most of the channels that are contained in each package are encoded, they must be paid separately.  On some, in addition, they spin one advertisement around the clock. </p><p>  A poor selection of channels in packages, especially compared to other providers, is noted by most Tricolor users and customers.  In addition, the company is constantly setting excessive prices for Chinese-made equipment, which is frankly of poor quality. </p><p>  In general, the company does not respect its subscribers, many users have already seen this.  The policy of "Tricolor" is that they force subscribers to purchase new equipment, and at inflated prices.  With the old technology, practically no channel works at all.  In addition, the company regularly introduces new channel packages, canceling those that were before.  At the same time, prices for new subscriptions increase significantly.  The new packages promise that the number of channels will only increase, while they will be really interesting and in demand, but in reality the number is mainly growing due to the same type of ‚ÄúShops on the Sofa‚Äù, which no one is watching anyway. </p><p>  In some cities where satellite television is not as developed as in large settlements, people have to put up with the fact that they have no other options than to use the services of Tricolor TV.  Therefore, they are still connected to this provider, although in recent years the quality of its work has deteriorated significantly.  A lot of unflattering reviews about the company are connected with this. </p>
