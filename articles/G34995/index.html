Description, specifications, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cost of a coin of 2 pennies 1935 depends directly on the type of stamp used to produce it.  The change of the seals used in the work took place in the same year, so the coins of one year vary greatly in appearance, therefore, in value too. </p><div class="photo" data-original="monetyinfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopecks 1935" class="if uuid-3164592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3164592.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Collectors of rare monetary units call 1935 a very productive and interesting year for collecting.  Not every year coins of one denomination, but of a different sample were minted.  2 copecks of 1935 just concern those. </p><p>  These were coins produced by the Leningrad Mint.  "The people" took more than eighty million copies.  Initially, these banknotes were made of an alloy of bronze and aluminum.  The color is golden.  In the second half of the year, the coins changed color. </p><p>  2 pennies of 1935 did not possess the magnetic characteristics.  Weighed two grams.  Despite a decent circulation, treasure hunters say that finding such a penny is very, very difficult.  Especially rare are coins of a new sample, which were printed (according to preliminary and unverified data) about two dozen sets. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The central part of coin 2 kopeks of 1935 is occupied by the number "2".  Under it is the inscription "cents" and the year of manufacture.  At the very bottom, under the year of minting, there is a decorative point.  It is often found on monetary units of the time.  on the sides of the inscription are decorated with thin wicker ears of wheat.  Under the point below, they intersect with each other and then go around all the sides of the coin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  The most interesting is on the reverse side.  The central part of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union, which depicts the Earth, a sickle, a hammer and the sun with rays warming the earth, is what remains unchanged.  With the rest of the details on coin 2 of the 1935 penny, changes occur during the change of stamp. </p><p>  The ground on a coin is decorated with wheat stalks, gathered in small ears.  Ears, in turn, are covered with beautiful lush ribbons.  Three turns on each side, the seventh part of the tape collects ears of corn below.  In the upper part, where the spikelets converge, there is a five-pointed star. </p><p>  The coat of arms is surrounded by a thin line around the perimeter.  Further around the circle there is the famous Soviet slogan ‚ÄúPROLETARIANS OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNION!‚Äù.  Moreover, in the sentence all punctuation marks are observed. </p><p>  Here, as well as on the reverse side of the coin, there are decorative dots.  They are located after each letter in the inscription of the USSR.  "Country" is at the very bottom, under the image of the coat of arms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ngccoin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopecks 1935" class="if uuid-3162428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162428.jpg"></div><h2>  Changes </h2><p>  After the stamp was changed, coin 2 kopeks 1935 changed its appearance.  The following conversions have occurred: </p><ul><li>  A proposal with a call to unite, which circled the image of the Soviet coat of arms, was lost. </li><li>  The inner circle that circled the coat of arms disappeared. </li><li>  If the star was homogeneous, more uniform and rounded on the ‚Äúold‚Äù coin, then on the ‚Äúnew‚Äù coin it is split, pointed and sharp. </li><li>  The letters in the name of the state have also changed.  Now the USSR is written in square letters. </li><li>  The decorative dots that separated each letter were also removed. </li></ul><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  On this type of coin of 1935, a clearly noticeable marriage is very rare.  Only a few times coins got to the auctions, where there were: </p><ul><li>  splits </li><li>  convex form; </li><li>  concave shape; </li><li>  image rotations; </li><li>  excess metal near the image of the figure on the reverse. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopecks of 1935" class="if uuid-3162429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162429.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Coins with the slogan cost from ten to six hundred rubles.  Everything will depend on safety.  Next in ascending order are 2 kopecks of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù stamp, which are evaluated in different collections and at different auctions from 1200 to 80,000. Coins with any type of marriage can be sold for 100-1000 rubles.  The most expensive are considered ‚Äúremodelers,‚Äù that is, coins issued by Khrushchev‚Äôs personal order in very small quantities.  Here the price can reach 130,000 rubles or more. </p>
