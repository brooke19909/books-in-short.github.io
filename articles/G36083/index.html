Thailand is known for its amazing sights and equally exciting shows.  One of the places that are interesting for family visits is Phuket Fantasea Park.  It will be discussed about him in our article. </p><h2>  Park location </h2><p>  Thais are very good tourists, they have created many places for entertaining guests.  One of the most interesting places created for children is the Phuket Fantasea complex.  It is located in Kamal, just ten kilometers from the famous Patong.  The park occupies a fairly vast territory, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is about 57 hectares.  The entertainment complex was created by the rather famous Fan Group company in Thailand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasea photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225965.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Locals believe that Phuket Fantasea is the best place for families, as there are activities for visitors of all ages.  The entire territory of the park is divided into thematic zones, each of which has its own characteristics. </p><h2>  Market Street </h2><p>  According to tourists, the <span>amusement park</span> Phuket Fantasea should come long before the start of the show.  Then you will have enough time to take a walk along Fantasy Street and visit the numerous shops selling souvenirs.  Here you can find all the crafts that are available in Thailand.  Local craftsmen carve paintings from wood directly with tourists, make a variety of glass figures and other crafts.  You can also see real paintings carved from buffalo leather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All this is at the very beginning of the park.  We can safely say that every house-shop is a real center of art.  After all, masters create real masterpieces right before your eyes.  And you can buy any souvenir you like in memory of visiting Phuket Fantasea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasea reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225948.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are even several shops on the street that sell vibrant electronic, mechanical, and themed toys for children.  You can be carried away by the contemplation of cute little things without children.  Well, with kids it‚Äôs generally impossible to pass by such fascinating shops.  After all, I want to touch everything and carefully consider it. </p><p>  Here you can purchase all those products that are traditional for Thailand.  For example, in stores there is natural silk, leather products, jewelry with pearls and natural stones.  The range of goods presented on the shopping street is so wide that it is simply difficult to tell about everything. </p><h2>  Traditional fairground entertainment </h2><p>  Phuket Fantasea Park is hard to imagine without traditional fairground entertainment: dart throwing, shooting at a shooting range, climbing a rope, workshops, snake pulling and much more.  Right on the street, local craftsmen will teach you to cook colorful candies, chocolate, make Christmas toys, burn all kinds of pictures on a tree. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Elephants walk right through the park.  You can ride them and take stunning photos as a keepsake.  After the trip, the giant must definitely be thanked by offering him a treat.  Usually a large number of tourists who want to ride an elephant gather here. </p><p>  In the park you can see brightly dressed animators, funny clowns, live dolls, talking robots and much more.  Disney cartoon characters walk here.  The festival village is a place from which it is simply impossible to pick up children.  After all, there is something to see.  And local attractions are no less impressive for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasy phuket fantasea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225950.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Crowds of tourists watch the golden carps living in the artificial pool.  If desired, fish can be fed by purchasing special food.  Throwing a handful of food into the water, you will immediately see a swarming horde of golden beauties. </p><h2>  Park rides </h2><p>  In the territory of the Fantasy park (Phuket Fantasea, Phuket) there are many attractions.  Here you can find a variety of slot machines brought from different parts of the world.  In addition, in the park you can ride on swings, slides, carousels and other children's attractions.  Rope towns with real monkeys, live lizards and pigs in a living corner are waiting for the kids.  All children's entertainments are supported by bright luminous decorations that create a unique atmosphere of fun and celebration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tiger show </h2><p>  Tourists will definitely recommend visiting the Tiger Show.  Indoors in fluorescent light, you can see different animals: parrots, monitor lizards, and others.  A tiger, which has long been accustomed to posing in front of cameras, lives nearby.  And in one of the rooms there is a huge snake.  You can‚Äôt immediately guess that it is artificial, since the scarecrow moves very naturally. </p><h2>  Phuket Fantasea (Show Theme Park) </h2><p>  Show programs and attractions are something without which it is impossible to imagine the Fantasy park.  A very interesting show for children called ‚ÄúAdventures in the Jungle‚Äù allows viewers to see rare examples of albino animals, including white tigers.  There is also a terrarium with all kinds of reptiles. </p><p>  The king of monkeys shows children of various animals, among which there are not only snakes, but also lemurs, parrots, monkeys and others. </p><h2>  Park Restaurant </h2><p>  In the territory of the Fantasy Park (Phuket Fantasea, Phuket) there is even a restaurant that can be visited immediately before the evening performance.  By purchasing a ticket to the complex, you can immediately pay for dinner at the Golden Kinnari.  The institution begins to work only at six in the evening.  The restaurant is very large and can accommodate up to 4 thousand people in its halls.  Once in it for the first time, you get lost right away.  It is simply impossible to immediately appreciate its impressive size.  By the way, in southeast Asia, the institution is recognized as the most magnificent restaurant. </p><p>  The room has an amazing design.  Large catfish brought from <span>the Mekong River</span> are swimming near the pool entrance <span>.</span>  Their sizes are simply staggering.  A large carpet for the restaurant was made to order.  On it beautiful Kinnari are woven - mythical bird girls.  The walls of the room are painted with real frescoes depicting paintings from national folklore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasea park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225952.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The restaurant can offer you not only Thai dishes, but also international.  Most of them are meat dishes, but there are also fish dishes.  But drinks such as coffee, tea or water are provided free of charge. </p><p>  The restaurant has a separate lounge serving seafood dishes.  But to visit it you need to pay a certain amount, since the price of a standard ticket does not include such a service.  Paying 400 baht (700 p.) Per person, you can taste a variety of seafood.  The hall has a buffet system. </p><p>  The staff is very courteous and helpful, like all Thais.  The waiters pay attention to each guest, changing plates and adding drinks.  They say that the dishes in the restaurant are incredibly tasty, because there are amazing cooks, real masters who have been trained not only in Asia but also in Europe. </p><h2>  Elephant palace </h2><p>  In the territory of the Phuket Fantasea park, the reviews of which are given in the article, a modern theater is built where there is a richly decorated with gold hall for all kinds of banquets.  Around the most beautiful fountains, there is a pond with colorful fish and 999 statues of elephant protectors. </p><p>  The main attraction of the complex can rightfully be called the building of the Elephant Theater.  It is there that the famous Phuket Fantasea show is shown.  They say that the performance is comparable with the programs of the famous circus Du Soleil.  The program is based on the use of myths of Thailand.  The show will introduce tourists to the legends, history and culture of the country.  Artists perform in very bright national costumes.  The entire program is accompanied by Thai songs and music, even there are pyrotechnic effects. </p><p>  During the program you can see aerialists, magicians, ballet performances.  An indelible impression leaves a fire show.  The highlight of the program is the elephant show.  The performance involved more than 30 animals.  In addition to elephants, monkeys, elephants, buffalos, birds and other inhabitants of the park perform in the theater.  The performance lasts at least 90 minutes.  And it starts at nine in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225945.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The palace has impressive dimensions.  The auditorium accommodates up to three thousand people at a time.  It is decorated with gold, so that everything shines and shimmers.  In the interiors of the hall there are numerous figures of elephants, which are considered sacred animals in Thailand. </p><h2>  Park Schedule </h2><p>  The theater gives performances every evening, except Thursday.  Front row tickets are thought to be preferable due to good visibility.  For those who want to have dinner at a restaurant, the ticket will cost more (depending on the chosen dishes). </p><p>  If you do not have transport, then when buying a ticket you can immediately order a transfer that will take you to the complex and back to the hotel. </p><h2>  The nuances of visiting the park </h2><p>  You can take photos in Phuket Fantasea far from everywhere.  So, for example, walking on the festival street or having dinner in a restaurant, you can take pictures.  But at the entrance to the theater, cameras and telephones must be taken to a left-luggage office.  It is strictly forbidden to take any pictures during the show program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park phuket fantasea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225960.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, the park administration does not allow entering the territory of the complex with its own food.  An exception is allowed only for infants.  Yes, and smoking in the "Fantasy" is prohibited.  At the entrance to the park, guests go through a metal detector to check for weapons.  All these simple rules are worth knowing to avoid unpleasant surprises. </p><h2>  Phuket Fantasea Reviews </h2><p>  Resting in Phuket, you will certainly repeatedly see an advertisement of the Fantasy park.  And tour operators do not miss the opportunity to praise the famous show and sell you tickets for it.  But what are the reviews for Phuket Fantasea? </p><p>  Oddly enough, but the reviews of tourists are not so enthusiastic.  They can be called controversial with confidence.  Not all vacationers are satisfied with visiting an amusement park.  According to tourists, the institution is more focused on children, and adults in it are quite boring and uninteresting.  The park is not suitable for the title of place for family vacations. </p><p>  If you are going to visit the entertainment complex, then you should immediately think about the transfer.  With a rented bike, you can easily get to the right place and save significantly.  Tourists do not recommend taking a taxi, since it is quite expensive, it is better to use the park's transfer. </p><p>  On average, the cost of an inexpensive ticket along with travel costs at least 3,700 rubles.  The price of tickets in the front row is much more expensive.  If you wish, you can order dinner in the restaurant of the complex.  This is done at the time of purchase of tickets, because the meal is included in the price.  The impressions of visiting the restaurant are mixed.  Tourists note that the institution itself is very beautiful and amazing with luxury.  But his menu leaves much to be desired.  In general, you can completely do without dinner.  On the territory there is a buffet and a VIP buffet in which you can have a meal and feed the child, since no food can be taken with you. </p><h2>  General impression of the show program </h2><p>  The hall in which performances are held impresses with its frescoes and numerous decorations.  As for the show program, most tourists note that only the performance of elephants and acrobats is of interest.  There are few other animals involved in the program.  But the performance of the artists is not professional.  Of course, children do not notice such things and remain delighted.  But adults are very critical of the show, saying that the cost of such entertainment is quite overpriced. </p><h2>  Reviews about the park </h2><p>  On the territory of the Fantasy park there are attractions for children.  All of them are quite simple, so do not expect anything special.  In general, the complex is not badly decorated, but all the decorations are plastic, which is not particularly impressive.  There are a lot of shops on the shopping street with all kinds of souvenirs, goods and fakes.  Experienced travelers recommend shopping not in the park, but in any market in Thailand, where the same things will cost you much cheaper.  In general, a shopping street is more like an area for shopping than an amusement park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket fantasea show theme park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2225958.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But the theater building is really worthy of attention, because it is made in the Thai style.  Inside it has a rich decoration.  Some rooms have exhibits. </p><h2>  Park impression </h2><p>  Fantasy Park is a place that can only be visited once with a child.  Adults there are not very interested, especially if you do not share children's games.  In general, the institution is worthy of attention.  However, going to the park, remember that the photo is allowed to be taken only on the street.  At the entrance to the theater you will have to turn in the cameras and the phone to the left-luggage office.  Unfortunately, to photograph cute elephants for which people come here is not possible during the program. </p>
