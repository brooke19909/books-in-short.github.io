    <h2>  Characteristic Approaches </h2><p>  Science can be considered in various aspects.  It can be characterized as: </p><ol><li>  A specific <span>form of social consciousness</span> based on a knowledge system. </li><li>  The process of knowing the laws of the objective world. </li><li>  A certain type of division of labor in society. </li><li>  One of the key factors of social development. </li><li>  The process of developing knowledge and its application in practice. </li></ol><h2>  <span>Science: subject,</span> objectives, goals </h2><p>  The knowledge gained through simple observation is undoubtedly of great importance to man.  However, it will not reveal the essence of the phenomena, the relationships between them, which will explain the reasons for the occurrence of a particular phenomenon, with a certain degree of probability to predict its subsequent development.  The correctness of scientific knowledge is determined not only by logic.  As a prerequisite is checking it in practice.  <span>What is the purpose of science?</span>  <span>It</span> consists in the study of the laws of nature and society.  The results are used to influence the environment to obtain useful benefits.  Each study has its own subject.  <span>The purpose of science is the study of</span> phenomena to search for answers to the questions posed.  The problems that the researcher formulates are determined by the topic of knowledge.  <span>The goals and objectives of</span> science are being implemented in stages.  The study begins with the collection of facts, their analysis and systematization.  Information is summarized, certain laws are revealed.  The obtained research results allow us to build a logically ordered system of knowledge.  On its basis, certain facts are explained, new ones are predicted.  <span>The main goal of science</span> , therefore, is to obtain information to describe the existing reality, build models for its future development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goals and objectives of science" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1545296.jpg" width="275"></div>

The process of cognition involves, among other things, the accumulation of facts.  Moreover, they should be systematized, generalized, logically comprehended.  Without these actions, the <span>goal of science</span> cannot be realized.  Systematization and generalization of facts is carried out using simple abstractions.  They are concepts that are key elements of science.  Definitions that have a broader content are called categories.  For example, they include concepts about the content and form of phenomena. </p><h2>  Items </h2><p>  Realizing the <span>goal of science</span> , any scientist uses axioms, principles, postulates.  They mean the initial position of a certain direction of knowledge.  They are considered the basic form of systematization.  The laws are the most important link in the system.  They reflect the most stable, significant, objective repetitive relationships in various phenomena (natural, social, etc.).  As a rule, laws are presented in the form of a certain ratio of categories and concepts.  One of the highest forms of generalization and systematization of information is theory.  It is understood as scientific methods and principles that make it possible to logically comprehend and cognize processes, analyze the influence of various factors on them, and suggest options for their use in practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main goal of science" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1545332.jpg"></div>

The method is a key tool to achieve the <span>goal of science</span> - to discover and justify the objective laws of reality.  Any theory, within the framework of which the nature of any processes is explained, is always associated with a particular particular way of research.  Based on general and <span>special methods, the</span> scientist receives answers to the initial questions: where to start studying, how to relate to facts, how to generalize them, how to come to conclusions.  Today, the role of a quantitative method of studying processes and phenomena is becoming increasingly important.  This is due to the rapid development of computers, computational mathematics, cybernetics. </p><h2>  Hypotheses </h2><p>  They are used when the scientist does not have enough material to achieve the ultimate <span>goal of the study.</span>  The hypothesis is a reasonable assumption.  It is formulated to explain the phenomenon and can be confirmed or disproved after verification.  The hypothesis is often the original description, the "draft" law. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="science subject task objectives" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1545298.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Production Relations </h2><p>  The development of science, the implementation of its tasks, acts as a starting point for the revolution of practice.  The results obtained in the course of research allow you to create new industries.  Science today acts as the driving force of society.  This is due to the following factors.  First of all, many types of industries and technological operations are initially born in research institutes.  The formation of chemical technologies, nuclear energy, the production of specific materials is far from a complete list of the advanced achievements of the research institute.  Equally important is the reduction in the time between the immediate opening and its introduction into production.  More recently, this gap could stretch for decades.  Today, for example, several years have passed from the discovery of the laser to its practical application.  It is also worth mentioning that in the production sphere research is developing quite successfully, the network of scientific and industrial institutions is expanding.  Today, the creative collaboration of scientists, workers, engineers has become relevant.  In addition, the professional level of staff has sharply increased.  Employees of enterprises widely apply scientific knowledge in practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the purpose of science" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1545299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Types of Research </h2><p>  <span>Scientific activity</span> , depending on the purpose, can be theoretical or applied.  In the first case, research is focused on the development and formulation of new principles.  As a rule, they are called fundamental.  Their goal is to expand the knowledge that society has.  <span>Basic research</span> fosters a deeper understanding of the laws of nature.  Theoretical developments are used mainly in the further development of new areas of knowledge.  Applied research is focused on the development of new methods for creating equipment, materials, technologies, etc. Their goal is to meet the needs of society in the development of a specific manufacturing industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="purpose of science study" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1545300.jpg" width="216"></div>

    <h2>  Applied Development </h2><p>  They are short- and long-term, budgetary, etc. Their goal is to transform research into technical applications.  The end result is the preparation of material for practical use.  As a rule, special design bureaus, pilot and design facilities are involved in this.  In this case, the work is performed according to a certain scheme.  At the initial stage, the theme is formulated.  As it can be a certain scientific and technical issue.  An important stage in the development process is the substantiation of the topic.  The final stage is the implementation of the research results and verification of their effectiveness. </p>
