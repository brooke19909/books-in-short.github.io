Here guests can fully enjoy the monastery culture and spirituality.  This place is suitable for tourists and business people.  You can also have an unforgettable celebration here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reseption" class="if uuid-2537945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/2537945.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the very center of the city is the Monastery Hotel in Minsk.  The address is 6. Cyril and Methodius Street. In the immediate vicinity are attractions such as the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, the Palace of the Republic, the Great Patriotic War Museum, Island of Tears, Gorky Park and others.  Also nearby are numerous catering establishments, shops and urban sites. </p><p>  How to get to the Monastyrsky Hotel in Minsk from the railway station?  You need to walk to the metro station "Ploshchad Lenina" (about three minutes) and get to the station "Oktyabrskaya".  After about 600 meters, you will be taken to a hotel. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.90508516031098" data-lng="27.557622093254054" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="19"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/2/6/5/4265.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Hotel "Monastery" in Minsk is located in the historical center, on one of the oldest streets - Cyril and Methodius.  The hotel building is a former Bernardine monastery for men, which was founded in 1624 and operated until the 19th century.  It included a church, a fraternal corps, and a refectory, and a school, and a hospital, and stables, and many other objects that represent a whole block. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 1860s, the monastery was closed.  After that, military barracks, fire departments, and even a prison were located here.  And in the church to this day archival documents and scientific and technical literature are kept. </p><p>  In 2009-2014, a restoration was carried out, thanks to which it was possible to preserve architectural objects and restore decorative elements.  During the repair work, fragments of frescoes were found, which were also partially restored.  And unique fragments of tiles were found, on the model of which it was possible to produce a unique finishing material for corridors. </p><p>  Perhaps the most interesting find is a mysterious room in the lower level of the building.  He is not on any plane of the monastery.  Employees believe that the spirit of a monk lives in this room, who wanders through the dungeons at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lobby" class="if uuid-2537953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/2537953.jpg"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The Monastyrsky Hotel in Minsk provides 48 rooms of various categories of comfort.
