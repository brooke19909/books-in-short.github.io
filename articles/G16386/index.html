    <p>  The focus of this article is a combined version of a DVR, navigator and radar detector.  The South Korean company manufacturing accessories for cars presented for the CIS countries all the requested functionality in one device and at an affordable price (10,000 rubles).  His name is Sho-Me Combo 3. Reviews, description, review and specifications will help the reader find out more information about the new product on the domestic automobile market. </p><h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  Such a symbiosis of the three popular automotive accessories is quite explainable - car owners want to not only drive comfortably on the roads.  Many drivers are pleased to see one device on the car windshield, not three.  It was the comfort of the car enthusiast that became the main criterion for the manufacturer, who introduced the 3-in-1 device to the world - a navigator, a video recorder, a Sho-Me Combo 3 radar detector. You cannot find negative reviews about the combination of these three car accessories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for pricing, here the manufacturer went to meet buyers.  Similar in functionality devices will cost the future owner exactly 2 times more expensive.  However, as practice shows, three separate devices are still rational in use, because when one component fails, the other two continue to work.  And in combined systems, the owner loses all the functionality immediately. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  The combined device comes in a colorful box of large sizes, but the buyer should not be afraid that the registrar itself will be as huge as it is shown in the media in the photo.  The gadget itself is small and from afar resembles a digital camera.  In addition to the device itself, in the box, the user will find a bracket for attaching the gadget to the car windshield, several interface cables and a huge instruction manual. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the manual is the most important accessory that has a Sho-Me Combo 3 DVR. Owner reviews claim that it is impossible to configure and commission the device without instructions, and there are no step-by-step actions for users in the media, in descriptions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Registrar Specifications </h2><p>  For video shooting there is a 2-megapixel sensor that is capable of recording video in MP4 format at FullHD resolution (1920 x 1080 dpi).  The video stream rate is 30 frames per second, and the H.264 codec is used to compress the data.  This is not to say that these specifications are perfect, but they are enough to look at the license plate numbers and faces of drivers while driving.  Indeed, for this, the Sho-Me Combo 3 car DVR is needed. User reviews flattering describe the lens, with which you can not only adjust the sharpness of the image, but also change the focus. </p><h2>  Additional functionality of the DVR </h2><p>  The device has a built-in memory of 1 gigabyte, and also supports removable memory cards.  True, there are restrictions on the volume of media, it is 32 gigabytes.  The device supports loop recording, and also has the function of saving video in extreme conditions.  Let it sound proud, but in fact it is very simple: the Sho-Me Combo 3 DVR has a built-in G-sensor, which disables overwrite from the shock, allowing the owner to view the captured material at any convenient time. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, all parameters are customizable, and it will not be difficult for the user to determine the strength of the blow, as well as solve the problem with rewriting cycles.  It‚Äôs a pity the memory card‚Äôs volume is small, maybe the manufacturer will correct this shortcoming by issuing a new firmware for the combined device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Special navigator </h2><p>  As for the quality of work with satellites, the Sho-Me Combo 3 <span>GPS</span> DVR <span>, the reviews</span> are positive.  Even with a <span>cold start</span> (after removing the battery), positioning takes no more than five minutes.  The device supports loading geographical maps, can update and demonstrates stable operation during the ride.  The owner of the vehicle can fully trust the navigator, because, unlike Chinese devices, the gadget will not lead him to a dead end or to the oncoming lane of one-way traffic. </p>

    <p>  Navigator software has a built-in ‚Äúcorrect driving‚Äù function.  It is it that causes negativity among all device owners.  After all, when <span>speeding, a</span> meticulous voiced voice constantly reports this (of course, with an increase).  Many car enthusiasts cannot understand why then a radar detector, if a conventional navigator cares so much about the user. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the navigation system </h2><p>  And if the owners, judging by their reviews, have no complaints about the hardware of the device, then there are a lot of questions to the program for working with navigation.  Better to start with the fact that in GPS mode it is impossible to mute the sound.  Quieter - please, but completely de-energize the speaker will not work.  Naturally, this causes a big negative of those around the Sho-Me Combo 3 device. Owner reviews are full of ready-made solutions to fix the problem: some recommend installing unofficial firmware, while others are easier to solder an additional resistor for the speaker. </p><p>  Support for all kinds of maps does not extend to street names of small cities.  It is unclear what resources the manufacturer used, but apparently he never heard of Yandex cards.  It is the search for the desired address in small towns and is the second most important negative in this combined device.  And again, all the hopes of users for the updated firmware. </p><h2>  Savior of all motorists </h2><p>  Many car owners assure others that the car repair, as well as the purchase of new alloy wheels, were provided by the Sho-Me Combo 3 radar detector. The reviews are understandable - fans of fast driving simply saved on fines.  One can talk about the effectiveness of radar detection, and more precisely about its methods for detecting and using all kinds of frequencies, to infinity.  It will be easier to summarize - on the roads of the CIS countries, as well as a small part of Eastern Europe, there is not a single radar that could not detect Sho-Me Combo 3. </p>

    <p>  That's just to achieve maximum efficiency in determining the effect of the radar, you need to fine-tune the device.  And to do this without a real radar is very difficult.  The fact is that the manufacturer has equipped the gadget with several detection modes that you can independently configure (city, highway, speed, etc.).  In the factory version, they work poorly - the radar squeaks on city streets or is inactive on the highway when driving at high speed. </p><h2>  Device control panel </h2><p>  The registrar's LCD screen does not support touch input.  This is really a serious mistake of the manufacturer, because the 21st century is in the yard, and you need to somehow comply with market trends.  And do not think that a large number of buttons can correct the situation with entering data into Sho-Me Combo 3. Owner reviews claim that it‚Äôs convenient to switch modes only with keys, but it‚Äôs difficult to fine-tune it - it takes time, perseverance and the ability to read operating instructions . </p>

    <p>  As for the buttons, here the manufacturer managed to upset all the buyers.  The keys located on both edges of the device are fully involved in controlling the device.  Accordingly, before entering data, you need to study the functionality of all buttons and only then make settings. </p><h2>  Oddities in the work of firmware </h2><p>  For a Sho-Me Combo 3 combo device, negative reviews always begin with a description of the software.  The fact is that the manufacturer supplies the market with unverified firmware.  Correcting one mistake, the programmers of the company commit another.  There are also complaints about the manufacturer - technologists install the first version of the software in the device, trusting the end user with the update.  Yes, this solution is simpler, but many customers who purchase a registrar immediately install it in the machine, and do not run to change the firmware.  Hence all the negatives: second dips in the recording, the inability to change the sound volume, the lack of G-sensor settings and many other inconveniences. </p><h2>  Hardware Features </h2><p>  Owners of a combined device should take care of having a card reader on the computer if they want to view the footage at home.  The problem is that when connecting the recorder to a personal computer or laptop, it is impossible to detect the Sho-Me Combo 3 radar detector at the hardware level. User reviews say that the whole problem is in drivers that simply do not exist for all operating systems except Windows 10. </p>

    <p>  There are questions about the operation of the HDMI interface.  It is not possible to get acquainted with the footage on the LCD TV display.  Naturally, many questions arise for the non-working interface of all motorists.  However, the manual, in the description section of the HDMI port in black and white, says that this controller is designed to be expanded and it works only in the navigator mode.  Many users hope that when updating the firmware of the device, the manufacturer will fix this problem in the HDMI port. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Excellent functionality, but raw software - this is how you can briefly describe the combined device Sho-Me Combo 3. User reviews only confirm these conclusions.  Indeed, no one has any complaints about the hardware (if you close your eyes to the button functionality): radar detector, navigator, video recorder - everything functions perfectly.  A lot of settings, a convenient menu, small dimensions, a choice of modes - what else does a motorist need?  But the program part of the questions can not be counted.  Therefore, the conclusion on the combined device is obvious - it is better for demanding customers to look for another solution on the market, and all other potential owners will need strong nerves to fine-tune the multifunctional gadget. </p>
