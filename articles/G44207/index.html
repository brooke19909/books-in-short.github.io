This country, with its distinctive culture, seems to be in the past, despite all the latest technologies, cars and airplanes.  It is just as quiet and peaceful as it was 100 and 200 years ago.  Rather, it is good for those who want to really relax from the noise, crowds and crowds.  If you belong to this category of travelers, then the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel will be a good place to spend time with your family. </p><h2>  Mahdia </h2><p>  This small town with a stretch can be called a resort, since it does not yet have those features by which you recognize similar settlements around the world: </p><ul><li>  There is a huge number of people scurrying back and forth on business and without work. </li><li>  There is no usual noise of voices, crying or cries of numerous children and parents screaming at them. </li><li>  Nobody grabs hands and tries to sell some consumer goods on the go. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps all these signs will someday become the property of Mahdia, but the guests of this city write in their reviews about him that they would not want this to happen with such a nice and cozy village.  The only drawback that none of the clients of the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel in Tunisia could not keep silent about is the incredible dirt on the way to the city, and even in it.  This is due to poor work or its complete absence of services responsible for garbage collection.  Unfortunately, this problem in the country is acute at the state level. </p>

    <p>  You should be aware that choosing the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel as a place to relax in Mahdia in Tunisia, you agree to a quiet relaxing holiday without exciting attractions, spectacular shows, discos and foam parties.  When traveling in a Muslim country, you should not only remember that the traditions and life of its people are very different from your usual surroundings, but also respect and, if possible, not violate local rules.  In the rest, Mahdia is a hospitable city in which the weather is always good, clean beaches and the sea with incredible turquoise water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thapsus Aquapark Hotel and Local Traditions </h2><p>  In this city there are only a dozen hotels located on the first line from the sea.  You should not expect something supernatural from the local service and staff.  The resort is only a little over 20 years old, and all the hotels in the city are still considered new, and their employees are new to customer service. </p><p>  Thapsus Aquapark 4 * is the same.  A beautiful five-story building in bright colors, like all buildings in Tunisia, as if he wants to embrace the territory belonging to him.  If you believe the reviews, then in fact there are 4 floors in the hotel, since it has a zero and a basement floor, where customers are accommodated when all the rooms are already occupied. </p>

    <p>  A large spacious lounge with nice reception staff welcomes guests at any time of the year.  As many Russian tourists complain in Mahdia, and throughout Tunisia, the priority service is exclusively Muslims, no matter where they come from.  Unfortunately, this tradition extends to the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel.  To ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the local tradition, you should be persistent and stand your ground until you prove that you have the right to a room with an improved layout. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  As practice shows, you should not believe everything that is written on the Internet and you can not trust exclusively negative reviews about the hotel or resort.  As a rule, the truth is somewhere in between.  About the hotel Thapsus Club Hotel (Thapsus Aquapark 4 *, as many travelers know it) they write a lot and different things.  In general, the reviews are positive, including about the rooms.  There are 330 of them in the hotel, and they are presented in the following categories: </p><ul><li>  Quadruple rooms are 26 m2 with garden views.  There is everything for a comfortable stay: a soft bed for sleeping, armchairs and a sofa for watching TV on satellite TV, air conditioning and a balcony on which it is nice to meet the dawn and see off another day spent in Tunisia.  Bathroom and toilet with necessary bath accessories, minibar and wardrobes for things. </li><li>  Single rooms are equipped with a double bed and the same amenities as the quadruple apartments.  The view from the balcony may be of the sea, garden or pool. </li><li>  Triple rooms have an <span>adjoining room</span> and are furnished as elegantly as all apartments in Thapsus Aquapark 4 * (Mahdia, Tunisia). </li></ul>

    <p>  Guest reviews differ somewhat in the description of the rooms, but overall they are benevolent.  The furniture is quite comfortable, it‚Äôs very pleasant to sleep in the apartments after all the fun and the beach, there is peace and quiet around.  What else do you need for a family vacation? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  When the word "Africa" ‚Äã‚Äãis uttered, a picture of the Sahara desert, the heat and travelers dying of thirst, immediately appears in consciousness.  Modern Africa (this is where Tunisia is located) includes air conditioning in every room, cars and buses with an air conditioning system, and numerous establishments serving soft drinks for every taste. </p><p>  The territory of the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel in Mahdia (Tunisia) is: </p><ul><li>  garden with palm trees and exotic flowers; </li><li>  pools with such refreshing clean water that you want to dive into it without thinking; </li><li>  these are sun loungers in green clearings, where you can "catch" the largest amount of ultraviolet radiation; </li><li>  bars with cold drinks, which quick waiters bring to the place of rest. </li></ul>

    <p>  Do not believe those who claim that good service does not apply to non-believers.  In their reviews, tourists write that the best incentive for the excellent work of the staff of the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel is a smile and a tip, and this tradition extends to the entire resort town. </p><p>  Also on the territory of the hotel are available to vacationers: </p><ul><li>  hammam and sauna (for a fee); </li><li>  playground and playhouse; </li><li>  sun terraces; </li><li>  swimming pool, including children; </li><li>  minigolf and horse riding; </li><li>  table tennis and billiard room. </li></ul><p>  For lovers of real golf, there is a professional field 3 km from the hotel, but playing it is paid. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  What is worth going to Thapsus Aquapark 4 * in Tunisia for the sake of its beach.  White sand springing underfoot, gentle sloping into the sea, turquoise water, warm as fresh milk, and most importantly, even in the midst of the season, the coast is barely full. </p><p>  This amazing quality of the beach near the hotel is noted by all its guests, but there are those who are unhappy with the lack of a bar on it.  It is strange to complain about this in a Muslim country where alcohol is not honored. </p><p>  Another feature of the hotel's beach is the presence of a fence and a wicket, which closes every evening at 19:00, so you can‚Äôt count on getting together until late.  As many vacationers write, both the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel and its beach are just perfect for families with small children. </p><h2>  What is Tunisia fed </h2><p>  What can be concluded from the reviews of vacationers about how they feed at the hotel and what the local cuisine is like, is that there are less people dissatisfied with life. </p><p>  In truth, the cooks at the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel in Mahdia are many and tasty.  What gourmets can expect at the buffet are: </p><ul><li>  4-5 varieties of meat cooked in various ways - grilling, stewing, frying, baking in foil. </li><li>  Fish and seafood - from shrimp to octopus. </li><li>  Served with vegetables and rice. </li><li>  Large selection of fruits and ice cream. </li><li>  Famous Oriental Sweets </li></ul>

    <p>  According to most hotel guests, the menu is quite varied, and if you take something new every day, then you can never repeat it in 2 weeks. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and service at the hotel </h2><p>  Tunisians are a friendly and hospitable people.  The last concept includes caring for the guest, which at Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel is manifested in the following: </p><ul><li>  <span>Daily maid</span> service and change of bed linen and towels.  Some guests in their reviews note that the plumbing in the bathroom is polished to such a brilliance that it seems that it was just installed. </li><li>  For business people there is a conference room with the necessary equipment for presentations. </li><li>  A hairdresser, laundry and dry cleaning services are available. </li><li>  Shops are located directly on site. </li></ul><p>  As customers note in their reviews, in general, the staff at Thapsus Aquapark 4 * is very responsive, and you do not have to go to them several times with the same request.  If something breaks down in the room, the master comes and repairs or changes everything. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Do not go to Mahdia for those who crave vivid impressions.  There are none in this city.  Quiet streets with little traffic, a minimum of shops and only a few bars, only one of which makes decent cocktails. </p><p>  In the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel itself (reviews note this), there are no entertainments per se either.  Animation is rather weak, a disco, karaoke and evening programs - this is perhaps all you can count on. </p><p>  But outside the hotel lies a whole ancient world.  You can buy a tour to the famous Carthage and admire its ruins, which only in a small part can convey the former greatness of the famous kingdom. </p><p>  Those who prefer modern entertainment to all the ruins of the world will really enjoy the Medinat Elzahra laser show, which you can enjoy while enjoying a dinner of national dishes. </p><h2>  What do active people offer </h2><p>  For those who are used to being in good shape and keep themselves fit, a choice of sea sports and entertainment: </p><ul><li>  Riding a boat and a banana. </li><li>  Parachuting to the sky. </li><li>  Diving, the benefit of pure and clear water allows you to dive as deep as possible. </li></ul>

    <p>  By the way, in Mahdia you can take a five-day course for beginners for only $ 350 with daily training.  Perhaps the local marine inhabitants will not interest sophisticated submariners, but for beginners this is an excellent base for preparing and gaining experience. </p><h2>  Extreme entertainment </h2><p>  As indicated in the reviews of the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel (photos confirm this), there are not so many interesting things in the city itself, but if you take a two-day tour to the Sahara desert with an overnight stay, this experience will be unforgettable.  Camel riding and jeep riding, endless dunes and huge stars in the night sky are unlikely to be forgotten soon.  What could be more attractive than feeling like a Bedouin in a desert that has been ‚Äúlooking‚Äù for thousands of years into the same sky as you? </p><h2>  What to bring from Tunisia </h2><p>  Mahdia is a famous silk production center throughout Tunisia.  It is here that wedding dresses are woven for all the brides of the country, because according to custom, a girl should be dressed exclusively in clothes made of this fabric.  It is worth going to the local bazaar and buying a silk shawl or a cloak for memory. </p><p>  There is also a large selection of souvenirs, ceramics and paintings, because not far from Mahdia is Sidi bou Said - a city of poets and artists. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to local fruits and dried fruits, which are sold at a purely symbolic price. </p><h2>  Rest in silence </h2><p>  As a rule, they go to Tunisia, and precisely to Mahdia, behind the "sea" and silence.  The beaches of the city are good, and many tourists resting in Thapsus Aquapark 4 * are surprised that all the sand on the territory that belongs to it is cleaned by hand with a rake.  This approach allows you to find some traffic jams from soda bottles or cigarette butts buried in some negligent hotel customers in the sand. </p>

    <p>  The coastline is so long and wide that even in the most ‚Äúresort‚Äù months there are several meters of free space between vacationers. </p><p>  The absence of unwanted living creatures in the sea and the sandy gently sloping bottom allow the kids to dabble in it all day.  At the same time, parents can safely read their favorite book or enjoy drinks from the bar, located right next to the beach fence.  The only inconvenience is that you have to go for each glass yourself. </p><p>  At night, nothing disturbs sleep, only the splashing of waves is heard, and the "whisper" of palm branches swaying under the light breeze.  For daytime entertainment with children, a beach and a pool with slides at the hotel are enough, but if this is not enough, you can take your baby to the zoo, where he will get acquainted with the African flora and fauna. </p><p>  Choosing Tunisia and the Thapsus Aquapark 4 * hotel as a place to relax, make sure that you are familiar with local traditions.  So, if you want to visit a mosque, you must definitely have decent clothes for these purposes - a dress with long sleeves or trousers with a shirt. </p><p>  Tunisians are a very friendly and courteous people, so any disputes, if they arise, should be conducted in a restrained tone, without showing disrespect to the interlocutor.  For the rest, this country is a great place to spend time with your family in the peace and quiet of nature, as ancient as the continent itself. </p>
