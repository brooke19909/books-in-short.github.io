It is on the balance of the phone that there is often some amount that could help out by being on the balance of a bank card.  The mobile operator allows subscribers to transfer money to a card with Tele2.  How to do it?  Let's consider several ways in the article. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer from server" class="if uuid-3040482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114090/3040482.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to transfer funds is through online transfer.  How to transfer money from Tele2 to a card using the online service? </p><ol><li>  First you need to go to the provider's official website. </li><li>  Select the ‚ÄúTransfer from phone to card‚Äù tab. </li><li>  In the window that appears, enter the transfer data: phone number without a figure eight, personal account of the card to which you need to transfer funds, and the amount.  The card number is on the front side and consists of 16 or 18 digits. </li><li>  Next, you need to familiarize yourself with the translation rules and click the appropriate button if you agree to the terms of service. </li><li>  To confirm the operation, you will receive an SMS with a code that will need to be entered in the window that appears on the site. </li></ol><p>  It is necessary to transfer funds through the online service through your account.  Therefore, if you are not registered in the system, first go through a quick authentication. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  SMS </h2><p>  <span>You can transfer money from Tele2 to Sberbank card</span> via SMS.  To do this, you need to write a message and send it to operator number 159. The text of the message should turn out like this: card (card number) (transfer amount).  Sending a message is free, but a transfer fee is charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilegram.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card transfer" class="if uuid-3040512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114090/3040512.jpg"></div><p>  You can use SMS to transfer money from a card to a Tele2 phone.  If you have a card of Sberbank of Russia, then you need to write a message to number 900 with the text: tel (phone number) (amount).  For example, you want to top up your balance with 205 rubles.  Your message will look like this: TEL 12345678910 205. </p><p>  In order to replenish the balance of a mobile phone tied to a card, you just need to send an SMS with the amount topped up without a penny.  Money comes almost instantly, and a transfer fee is not charged. </p><h2>  USSD request </h2><p>  You can quickly translate using short queries.  On the phone you need to dial the command: * 159 * 1 * card number * transfer amount #.  Check the data and press the call button. </p><p>  You can also transfer money from Tele2, both to the bank card and to the cards of other mobile operators, by dialing * 135 #.  Next, follow the instructions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Operator Offices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mxsmart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office Tele2" class="if uuid-3040508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114090/3040508.jpg"></div><p>  You can transfer to a bank card from the phone balance by writing a statement at any Tele2 office.  To do this, you need a passport to confirm your identity, and a bank card number.  All data will need to be reported to an office employee who will help to complete the operation.  The commission for the transfer through the operator‚Äôs office is charged in the same amount as with other methods of transfer.  With this method, the transfer of funds takes up to five business days. </p><h2>  Terms and Fees </h2><p>  Before transferring money from Tele2 to a card, you need to find out all the conditions for providing the service. </p><p>  The transfer is available to subscribers who have been using a SIM card for at least two months, and the tariff should be on a prepaid payment system for services.  You can transfer money to a VISA or MasterCard of any bank.  For corporate clients, the transfer service to a bank card is not available. </p><p>  Money transfers can be carried out not only in Russia, but also in the CIS countries.  You can use the service any day and time of day. </p><p>  A commission from 50 to 400 rubles is taken for a transfer to a bank card.  Its size fully depends on the amount of transfer.  More detailed information on commissions can be found by calling the information number 611. </p><p>  Money can be transferred only from the personally paid subscriber amount.  It is not possible to transfer funds from the amount of the promised payment or bonuses.  In order to find out the available amount for transferring to the card, you need to enter the command * 104 # and press the call key.  The maximum possible amount of money that can be transferred to the card account will appear on the screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="operevodah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money transaction" class="if uuid-3040518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114090/3040518.jpg"></div><p>  The minimum transfer amount is 50 rubles.  Keep in mind that the maximum possible amount per day cannot exceed 15 thousand rubles.  The limit of transfers per month is 500 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Before transferring money from Tele2 to a card, make sure that after transferring and withdrawing a commission, at least ten rubles will remain on the balance.  If the potential balance is less than this amount, the terms of the provider cannot be transferred. </p><p>  Under the terms of the operator‚Äôs agreement, it is also said that funds can be credited to the account within three banking days.  However, in most cases, the money appears on the card almost immediately. </p><p>  Transferring money from Tele2 to a bank card is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.  Choose for yourself the most convenient way and use.  The main thing is to carefully check the details of the account so that there are no misunderstandings after sending the funds, and they arrive at that addressee. </p>
