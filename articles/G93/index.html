But along with this political system, Greece also tested other forms of government.  Suffice it to say that in his writings Aristotle, along with democracy (he calls it politics), fully admits the aristocracy and the monarchy.  Aristotle called each deviation from royal authority tyranny.  Depending on the particular form of government adopted at the moment, the ruler in ancient Greece could be called differently.  In each case, this depended on the mode in which the country was governed. </p><h2>  Crete Mycenaean period </h2><p>  Perhaps the earliest of the studied periods of Ancient Greece existed in the <span>Bronze Age.</span>  Available texts suggest monarchical principles of government in those days.  The ruler in Ancient Greece bore the name "Vanaka", which translated as "master", "lord", "king".  Along with the supreme ruler, power (possibly executive) was exercised by the Basileus.  It is noteworthy that in later times the word basileus would mean ‚Äúking‚Äù.  But at the dawn of Greek civilization, the Basileus performed other, more modest functions related to administration and military affairs. </p><h2>  The Age of Homer </h2>

    <p>  In the <span>Iron Age</span> , a new type of socio-political system was formed in Greece - policies.  At this time, Homer writes his wonderful works - The Iliad and The Odyssey.  From his description of the <span>Trojan War,</span> one can draw many names that were the rulers of ancient Greece.  The list of Basileuses, by then already having received the full power, is quite large.  Along with the names of the kings, such as Odysseus, Diomedes, Nestor, Achilles, entire dynasties are mentioned - Atrides, Labdakids, Neleids and others.  All rulers in ancient Greece were considered descendants of the gods.  With all this, the dynastic monarchy in this country did not work out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tyrant time </h2><p>  At the turn of the 7-6th centuries.  BC  e.  in many policies, power passed into the hands of tyrants.  Some of them were quite vibrant and successful personalities, who would later be called the "rulers of ancient Greece."  Their names are Periander, Pisistratus, Kipsel and others.  A characteristic feature that applies to all rulers at this time is the transience and short duration of power.  Indicative in this sense was the biography of the tyrant Dionysius, who ruled in Syracuse.  He was elected to the post of auto-strategist during the period of hostilities, but after the enemy laid down his arms, Dionysius continued to rule Syracuse until the end of his life. </p>

    <h2>  Archons </h2><p>  During the democratic period of the existence of polis-states, the city was governed by constitutional magistracy, which was dominated by archons.  Translated from Greek, the archon is a ruler, chief, leader.  Another word that the ruler in ancient Greece could call himself is tag.  For example, in Thessaly, Jason Fersky deservedly called himself a tag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rulers of ancient Greece names" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/696422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most of the policies on the composition of their rule could be called either democratic or oligarchic.  The difference was that in a democratic society all free citizens had the <span>right to vote</span> , in an oligarchic society only people of high material wealth.  A good example of the leader of a democratic camp was Pericles.  His influence was so enormous that he earned the honorary nickname "demagogue" which means "dominant over the people."  Over time, this word has acquired a negative connotation.  But under Pericles, the bearer of the demagogue enjoyed well-deserved respect. </p><p>  After the conquest of Greece by <span>Alexander the Great,</span> his commanders - Demetrius and Antigonus - began to call themselves kings.  Over time, the monarchs became deified, and before the conquest of the lands by the Romans, each ruler in ancient Greece was considered a king and could transfer power by inheritance. </p>
