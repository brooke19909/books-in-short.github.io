    <p>  Although the appearance of the Admet B30 is not entirely ordinary, it is impossible to call it unique.  The design is very similar to many phones designed for outdoor activities.  Of course, there are significant differences.  B30 is not capable of boasting additional protection. </p><p>  The Admet B30 phone is completely made of plastic.  The material is very high quality and, although the device does not have shockproof properties, most drops will do without noticeable damage.  Such properties of the device allow you to use it during tourism. </p><p>  The dimensions turned out pretty impressive, as for a conventional cellular.  Dimensions are as many as 121 by 56 millimeters.  Impressive was the weight of 170 grams.  The culprit of such a weightiness of the device is the battery.  Actually because of the battery, the device received 25 millimeters of thickness. </p><p>  Significant dimensions and significant weight are compensated by bends on the sides of the device.  Thus, holding the device has become much more convenient.  In addition, the phone lies tightly in the hand and does not try to slip out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The unusual device is noticeable in external elements.  A small display, speaker, model number, and keyboard are located on the front.  It should be noted that the buttons of the device are large and equipped with <span>Braille.</span>  The back side has become a haven for a surprisingly large speaker and main camera. </p><p>  The usb connector, for the docking station, is located on the left side, where is the place for the lace.  The right side placed a usb socket on it, designed for charging.  A curious feature was the huge flashlight at the top, and at the bottom - a microphone. </p><p>  Design without any frills, since the phone is designed more for durability and convenience.  The strong case, large buttons allow you to comfortably use the device in any conditions. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  I got the Admet B30 "eye" with a matrix of only 0.3 megapixels.  Naturally, you won‚Äôt be able to get an acceptable image quality from the camera.  Photos are obtained with a significant amount of noise, without detail and with low resolution.  Actually, from 640 by 480 pixels, you do not have to expect more. </p><p>  Most likely, the owner will not have to use the camera.  Poor quality at the root kills the urge to photograph.  Even under ideal conditions, a grainy picture is obtained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tendency of manufacturers to install bad cameras in ordinary dialers, where they are completely unnecessary, is completely incomprehensible.  Having abandoned the camera, it would be possible to slightly improve another feature, for example, the device‚Äôs memory. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen size is only 1.77 inches, which is enough for the Admet B30.  The angle overview, unfortunately, is not very high, because the display uses the old TFT matrix.  For the same reason, the behavior of the screen in the sun also leaves much to be desired.  The brightness is quite enough, but in strong light the display fades noticeably. </p><p>  There are not too many pixels, only 320 by 480. Although this is somewhat larger than in similar devices, the image is not the best.  However, this does not affect work. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The biggest drawback is 64 megabytes of memory installed in the Admet B30 phone.  Owner reviews report the only solution, an increase in capacity due to the flash drive.  The device supports cards up to 8 gigabytes. </p><p>  The phone book is also not the largest.  Only 250 numbers can be recorded in the device.  The number of messages is also limited, the device fits 300 sms. </p><p>  A small amount of native memory forces the user to make additional expenses.  If you use the device as a player, then you can‚Äôt do without a flash drive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  Cellular works exclusively in a GSM network at frequencies of 1800, 900, 1900 and 850. Support for GPRS Internet is also provided.  But Wi-fi and navigation are missing.  Your device only supports media such as usb and bluetooth. </p><p>  The main advantage is the presence of two connectors for SIM cards in the Admet B30.  Reviews boil down to the fact that this was the reason for choosing the phone.  However, the B30, like most devices, has only one radio module.  Thus, during a call, the second card is automatically disabled. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery capacity in Admet B30 5000maH, quite impressive volume.  But such a battery is provided for a reason.  Not only can the device last over a hundred hours of talk time, it can also charge other devices. </p><p>  On the side, on the left, is a usb socket for connecting gadgets.  Thus, without any adapters, and using only one cable, you can charge any phone or tablet. </p><p>  The device will be an excellent choice if it is not possible to often recharge the phone.  In passive mode and with minimal work, this miracle is able to live a whole month without an outlet. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost has appealed to so many Admet B30 users.  Reviews report a different price, but it fluctuates around 1500-2500 thousand rubles.  Such a "monster" is definitely worth the money.  Although the functionality is lame, long-term operation and excellent communication are expected from the cell, in fact, this is without any difficulties and provides the B30. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The package includes the Admet B30 itself, instructions, headset, adapter, usb cable and battery with 5000 maH capacity.  Sometimes found in the kit and the rear bumper for greater protection of the device.  Definitely a cover will not be amiss.  The native memory also hints at the extra costs in the form of a flash drive, but this is in case of emergency. </p><p>  The current solution is to purchase a universal usb.  This addition will allow you to charge any other gadget with the docking station of the device without any difficulties. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The device can rightfully be considered not only a cell and a flashlight, but also a good speaker.  The back side is equipped with a large speaker, providing a sound and deep sound.  Of course, crackling and slight distortion are heard at maximum volume. </p><p>  MP3 support and an installed player inform the owner that even a device that is weak in its functions can serve as a player.  Naturally, such use is possible only after installing a memory card. </p><h2>  Additional abilities </h2>

    <p>  The device is not very prone to entertainment.  The manufacturer has installed only one game.  Also in the B30 model there is a voice recorder, organizer, calculator, radio, file manager and alarm clock.  It is possible to work with texts, only supports the device format txt.  There is nothing more to brag about the device. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The main plus is installed in the Admet B30 5000maH.  Reviews fully confirm the specified duration of the device.  The phone, capable of "living" a whole month without additional charge, was attractive to many users.  The device is ideal for both lovers of tourism, outdoor activities, and for the elderly who have vision problems. </p><p>  I would like to note large, convenient buttons with a special font.  The manufacturer definitely tried to make his brainchild as versatile as possible. </p><p>  A surprise was a good speaker.  The device is quite capable of replacing a small column.  This ability will be especially valuable when camping. </p><p>  Protection is also one of the strengths of the Admet B30.  Reviews report on thick and high-quality plastic that can withstand a drop from a height of a meter. </p><p>  The ability to use the B30 as a dock is also attractive.  The device is able to charge any gadget with usb plug without any problems.  The battery capacity allows you to provide a full battery even for advanced tablets. </p><p>  Equipping a cell phone with two SIM cards, the manufacturer instantly increased the number of users interested in the device.  Many owners do not need unnecessary functions, but many people liked the additional card slot. </p><p>  Trump B30 is also the cost.  Few competitors can compare in this parameter with the brainchild of Admet. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The disadvantages are also enough in the Admet B30.  Reviews especially highlight a small amount of native memory.  We can say that this is the weakest point of the phone.  Even the simplest needs require additional costs for the card. </p><p>  The 0.3 megapixel camera causes an incredible stupor in the 2013 device.  The installation of such a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmost likely performed purely for show. </p><p>  The opportunity to record a total of 250 numbers also upsets.  Using the device only for calls only, the user quickly fills the phone book.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to expand the number of rooms. </p><p>  Creates a little discomfort and tangible weight of the device, or rather, its battery.  The battery is almost twice as large as the device itself.  Although you can understand the manufacturer, it is quite difficult to find a balance between battery capacity and total weight. </p><p>  Protection also has flaws.  Although the phone itself is durable, installing a rubber layer would greatly improve this figure.  In addition, the B30 does not have shockproof properties and dust protection. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  At its low price, the device turned out to be more than successful.  All the shortcomings fade against the background of the built-in docking station, the duration of the work, as well as two SIM cards.  Cellular after the release instantly gathered a lot of fans.  Choosing a B30, you can be sure that the device will not disappoint, because you can use it both as Power Bank and as a player. </p>
