In this case, they enter the battlefield - inexpensive budget models.  Among them is the <span>HomTom HT7, reviews</span> of which make you think about buying it. </p><p>  It is an ultra-budget model of the smartphone.  Which, however, remains quite attractive and productive, despite the low cost.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The smartphone received a high-quality plastic case with two color options - black and white.  The casing has nice arched fillets in the upper and lower parts.  The back cover got corrugated, which makes it look good, does not get dirty, and the smartphone does not slip out of the hand.  About the case HomTom HT7 reviews are all positive, they emphasize the ergonomics and quality of materials.  The volume and power buttons are located on the left side, which gives some discomfort to the right-hander, but you can get used to it during operation.  The rest of the device is no different from similar state employees from this price category. </p>

    <p>  Separately, I would like to note the removable back cover, given the trend of recent days, when smartphones are doing with SIM card trays combined with memory cards.  Here you don‚Äôt have to choose, expand the device‚Äôs memory or install a second SIM card - as before, separate slots for all cards are available under the cover.  This is another significant plus in favor of the HomTom HT7.  Reviews of this feature show it on the good side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone received a classic MT6580A budget processor for this price category, which has 4 cores operating at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  The Mali-400 video chip is integrated into it, which will be enough for most simple games from the application store, but it can‚Äôt cope with complex 3D games at all, or they will hang noticeably.  To run applications provides RAM standard DDR3 in the amount of 1 GB.  Judging by the comments of users of the HomTom HT7 MTK6580A model, whose reviews can be found without problems in different stores, this amount is quite enough for using 2-3 applications at the same time. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone is equipped with two cameras that have a resolution of 5 MP and 2 MP.  However, the firmware provides for their interpolation, as a result of which the pictures are obtained with a resolution of 8MP and 5MP, respectively.  Cameras are enough to take fairly high-quality photographs in bright light, but at dusk or in artificial light, the quality suffers noticeably, and the colors are distorted.  For storing photos and other files of the user, as well as the system itself, a non-volatile memory of 8 GB is provided, which, if desired, can be expanded using a MicroSD memory card up to 64 GB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the display, which is both a strong and a weak side of the device.  On the one hand, the smartphone has a chic IPS-matrix with a diagonal of 5.5 inches and a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  This is enough to watch movies and photos, while pixelation is almost invisible.  In addition, there is enough margin of brightness to comfortably use a smartphone even on a bright sunny day. </p>

    <p>  However, the sensor in most cases is not of good quality.  The multi-touch of this smartphone is designed for just two touches, as a result of which, with a fast typing of messages, false alarms or sticking of the sensor are very often noticed.  Doogee HomTom HT7 5.5 ‚Äùusers often write about this, the reviews of which contain recommendations on how to learn how to use the sensor more comfortably, since it has this problem.  The same thing happens when playing active games.  Therefore, the use of a smartphone leaves a double feeling, but for those who almost never hurry, this moment will not cause inconvenience.  It should be ensured that the display always remains clean, then it will be possible to avoid some part of false or inaccurate responses that occur due to particles of dirt and grease. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery capacity declared by the manufacturer is 3000 mAh.  But, as shown by most tests, almost always the capacity is lower, sometimes significantly.  Well, you can only come to terms with this, since almost all manufacturers of budget devices overestimate their characteristics. </p>

    <p>  In this case, it is simply best to rely on the capacity determined by Doogee HomTom HT7 users, whose reviews speak of average battery performance - about 2300-2700 mAh.  According to them, even this is enough to comfortably use the smartphone in active mode during the day, and not live near the outlet. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The firmware from the factory comes with Android 5.1.  It is quite well optimized and, despite the budget hardware, it works smartly.  Most users who bought a HomTom HT7 phone write positive reviews about the firmware, noting that the scrolling in the menu is smooth, and in general, using the smartphone creates a pleasant feeling. </p>

    <p>  For those who like to experiment with their devices, the Internet contains a lot of information regarding the flashing of this model to custom software options.  However, do not forget that such actions will void your warranty on the device. </p><h2>  Smartphone Reviews </h2><p>  In principle, the HomTom HT7 smartphone has earned positive reviews, but consumers have indicated a number of shortcomings.  Among the advantages, they note a very low cost, a rather attractive design, high-quality assembly without backlashes, good color rendering and brightness of the matrix, as well as large viewing angles.  The disadvantages definitely include the speed and accuracy of the sensor and the quality of the received photos from cameras.  For some users, the inconvenient location of the keys on the side of the phone was also critical. </p><h2>  General impression of the device </h2><p>  In general, this unit is suitable for those who want for a little money to get a functional device and use all modern communication methods.  However, it should be borne in mind that it is the state employee who is being bought, which means that some shortcomings simply cannot be avoided. </p>

    <p>  This device is also suitable as a gift for children, because it is quite functional, but it does not attract too much attention, like expensive devices.  It is quite enough for most games and educational applications, and the modest amount of internal memory can be expanded without problems using a microSD card.  If you set out to study what the reviews say about the HomTom HT7 model, you can find many posts that say that the gadget was bought specifically for children. </p><p>  When buying, do not forget to test all the necessary functions so as not to get into a mess and not get a defective device.  Although the percentage of marriage is low, you should not risk it.  Better to be vigilant.  In order not to encounter problems of warranty replacement. </p>
