This applies to makeup, and hairstyles, and clothing.  Today, to purchase a thing that will be unique, not everyone can afford.  Therefore, many women sew clothes for themselves.  The sewing machine is the first assistant in this matter. </p><p>  Beginning seamstresses often face the problem of tearing the thread at the time of sewing.  Do not panic.  It is easy to fix on your own.  More about this later in the article.  First you need to find out why the sewing machine tears the thread, upper or lower, and how to deal with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why does the sewing machine tear the upper thread" class="if uuid-2871379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2871379.jpg"></div><h2>  Why it happens? </h2><p>  There are a lot of reasons.  Consider the main ones.  After all, it is not always possible to call a master.  Especially if the work is urgent and there is no time to wait. </p><h2>  Thread tension </h2><p>  The most common reason why a sewing machine tears a thread (lower or upper) is a fairly strong tension.  The interweaving of threads in this case occurs on the fabric.  To fix such a problem is quite simple - just loosen the tension. </p><p>  A low tension leads to the breakage of the thread.  The threads begin to get confused in the shuttle, because of which they are torn.  This disadvantage also affects the beauty of the seams. </p><h2>  Needle </h2><p>  Another reason a sewing machine tears a thread is the needle if it is not set correctly.  When it touches the walls of the hole in the needle plate, the thread will begin to cling to its irregularities, which will lead to rupture.  In such a situation, both the needle will break and the thread will break. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.madetosew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="selection of needles for a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2874386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2874386.jpg"></div><h2>  Regulator spring </h2><p>  The thread may also break due to the spring being incorrectly set in the voltage regulator.  Firstly, closer to the body of the machine should be large turns of the spring.  Secondly, it is necessary that the spring in the axis of the regulator go easily.  If the tension adjuster is not assembled correctly, this will be the main reason why the manual sewing machine tears the thread. </p><p>  The machine will not work fully if the needle is not installed correctly in it.  It should be inserted all the way, and the shuttle nose should pass near its recess. </p><h2>  Other reasons </h2><p>  Notches on the details of the machine can also file and tear the thread.  To eliminate such malfunctions, you should go through them with a file. </p><p>  The problem may also be hidden in the bobbin case.  A heavily tightened part leads to a break in the thread.  Difficulties also arise if the cap is clogged with thread and dirt. </p><p>  Most often, the reason why the thread breaks is due to incorrectly installed elements.  In this case, the machine will incorrectly grab the thread, which will lead to its breakage. </p><p>  Poor lubrication can also be the reason why the sewing machine tears the thread.  To prevent this from happening, simply lubricate the working parts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="memo.edu.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seamstress at work" class="if uuid-2872209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2872209.jpg"></div><p>  If the presser foot is too strong at the lower presser foot, this may affect the sewing speed and quality.  On some models of sewing machines, there are three modes that correspond to the type of fabric: light fabric, dense and embroidery mode.  Choose the one that suits the material used. </p><h2>  Why does the sewing machine tear the upper thread?  Wrong materials </h2><p>  The thread in the machine may break, not only because the parts are incorrectly installed, but also if the material for sewing was selected incorrectly.  When difficulties are associated precisely with this factor, correcting the situation is quite simple.  You just need to replace the fabric with a more suitable one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewitwithlove.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why does a sewing machine tear a thread on a needle" class="if uuid-2872199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2872199.jpg"></div><p>  We continue to consider the issue, because of which the thread in the machine breaks and gets confused: </p><ol><li>  When using threads from old stocks, attention should be paid to their quality.  Very often, threads with knots of cotton material will be torn.  Threads that are too thick should also not be used in work. </li><li>  An incorrectly selected needle may cause a thread to break.  These tools are selected depending on the thickness of the fabric.  Otherwise, the loops will be sloppy, and the finished product takes on an untidy appearance. </li><li>  Defective needle.  Before sewing, check the spout and eye of the needle. </li><li>  Unsuitable bobbin.  If it is too small or large, the thread will not be wound correctly during sewing, which will cause it to break. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated.  To fix a broken thread, you just need to carefully check everything and immediately fix the problem. </p><h2>  Loops the thread in the machine </h2><p>  It often happens that the thread in the machine does not break, but simply winds.  Sewing clothes in this case is also impossible.  After all, parts of the pattern cannot be sealed together. </p><p>  The reason may be the same as with a broken thread.  Therefore, in this situation, you must first check the thread tension, then make sure that there is a spring in the tension regulator.  If everything is checked and corrected, but stitching still occurs, then the problem may be that the lower and upper threads are of different thicknesses.  It is very important that both threads are of the same number. </p><p>  Another reason, because of which the line winds, there may be washers not clamped in the tensioner.  If this is the case, then this part of the device should be disassembled and all its parts checked for rust and contamination.  If everything is done correctly, then the machine will begin to work properly. </p><p>  If the machine malfunctions, you should not immediately contact the master, most likely, it is simply not assembled correctly.  After checking each of the options described above and making sure of the quality of the materials, the seamstress, finding the reason, can easily eliminate it on her own.  If this is beyond his power, then it‚Äôs better to invite a customizer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why manual sewing machine breaks the thread" class="if uuid-2872201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2872201.jpg"></div><p>  If a woman wants to look beautiful and go out in beautiful clothes, she should purchase a sewing machine and learn how to work on it.  Using her wildest decisions and imagination, she can become irresistible, elegant and especially feminine. </p>
