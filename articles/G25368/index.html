Meanwhile, we are talking about two completely different villages of the Caucasus.  Both of them are not so far from Novorossiysk.  But Abrau is a village in the mountains, on the lake.  There is one of the famous centers of Russian winemaking.  But Durso is a typical Black Sea resort.  It is there that the lion's share of tourists stops for rest.  What awaits them in the private sector of Durso?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="durso private sector" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2220558.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation Rentals in Abrau-Durso </h2><p>  In the village in the mountains there are several comfortable hotels.  But not too many tourists go there to stay.  Another thing is Durso.  Here, the private sector will open wide the doors for you.  Abrau-Durso is famous for its offers of private housing.  But at the same time, speaking of the private sector, we mean not only and not so much the apartments or rooms of the owners.  We are talking about mini-hotels and guest houses.  You can choose both small rooms of the "economy" type, and chic one-bedroom apartments.  In any case, this accommodation is cheaper than hotels.  This type of vacation is not too expensive, but comfortable, and the homely atmosphere that you will find instead of standardized hotel rooms crosses out all the shortcomings of such accommodation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abrau durso private sector" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2220229.jpg"></div>

It is not noisy, there are no stormy parties.  And if you miss them, then there are no problems getting to Novorossiysk or Anapa even in the evening.  Rooms or rooms in the private sector are usually air-conditioned and have separate refrigerators.  The owners most often provide bed linen, which is included in the price.  Even with economical housing options, you will find in such private houses equipped kitchens with gas or electric stoves, a set of dishes for both food and cooking, as well as comfortable tables.  Some options include their own kitchen for each room.  Many guest houses in the private sector of Durso have a <span>green area</span> with summer areas, verandas or gazebos.  Many of these mini-hotels are by the river.  Amenities are subject to room rate.  In economies or standards, they are located on the territory, but hot and cold water is around the clock and without interruptions.  Most often in the same guest house there are rooms of various categories, and the owners can accept both budget tourists and richer guests.  Many private complexes have free Wi-Fi and a pool.  An example is mini-hotels such as Lukomorye, Aivengo, Emerald, Call of the Sea, Eden.  Luxury rooms and apartments are most often located in apartments and residential complexes.

Sometimes the hosts arrange delivery of lunch and dinner.  In addition, in the village itself, including on the coast, there are many food outlets where you can eat.  Local restaurants are famous not only for Krasnodar cuisine, but also for seafood.  And those who have kitchens or live in private apartments will not have any problems with buying products.  Everything you need can be purchased in stores or in the private market.  The economy version of the private sector in Durso starts at 600 rubles per person.  There will certainly not be luxury here, but there is everything you need to relax in such houses.  The price of an average room is 1800-2500 rubles per day for the entire living space.  In general, the cost of housing in the private sector of Durso is the same as on the entire Black Sea coast in Russia.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists, as a rule, leave positive feedback about many guest houses.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the hosts are friendly, they monitor the cleanliness and order.  Of course, the village is small, and sometimes it is crowded on the beach.  But those who rented housing closer to the sea, went there mainly in the morning and evening, and when it became too noisy, relaxed in their yard or pool.  If the hosts organize meals, then the portions are often large.  You can order barbecue on the grill or grilled fish.  In the village there are many shops with draft wine, which is good to drink on the balcony, terrace or veranda at your table.  In general, tourists remember with pleasure with rest in the private sector of Abrau-Durso - this "little France" on the territory of Russia. </p>
