Her field of activity in the domestic market is to serve not only large companies in our country, but also foreign commercial institutions that conduct successful business in Russia.  In its work, the aforementioned credit institution focuses on cooperation with French investors, while partnership with representatives of the “retail” business is not included in the list of priority areas of its activities. </p><h2>  The appearance of the bank in the Russian market </h2><p>  In Russia, a foreign banking institution, which was originally called Lyon Credit, was established in 1991.  Subsequently, a credit institution was reorganized, as a result of which Credit Lyonnais became an integral part of the new financial structure called Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank. </p><h2>  Bank owners </h2><p>  Currently, the aforementioned credit institution is a closed joint-stock company, the owners of which are two foreign companies: Credit Agricole SA S, which owns 82% of the authorized capital, and Credit Agricole Global Banking, which it controls, owns 18% of the shares. </p>

    <p>  In Russia today there is one branch of the above company.  “Credit Agricole” is primarily engaged in investing in commercial projects and servicing French entrepreneurs who develop their own business in the domestic services market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bank cooperation with small business representatives - so far in the future </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the credit institution is a participant in deposit insurance (CER), its management does not yet consider the likelihood of "tight" cooperation with entrepreneurs representing small businesses. </p><p>  Back in 2008, “Credit Agricole” initiated the possibility of creating a business development program, however, due to the then crisis phenomena in the economy, the financial structure had to abandon the idea of ​​partnership with “small” businessmen.  However, this fact did not become any significant barrier to the development of the banking business. </p>

    <p>  Today, the main trump cards of “Credit Agricole” in the competition in the banking market are car loans, mortgage loans, and consumer loans. </p><p>  In addition, bank employees are ready to offer <span>corporate customers an</span> advantageous package of business services focused on the <span>agro-industrial complex.</span>  At present, the bank's management is trying to attract as many agricultural producers as possible to lending. </p><p>  Experts also note the high level of development <span>of the</span> payroll system for individuals and legal entities. </p><p>  The achievement of the leadership of the financial structure can also be considered the fact that the bank won the first place in the automotive financial market precisely because of partner lending projects that involved well-known importers of cars to Ukraine and dealers selling them. </p><p>  This is the scale of the business of Credit Agricole.  Ukraine is one of the countries in which there is a wide network of representative offices of the above credit organization.  Only in it there are about two hundred branches and about three hundred ATMs, without taking into account contractual relations with the Atmosphere company, which owns more than three thousand terminals throughout the state. </p><h2>  What other factors provide a powerful pace of development </h2><p>  Such large-scale successes in the banking business became possible thanks to financial assistance from the largest financial corporation in Europe - Credit Agrigol SA. </p>
