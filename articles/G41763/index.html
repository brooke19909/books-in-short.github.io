    <p>  So, for example, in the ‚ÄúCossack Bay‚Äù there is a famous research center (State Oceanarium), which studies the marine inhabitants of the Black Sea, and also specializes in all kinds of underwater operations.  During the Soviet Union, it was here that scientific research was conducted in the field of the use of dolphins in the military sphere.  The center was classified.  Currently, it is accessible for tourists, who are offered unique demonstration programs with the participation of dolphins and other marine inhabitants.  Guests of the city, especially children, will get a lot of pleasure from watching the behavior and games of dolphins, fur seals.  Visitors can chat with marine animals, take pictures next to them.  Dolphinariums have developed and are successfully implementing health-improving programs involving marine mammals. </p><p>  Some bays of Sevastopol offer city guests special types of educational entertainment.  By visiting the Biodesign exhibition, tourists can get a complete impression of the diversity of species of marine animals living in the Black Sea and see first-hand unique rare fish and marine mammals. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  In the Oceanarium area, there is the famous UNICON DIVERS diving center, whose experienced specialists will help you to join the fascinating world of scuba diving.  Sevastopol bays are characterized by calm waters, protected from the effects of weather factors, which are great for swimming under water.  The diving center has the necessary modern equipment, allowing training for beginners.  People with experience in scuba diving will also find a lot of interesting things for themselves. </p><p>  The city of Sevastopol, due to its excellent, exceptionally convenient location, is a unique place for relaxing on the water and visiting by tourists - lovers of the sea and the history of the fleet.  City guests have the opportunity to take a fascinating boat trip and enjoy the beauty of the local places.  Due to the fact that warships are based in the bays, numerous history buffs of the Russian Navy flock to Sevastopol annually. </p><p>  The central bays of Sevastopol (photo, unfortunately, cannot convey the exceptional atmosphere that hovers in these places) are inextricably linked with the heroic history of the city.  It was in them that the ships under the command of Admiral Ushakov were based.  From here the Russian ships left in order to win the <span>battle of Sinop.</span>  During the <span>Crimean War</span> , sea vessels were flooded in the Sevastopol Bay in order to prevent the Anglo-French squadron from reaching the city.  During the siege in 1941-1942, ships broke into the bays of Sevastopol, supplying the besieged city. </p>
