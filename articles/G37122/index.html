    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The word ‚Äúorbat‚Äù can be translated from Arabic as ‚Äúsuburb‚Äù.  In the 14-16 centuries, the place where the famous street is located now, fully corresponded to this name.  The fact is that in those days this name was borne by the whole district, which was located under the walls of the White City. </p><p>  The situation changed in the 18th century.  It was then that the Arbat began to be called a separately located street.  Representatives of the Moscow nobility and high officials began to build houses here.  After the fire of 1812, most of the wooden buildings burned to the ground.  Later, stone buildings appeared in the Empire style, which was fashionable in those days. </p><p>  In the 19th century, Arbat radically changed its status.  It ceased to be a "noble nest", since merchant families became its main population.  The appearance of the street also changed: shops and shops appeared on the ground floors, and colorful signs decorated the houses. </p><p>  In the 60s of the 20th century, many old buildings were demolished, high-rise buildings and new shops appeared.  Arbat became a pedestrian zone only in 1974. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, we will tell you what is interesting for city guests and foreign tourists in Old Arbat.  Moscow, the sights of which are so diverse, can surprise even experienced travelers.  So, what is worth seeing while walking along the Arbat? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arbat Zoo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1386401.jpg" width="400"></div>
