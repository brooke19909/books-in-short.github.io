  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alexander Lakes in Russia, description.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are several Alexander Lakes in Russia.  The most famous lakes with this name are located quite far from each other.  One is located near the city of St. Petersburg in the Vyborg district, they come there for fishing.  And others represent a whole country of lakes, which are located near the city of Alexandrovsk in the Perm Territory.  The latter are called Blue, these Ural ponds have incredible beauty. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.18791909999999" data-lng="57.490766399999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/1/8/3/3183.png"></div><h2>  Alexander Lake in the Vyborg District </h2><p>  This lake is located in the Vyborg district in the Leningrad region.  In the east, it connects to another lake.  With Pioneer.  Lake Alexandrovsk has a long, old name of Finnish origin - Hatyalahdenj√§rvi.  This pond is 5.5 kilometers long and 1.5 kilometers wide.  The greatest depths in Lake Alexandrov are 6-7 meters, with a total average depth of 3 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dacha-v-malinovke.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Lake Perm Region" class="if uuid-2465416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/2465416.jpg"></div><p>  At this reservoir, the shores are high, a mixed forest grows on them, in some places pine is found.  Near the coast, the bottom is sandy, and closer to the deeper middle - muddy.  In the northern part, the lake is slightly overgrown, by the water you can see reeds, horsetail and egg capsule.  The Alexander Lake is replenished with water at the expense of small streams, and the Alexandrovka River flows from it.  The fact that the pond is flowing, and determines its purity, and consequently, the presence of fish in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the Lake of Alexander is connected by a channel with the Pioneer, together they form a single system of water bodies belonging to the Gulf of Finland basin.  It is near this channel that the best places for fishing are located.  Here you can often catch burbot, perch and roach, and less often zander or bream. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rybalkaspb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alexander lake" class="if uuid-2465418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/2465418.jpg"></div><p>  A favorite place for pike is the northern part of the lake at a depth of four meters.  They catch it while sitting on a boat, as small fish mostly come from the shore.  In spring, you can often catch roach where the Alexandrovka River flows from the lake. </p><h2>  Lakes of the Alexandrovsky district in the Perm region </h2><p>  One more lake can be called Aleksandrovsky, because they are located near the city of Aleksandrovsk.  They are called Blue, and this is not surprising, because their water has an amazing turquoise color.  Photo of Alexander Lakes in the Perm region pleases the eye with its unusual bright colors.  It's hard to believe, but these beautiful lakes are man-made.  <span>The water surface</span> has such a specific shade due to the smallest particles of limestone.  These lakes appeared as a result of human development of this territory 300 years ago.  Aleksandrovsky district used to belong to the large landowners Stroganov.  Then the development of the Ural lands took place, and the Stroganovs wanted to build metallurgical plants in these places.  Just in time, we discovered large deposits of brown iron ore, and then began the construction of factories that produce steel and iron.  Soon, this territory was transferred to other owners - Vsevolzhsky and Lazarev.  The first plant appeared here in 1808, it was called Alexandrovsky, and it laid the foundation for a city with the same name.  For metallurgy, which developed in these places, a flux was needed.  As it used limestone.  According to the stories, Prince Alexander Vsevolzhsky also participated in the search for limestone deposits.  While wandering through the forests, he lost his way and came across a large limestone rock.  Then he vowed that if he got out of the forest, he would certainly erect a chapel in this place.  From the cliff he saw a factory, he soon got out and kept his vow.  It was in this place that a chapel was built and limestone was mined nearby.  True, it was demolished in the 30th year of the last century.  In that place now stands the cross, which was erected by one of the locals of the nearest village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lake photo" class="if uuid-2465404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/2465404.jpg"></div><p>  A quarry appeared on the mountain near the rock, which was called Staraya.  Limestone has been mined here for soda production for more than 100 years.  In 1930, a village with a distinctive name, Quarry-Limestone, appeared in the quarry area. </p><h2>  Characteristic Blue Lakes </h2><p>  The largest quarry is closer to the road leading from Aleksandrovsk.  Its length is less than a kilometer (800 meters) and a width of about 200 meters.  But his depth is decent - 70 meters.  This is the deepest reservoir among those in the Kama region.  It is this quarry that is implied when Blue Lake is mentioned.  By the way, he also has an official name - Shavrinsky quarry.  He was nicknamed the Blue Lake for the unusual color of the water that contains limestone.  Water is good enough for a fish to live in it.  Here they arrange spearfishing for her.  Swimming in this career is popular among locals, there is even a recreation center.  A photo of one of the Alexander Lakes in the Urals is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bit.picssex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue Lake" class="if uuid-2465406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/2465406.jpg"></div><p>  A similar lake is located north of the Shavrinsky quarry, the water in it is also blue, but the reservoir itself is somewhat less.  The length is 1.4 kilometers and the width is 150, so it is more elongated.  It is called the Morozovsky quarry. </p>
