Pioneer has earned a reputation for its high-quality multimedia and musical devices, such as radio, speakers, synthesizers, monitors and many others.  She did not deprive and Pioneer 80PRS, making it multifunctional, with a catchy simple design, which is the standard for all radio tape recorders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": pioneerelectronics, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 80prs" class="if uuid-2739874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2739874.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The review of Pioneer 80PRS is worth starting with a list of its technical characteristics: </p><ul><li>  the screen has three lines, is equipped with a backlight; </li><li>  supported file storage media: USB, SD-cards, CD-ROMs; </li><li>  playback format: mp3, wav, wma: </li><li>  save function and search for your favorite radio stations; </li><li>  the ability to connect Apple technology, but for this you need to purchase a special cable; </li><li>  built-in microphone; </li><li>  the presence of a sixteen-band equalizer, divided into stereo; </li><li>  official Russian firmware; </li><li>  signal processor, its processing according to the DSP principle: </li><li>  high and low pass filter; </li><li>  output to an amplifier, subwoofer, speakers; </li><li>  two inputs for a flash drive on the rear panel; </li><li>  SD card input </li><li>  AUX input on the front of the radio; </li><li>  radio control panel; </li><li>  the presence of a port for controlling the radio buttons on the steering wheel; </li><li>  display and buttons have customizable RGB backlight; </li><li>  collapsible front panel; </li><li>  type - 1-din; </li><li>  power at 200 W for 4 channels (50 √ó 4); </li><li>  file system availability; </li><li>  typical sizes: 178 √ó 50 √ó 160 millimeters. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.stevemeadedesigns.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.stevemeadedesigns.com/board/topic/209884-pioneer-deh-80prs-head-unit/"><img itemprop="image" alt="manual for car radio" class="if uuid-2741184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2741184.jpg"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The design of the Pioneer 80PRS is the same as that of all models released in 2012 by Pioneer: the availability of volume control by scrolling and the swaying switch "back and forth".  The control buttons themselves are located on the front panel, they respond distinctly to the click.  The color of the buttons can be any.  It is also worth saying that the color of the screen backlight can be selected regardless of the color of the buttons.  An important nuance is the presence of network readings on the radio screen.  Given that this is a music-reproducing device, and not a voltmeter, it shows the values ‚Äã‚Äãquite accurately.  You can "run" through the file system of the media both in files and folders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": gadget-town, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 80prs" class="if uuid-2740495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2740495.jpg"></div><h2>  Radio connection </h2><p>  In addition to FM-radio, the radio is capable of playing multimedia with AUX, Bluetooth, USB, SD.  In this regard, the developers tried their best.  You can, of course, say that the USB output is not located in the most convenient place, namely at the back, but this is a matter of taste, because a flash drive sticking out from the connector can interfere or spoil the appearance of the radio.  Also, to listen to music from an SD drive, front panel parsing is required.  There are two inputs for connecting AUX: RCA (rear) and minijack (on the front panel).  If their use is not planned, then in the radio settings you can erase them from the proposed connection options. </p><p>  An important plus of the Pioneer 80PRS is the presence of a Bluetooth module that can both play songs and receive calls and make calls to other subscribers thanks to the presence of a front panel microphone and a remote microphone.  It is possible to connect an Apple device to the radio and control it from the phone.  A good bonus for users of low-capacity flash drives is the ability to read WAV files or Apple-format files. </p><p>  The steering wheel control is available thanks to an adapter for the radio, which is able to turn the steering wheel into a remote control.  This can save time, and it‚Äôs not safe to reach the radio while driving.  When changing the standard multimedia system, an adapter for the Pioneer 80PRS radio can make your steering wheel ‚Äúworking‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  Pioneer 80PRS is configured in the same way as other radio tape recorders: it suggests two options: </p><ul><li>  subwoofer, front and rear speakers; </li><li>  front - two-way. </li></ul><p>  The first mode is simpler: low-pass filter - subwoofer, high-pass filter - for speakers.  The second mode will be better for those who want to make an entire customizable audio system out of their radio.  Equalizer settings are both standard and custom, for which two slots are freed.  You can also edit and create presets with your own hands.  But for the lazy, standard presets or their absence at all are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Pioneer-DEH-80PRS-Car-Audio-CD-Receiver-w-Bluetooth-Pandora-USB-MP3-iPod-/311853303205"><img itemprop="image" alt="Remote Control" class="if uuid-2741189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2741189.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Since all reviews contain the unpacking of the package, it is also worth talking about it.  When ordering from official suppliers, the radio comes in a plain white box with the inscription in the center of Pioneer.  Simple and cheerful.  The radio tape recorder itself is included, the manual for the Pioneer 80PRS, located on the disk, the radio control panel that does not match the design of the radio itself, the front panel, which comes in a separate plastic bag and lies at the bottom of the box.  It is worth saying that the remote control from the older version looks more presentable and has more functionality.  Also included is a warranty card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.soundoftristate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 80prs" class="if uuid-2740085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2740085.jpg"></div><h2>  Who is it for </h2><p>  Since this radio tape recorder has good sound, a car enthusiast who prefers a trip in a car to quality music can be interested in it.  The price of the car radio is quite high - about $ 300.  But we can say that for $ 300 there is an excellent radio with good technical components, design, ergonomics, a simple installation process, and also a beautiful and high-quality brand - Pioneer. </p><p>  The price of the Pioneer 80PRS is lower in comparison with premium models such as Kenwood, Alpina, Sony and so on.  It is worth considering the fact that this radio tape recorder belongs to the budget class (the price of car radios is up to $ 500), but it can compete with devices of both the middle and premium class.  Moreover, its setup will not cause anyone any difficulties. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Most owners of old Pioneer recorders say that after switching to the Pioneer 80PRS, the sound became much clearer and more intelligible, the subwoofer began to work together with the front, the functionality of the settings increased, support for USB and SD cards appeared, the presence of automatic sound level adjustment using a microphone.  All that is needed in the radio is present. </p><p>  Of the advantages, the owners of Pioneer 80PRS distinguish: </p><ul><li>  excellent quality sound; </li><li>  a wide variety of settings; </li><li>  CPU; </li><li>  the presence of a bluetooth module and a hands-free headset; </li><li>  the ability to select the color of the backlight of both the buttons and the screen; </li><li>  the presence of USB; </li><li>  the ability to connect a subwoofer; </li><li>  simple intuitive interface; </li><li>  pleasant sound of low frequencies; </li><li>  support for wav format; </li><li>  the presence of a remote control. </li></ul><p>  Of the minuses, it is worth highlighting the following: </p><ul><li>  without sound settings, the standard sound is not so high-quality; </li><li>  adjusting the sound through the microphone only sounds beautiful, actually a useless function; </li><li>  lack of a pause button on the front panel of the radio; </li><li>  very large stroke of the volume knob: to decrease it, you need to turn the knob for a very long time, which is not very convenient, and when it is turned sharply, it simply does not work; </li><li>  cheap case materials; </li><li>  there is no subwoofer volume control in the main menu, you need to dig into the settings for a long time; </li><li>  there is no ‚Äúmute‚Äù button on the panel, but it is on the remote control. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.stevemeadedesigns.com" data-author=": WalledSonic, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 80prs" class="if uuid-2740147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2740147.jpg"></div><p>  The Pioneer 80PRS is a great budget choice.  For a relatively low price, you can get high-quality sound, a nice design and many other functions that this radio can perform.  Even small minuses will not be able to block many of the advantages of this version from the legendary company Pioneer. </p>
