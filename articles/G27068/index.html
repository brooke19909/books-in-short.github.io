Reviews about holidays in the Iron Port</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the onset of summer, almost every resident of any large noisy and gassed metropolis wants to leave from all this fuss to the sea coast.  With the modern rhythm of life, rest at sea is a kind of reset of consciousness, a way to get rid of the bulk of the problems at least temporarily, and at the same time, of course, improve your health and get a lot of pleasant experiences. </p><p>  Often, many people begin planning their sea vacation almost in January.  Despite the course of "moving to Europe", for most Ukrainians, foreign resorts, even such as Turkey or Egypt, which are positioned as cheap, remain inaccessible.  Therefore, every year, national resorts are experiencing an increasing influx of tourists, and therefore received an impetus for their active development.  This is especially true of vacation spots in the Kherson region of Ukraine, which have become an excellent alternative to the Crimean coast, so beloved by all before.  Resorts of Kherson region have a wonderful mild climate and are perfect for families with children. </p><h2>  Kherson region - Black or Azov Sea? </h2><p>  Kherson resorts are located on the shores of both the Black Sea and the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov has always been considered a budget vacation destination, therefore such villages by the sea as Schastlivtsevo, Strelkovoye, Komissarovka, <span>Genicheskaya Gorka</span> do not go unnoticed by tourists in the summer.  The most popular resort of Kherson region Genichesk annually hosts more and more vacationers, especially couples with small children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But most still prefer to relax on the Black Sea, as it is cleaner and covers more recreational areas.  In the Kherson region on the Black Sea, you can choose the following summer vacation destinations such as Lazurnoe, Golaya Pristan, Khorly, Skadovsk, Primorsky, and Iron Port.  It is on the latter to dwell in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Rest in the Iron Port of the Kherson region - for every taste for everyone and everyone </h2><p>  Iron Port - a small village in several streets on the Black Sea coast of the Kherson region near the <span>Tendra Spit.</span>  As a resort, it is still quite young; the Iron Port ceased to be a fishing village only in the middle of the last century, but is currently actively developing its infrastructure.  <span>Hotels, mini-hotels,</span> pensions and guest houses grow on the seashore like mushrooms after the rain.  The private sector of the Iron Port also welcomes guests with open arms.  The weather in the Iron Port is beautiful from the very beginning of May until the end of September, when the velvet season ends, which is why the town attracts so many tourists. </p>

    <p>  Everyone will find here for himself what he likes best.  You decided to go on vacation alone, with friends, with your loved one or with family and children - for any occasion, the Iron Port is the best fit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Iron port - how to get there? </h2><p>  The best way to get to Zhelezny Port is to catch a train next to Kherson, and from there take a shuttle bus to the village itself.  Kherson can also be reached by bus, however, you need to understand that travel in this case will cost much more.  Some companies, for example, in the Zaporizhzhya region, offer direct flights to the Iron Port at reasonable prices in the summer. </p><p>  If you did not take care to book accommodation in the Iron Port in advance, you have the opportunity to find where to settle already upon arrival at the place.  In this case, most likely it will be possible to most quickly find a haven in the private sector. </p>

    <h2>  Iron Port - a private sector for budget travelers </h2><p>  Private houses at sea resorts attract vacationers primarily because the settlement in them is quite cheap.  The price of such housing ranges from 60 to 80 UAH per day per person, depending on whether it starts, peak or end of season.  But, unfortunately, the list of undoubted advantages of settling in a private house at a low price ends.  And the list of unpleasant minuses begins, which is much more significant for most tourists.  Convenience and comfort in such housing are minimal, in addition, you will have to get to the sea at least 15-20 minutes.  So, most of the students who decide to mark the successful passing of exams at sea in the Iron Port will probably settle in such places, and those who allow the budget will choose a private house unless they have no other choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Rest at private owners with comfort </h2><p>  But there is a private sector in the settlement of Zhelezny Port and with increased comfort conditions.  Already much closer to the coastline you can find small and quite comfortable mini-pensions for every taste and budget.  Every year, owners of private estates and boarding houses seek to improve housing conditions and expand the list of services provided to attract more tourists.  Prices in the private sector of the Iron Port are very affordable - in 2017, the minimum cost of such housing at the beginning of the season was 100 UAH per day per person, at the peak of the season - 150 UAH and above, but you must not forget that for this price you get a decent comfortable room with all amenities and a beautiful surrounding area, as well as the sea is only five minutes away! </p>

    <h2>  Iron Port - the best place to relax with children </h2><p>  For couples who have young children, the private sector in the Iron Port, located off the coast, is just a sea paradise.  Even directly in a boarding house or manor in which you decide to settle, there is certainly something to do with a little child.  Many of them are equipped with playgrounds with slides, swings, inflatable or stationary mini-pools, sandpits and other children's joys.  In addition, younger schoolchildren will probably disappear all day in the water park, at the attractions of the lunapark and the Ferris wheel, and will also go for a fun hour or two on a banana to the "Entertainment Island" to frolic on inflatable slides on the high seas.  By the way, about the sea - at the coastal strip it is quite shallow, so the child can safely go away to swim or just splash.  The smallest here will be very convenient to teach swimming. </p>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the important advantage of the Iron Port for families with children - after half-past ten in the evening, all noise on the promenade ceases, the owners of coastal cafes play music, so that both children and their parents can get enough sleep.  Only one caveat - to enjoy the silence at the coastline at night, you need to settle on the outskirts of the village, because on the central part of the embankment nightlife is always in full swing. </p><h2>  Iron port - what to see and what to do? </h2><p>  There are not too many special entertainments for the adult population in the Iron Port.  So if you are an individual traveler and spending time near the water under the hot rays of the summer sun, you prefer other types of sea holidays, then any Iron Port beach with its soft white sand and small shells is perfect for this.  For added comfort, it is even possible to rent a bungalow on breakwaters with a hookah and an Internet access point, and enjoy beautiful sea views for three hours while drinking cool drinks, however it costs quite a lot - 600 UAH for three hours.  Someone might want to parachute after a boat or ride a banana - absolutely standard entertainment for the Black Sea resorts. </p>

    <p>  Those interested in nature can go on an excursion to the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, or relax in a thermal spring 15 kilometers from the village.  And now a few words directly about the aforementioned "special" entertainment.  For lovers of extreme water activities in the Iron Port there is a diving club.  Feel like a research scientist or treasure hunter, plunging into the depths of the Gulf of Tendra, where the remains of ancient ships lie.  Of course, for such a pleasure the tourist will have to pay a tidy sum - 900 UAH or more, but it is worth it. </p><h2>  Iron Port: holiday reviews </h2><p>  From vacationers in the worldwide network you can find many positive reviews about the Iron Port.  And this is absolutely not surprising - the gentle warm sea and fine sand, the healing Kherson air, wonderful weather in the Iron Port and pleasant prices will leave even the most fastidious vacationers happy.  True, there are a couple of minuses that tourists note in their reviews about holidays in this resort.  The first is a considerable number of adult large jellyfish hunting in the immediate vicinity of the coast.  But there are practically no poisonous ones among them, and even those that can harm human health are capable of this only in a certain period. </p><p>  And the second - thick algae, through which you have to step over before you get to the depths where you can normally swim.  But they are not at all on all the beaches of the village, so there is always the opportunity to swim in absolutely clean water. </p>
