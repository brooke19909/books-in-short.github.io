It has many cultural attractions that create a special image of the city.  One of these attractions is Rastrelli Square.  It is known for its beautiful architectural ensemble. </p><h2>  Title History </h2><p>  Rastrelli Square changed its name several times.  Its very first name is Smolny, because it is located next to the Smolny Cathedral.  In 1864, it began to be called Mariinsky Square - in honor of Empress Maria Fyodorovna.  This was done because the cathedral there and other nearby institutions were under its auspices. </p><p>  However, another name appeared - Catherine.  This name came from the street of the same name.  She got her name from the church of St. Catherine.  Then she became part of Shpalernaya street.  This name was used more often, and after 1884 it became official. </p><p>  Then, in 1923, this St. Petersburg landmark was renamed the architect Rastrelli Square.  She was named after the famous master who created many magnificent creations in St. Petersburg.  And in 1929, the attraction received its modern name - Rastrelli Square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="et.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="architect rastrelli" class="if uuid-2940362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2940362.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief biography of the architect </h2><p>  Francesco Rastrelli arrived in St. Petersburg in 1715 with his father.  Their talent was not appreciated in Italy, so they went to France, where they worked at the court of Louis XIV.  When the French king passed away, Francesco, like many others, was left without orders.  Then he met with Russian diplomat Zotov.  He was instructed to look for talented people abroad, and that was Rastrelli. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The famous architect has created many beautiful architectural creations.
