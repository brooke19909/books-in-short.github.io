    <p>  In this article we will talk about one very worthy family hotel in the resort of Mui Ne. </p><p>  In which hotel can you recommend a tour to people who prefer a relaxing, but full of exotic vacation?  As you know, Mr. Phan Thiet can boast of such.  Phan Thiet <span>Canary Beach Resort 3 *</span> can be considered a good option.  Do not be afraid of three-star.  The fact that the hotel itself does not have five restaurants by appointment and staff of animators is more than compensated by the environment.  It consists of the infrastructures of many hotels, night clubs, restaurants.  Here, in the center of the village, there are many shops, shops.  However, after ten in the evening, all restaurant and retail outlets are closed, and vacationers return to their hotels.  It is a calm resort. </p><h2>  The favorable climate of Mui Ne Resort </h2><p>  Potential guests of Vietnam are often stopped by the rainy climate of this country.  After all, no one wants to enjoy a vacation during a month and a half rain.  However, do not rely on prejudices inspired by Hollywood films!  Guest reviews of the local economy hotel (with 3 stars) - Canary Beach Resort 3 *, indicate excellent resort weather.  None of them have complaints of precipitation! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's make it clear.  <span>The climate of Vietnam</span> from mid-October to mid-December is really rainy.  But we want to reassure tourists traveling to the Phan Thiet resort.  Near this 250-thousandth city, the capital of the resort industry, the Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Mui Ne) is located.  The rain front does not pass into the Fantiet zone.  The reason for this is the natural thermal screen that <span>accelerates the clouds.</span>  It is formed by sun-heated dunes, a belt of which surrounds the region of Phan Thiet.  Not far from the suburban village of Mui Ne there are red sand dunes, and white, a little off, form a belt of mini-deserts.  By the way, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhite dunes there are picturesque lakes decorated with blooming white lotuses. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Earlier, before the construction of a modern resort, here, on the beautiful deserted coast of the South China Sea, there was only a small fishing village.  Vietnamese fishermen are smiling and friendly.  Fish are caught including directly near the beach.  Early in the morning, at about six o‚Äôclock, from among the tourists, they can not only see the sorting of the catch by its miners, but also take part in it themselves.  In addition, directly from the fishermen you can buy the freshest exotic seafood: tuna, mackerel, marlin, lobster, crab, squid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 vietnam reviews" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1072775.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A lot of Russians and Ukrainians have a rest in the village, because the local three-star vacation is quite economical ($ 35 for a double room).  Great restaurants here!  At fairly reasonable prices, they are a real gourmet paradise: a wide range of seafood, skillfully prepared crocodiles (meat resembles chicken and crab at the same time), snakes, frogs, lizards, insects. </p><p>  Next to the fishing village, in the resort village of Mui Ne, located on the coast of Mui Ne Bay, the 3 * Canary Beach Resort hotel considered in our article is located.  It is built on the first line: to the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe South China Sea beach is only 20-30 meters.  Almost directly from the hotel begins the beach. </p><p>  Those who buy a tour get from Moscow to the hotel in 24 hours.  Of these, five hours takes the road from the Vietnamese airport to Chang (this is due to the severe speed limit in Vietnam, although this is a relatively short distance, only 200 km). </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel we are considering is average.  It has 70 rooms. </p><p>  On the well-groomed territory of Canary Beach Resort, landscaped with flower lawns, palm trees, exotic plants, the hotel guests feel cozy and comfortable. </p><p>  The hotel has a business center equipped with modern equipment for video conferencing.  This is a modern conference room with a capacity of 100 seats. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is quite compact.  Two two-story residential buildings are located one opposite the other.  In the middle of the garden, swimming pool, territory, landscaped landscape designers.  In the pool area there is a cafe and bar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Beach, pool are cleaned daily. </p><h2>  Guest rooms </h2><p>  Hotel rooms 3 * Canary Beach Resort are spacious.  The family rooms are furnished with two double beds, armchairs, tables, bedside tables, a wardrobe.  They are equipped with air conditioning, safe, TV, minibar, electric kettle, hairdryer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 vietnam phan thiet" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1072772.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  Bathrooms are equipped in such a way as to provide maximum comfort to hotel guests: three types of towels, toothpaste, gel, shampoo, toothbrushes.  Free daily in the room bring two pairs of coffee bags, a couple of tea bags, a couple of bottles of mineral water.  Minibar is paid. </p><p>  Almost all guests praise for the fast Wi-Fi hotel Canary Beach Resort 3 * Phan Thiet.  The reviews indicate that its speed is quite enough for watching cartoons by children, as well as for video communication with relatives through Skype.  Acquiring in the hotel complex is not developed, so you will have to pay for additional services in cash. </p><h2>  Recommendation: how to communicate with Vietnamese without knowing their language </h2><p>  From the reviews of the hotel guests, we learned about their witty enough to overcome the language barrier.  If there is no Russian-speaking guide nearby, you can still communicate with the hotel staff.  The Vietnamese language is very difficult for a European.  It should be recognized that the kind and executive staff serving the Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel in Vietnam, unfortunately, is poorly oriented in both Russian and English. </p><p>  Therefore, in order for them to understand the request of the hotel guests, the most quick-witted compatriots took as a mediator ... a tablet.  Google translator easily transforms Russian into Vietnamese.  Good wifi helped in communication. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The food is tasty and varied.  It is provided by a hotel restaurant and bar. </p><p>  The restaurant is built in the middle of a picturesque garden of coconut trees.  Here, in addition to Vietnamese technology for the preparation of seafood, international cuisine familiar to Europeans is practiced.  The menu has a lot of French dishes. </p><p>  Breakfast is quite easy: cereal with milk, noodles, fruit, scrambled eggs, local simple dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phan Thiet Canary Beach Resort 3" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1072771.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  For lunch and dinner, the menu includes seafood, meat and fish main dishes.  Lots of vegetable salads.  It lacks a variety of pastries, juices, fruits. </p><p>  Prices for paid drinks and dishes of the restaurant and bar (not included in the all-inclusive system) are 2-2.5 times higher than in shops and shops of the village. </p><p>  The cost of fruit in Vietnam is much cheaper than ours.  Vacationers consume them in large quantities. </p><p>  Although Europeans should mainly eat the usual food for the body.  But for a complete impression of Vietnam, of course, you should not leave here without tasting a crocodile, a lizard, a snake, grasshoppers.  Around the hotel there are many small restaurants of various price categories.  Having picked the right one, the guests of the hotel we are considering realize their gourmet fantasies. </p><p>  We will disappoint those wishing to celebrate their birthday ‚Äúin full‚Äù: there are no such opportunities at Canary Beach Resort 3 *.  The restaurant is designed for everyday meals. </p><p>  Alternatively, vacationers arrange a festive dinner with brought alcohol and barbecue prepared here from fish and reptiles in the restaurant located next to the hotel.  Such a dinner will cost $ 45 per person. </p><h2>  Alternative nutrition.  Boke Village </h2><p>  For a variety of relaxation, hotel guests, already accustomed to its menu and typical hotel design, travel to the nearby authentic village of Boke. </p><p>  A tourist area in the Vietnamese-style has been created here.  Numerous exotic cafes offer grilled and using other technologies lobsters, turtles, shrimps, squids, oysters. </p><p>  We advise you to visit a very exotic cafe, located near the local pagoda.  It lures tourists on display a crocodile on a spit.  Those who decide to visit him will not regret it!  This is guaranteed by simple review statistics: almost all guests of 3 * Canary Beach Resort visit it. </p><h2>  Hotel pool </h2><p>  The pool is comfortable, spacious and clean.  Around it - a sufficient number of sun loungers and tables. </p><p>  The pool bar is a good place to have a tasty snack.  Salesgirls smartly and benevolently serve swimmers. </p><p>  There is also a children's pool and a playground.  Kids here really like it.  However, there is no child animation.  Still, the hotel is three-star, and its staff is small. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach of the 3 * Canary Beach Resort is neat, clean, with convenient entry into the water.  Its water area is located in Mui Ne Bay, so the sea is calm here.  In some reviews, tourists write that the water of the South China Sea is cloudy.  This is not entirely accurate.  It's all about the tide rolling on the sandy shore.  The waves, capturing sand, form a sand curtain in the coastal strip.  A few meters from the coast, the water is much cleaner.  And after a few dozen - perfect purity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 phan thiet reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1072784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Right on the beach, guests of the Canary Beach Resort 3 * (hotel photos are presented in the review) have the opportunity to enjoy tasting exotic fish and grilled seafood. </p><h2>  Cheap scooter rental </h2><p>  It‚Äôs wise to rent a scooter to explore the surroundings (for only $ 5 per day).  Rental is located opposite the hotel.  From the hotel guests a rental guarantee is not taken.  In addition, guaranteed free parking for rented motorcycles is guaranteed - in the hotel parking lot. </p><p>  On a scooter you can go to the center of the village of Mui Ne (and this is 8 km) for shopping (it makes sense to diversify your diet with cheap fruits and seafood).  You will have to pay a lot more for a round-trip taxi. </p><p>  Those wishing to visit the <span>capital of Vietnam,</span> Ho Chi Minh City, use a bus specially equipped for long trips - sleeper bass, because the road takes 5-6 hours in duration. </p><p>  Riding a scooter or minibus to the center of the village, you can buy quite exotic souvenirs - these are pearls, crocodile leather, strange bottles with all kinds of snakes filled with balsam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 tourist reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/467422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists can, without spending too much time, purchase their favorite excursions directly at the hotel, directly from the tour operator.  However, there is an alternative.  In the resort village there are specialized tour agencies. <br>  For example, Rice Dragon.  However, the guests of the Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel <span>(Vietnam)</span> still rely more on the tour operator <span>.</span>  Their <span>reviews</span> are noted for reasonable prices, an assortment of excursions, professionalism of guides, comfort, safety. </p><h2>  Excursion to the city of Dolat (center of the resort of the same name) </h2><p>  In order to feel the contrasts of Vietnam, we recommend you to buy excursions to the alpine city of Dolat. </p><p>  On the way, you will see hydroelectric power plants that are different from what we are familiar with.  They are less powerful and are a pipe through which mountain streams run from the top of the mountains.  Inside the pipe is a turbine.  Such a hydroelectric power station feeds nearby villages with electricity. </p><p>  Tea and coffee are grown in this region.  You can buy coffee "Arabica" at a price of 400 rubles., "Luwak-1" - 750 rubles., "Luwak-2" - 520 rubles.  per kilogram.  And the range of relatively inexpensive products of the local silk factory has long been popular with tourists. </p><p>  At the highest point of the city, a Buddha statue is erected, and around it is a sculpture park visited by tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 mune" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/284165.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Here is a magnificent picturesque Buddhist Temple of Love. </p><h2>  Visit Nha Trang (center of the resort of the same name) </h2><p>  In order to diversify a relaxing ‚Äúrural‚Äù vacation at Canary Beach Resort 3 * (Vietnam, Phan Thiet), we recommend you to buy an overnight stay in Nha Trang one day before departure.  Staying in this 400 thousandth city, you can indulge yourself in the afternoon with inexpensive shopping (the cheapest thing is at the Cho-Dam market) or shopping in numerous boutiques.  Here it‚Äôs impossible to bring down the price, but still for $ 40-50 you can buy a thing from cotton, silk, bamboo, which you can‚Äôt buy at home and for $ 200.  The Vietnamese dong against the dollar can be calculated on the basis of the proportion: $ 100 - 2.1 million dong. </p><p>  And in the late afternoon you can visit a very worthy club.  If you speak English, then you will like the Silent Club.  If you want to hang out in a Russian-speaking company - ‚ÄúCrazy Frog‚Äù.  However, in both cases we recommend visiting the ‚Äúalmost gangster‚Äù bar ‚ÄúTarantino‚Äù, where for those with skills there is the opportunity to play billiards quite cool. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Every year, the tourist flow to Vietnam is increasing.  One of the favorite vacation spots of Russian-speaking tourists is the village of Mui Ne (compatriots, speaking of holidays in it, usually call it in our manner - "Mui Ne.") Moreover, some vacationers come to this resort more than once.  And this is a sign of the quality factor of a spa holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canary beach resort 3 hotel in vietnam" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1033110.jpg" width="600"></div>
