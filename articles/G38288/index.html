Autonomous lighting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Emergency lighting is an independent element of the central <span>lighting system, the</span> main purpose of which is to ensure the visibility and normal orientation of people on objects during the occurrence of breakdowns or shutdowns.  In addition, it is indispensable in all kinds of disasters of technological and natural origin.  In this regard, all public and industrial enterprises must be equipped with such a system without fail. </p><h2>  Varieties of emergency lighting systems </h2><p>  In general, such a system as emergency lighting is usually divided into two main varieties: backup and evacuation.  The main function of the first of them is to provide such an amount of light that is necessary to support the operability of enterprises related to the social sphere of activity, as well as those institutions, even a temporary stop of which can lead to disastrous consequences.  For example, this can include medical and social facilities, as well as companies involved in various types of hazardous production.  Here, at least two auxiliary lamps should be mounted in each room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emergency lighting" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/422677.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the second system, this is emergency lighting, which is necessary to ensure the urgent completion of all urgent types of work.  In addition, it is designed to help evacuate <span>plant personnel in the</span> event of a disaster or a threat to human life.  Installation of emergency luminaires and lamps is always carried out on the way to a safe exit at a distance that provides the smallest degree of illumination in the center of the corridor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Emergency Lighting Design </h2>

After a thorough analysis of the design documentation, the locations of the fixtures should be identified and designated.  As a result of the installation of these elements, the highest efficiency of their work should be ensured, taking into account the functional purpose of the room.  At the same time, it is imperative to take into account the operating life for which each emergency lamp is designed, as well as its power sources.  It should be noted that in order to avoid significant financial costs for the repair or installation of a new system in the future, it is important to carefully consider this issue at <span>the design stage.</span>

    <h2>  Mounting </h2><p>  Installation of emergency and central lighting systems in most cases is carried out in parallel, but not jointly.  The fact is that it is desirable that their power lines are not laid at all at the location of the main electrical wiring.  According to the legislation in force in our country, emergency lighting control should be carried out from the premises, distribution or group points, from substations or other places that only service personnel have access to.  Be that as it may, it is recommended that in the corridors there are no buttons to turn on or off the lamps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the places of their installation, they must be present above all emergency exit doors and safety signs, near fire-fighting tools and <span>panic button,</span> on flights of stairs, in tunnels and on escape routes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emergency light" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/422680.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Emergency lighting, regardless of its type, is a system that is not used often and intensively.  At the same time, if there is an urgent need for its application, the operation of each of the elements should be trouble-free.  In this regard, it is recommended that regular inspections by specialists not only of the equipment itself, but also of the communication networks.  Only in this case can we speak with confidence about the proper functioning of the entire system. </p><h2>  Choice of fixtures </h2><p>  Each emergency lighting luminaire should be selected, first of all, taking into account all regulatory documents that stipulate requirements for them in terms of electrical and fire safety.  Reliability of devices is also important, since it is not known under what conditions they can happen to function.  The housings of such lamps should be made of high quality materials.  As for the power sources, in various facilities, in the overwhelming majority of cases, emergency lighting fixtures with a battery are used.  As practice shows, without additional recharging, these devices can function for a period of time of one to three hours.  Along with this, options with other power sources have recently begun to appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emergency light" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/422681.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Types of fixtures </h2><p>  The luminaires used in the emergency lighting system are usually divided into three main groups depending on their functioning.  The first of these are permanent devices.  Their distinctive characteristic is that the lamp continues to operate even if it is disconnected from the mains.  The second type is lamps of intermittent action.  Their lamps are turned on only if there is a malfunction in the main lighting system.  The third category includes combination devices.  Their design provides for the installation of two or more lamps.  At the same time, one of them provides emergency lighting, while the rest operate from a common network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emergency lights with battery" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/422682.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomous lighting systems </h2><p>  Familiar incandescent lamps do not have a high efficiency, and their use at various sites is very expensive.  As a result, this leads to the constant emergence of new technologies and ideas in this area.  One of the most interesting among them was autonomous lighting, which operates through the conversion of solar and wind energy.  The main advantage of such systems is the absence of the need to lay electrical lines.  In addition, they do not need constant maintenance.  As practice shows, the most effective use of such systems in hazardous areas of highways (bridges, junctions, <span>railway crossings).</span>  Also, from year to year, they are increasingly appearing in many enterprises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autonomous lighting" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/422679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The autonomous lighting system itself is a high pole on which a <span>solar panel, a</span> wind generator and an LED lamp are mounted.  Throughout the day, the energy of the sun and wind is converted into electric current, which accumulates in batteries installed in a special box at the foot of the column, and can be used at any time. </p>
