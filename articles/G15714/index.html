For many years, its Mediterranean resorts were very popular, where mostly Russians came to rest.  Soon, tourists realized that this region is very congested, and the northern Turkish coast, which is washed by the Black Sea, gained popularity.  How does it rest and what's interesting there? </p><h2>  General information about the region </h2><p>  At first glance it seems that any resort in Turkey on the Black Sea is cold, windy and uncomfortable.  Someone associates it with typical Sochi beaches, others believe that there is no sun here, while others think that the Black Sea has too cold water. </p><p>  But everything will fall into place if you look at the map.  Have you ever had a cold summer in the Crimea?  And in the Kuban?  In these regions, the heat in July and August is unthinkable.  And the northern <span>Turkish coast</span> is located further south, almost in the tropical climatic zone.  The average daily temperature in the shade here is +32 degrees, the sea off the coast warms up to 25-28 - is it really cold?  As for the winds and rains, you should not worry too.  On the one hand, the Caucasus Mountains protect this region, and on the other, the Balkan ranges.  Therefore, the weather does not reach here. </p><p>  Well, now we offer a detailed look at every resort in Turkey on the Black Sea, in which there is something remarkable. </p><h2>  Sinop City </h2><p>  This place does not have an exact date of birth, because because of its unearthly beauty, it has attracted people from time immemorial.  Sinop is a resort in Turkey on the Black Sea, which is located on the Boztepe Peninsula.  It is fenced off from the mainland by a mountain range, which doubly protects it from unwanted cyclones.  This city is part-time and resort center of the country, and the largest port.  Tourists should definitely like the “mermaid beach”, which is covered with snow-white sand.  In addition to him, in the city and its environs you can find the most beautiful harbors, buried in the waters of the sea and the greenery of nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In Sinop, you can also see the most beautiful sights.  Locals are proud of the Alaeddin Mosque, which was erected in the 13th century.  Also, a local prison, from which no one could ever escape, and the Balatlar temple are considered a tourist attraction.  The Romans built it as a theater, and only during the Byzantine Empire the building began to be used as a church. </p><h2>  Samsun, Turkey </h2><p>  The most popular resort on the north coast of the country, which is in demand mainly by European tourists.  It was founded in the 6th century BC by the Greeks, their colony was here for a long time.  Therefore, the feeling that you are in Europe will not leave you while you study Samsun.  Turkey, however, also set its emphasis here in the form of mosques. </p><p>  The most popular local temple is the Charshamb Geggeli Jami Mosque.  Half of the building is made of wood, but this did not prevent him from holding out in his original condition for eight centuries.  The Muslim temple of Charsamba Sheikh Habil Jami is somewhat younger, but at the same time it is completely built of wood. </p>

    <p>  Turkey is an eastern country, very colorful and vibrant, and this city emphasizes all these qualities more than others.  Previously, it was a transit point on the Silk Road, so it absorbed all the delights of the East.  The main attraction of Trabzon is St. Sophia Cathedral, which was built during the Byzantine Empire.  Now it plays the role of a museum where all Christian relics have been preserved.  The oldest building of the city is a medieval castle.  You can just walk along it, feeling the spirit of a bygone era.  Also here is the magnificent Sumela Monastery, which is a masterpiece of architecture. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that, in terms of tourism, Trabzon is an underdeveloped city.  The all-inclusive system does not work in all hotels, there are difficulties with the English-language service.  The cuisine in the city is mainly local - high-calorie and very spicy. </p><h2>  Rize, Turkey </h2><p>  The town, which is located in the <span>north-east of the country,</span> literally borders on the Caucasus mountains.  Due to this, the local landscape looks like from a fairy tale - incredibly green, mountainous, bright and colorful.  In addition to all this, the city is located in the bay of the Black Sea, where it is always calm and calm.  The main asset of this area is its nature.  Tourists are offered to climb the Ikizdere, Chamlyheshim or Ayder plateau, enjoy the bird's eye view of the bay and tea plantations.  A few tens of kilometers from the city there are thermal springs - Ayder and Andon. </p>

    <p>  Fishermen are doing their favorite thing here on the shores of alpine lakes.  From the same peaks, rivers run at great speed, along which rafters overcome all obstacles in their boats.  It is worth noting that the infrastructure is well developed in Riesa.  There are many “above average” class hotels, night clubs, restaurants and bars. </p><h2>  Giresun - a city with a double history </h2><p>  Not far from Samsun, at the same time in the sea bay and in the forest green, is another pearl of the East.  Vacationers, especially our compatriots, know almost nothing about such a town as Giresun.  Turkey hid it between the brighter resorts, and perhaps not in vain, because it is here that the cleanest air, the quietest streets, the most unique landscapes. </p>

    <p>  The city center is the focus of two civilizations at once - Eastern and European.  There is a Catholic cathedral built in the 18th century, as well as several houses made in the same European spirit.  In the center is the Giresun fortress, as a symbol of the power of the region.  The second half of the historical part of the city is occupied by typically Turkish buildings.  These are mosques, and houses in oriental style, and monuments.  Five kilometers from the center of Giresun are incredibly beautiful beaches. </p><h2>  Forgotten resort </h2><p>  All modern travel guides only casually mention a town called Zonguldak.  Turkey, as you know, is a major exporter of coal, and it is from this region that this product is delivered to Europe by sea.  Zonguldak is located not far from Istanbul, it is close to the border with Greece, but is located in the bay of the Black Sea. </p><p>  Many argue that this city is purely port and industrial (something like Odessa), there are no gorgeous white beaches, there is no service and five-star hotels.  In many ways, these words correspond to reality, but we offer to explore the city from a completely different perspective.  Firstly, a huge number of architectural monuments are concentrated here - bridges, house-museums, Orthodox churches and mosques.  Natural beauties are simply indescribable.  What only is Mount Gel, a forest named after National Sovereignty, Kyzyl Elma Caves and much more.  As for the beaches, they are really narrow, small, but very picturesque. </p>

    <p>  The resorts are not worn out, there are few people, the nature is incredibly beautiful, there are historical sights.  In the north of Turkey, the flavor of this country, both architectural and national, is felt more than anywhere else.  And of course, the variety of local resorts allows you to choose the type of vacation - beach, active or informative. </p>
