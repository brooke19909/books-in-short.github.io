To answer this question, you must first deal with the tariff and options that you have connected.  Verification methods vary, and you need to know all the nuances in order not to encounter unpleasant situations.  And first of all, we will look at what this parameter of mobile communication is like. </p><h2>  Why traffic? </h2><p>  How to find out the rest of the traffic on Tele2?  This question is sometimes asked by many subscribers.  Verification is necessary so that the subscriber is aware of the possibility of using the World Wide Web.  Not all tariffs require unlimited internet, so it is recommended to monitor the remaining megabytes.  Traffic shows how much more data a subscriber can download for free.  As soon as the threshold is overcome, you will have to use the Internet at the base price or connect additional options.  Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the end of traffic in order to avoid unexpected financial losses.  And how to find out the rest of the traffic on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù tariffs, we will tell further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tarife.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanks to traffic, you can use the Internet" class="if uuid-3139676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3139676.jpg"></div><h2>  Validation Using the USSD Command </h2><p>  Due to the fact that mobile technologies are constantly being improved, the subscriber gets the opportunity to use different methods of obtaining information.  The first step is to consider the option of checking balances using the USSD command.  This method is the simplest.  In order to know traffic in this way, you need to perform the following steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Dial the command * 155 * 0 #, then press the call button. </li><li>  Wait for SMS messages. </li><li>  Read all the information on the residues of your traffic. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how the remnants of traffic in your account look like" class="if uuid-3139700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3139700.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure is simple, does not take much time and is convenient to use.  Such a request is absolutely free and has no restrictions.  Thanks to him, you can immediately understand how to find out the rest of Internet traffic on Tele2.  But we will not stop there and proceed to consider other methods. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  Among all the options there is the most understandable - appeal to support subscribers.  This method has one minus - you have to wait a few minutes for the operator to respond.  At the same time, you are guaranteed to solve your question and get all the necessary information.  To use this method, just follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial 611, press the call button. </li><li>  Answer all inquiries of an answering machine. </li><li>  Wait for the operator to pick up the phone. </li><li>  Explain your problem. </li><li>  Provide all the necessary information at the request of the operator (the data of your SIM card, full name or key word). </li><li>  For convenience, you can request sending information via SMS. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="roicallcentersolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The operator can answer any questions." class="if uuid-3138219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138219.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to this method, you will never think about how to find out the rest of the traffic on Tele2.  Calling an operator is a universal option.  It takes more time, but guarantees a positive result.  Now consider the last method, which involves visiting the site. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using your account </h2><p>  Any large company has its own personal information resource.  This mobile operator is no exception.  Thanks to the site, the subscriber can receive the latest news, updated offers on services and information on his phone number.  Using this method, you will immediately figure out how to find out the rest of the traffic on Tele2, since this information is on the site.  And to make it convenient for you to use it, we offer the following instructions: </p><ol><li>  Go to the official website of the company. </li><li>  On the top right, click on the "Enter your account" button. </li><li>  Indicate the mobile number "Tele2". </li><li>  Receive SMS with a code. </li><li>  Enter the information received. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.simonlyabonnement.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the rest of the traffic on body2" class="if uuid-3140420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/3140420.jpg"></div><p>  This option takes you just a couple of minutes.  True, you may encounter some problems and restrict access.  In this case, be sure to call the operator and report this negative situation.  In conclusion, we will talk about the ability to check the balance of additional Internet packages. </p><h2>  Checking traffic in individual options </h2><p>  How to find out the rest of the traffic on Tele2 from the Black tariff?  What about other services?  In fact, the procedure for obtaining information is not different from that which we examined above.  A completely different situation arises if you want to check the balance for individual options.  In this case, you will most likely need to call the operator. </p><p>  If you use one of the options, we recommend that you write down a combination that will allow you to monitor the balances.  You can call the operator, but it is better to learn from him a special USSD-command and in the future already personally check the balances.  And remember that initially the traffic is spent from the connected option, and only then the main package starts to be consumed.  Using these methods, you will always be aware of the current remnants of the Internet and you will always be able to go online. </p><p>  Now you have useful instructions that you can actively use.  Each of the methods is relevant and will allow you to resolve the issue of traffic once and for all. </p>
