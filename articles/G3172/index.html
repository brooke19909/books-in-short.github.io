  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY rope baskets - 4 craft options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Linen or hemp ropes - this is a great material for creative crafts.  They are used for decorating flower pots, weaving and creating macramé.  Wonderful are self-made rope baskets.  There are many options for their manufacture.  It is best to use material made from natural fibers.  The containers are denser and last a long time. </p><p>  Some craftsmen pre-sheathe the rope with fabric, creating floral or striped crafts.  The article will take a closer look at how to make do-it-yourself baskets of ropes in four different ways.  The photographs presented and a detailed description of the work will help to repeat the sample at home.  It’s easy to do crafts, the main thing is to choose a high-quality rope. </p><h2>  Crochet </h2><p>  The first presented sample <span>basket made of ropes with their own hands is</span> made using strong nylon threads and a crochet hook.  Sewing threads from the bottom begins.  The rope must be folded in half and a seam over the edge to bypass the entire length of one strip.  Attach the next segment next and continue the seam, capturing it already.  The photo below shows how the rope is located further.  It goes around several times around the first part until you get the desired bottom area.  The kapron thread is tightened so that the rope is tightly tensioned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makemydaycreative.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a basket of ropes" class="if uuid-3110909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110909.jpg"></div><p>  Then the height of the basket is raised.  The rope continues to wrap the bottom, but they already have it not in a spiral, but one above the other.  You can use a template, such as a round or rectangular bucket or box.  To form the handles, leave the extended loops in two rows on the sides, without attaching the selected segments to the basket.  They can be additionally tied with cloth or colored tape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Container gluing </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself laundry basket is easy to assemble around a dense base.  They take any container, wrap it additionally with a cloth from the outside and glue it with a rope in a spiral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lydioutloud.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gluing a container with a rope" class="if uuid-3110938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110938.jpg"></div><p>  Use hot glue for strong adhesion.  When the required height is reached, the craft is left aside until the glue completely dries.  Then the fabric is removed from the container along with a rope basket and decorated as desired. </p><h2>  Based weaving </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself baskets of ropes can be made by weaving.  To do this, you need some kind of capacity for which the work will actually be done.  Weaving begins from the center of the bottom, linking together several separate pieces of rope of the same length.  The ends are distributed in a circle at an equal distance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basket weaving" class="if uuid-3110949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110949.jpg"></div><p>  Further, a long segment is wound around in a spiral, and the end is threaded in a checkerboard pattern, that is, under one segment from below, and the next is bent from above.  Weaving is carried out tightly, each turn must be carefully straightened. </p><h2>  Stapling </h2><p>  The next basket of ropes do it yourself with a sewing machine.  Start work, as in most cases, from the bottom.  The end of the rope is bent with a loop and sewed in a zigzag seam.  Gradually twist the rope with a spiral and sew each level to the previous one.  Thus, they act until the height of the craft reaches the desired level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitching rope" class="if uuid-3110962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110962.jpg"></div><p>  If the basket is carried out with the extension up, then the loops are not sewn so tightly, spiral coils are attached more freely.  To form the handles, the rope is slightly pushed away from the main part and continued to be attached further.  A similar action is performed on the other side of the basket. </p><p>  In the article, you got acquainted with the manufacture of baskets from a rope with your own hands, a master class will help you do the crafts yourself at home.  Have a good start! </p>
