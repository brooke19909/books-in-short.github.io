Moscow introduced the first bar of its kind in 2003.  However, the idea of ​​serving delicious dishes and entertaining visitors with good music originated long before this date. </p><h2>  Good idea </h2><p>  In 1971, young and talented Americans opened a small institution in British London.  Men were so homesick that they decided that the main focus of their cafe would be food and drinks, popular in the United States.  However, the highlight of the restaurant was that visitors in the stiff and restrained capital of England could enjoy rock. </p>

    <p>  A special atmosphere reigned in the hall.  Accordingly, every musician and singer who worked in this style was actually obliged to visit the “Hard Rock Cafe”.  <span>Moscow, Paris</span> and even Washington could not boast of such an institution.  Very soon, the owners realized that their idea was a success.  Therefore, in 1985, successful entrepreneurs opened a second restaurant, but not in London, but in New York.  This bar also hosted hundreds of guests a day, so the Americans decided to launch a whole network of such establishments. </p><h2>  The conquest of domestic spaces </h2><p>  Now in more than 50 countries of the world there are more than 200 cafeterias of this series.  Only recently has the network reached the CIS countries.  Consequently, the Russian capital was the first to open this institution on its territory.  The “Hard Rock Cafe” on Arbat was launched on September 17, 2003.  It should be noted that the total area of ​​this institution is the same in size as in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a cult bar, they were looking for a convenient location - right in the center of the capital.  Designers and engineers for a very long time deciding where to open a restaurant.  The choice fell on the old three-story mansion, which differs from other houses in elegance and sophistication.  Now such a large and spacious room hosts and organizes banquets for more than 500 people. </p><p>  People come for an exceptional atmosphere.  The restaurant is designed in rock and roll style.  This is another legend of Hard Rock Cafe.  Thanks to this bar, Moscow now also has a peculiar museum. </p>

    <h2>  Rich collection </h2><p>  The story tells that famous London artists visited an unusual London institution.  One of the regular guests was the famous British musician Eric Clapton.  The man loved to sit at the same table every time he came.  However, often his place was taken by other guests.  Then the composer decided to give his stylish old guitar unsuitable for concerts to a stylish restaurant.  The owners hung the tool over Eric's chair.  Thus, the man secured a table.  In just two weeks, following the example of Clapton, another guitarist also mailed his instrument to his favorite institution.  After the events of 1979, many years passed.  Today, more than 70 thousand exclusive exhibits are in the “Hard Rock Cafe”.  Moscow also has something to show guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In particular, in the collection of the capital's institution, one of the <span>stage costumes of the</span> world-famous godfather of heavy metal Ozzy Osbourne.  Visitors can see on the cafe wall the coat of American virtuoso guitarist Jimi Hendrix.  Another pride of the restaurant is a letter telling about one of the members of the Sex Pistols band - <span>Side Vises.</span> </p>

    <h2>  The nuances of a foreign menu </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the kitchen also offers vegetarian food.  Therefore, instead of a meat one, you can ask for a soy cutlet, the price of which is practically the same.  Guests note that another big plus is the children's menu.  There are original desserts. </p><p>  However, there is a significant drawback.  <span>American cuisine is</span> very unusual.  Accordingly, not every Russian organism is capable of immediately perceiving strange foreign food.  Especially often, people don’t like the famous and popular steak of various roasts in the USA. </p><p>  The “Hard Rock Cafe” menu indicates that such delicacies can affect the body in different ways.  Some clients note that such information worries them, while others say that they lose their appetite.  Often, guests complained of poor health after dinner. </p><h2>  Staff work </h2><p>  Separately, guests praise alcoholic beverages.  Typically, customers leave positive feedback on the <span>work of the bartender</span> and the quality of cooking.  Slightly departed from the general rules of “Hard Rock Cafe” on the Arbat.  Prices in Moscow are higher than their foreign counterparts.  However, impressions of the rest are worth that kind of money - regular visitors are convinced. </p><p>  The bar menu is much wider.  Customers can order both interesting and colorful foreign cocktails, as well as domestic vodka and wine. </p><p>  Sometimes visitors complain about the quality of work and the attitude of the staff.  However, such comments are extremely rare.  Most vacationers note that the service here is at the highest level and is not inferior to similar establishments in other countries.
