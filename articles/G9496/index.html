    <h2>  Lushan </h2><p>  Today, thousands of tourists from all over the world visit China.  Nature reserves and national parks, whose names are quite difficult for the pronunciation of Europeans, are of great interest.  Many of them are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  For example, Lushan National Park, covering an area of ​​more than 300 square kilometers.  It is located south of the city of Jiujiang, in the province of Jiangxi, near Lake Poinhu. </p><p>  This national park has about a hundred mountain peaks, among them Hanpolin, Shuangjianfeng, Shansofeng.  The highest mountain is Dahanyanfeng (1474 m).  There are many waterfalls here: Sandequan, Ximenjian, Kaisian.  The climate is mid-mountain - summers are very warm (in July + 25.8 degrees Celsius), and winters are mild (in January the average temperature is +7.3 degrees).  The park was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List back in 1996. </p><p>  There are several Taoist and Buddhist temples along Mount Lushan, as well as the Zhu Xi School (Neo-Confucian).  All these sights are surprisingly harmoniously combined with natural beauties.  The main attractions of the park are: hermit's huts;  the building of the Eighth plenum of the Central Committee of 1959;  Zhushan Buddhist Temple; </p><ul><li>  flower paths; </li><li>  holy cave; </li><li>  valley; </li><li>  waterfalls; </li><li>  mountain streams; </li><li>  lakes; </li><li>  the woods; </li><li>  sources; </li><li>  Botanical Garden. </li></ul><h2>  Arshan Geopark </h2><p>  Not all national parks in China have hot springs on their territory.  In the Arshan geopark, on an area of ​​814 square kilometers, there are 76 springs, in which the water is healing, and therefore tourists are happy to go on this route. </p><p>  The park is located in the autonomous region of <span>Inner Mongolia,</span> near Arshan County, in the center of the Great Khingan mountain system.  The vast territory with glacial and volcanic relief has dense forests, endless steppes, <span>azure lakes</span> and rivers.  In addition, in the park there is a volcano of Halah, of extraordinary beauty, the mountain lake Tianchi, whose name translates as "Pond in Heaven."  It is located at an altitude of 1300 meters above sea level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China what are the reserves and national parks" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1452628.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Zhangjiajie Park </h2><p>  And finally, we want to introduce you to one of the oldest, most popular and most visited Zhangjiajie National Park (China).  A unique nature reserve is located in the southeastern province of Hunan, which is located 32 km from the city of the same name.  It was created to protect rare species of animals and plants, as well as amazing rocky landscapes. </p><p>  The beauty of this part of the Wulingyuan mountain range was appreciated by European tourists.  Travel agents recommend planning a trip to these places in spring or autumn.  The exception is the beginning of May and October, when national holidays are held in China and crowds of local residents are flooding the park.  At the peak of the season - in the summer - it is also crowded here: if you can still find deserted corners while walking in the park, it is difficult to squeeze into crowded buses or stay out of bed because of problems with booking - a rather dubious pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie national park china photo" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1452316.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In winter, the rocky peaks look very impressive, but it is not safe to travel along the snowy mountain trails. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Chinese researchers are still arguing about the name of the park.  There are several versions of its appearance.  Most historians are inclined to believe that the name Zhang Liang is hidden in it.  <span>This is a disgraced</span> aristocrat who played a major role in the formation of the Han Dynasty, but as a result was forced to hide with his family in the vicinity of the current reserve in the 2nd century BC.  e.  Here he died and was buried. </p><p>  This information is reliable, confirmed by numerous written sources.  There are legends that tell gullible tourists: they are still shown several graves of Zhang Liang, located in different parts of Hunan.  The “main” of them is located at the village of Zhangjiajie at the border of the park. </p><h2>  Description of the park </h2><p>  Initially, in 1982, <span>Zhangjiajie National Park</span> (China), the photo of which we posted below, occupied a modest-sized territory - 4810 ha.  After 10 years, the mountains of Wulingyuan, as well as Zhangjiajie, were included in the UNESCO list.  Immediately after this, the size of the park was increased to 130 square kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what national parks are in china" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1452631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cliffs </h2><p>  On a vast territory there are 243 mountains.  Their average height is 800 m, although there are giants with a height of more than three thousand meters.  The popular observation deck, Huangshi, rises 1300 meters above sea level, with 3800 steps leading to it.  Rocks resemble easily destroyed limestones, but this is only at first glance. </p><p>  Mountains that resemble huge figured candles appeared in the process of weathering of quartz sandstones, as well as the gradual "subversive" work of plant roots, which in Zhangjiajie, due to high humidity, a huge amount.  They do not miss the slightest opportunity to capture more and more new territories.  The tops of the rocks are covered with dense thickets of conifers.  When fog descends here (in Zhangjiajie this happens very often), it seems that giant stone fragments soar in the air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China nature reserves and national parks names" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1452626.jpg" width="600"></div>

All attractions of the park are connected by cable car.

Its ceiling is mirrored, and the walls are made of high-strength glass.  Amazing views can be enjoyed from the pedestrian walkway with glass floors.  It is located at an altitude of 1430 meters. </p>
