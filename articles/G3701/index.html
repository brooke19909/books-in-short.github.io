Each material is individual and good in its own way.  It is worth a little closer to get acquainted with the most common fabrics that are often used for sewing various products.  So, for example, for the manufacture of bedding by modern manufacturers, cotton and satin are most often used. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A few thousand years ago, on the shores of India, people learned to grow cotton.  In Mexico, began to produce cotton fabric for many years BC.  After, thanks to merchants, textiles came to Europe and the Greco-Roman Empire and gradually reached the west.  Cotton was cultivated in almost 80 countries.  Cotton fabric accounts for 40% of the total fabric production.  Today, there are about 50 varieties of this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theland.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton field" class="if uuid-2983148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2983148.jpg"></div><p>  As for sateen, back in the 12th century in China it was used for sewing expensive clothes.  At cost, outfits from this material were not available to everyone, and aristocrats and wealthy Europeans bought it.  China was the supplier and manufacturer of this material, and only in the middle of the nineteenth century did Europe patent its production.  Such clothes were sewn of expensive material and no less expensive lingerie.  In the XX century, the production technology of the material was improved.  It became available to ordinary people due to lower costs.  Now, satin clothing was not a luxury. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Characteristics and composition of the canvas </h2><p>  After collecting, the cotton is cleaned of seeds.  The fibers are bored and pressed for further processing.  Seeds, in turn, are left for further sowing and making oil, which is suitable for cooking.  Cotton fibers are carefully selected to evaluate product quality.  The fiber length and color are determined.  Coloring can be white, cream, yellow.  The quality of cotton is affected by the degree of transparency and contamination. </p><p>  After all the manipulations, cotton goes to production, where yarn and threads are made from it.  The latter are used in sewing production - from them it is possible to produce knitted things and fabrics.  Everyone's favorite jeans are also made from cotton.  After the fabric is made, it goes to the factories for sewing clothes or bedding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored satin fabric." class="if uuid-2977619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2977619.jpg"></div><p>  Satin is 100% cotton, since cotton threads that have undergone special processing are used for the production of fabric.  The production technology provides for the interweaving of threads of various calibers.  For the production of 1 square.  m satin needs from 90 to 200 cotton threads.  As a result, the finished canvas has a smooth and pleasant structure. </p><h2>  Fabric properties </h2><p>  As you already understood, cotton and satin are similar to each other.  The properties of the tissues are almost similar.  Consider the pros and cons of the canvas.  Positive qualities of clothing: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Keeps warm for a long time, as cotton consists of hollow fibers.  Even thin knitwear is pleasant to the body and retains heat for a long time. </li><li>  Cotton and satin absorb moisture well.  When wet, things from such fabrics become stronger. </li><li>  Clothing made from cotton raw material keeps its shape well after ironing. </li><li>  This fabric is hypoallergenic, so baby clothes are sewn exclusively from cotton fabrics.  It is also suitable for people who have problem skin. </li><li>  The durability of the fabric.  The material retains its strength up to 300 washes. </li><li>  The fabric is not picky about care.  Stains can be removed in organic solvents and ordinary detergents. </li><li>  Cotton and satin have a democratic value.  They are available to every consumer and is always on sale.  Clothing made from such material will not hit the consumer‚Äôs wallet very much. </li><li>  Fabrics are very durable.  As a rule, even those that have lost their presentable appearance have long been used as work clothes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeshop18.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Linens." class="if uuid-2977628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2977628.jpg"></div><p>  Negative qualities: </p><ul><li>  When washing, the product may shrink. </li><li>  The fabric cannot be exposed to direct sunlight for a long time, as the threads of the fabric become thinner. </li><li>  Cloth and clothes do not stretch. </li></ul><p>  Compared with positive qualities, minor disadvantages of fabrics do not affect the popularity of products at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Assortment of cotton fabrics </h2><p>  Cotton itself is very strong and durable.  But the fabrics made from it may differ in some characteristics.  Here are just a few of them: </p><ul><li>  CANNET  Soft and very dense material.  But things from such material are very rare on sale. </li><li>  Jacquard.  The fabric is often used for upholstery.  It is easy to make various patterns on such material.  Sew shirts from jacquard.  They are very comfortable and pleasant to the body. </li><li>  Chintz.  From this fabric sew dresses for everyday wear, bedding, diapers for babies, men's shirts.  The material is a little rough.  In Russia, it began to be popular in the 70s of the last century. </li><li>  Denim  Dense and durable material.  It is made by twill weaving of cotton threads.  A variety of denim is the well-known jeans.  To make the fabric softer and more comfortable for sewing clothes, some synthetics are added to the jeans. </li><li>  Velveteen.  The fabric is quite popular.  At one time, corduroy pants were at the height of fashion.  However, velveteen is extremely finicky.  On the protruding parts of the body, the structure is rapidly changing.  In addition, velveteen is difficult to clean. </li><li>  Flannel.  Popular fabric due to the softness of the fiber.  Pajamas, nightgowns, underwear made of flannel fabric are very popular among consumers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.jackbfabrics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabrics in the apartment" class="if uuid-2977545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2977545.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of Satin </h2><p>  Satin fabric (or 100% cotton) is also divided into certain varieties.  The difference lies in the manufacturing method.  This factor also affects the cost of the canvas.  The cheaper material is made of 85-170 cotton threads per square centimeter.  More expensive fabrics are made from 200 twisted threads.  In the textile industry, six types of satin are used: </p><ol><li>  Regular look or classic satin.  The most affordable type of fabric.  In terms of external characteristics it is equal to average quality.  After washing, spools are formed on the surface of the clothes of such material. </li><li>  Satin jacquard is made of 220 threads.  The canvas has high strength and smooth surface.  A pattern may be applied to the material.  There is special equipment for this.  This type of fabric belongs to the premium class. </li><li>  The printed look is woven from 130-170 threads.  Such a canvas is light and hygroscopic.  The appearance is aesthetic and very beautiful.  Refers to expensive paintings. </li><li>  Silk satin has a flawless appearance.  It consists of cotton and silk without other impurities.  At its cost refers to expensive materials. </li><li>  Mako Satin is made up of Egyptian cotton threads.  It is made by special reactive technology.  Clothing made from such a fabric belongs to the elite category.  The material is soft and has a smooth surface. </li><li>  Printed fabric refers to the standard group of materials.  The canvas is strong and durable in operation.  Withstands a large number of washings.  This fabric is often used to make bedding. </li></ol><p>  In addition to the main types of satin, there are many others: take, crepe, dress, lining, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.shopotam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful cotton fabrics." class="if uuid-2979798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2979798.jpg"></div><h2>  Which material is better? </h2><p>  Which is better: cotton or satin?  It is difficult to give a definite answer to this question, since these fabrics are very similar to each other.  Indeed, 100% cotton is used to make satin.  The only difference between them is that cotton is quickly wrinkled and satin is an expensive material.  Manufacturing technology is different way of weaving. </p><h2>  What is made of satin and cotton? </h2><p>  Cotton satin is acceptable for the manufacture of underwear and children's underwear, as well as summer clothes.  If polyester yarns are added to the cotton fiber, the fabric becomes stronger, and such textiles are used to make curtains, upholstery and home furnishings.  Lining fabrics are made from satin-double, which subsequently go to tailoring beautiful costumes.  Materials such as crepe satin and satin satin are loved by fashionistas.  They sew elegant dresses or suits.  Bed linen made of satin or cotton is very popular among housewives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satin Curtains" class="if uuid-2977617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2977617.jpg"></div><h2>  Linens </h2><p>  We spend a lot of time in bed.  Each person wants to feel comfort and coziness at night.  On the shelves of the store you can find a huge assortment of bedding.  They can be of different colors, sizes, from different materials.  When choosing, a logical question may arise - which bed is better (satin or cotton)?  It all depends on the financial situation of the buyer.  Both options are good.  Cotton bedding has its own strengths: reasonable cost, ease of use and care, the ability to wash at high temperatures, the absence of allergies, breathability.  The weak side of cotton is that when washing the laundry can sit down, dry for a long time and may fade in direct sunlight. </p><p>  As for the satin bedding, then it has both positive and negative sides.  The pluses include the durability of products - they do not lose their presentable appearance even with a large number of washings, do not sit down, hold heat well.  Only two points can be attributed to the minuses: cost and poor bandwidth (in the summer it is very hot).  Cotton or satin bedding is perfect for a crib. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.exportersindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton bedding" class="if uuid-2977622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/2977622.jpg"></div><h2>  Material Care </h2><p>  For the material to last a long time, adhere to some rules of care: </p><ul><li>  The spin mode should be manual or gentle. </li><li>  Wash with soft powders without adding bleach.  At a temperature of no higher than 40 degrees. </li><li>  Do not dry under direct rays. </li><li>  Iron at minimum iron temperature. </li></ul><p>  All that remains is to add that cotton and satin are ideal materials for home textiles.  They are versatile, durable and safe. </p>
