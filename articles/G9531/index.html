The number of visitors to the "land of smiles" is growing steadily every year.  This is understandable: the nature of these places is fascinating, the modern infrastructure meets fashionable trends, the variety of parks, temples and shopping complexes is striking in its scale.  The most popular resorts are still Pattaya and the island of Phuket.  Often tourists make a double trip (Bangkok - Pattaya or Bangkok - Phuket) in order to enjoy the sights of the kingdom's capital for several days. </p><p>  The hotel base of the country is distinguished by a high level of service, traditional interior elements that are harmoniously combined with fashionable architectural directions.  Travelers need to solve a rather complicated problem: choose the best hotel from the best.  Often in travel agencies they say that vacationers just get tired of rereading numerous reviews, they have a "head spin" from the proposed many accommodation facilities.  According to tourists on the most popular booking sites, the Best Bella Pattaya hotel has been consistently leading the way over the past few years.  This is also confirmed by managers in travel agencies who examined the hotel personally during advertising trips to North Pattaya. </p><h2>  Thailand is a country where the joy of the moment is appreciated </h2><p>  Coming here, I want to "embrace the immense"!  Thailand offers such a diverse vacation that it is impossible to distinguish the categories of travelers by type of tourism.  People of all ages and religions come here, active travelers and lovers soak up the shore of the Gulf of Thailand, business tourists and shopaholics, the young generation who prefer nightlife and retirees who find paradise, quiet corners in calm and comfortable hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  What you need to know when traveling to Thailand?  Residents are very religious, love and honor the royal family, kind and smiling, do not rush anywhere, enjoy life and never grumble.  In the country there are a lot of temples of Buddha, and near each dwelling (even the smallest) there is a beautiful "house of spirits".  Thais do not like to be photographed without permission.  Children cannot be stroked on the head: it is believed that the soul of a person is there, it can be frightened off.  They can be fined and even sent to prison for crushing or throwing a baht (a banknote of the country with the image of a king).  In general, everything is pretty good and cute: an abundance of eateries (the Thais erected a real cult of food!), Funny go-go bars, laughter and music are heard around.  The hotel territories are usually calm, and the beaches can be found pristine and uninhabited. </p><h2>  Features of rest in northern Pattaya </h2><p>  This is a fairly calm area, which is often chosen by families with children and tourists who value silence and peace.  On the other hand, if you suddenly want entertainment, you can easily and quickly get to the city center.  The beaches here are less busy and cleaner. </p>

    <p>  The main means of transportation in the country are motorbikes and cars.  They say that a rental car can be obtained even without a license.  There are practically no sidewalks, so vacationers may feel some discomfort when walking around the city.  It is best to use a tuk-tuk, where you will be taken at a measured speed at an affordable price to wherever you say.  By the way, Thais speak very specific English, which is difficult to understand even for a Briton.  The peculiarity of the pronunciation is the excessive softening of many consonants, if you take this into account, you can parse some words.  In other cases, sign language and facial expressions will always save us! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why choose the Best Bella Pattaya hotel? </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, it offers an excellent price / quality ratio.  The hotel is considered one of the best on the north coast of Pattaya (in the Naklua area).  The modern Best Bella Pattaya 4 * building, which features large panoramic windows, was built in 2007.  Regular renovations keep the infrastructure in very good condition.  According to vacationers (this can also be seen in the photo), the Best Bella Pattaya hotel looks completely new. </p>

    <p>  Hotel guests liked that the offered assortment in the restaurant included many dishes of fish and seafood, meat.  Vegetables and exotic fruits were presented in abundance, there were dairy products and cereals, cereals for small guests. </p><h2>  At the disposal of tourists ... </h2><p>  In warm weather, it‚Äôs quite lively near the outdoor pool, where children and adults bathe, someone sunbathes on the sunbeds, while others talk pleasantly over a glass of wine near the bar.  You can take a walk in the beautiful garden to remember the delightful beauty of tropical plants, breathe in the delicate aroma of flowers and take spectacular photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  Vacationers can use the sports and fitness complex, which houses a fitness room with modern fitness equipment, an indoor swimming pool, a sauna, a massage room, and a jacuzzi.  Tourists are given the opportunity to sing a song in the karaoke lounge, play billiards.  Everyone who wants to actively spend time on independent sightseeing trips around the city rent a bike from the hotel and explore the surroundings. </p><h2>  Gulf of Thailand </h2><p>  The road to the sea takes only 5 minutes, and the picturesque rocky coast of the Andaman Sea appears before the vacationers.  A little away is the clean sandy beach of Wongamat, which is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, deck chairs, changing rooms, showers, drinking water.  All the most popular water activities are available for tourists in this beautiful place: yachting and boating, riding a banana and a scooter, diving, snorkeling and much more. </p><p>  Tourists liked the beach: the water is clear, crystal clear, the territory is often cleaned up, there was no large debris, there were plenty of sunbeds for everyone. </p><h2>  We walk around the hotel </h2><p>  Families with children choose this hotel because within walking distance there is a stunning Oceanarium, where dolphin shows are most impressive.  By the way, walking there is not necessary - a free shuttle bass from the hotel can take everyone there.  The so-called "massage shop", which is located very close to the hotel, is in great demand.  Here you can relax under the gentle hands of professional and skilled Thais in this skill.  Lovers of "heavy metal" can sweeten their ears with a wonderful performance of this musical direction in Hard Rock Cafe. </p><p>  The trip to Walking Street in tuk-tuk or shuttle bass takes no more than 15 minutes.  Here you can see the fiery nightlife of Pattaya in all its diversity: bars and cafes, clubs with go-go "barkers", shops and boutiques, snack bars, cabaret shows "Alcazar", "Tiffany", etc. </p><h2>  Crocodiles, tigers, temples - we study the world around us </h2><p>  The most popular excursions in the city will be surely told to tourists at the hotel.  Sometimes it seems that a whole month is not enough to go around all the sights of Pattaya.  If you come with children, be sure to bring them to the Oceanarium, an open zoo where animals do not sit in cages, but move freely around a large territory and are not at all afraid of people.  Big and small visitors are interested in a pineapple and oyster farm, in a large tiger reserve, the new Ramayana water park with an incredible number of slides and attractions.  Look at the show of trained elephants in the Nong Chung tropical garden, and the orchid garden, Japanese, French and Italian plant corners will not leave anyone indifferent. </p>
