It is these epithets that I want to operate with when it comes to a small resort town in the south of France - Saint-Tropez.  Talking about this delight of holidaymakers and filmmakers is a pleasure, therefore, we will not linger on entry for a long time, but we will go straight to a detailed description of the beautiful place. </p><h2>  Location of the famous resort </h2><p>  <span>France, the Cote d'Azur of the</span> Mediterranean Sea, 43 ¬∞ 16‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ north latitude and 6 ¬∞ 37‚Ä≤99 ‚Ä≥ east longitude - these are the dry geographical data on the location of the famous resort.  Finding Saint-Tropez on a map of France is not very simple.  This tiny fashionable town is lost in the middle of the huge <span>French Riviera</span> and is located next to such mega-popular recreation centers such as Nice and Cannes. </p>

    <p>  From Cannes to Saint-Tropez is only 41 km, and the distance to Nice is much greater - 90 km.  Another name on the map that will help you find San-Tropes through your eyes is Port Grimaud - a small charming village built right on the water and nicknamed it Provencal Venice. </p><h2>  History of Saint Tropez </h2><p>  This is a city with a long history.  Saint Tropez owes its name to the Holy Great Martyr Torpis, who during the time of the persecution of Christians in the 1st century was beheaded by order of the dictator Nero.  And although the execution took place in the region of Pisa, a boat with the body of St. Torpis was washed ashore exactly in the place where a modern fashionable resort was subsequently formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At the end of the XV century.  the owners of San-Tropes were the Grimaud family.  There is one date in the history of the town, which is annually marked by a ceremonial parade: in 1637, the inhabitants of Saint-Tropez repulsed the attack of the Spanish flotilla, which consisted of 22 galleons. </p><p>  Previously, San-Tropes was, rather, not a city, but an ordinary fishing village, not particularly distinguished from the many other coastal villages of Provence.  Artist <span>Paul Signac was the</span> first to discover the beauty of this place, settling here in the 20s of the last century.  Since then, well-known representatives of artistic bohemia have been frequented there. </p><h2>  Saint-Tropez Attractions </h2><p>  The city offers its guests an extensive and interesting cultural program.  There is something to see in this place.  For example, all tourists are eager to visit the unique butterfly museum, which presents more than 4,500 copies of these beautiful insects, including very rare and endangered species.  Maison des Papillon is open for visits from April to October. </p><p>  For people who know a lot about art, there is an opportunity to get to the Mus√©e de l'Annonciade, where there is a wonderful exhibition of works by artists inspired by the beauties of these places.  After all, it is known that many eminent and talented painters loved to live and create in Saint-Tropez.  Attractions are not limited to butterflies and artistic landscapes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Curious travelers can visit the Old Port, which is the hallmark of the town.  This is a very busy place with many expensive yachts standing at the berths.  Around there are large and small chic cafes and shops, and a motley smart crowd is walking.  The old Suffren Castle flaunts right above the port.  Its construction was started back in 980.  And next to the castle is a large open square, on which there is a historical museum. </p><h2>  Glorious cinematic past </h2><p>  As already mentioned, once Saint-Tropez was not at all so popular and famous.  But in 1956, the legendary film director Roger Vadim made the film ‚ÄúAnd God created a woman‚Äù with the inimitable <span>Brigitte Bardot</span> in the title role.  Since then, fame fell on the town, and it became a real cinematic Mecca. </p><p>  In the 60s of the last century, a whole series of magnificent </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sen tropez photo" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20467/442974.jpg" width="305"></div>  French comedies about gendarmes, in which one of the best comedians of all time played - <span>Louis de Funes.</span>  And in 1968, the movie ‚ÄúThe Pool‚Äù was released on world screens with Alain Delon and <span>Romy Schneider</span> in the lead roles, the action of this detective also takes place in Saint-Tropez.  France can be proud of such a cultural heritage.

    <p>  All the mentioned movie masterpieces literally glorified this place.  The town was chosen by wealthy travelers and yachtsmen.  Now it is one of the most prestigious and expensive resort places in the world, and many dream at least with one eye to see Saint-Tropez.  A memory photo, by the way, can be taken near the old building, which housed the famous gendarmerie from old films. </p><h2>  San-Tropes: beaches, shopping and entertainment </h2><p>  Of course, this seaside resort town has beautiful beaches.  Moreover, there are both luxurious sandy "wild" and private ones, specially equipped for yachting, windsurfing, water skiing and other sports activities.  The most accessible beach can be considered Les Granier, it is located at the foot of the fortress near the port. </p><p>  Kanebieu Bay is dotted with small crowded holiday destinations: Bon-Terras, Cap-Saint-Pierre, Le Salen, Cap-Saint-Tropez and Tahiti-Plage.  A few kilometers from the city center is the famous five-kilometer Pampelonne beach - a place where it is customary to sunbathe and swim topless. </p>

    <p>  The hectic life does not cease during the summer season in Saint-Tropez even at night.  For guests open numerous restaurants, cafes, music bars, nightclubs and discos.  Very popular among tourists is the beach restaurant Club 55, where everything has been preserved in almost the same form as during the filming of the film with Brigitte Bardot.  Picky cocktail tasters love Papagayo Club.  Music always plays at Apero &amp; Music Live Port and world celebrities perform. </p><p>  And in Saint-Tropez there is an excellent amusement park with the most modern attractions.  Three days a week on the main city square there is a market where you can buy the freshest seafood, home-made sausages, cheeses, wines and much more.  Well, for shoppers in this resort town there is such a huge number of shops and boutiques that buyers will certainly be satisfied. </p><h2>  Travelers Note </h2><p>  Many experienced travelers are advised to visit Saint-Tropez not in the summer, but in the spring or fall in the velvet season.  At this time there are fewer people, fewer traffic jams and a cleaner sea. </p><p>  The resort can be reached by car or bus from Nice Airport, which is 100 km from San-Tropes.  Taking into account traffic jams in the summer season, the road can take from 2 to 3 hours.  Buses to Saint-Tropez are convenient to get from San Rafael, Cannes, Toulon or Nice. </p>
