    <h2>  Operator Terms </h2><p>  <span>Naturally, the price of 4590 rubles for the monitored phone (and this is specifically about the Turbofon phone from Motive 4G under number 2209) is determined by the need to use the SIM card of the operator that this phone sells to you.</span>  <span>The main condition for a discounted purchase is to activate the ‚ÄúInstead‚Äù tariff.</span>  <span>The tariff offers for a monthly fee a fixed amount of traffic and free calls within the home region.</span>  <span>Prices range from 300 rubles per month.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  <span>"Turbofon" 2209 4G from "Motive" has the average characteristics for 2017.</span> </p><p>  <span>For ease of perception, information about them is presented in the form of a table:</span> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption></caption><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>CPU</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>MTK6735, 1000 megahertz, 4 cores</span> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>RAM</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>1 gigabyte</span> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>Persistent memory</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>8 gigabytes (there is support for MicroSD)</span> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>Display</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>5 inches, IPS-matrix, 960 x 540 pixels</span> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>Battery</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>2000 milliamps * hour</span> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  <span>Cameras</span> </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  <span>5 megapixels main and 2 megapixels front</span> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turbo 4G from Motive, specifications" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1863514.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Design and controls </h2><p>  <span>The visual design of the device is not very impressive.</span>  <span>No, don‚Äôt think, the device looks good.</span>  <span>For a budget gadget, it‚Äôs so very much.</span>  <span>High-quality and strong plastic.</span>  <span>No extra elements.</span>  <span>The camera is almost recessed into the body.</span>  <span>The phone is smooth and stable to the touch (does not fall out of hands).</span>  <span>With active use, small scratches and fingerprints may occur, but this is not as noticeable as in the case of glass options.</span> </p><p>  <span>The case is folding.</span>  <span>Under the cover there are: a battery (for those who value the opportunity to replace the battery on the go, this will definitely be to their taste), a slot for a memory card and a slot for a SIM card.</span>  <span>The volume controls and the power button are located on the sides, clearly opposite each other.</span>  <span>These buttons spring well and do not hang out.</span>  <span>The controls on the front panel are typical of the old-fashioned Android (touch buttons, but not on-screen).</span> </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  <span>An important feature of the gadget is support for fourth-generation networks (LTE).</span>  <span>But it works at a very specific frequency - 1800 MHz.</span>  <span>The problem is that other operators do not use this frequency at all.</span>  <span>Reviews about "Turbofon" 2209 4G from "Motive" confirm this fact.</span>  <span>In this regard, the phone does not even need a SIM card lock.</span>  <span>Of course, Wi-Fi networks at b / n / g 2.4 GHz frequencies are supported. And also there is Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support.</span>  <span>Only one SIM card can be installed (this fact can significantly affect the number of potential buyers).</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  <span>"Turbo" 4G is equipped with a display panel with a diagonal of 5 inches.</span>  <span>Screen resolution is 960 x 540 pixels.</span>  <span>With this ratio of diagonal and resolution, individual pixels are very striking.</span>  <span>Users who are accustomed to the chic displays of the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and even Chinese Xiaomi and Meizu are unlikely to tolerate the "grain" of the picture.</span>  <span>Despite the fact that the device uses an IPS-matrix, it cannot boast of wide viewing angles.</span>  <span>Even a minimal slope spoils the picture and turns it into a mess from the negative.</span> </p><p>  <span>There are problems with the sensor.</span>  <span>The display does not feel completely wooden, as on some budget gadgets, but it does not differ in responsiveness either.</span>  <span>Some middling came out on this indicator.</span>  <span>Of the bonuses, one can distinguish natural color rendition, a good margin of brightness, and of course, a carefully protective film pasted by the manufacturer (comes as standard).</span> </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  <span>The manufacturer of the gadget boldly and proudly calls his brainchild a pocket camera.</span>  <span>Reviews about the ‚ÄúTurbofon‚Äù 4G from ‚ÄúMotive‚Äù, which are left by both professional reviewers and ordinary users, indicate the opposite.</span>  <span>It would seem that the resolution is 5 megapixels, everything should be more or less good, but it turned out that everything is bad.</span>  <span>The picture is too fuzzy, soapy, artifacts are noticeable.</span> </p><p>  <span>At the same time, the camera works very slowly, focuses for a long time and is unable to do anything in conditions of poor visibility.</span>  <span>In general, the photomodule performs only a utilitarian function and certainly does not reveal the photographer in you (although, of course, the matter is in skill, and not in equipment).</span>  <span>Selfie lovers also have nothing to catch.</span>  <span>2 megapixels inspire confidence, but in fact, again, they are very disappointing.</span>  <span>Posting smeared selfies in 2017 is not comme il faut.</span> </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  <span>Another area in which the Turbofon turned out to be the same as everyone else.</span>  <span>A 2000 mAh battery is installed here.</span>  <span>This is critically small for a phone of this size.</span>  <span>If we cite the example of the same Chinese who manage to shove a battery of 4500 mAh into a 5-inch smartphone, it becomes ridiculous in general.</span>  <span>In practice, the phone does not live more than one business day.</span>  <span>And then, it is provided that they will not use it very actively, trying to save a precious charge.</span>  <span>If you plan to take a phone for games, then do not forget to take an external battery in the same store.</span> </p>
