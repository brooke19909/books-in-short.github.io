    <h2>  Features of a Vietnamese resort </h2><p>  For those who have heard about the frequent earthquakes and tsunamis in Asia, it will be useful to find out that such natural disasters do not occur in Nha Trang.  And all this because of the favorable location of the resort.  Nha Trang is located in the bay, therefore it is protected from the open sea.  In addition, a large number of islands near the resort contribute to a calm environment, stop strong waves and wind.  The main volcanic activity occurs in the north of Vietnam, fortunately, the Nha Trang resort is far from these places.  Therefore, in this tropical paradise you can feel calm and safe for at least the whole year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Should I go to Nha Trang in September" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/996209.jpg" width="600"></div>

At this time, it is hot (but not as hot as in summer) and sunny.  So, the daytime temperature is + 30‚Äì32 degrees, at night the thermometer‚Äôs columns drop to +23 degrees.  The water temperature of the <span>South China Sea</span> off the coast of Nha Trang resort is +27 degrees. </p><p>  In September, light rainfall is possible.  Fortunately, they are infrequent (once every five days), and their duration is short-lived, about half an hour.  Therefore, the weather in Nha Trang in September will in no way be able to affect the quality of rest, and even more so worsen it.

    <h2>  How will the sea be seen by those who came to rest in Nha Trang in September </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Nha Trang is located on the white sandy beaches of the South China Sea.  However, the sea can change its color depending on the time of year.  And this feature is caused, of course, by weather conditions.  Nha Trang in September pleases with excellent and calm weather, which is why the sea at this time of year is calm, clean, transparent and azure.  So, the waves can be seen only 2-3 times a month, the water is warm.  For example, those who visited the Vietnamese resort of Nha Trang in recent years in September even leave comments that they had to look for cooler currents in the sea, it was so warm.  By the end of September and until February, waves begin to appear in the sea, they can pick up and bring some garbage to the shores, the water mixes with the sand, so it becomes gray.  But those who like to swim in the waves will surely enjoy such a southern sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russian season in a Vietnamese resort.  Why locals do not rest at this time? </h2><p>  From October to December in Nha Trang the highest rainfall occurs, this season is called rainy.  Oddly enough, it was at this time that a huge number of Russians, Slavs, appeared in the resort.  But even stranger is the fact that during this period the prices for tickets and accommodation in hotels in the city increase significantly, so the Vietnamese themselves do not rest in Nha Trang these months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Nha Trang in September" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/996213.jpg" width="600"></div>
