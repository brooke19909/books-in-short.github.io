    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of The Palmery Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, which this hotel can rightfully be proud of, is its location.  Only 800 meters separate it from the famous Kata Beach. </p><p>  Four kilometers away is Karon Beach.  He is also famous among tourists.  And if you drive 15 kilometers, you can get to a wonderful place called Patong Beach.  The purest sand, clear water, a lot of free space ... There really is freedom.  For this, in fact, Thailand was loved by many people. </p><p>  Also nearby is the Phuket International Airport.  45 kilometers is not so much. </p>
