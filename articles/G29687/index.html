The result was the Republic of Turkey, where Turks reside, respectively, and about twice the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Republic of Cyprus, inhabited by Greek Cypriots.  It is in this part that the Smartline Cleopatra Annex 3 * hotel is located. </p><p>  Cyprus, uniting the traditions of two peoples in its culture, nevertheless, retained its special mentality.  Therefore, rest here always turns out to be very colorful.  Ayia Napa is considered one of the youngest and most fun resorts in the country.  Its name in exact translation means "holy avenue of trees" or simply "holy forest".  The word "ayah" is an abbreviated version of the Greek "agia", that is, "holy", and "napa" in the language of the ancient Hellenes meant "many trees in a row." </p><p>  Once there it was.  A dense forest grew on the seashore, then a church appeared in its place, and a village nearby.  Since about 1970, she began to get upset and gradually turned into a first-class resort.  Since he is still very young, all the hotels here are modern and new. </p><p>  The same applies to Smartline Cleopatra Annex 3 *.  Ayia Napa will be revealed from the best and most memorable sides to everyone who decides to opt for this very budget hotel for Cyprus, since all the most interesting things will be with its guests within walking distance. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For lovers of noisy parties and exciting shopping, the Cleopatra Annex 3 * hotel occupies an unusually convenient position.  Ayia Napa, the city and resort where it is located, is located on the southeast side of the Greek part of Cyprus, about 12 km from the city of Protaras, 37 km from Larnaca, where the airport operates, and 83 km from Nicosia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  These and other settlements are connected with Ayia Napa by excellent highways on which regular buses run.  Therefore, hotel guests find it easy to visit the <span>capital of Cyprus</span> and its most famous cities on their own, without buying sightseeing tours. </p><p>  Please note that just across the road from the hotel in question is another one belonging to the same owner.  Its name is Cleopatra 3 *, which is very similar to Cleopatra Annex 3 *, which often leads to errors and misunderstandings.  The hotel, in the name of which there is no word "Anex", is slightly newer, and the conditions there are somewhat different. </p><p>  In this article we provide information only about the three-star hotel Cleopatra Anex.  It is located in the central part of Ayia Napa, on the street named after the glorious Yuri Gagarin, house 7. True, in Cyprus our astronaut is called in the Greek manner Giouri Kangari, which is written on street signs. </p><p>  One can say that one of the central streets of Ayia Napa, where there are many bars for every taste, restaurants, cafes, shops with clothes and groceries, night clubs, lies just five steps from the hotel.  Also close to Cleopatra Annex 3 * there are offices where you can rent any vehicle.  In Cyprus, this is not unimportant for educational vacations, since, owning a car or a bike, you can travel around the entire island without reference to excursion programs.  But the beach is not very close to the hotel.  Before it you need to either take a bus or walk about 15-20 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The path to Cleopatra Annex 3 * is straightforward.  From Russia to Cyprus, everyone does not get on airplanes.  The central airport is located in Larnaca, from where Ayia Napa is very close, only 37 km.  You can fly to Paphos from Moscow, Krasnodar and Nizhny Novgorod, but then you will have to travel 180 km to Ayia Napa (more than 2 hours), which, of course, is inconvenient. </p><p>  Arriving in Larnaca, you can get to the hotel on a pre-ordered paid transfer or by public transport.  The most convenient option is to take a taxi.  On weekdays, it will cost only 12 euros.  On weekends, the amount rises to 15 euros.  A bus ticket will cost only 7 euros, but this is if you use the services of the company "Intercity". </p><p>  You can also rent a car right at the airport, which will result in 50 euros per day.  In principle, renting a car in the city costs about the same.  There is a slight inconvenience, consisting in the left-hand traffic existing in Cyprus.  Those who are not used to it will be difficult to adapt in the early days. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Cleopatra Annex is a hotel in Ayia Napa, ideally located relative to the center and not very convenient with respect to the sea, which you need to walk for more than a quarter of an hour.  This distance can also be covered by bus.  The ticket price in them is 1.5 euros. </p><p>  The nearest beaches from the hotel are two, one on the right side, the other on the left.  The first is called Limanaki, which means ‚ÄúPouring‚Äù.  The coverage here is sandy, the sea is excellent, plenty of water activities.  But for the umbrella and sunbed will have to pay 7.5 euros. </p><p>  The second, less untwisted, is located in a small bay.  It is less crowded, but the water in the sea is not very clear.  But on this beach there are tents, there is a wonderful cafe. </p><p>  The most popular <span>beach in</span> Nissi in <span>Cyprus</span> , which translates as "island".  There really is a small island, which can be reached through a narrow sandy strip.  Hotel Nissi is approximately 2 km away.  A taxi to him costs 8 euros.  There is a lot of entertainment (parachute, banana, ping-pong, catamarans, water scooters), excellent landscaping (restaurants, bars, discos, showers, hygiene rooms) and the purest yellow sand, which many call it golden.  But there are always a lot of people on Nissi, which not all vacationers like. </p><p>  Almost immediately after this beach there is another, more calm.  It is called Adams Beach.  There is a water slide and other attractions, but the entry into the sea is not gentle, but ends with a small ledge. </p><p>  On all beaches you can see beautiful fish right on the shore.  There are even more at a depth, so diving is in great demand in Ayia Napa.  But in Cyprus, unfortunately, beach vacations are possible only from the end of spring and somewhere until mid-autumn.  The rest of the time it is cool, and in winter it can even briefly decorate the earth with a weak snow cover. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  It is for this purpose that Cleopatra Hotel Annex 3 * is most suitable.  Ayia Napa, Cyprus as a whole, is famous for its amazingly beautiful places that it is advisable to visit for all tourists.  What is Cape Cava Greco, located four kilometers from the hotel!  Fans of adventure and unique landscapes will also be delighted with the pirate caves located in the bay of Ayia Napa.  Those tourists who prefer entertainment that has already become classic will certainly enjoy the water park and amusement park.  A trip to a pirate ship awaiting its passengers in the port of the city will also be a wonderful gift. </p><p>  But the most vivid and unforgettable impressions will leave, of course, discos, <span>foam parties</span> and night clubs (The Castle, Soho, Crazy Frog and others).  Many of them can be reached on foot, which is extremely convenient.  Invitations there, promising free drinks, are handed out on the streets and beaches, so it‚Äôs very difficult not to visit these fun centers. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Cleopatra Annex 3 * hotel in Cyprus has mixed ratings.
