Best Egypt Water Park Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Egypt is the most budgetary tourist destination, and the most popular.  But unlike Turkey and Spain, hotels in this African country are also filled in the winter.  The Red Sea in February with its plus twenty degrees Celsius may seem too refreshing to someone.  Almost every hotel in Egypt has its own pool.  But even if it is heated, swimming back and forth soon becomes boring.  And here the local tourist service, which is fiercely competitive for each client, offers a new service - the best hotels in Egypt with a water park.  At the two main resorts of the country there is still no urban water attraction complex.  But they are in many hotels.  In order to lure the clientele, the administration in addition to the hills organizes amusement parks and menageries on its territory.  This is a special income item, because entrance fees are charged.  Of course, coming from other hotels.  For its customers, the service is included in the cost of the holiday.  So why pay more?  Going on vacation to Egypt?  Hotels with a water park - the best choice! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt hotel jungle water park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to find a good hotel </h2><p>  If you plan to go on vacation with your child, the choice of hotels should be approached especially carefully.  Indeed, in some water parks there are such slides that it’s scary for a sober adult to ride on them.  What can we say about the children!  The list of advantages of the hotel should definitely include a shallow pool and slides (and preferably water rides) for kids.  Of great importance is also what time of the year you intend to go on holiday to Egypt.  Hotels with a water park do not always offer their guests heated pools.  It is worth considering that Egypt is not the Dominican Republic and Thailand, and here in the winter months it will not be quite comfortable to flounder in plain water for a long time.  Some hotels use the word "water park" to mean one slide.  But even if it is with dashing turns, you need to anticipate how long it will take to stand in line, waiting for access to it, along with other eager to ride. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hurghada Hotels with Waterpark" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388908.jpg?1399456271641" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cheap hotels of Egypt (Hurghada) with water park </h2><p>  In this very budget resort of the country there are many hotels with slides, and not all of them are necessarily five-star.  For example, Sinbad Aqua Resort has a full-fledged water park.  There are two pools for children with slides "Play Pond" and Toods Pool.  For adults, about a dozen rides on the water.  These are slides “Aqua Tube”, “Pool Slider”, “High Trill”, “Boomerang”, “Space Bowl”, a wheelchair with Sky Dive free fall element.  And such a wonderful hotel has only four stars.  And all because it is located on the second lane from the sea.  But you can not go to him.  After all, the hotel has an excellent pool surrounded by a sandy beach.  Water, as in a real sea, runs ashore with an artificial surf.  Free entrance to the water park - only for vacationers on the "Club all" system.  The nearby Sinbad Beach Hotel also has several slides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hotels with Water Park" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388909.jpg?1399456439127" width="550"></div>

It is part of a whole complex of hotels, united under the name "Albatross".  Albatros Jungle Aqua Park 4 * has the largest water park on the entire coast.  Thirty-five slides and rides for adults and children!  This is ideal for winter holidays, as the water in the pools is heated.  Great animation will not let you get bored all day and evening.  Many bars and restaurants with cuisines of the world are open to those who choose the all-inclusive food system.  This hotel is not located on the beach.  You have to go to the sea for about twenty minutes.  However, for those who came to Egypt for his sake, the Jungle Waterpark Hotel offers a free shuttle bus that departs once every half an hour from the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels with water park" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388917.jpg?1399456484608" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Titanic </h2><p>  The second most important water park in Hurghada is located in the <span>Titanic Aqua Resort</span> 4 * hotel.  The rides Zigzag, Carpet-plane, Tsunami, Flying Boats, Freefall and others will increase the level of adrenaline in your blood.  Children will be amused by the absolutely safe slides “Clown”, “Elephant”, “Octopus” and others.  In Hurghada (Egypt), hotels with a water park are also found on the first line of the sea.  Of the "fours" are Beach Albatross Resort, Grand Plaza, Lilly Land Beach Club, Panorama Bungalow, Sea Gall.  However, not all of them in the winter water for rides is heated.  It still makes sense to choose a hotel on the second line, but with a wonderful infrastructure inside the hotel. </p><h2>  Five Star hotels in and around Hurghada </h2><p>  Catering and accommodation in the promoted hotels "for spoiled customers", of course, is better than in the "fours" and "three rubles".  However, hotels in Egypt 5 * with a water park do not always offer comfortable or breathtaking attractions.  For example, in the huge complex “Golden Five” there are seven ordinary slides.  There is only one slide in Sunrise Garden Beach, and out of three pools in winter only one is heated.  The case at Makadi is much better.  It is worth paying attention to such five-star hotels as Fan City (twenty-six slides, seven pools, of which two are heated, and in addition there is also a lunapark), Prima Life and Sunrise Royal Resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Egypt hotels with water park" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388915.jpg?1399456535207" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) </h2><p>  Hotels with a water park on this more expensive Red Sea coast also occupy a significant part of the hotel base.  Those who are accustomed to the services of the Albatros network can visit the local branch - Albatros Aqua Park SSH 5 *.  Here you will find a complete set of entertainment on the water.  A very good park of similar attractions in Maritim Golf and Resort, although the hotel itself is not cheap.  One of the best hotel chains in the Arab world, Rotana, offers to visit Sharks Bay, at the <span>Grand Rotana</span> 5 * hotel.  It is worth mentioning that since 2006 Sharm el-Sheikh has been operating the Cleo city water park.  The scenery of the attractions and the interiors of the complex are made in the ancient Egyptian style.  A day ticket costs twenty dollars for an adult and ten for a child.  This water attraction complex is located in Naama Bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt 5 Waterpark Hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/388911.jpg?1399456640479" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Five-star Sharm hotels with slides </h2><p>  Based on the fact that Sharm el-Sheikh is not a very good entry into the sea (compared to the sandy beaches of Hurghada), local hotels with a water park are trying to compensate their guests with this inconvenience with a full range of water activities on their territory.  For example, in the Tropicana Grand Azur Resort there are four adults and three <span>children's slides.</span>  At the same time, entering the sea in the shallow bay of Nabak, where the hotel is located on the first line, is along a long pontoon.  Of the other five-star hotels in Sharm that offer their guests water slides, you can recommend Continental Plaza Beach, Dreams Resort, Grand Rotana, Hyatt Regency, Nubian Island, Reef Oasis, Reana Royal Beach and SPA and the Maritim hotel complex.  In them, at least one of the many pools is heated in the winter. </p><h2>  Budget hotels with water park in Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  From this category, it is better to choose those that are on the first line of the beach.  This is <span>House Beach Resort</span> 4 *.  It has a full-fledged water park, but both pools are unheated.  Nubian Village 4 * is located in Nabak Bay, so the shallow and rocky beach compensates its guests with a full-fledged water park with six slides.  In winter, water is heated in only one pool.  Located on the first line of the Tropicana Sea Beach provides two slides for adults.  A bit more fun at Sunrise Garden Resort (previously wore the sign Maxim Plaza Garden).  But this "four" is located across the road from the beach. </p>
