After all, the choice in this case will affect the entire course of life: how much time you have to spend on the road (to work and back), whether there will be everything necessary in the district (schools, pharmacies, shops).  You may have to travel far from home for basic services.  Equally important is comfortable living in a new house, an apartment of this layout. </p><p>  Will it be safe for your child to walk in the courtyard of this house?  Do you have any special needs?  Are there special conditions (in the form of ramps) for people with disabilities?  And families with young children care about the availability of storage space for strollers.  Now many citizens have a car.  So, the residents of the complex will need personal parking spaces.  You need to think about all this in advance, in order to subsequently be able to objectively evaluate the options that developers offer you. </p><p>  Among other things, you should take care of the company's reputation.  Does she have successfully completed projects in her ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù?  Have the houses been commissioned on time?  Does it meet the deadlines for current projects?  After all, it depends on how responsible the developer is, when exactly you will receive your new housing, what quality this apartment will be.  An incredible amount of nuances.  However, making the right choice is still possible.  To do this, you only need to spend a little time and effort on a kind of research.  Believe me, in the case of your future apartment, such efforts will pay off in full. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today we will take a closer look at the construction project of the Litvinovo-City residential complex (Trubino residential complex).

    <h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  Let's talk in more detail about the Litvinovo-City residential complex project itself.  Developer - GT-TPP "Trubino".  Little is known about this company.  She has not yet managed to establish herself in any way on the market. </p><p>  Consider the pros and cons of the Trubino residential complex project.  So, there are the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Less than a kilometer from the <span>housing complex</span> is a forest.  At the same time, no industrial production was located near the residential area.  This clearly has a positive effect on the environmental situation in the area. </li><li data-id="601">  The balconies will be glazed by the developer. </li><li data-id="602">  Infrastructure will be significantly expanded.  For example, it is planned to place pharmacies and shops on the first floors of residential buildings. </li><li data-id="603">  The lack of aisles in the apartments, according to the declared layout.  Each apartment has separate bathrooms, which is also incredibly practical. </li><li data-id="604">  There is a real possibility of building a science city. </li><li data-id="605">  The housing complex under consideration is located in an environmentally friendly area. </li><li data-id="4759">  Prices for apartments for this territory can be called budget. </li><li data-id="4769">  Real estate can be paid in installments, which means that the buyer will not overpay for the purchased housing. </li><li data-id="4769">  This project is accredited by the Agricultural Bank.  There is the possibility of obtaining mortgages from a number of well-known banks, as well as military mortgages. </li></ul><p data-id="4777">  The disadvantages of this project are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p data-id="600">  1. Significant, from the point of view of some, the distance to the Moscow Ring Road (in this case, it is thirty-three kilometers). </p><p data-id="600">  2. The project does not provide for the construction of certain socially important facilities. </p><p data-id="607">  3. <span>Metro station "Schelkovskaya"</span> is located at a considerable distance from this housing complex.  So, for example, using your own vehicle, you can overcome these 36 kilometers quickly enough, but the road by public transport will take at least 55 minutes (not taking into account the possibility of traffic jams). </p><p data-id="608">  4. In certain cases, the number of apartments on one floor can reach seventeen.  This can create some inconvenience, provided that there are only two elevators for the whole ten-story staircase. </p><p data-id="609">  5. Among other things, the construction of the housing complex in question is the first project of the developer. </p><p>  The developer, in turn, focuses on the following points: </p><ul><li>  parking availability; </li><li>  installation of high-quality sound insulation, which will not lose its properties for a long time; </li><li>  the construction of the building is incredibly durable (monolith / brick); </li><li>  although the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartments is not too large, the layout is designed in such a way that allows you to comfortably implement any design decisions; </li><li>  the entrance group from the side of the street implies the presence of a ramp of a certain design (located at a standard angle); </li><li>  the internal entrance group will also become very convenient for future residents due to the presence of two elevators for each entrance, a stroller, a separate room for the concierge, as well as storage rooms, which are standardly located on the typical floors of each residential building. </li></ul><p>  Will the advantages of the project under consideration attract you?  Find out more about him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As a rule, it is the district‚Äôs infrastructure that interests potential customers the most after information about the cost of the apartment and its layout.  That is why this issue will be considered in detail below.  So, what objects are included in the construction plan?  The infrastructure of the <span>residential complex</span> will be the following set of objects: </p><ul><li>  three playgrounds; </li><li>  three kindergartens, one of which is built-in; </li><li>  school; </li><li>  church; </li><li>  two parking lots; </li><li>  Sberbank branch; </li><li>  two forest park areas; </li><li>  three areas with grocery stores and shopping centers; </li><li>  library; </li><li>  House of Culture; </li><li>  two pharmacies; </li><li>  post office; </li><li>  tourist complex; </li><li>  fishing complex; </li><li>  areas for bike rides. </li></ul><p>  Presumably, after the house is put into operation as the demand for certain goods and services grows, the infrastructure will be significantly expanded.  So, the builder‚Äôs clients are expected to build and open catering establishments and entertainment centers.  Given the demand for such services, there is no doubt that over time the surroundings of this housing complex will be flooded with a variety of offers. </p>

    <h2>  Installment plan </h2><p>  Interestingly, real estate in the residential complex "Trubino" (Litvinovo village) can be purchased in installments.  This means that you do not have to overpay for your new and comfortable apartment. </p><p>  In order to become a participant in this program, you will need to make a substantial down payment (at least 40% of the total cost of the apartment).  The entire remaining amount is divided into equal parts and paid monthly (during the next calendar year).  The size of each payment is calculated individually for each client.  Many interest holders found it advantageous to buy apartments on such conditions in the Trubino residential complex. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The housing complex under consideration can be reached by public transport.  You can go from the metro station "Schelkovskaya".  You can use both the bus and the minibus.  The road to the <span>residential complex "Litvinovo-City" (residential</span> complex "Trubino") in this case will take no more than an hour.  Probably soon the routes will change.  People will have much more opportunities to get to the village. </p><p>  Do you own a car?  Then from Moscow to the LCD Litvinov-City (LCD Trubino) you can reach a measured pace in just 45 minutes. </p><p>  Obviously, transport links still need to be developed.  However, the road can now be quite comfortable.  Practice shows that most citizens prefer to use the route from the Shchelkovskaya metro station.  Worry about the road to the residential complex is not worth it. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  How are things today at the construction site of the residential complex "Trubino"?  The progress of construction is reflected on the official website of the developer.  At the moment, five and a half floors are ready, work is ongoing.  For some time, construction stopped, but now again resumed.  The developer even called the new date of delivery - December 2017. Will the company manage to fulfill its obligations?  What do the real estate investors of the Trubino residential complex (Litvinovo-City) think about this? </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback </h2><p>  Some clients of the developer are confident in a good outcome.  They follow the news on the official website of the company, which reflect information on the work being done and the supply of materials.  Such feedback from real estate investors of the Trubino residential complex expresses confidence in the developer, as well as a firm hope to receive keys to their property by the end of this year.  How reasonable are their expectations?  Hard to say. </p><h2>  Negative feedback </h2><p>  Negative feedback from real estate investors in the Trubino residential complex is much easier to find.  Typically, customers express dissatisfaction with the delay in construction time, the failure to fulfill their obligations by the company on time.  At the moment, even an initiative group has been created, which is seeking to ensure that the Litvinovo-City residential complex project is recognized as problematic and another, more responsible developer is appointed for its implementation.  Such interest holders consider themselves deceived and do not believe that the company is able to complete the construction of a residential complex.  At the same time, many continue to be interested in real estate in the residential complex "Litvinovo-City" and even buy apartments there.  Which group of interest holders should you support?  This should only be your personal decision. </p><p>  So, is the Litvinovo-City residential complex project (Trubino residential complex) acceptable for you?  Surely after reading this article you were able to form your opinion on this matter.  Try to be as objective as possible without going to extremes.  You should not focus only on the negative aspects, completely losing sight of all the advantages of this project, but ignoring the significant shortcomings would also be wrong.  Think about what your family really needs. </p><p>  Have you always dreamed of living in an ecologically clean area?  Since childhood, you wanted to walk in the morning with a dog in the forest?  Aren't you bothered by the need to spend about two hours daily on the road in order to get into the city and then return home?  Then LCD "Litvinovo City" is definitely for you.  However, if you do not have a personal vehicle or if you do not want your family to live away from the city, you may have to refuse this choice.  You should also evaluate how much the cost of apartments corresponds to their area and layout, how these parameters suit you. </p><p>  And most importantly, think about whether you are ready to expect the end of construction indefinitely.  After all, the deadlines for putting the house into operation were postponed three times already.  Now they promise to give keys to the apartments no earlier than December 2017.  Do you agree to such an expectation?  Do you have any doubts about the integrity of the developer and his ability to complete the project safely?  If you feel insecure, you have serious doubts, it is better to refrain from such a purchase. </p><p>  Be vigilant, do not let yourself be deceived.  Take enough time to get acquainted not only with what the developer offers to his clients, but also with what he has already done before.  After all, it is the case (in this case, successfully completed projects) that can clearly indicate that your housing complex will be completed on time and will correspond to the declared quality. </p>
