    <h2>  Origami Origin </h2><p>  This art is familiar to humanity with civilized Japanese traditions.  It appeared in 610 in China, from where they brought to Japan the first paper made from silkworm cocoons, as well as the skill of folding different shapes from it.  Over time, such paper crafts received the Japanese name - orikami (meaning "folded paper" or "idol").  This ability to create products using the lightweight method of paper construction won the hearts of Oriental masters and soon conquered the whole world.  After some time, origami began to be made <span>of paper.</span>  <span>Valentines were</span> also created, but a little later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valentine paper origami" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31888/804184.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, it was customary to do origami in a serene environment, with a <span>positive attitude</span> and with love.  Origami Valentine was made similarly.  With their own hands, people created it in order to present to the closest people, to wish them happiness and wealth.  Such skill requires attentiveness, self-control and even meditation.  Today, the art of folding some ancient figures from paper is still preserved, for example: Kusu Dam (protects dreams), Pahari (brings good luck), a thousand cranes (fulfills wishes). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make origami valentine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31888/804207.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Varieties of Origami </h2><p>  This technique has two types of crafts: </p><ul><li>  Classic - figures are made according to the size of the square, glue and scissors are not required. </li><li>  Modular - various simple and complex compositions are produced from a huge number (up to 100,000 accessories) of separately prepared module parts.  In the process, glue can be used to grip parts. </li></ul><h2>  Everything is very simple </h2><p>  Today's paper origami technique is very popular.  Valentines simply enchant with their originality, simplicity and give joy to both the performer and the recipient of a beautiful creation.  To make such a craft can not only adults, but also children.  And the price category of the present does not matter at all when the product is presented to relatives and loved ones.

    <h2>  How to make modular origami </h2><p>  This skill is a form of Japanese paper folding skill.  A lesson with modules takes much more time, but the creation is unusual.  Valentine created in this technique is simple to use and looks very beautiful.  You just need to be patient, and your loved one will certainly appreciate the amazing thing presented. </p><p>  Now everyone will want to know how an origami Valentine will be created.  With your own hands, such a craft can be done without special skills, taking certain materials for work, namely: </p><ul><li>  4 A4 paper sheets in two colors; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  a ruler. </li></ul><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  You need to take A4 paper (one sheet of white and three red colors) and draw each sheet into rectangles 6x4 cm in size. Next, they should be cut along the drawn lines (100 rectangles should come out).  Now you need to add the modules you want to make out of them: 71 red and 18 white. </p><p>  It is important to know where the future creation contains a long and where a short edge.  You just need to remember the geometry and make the right <span>modular origami.</span>  Valentines with a long side have a hypotenuse, and with a short side they have a side with a pocket. </p><p>  Now you should fasten the modules to each other, taking two little things and holding them with a long edge to themselves, putting on another element.  A third module is added to the two modules, on which one is worn.  This step must be repeated twice.  It turns out two lines - four and five parts.  Bottom in a row of five modules you need to place six more.  A three-band configuration comes out.  We need to make one more figure. </p><p>  Next, how to make an origami Valentine, this article will tell.  And now the created figures can be pressed tightly to each other.  There are two open corners in the middle, and a module should be put on them.  Then it is necessary to cling from it to two elements in all directions.  It turns out the fourth strip of five parts.  Now four more are being ‚Äúbuilt up‚Äù on this fourth row, and then work is done from four, three, two, one modules.  It turns out the inside of the valentine. </p><p>  Now it is necessary to assemble the upper component, where the first row will go with the modules with the long edge toward you, the second - with two elements, the third - three, the fourth - eight parts (four are put on, two on the other sides are still lying).  The fifth line is superimposed on the unhooked modules of the fourth row, then three elements are put on from each edge.  The sixth row goes on two sides on two parts, and the seventh - on both edges one at a time.  This is how an origami valentine turned out (the scheme of its manufacture was very simple). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valentine box origami" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31888/811326.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  Now two red halves are interlinked with white modules.  Above, the lower part has two independent angles from one edge, and the upper side from the bottom from two.  On these sides you need to wear one white module.  And on the white elements in a free sequence, but adhering to symmetry, they plant eight parts on each side.  And now, finally, the amazing Valentine is ready! </p><h2>  Origami Box </h2><p>  To produce this unusual craft, it is better to use colorful smooth paper to make the gift look spectacular.  After all, the material is of no small importance in creating a sense of celebration.  The shape of the box will have two parts: a base and a cover. </p><p>  What is necessary: </p><ul><li>  two thick sheets of paper of any color (one slightly larger); </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  First, cut a square that is divided into three equal parts.  Next, you need to make bends, smoothing them well.  The right and left edges need to be folded in half.  You should get a square with springy bases.  Now you need to bend the corners: on one side, a corner of paper is wrapped in two layers, and on the other, from one.  Eight bent corners came out, where there are four from each of the edges.  The resulting accessory should be straightened in proportion to the middle.  To add hardness to the box, bends are made.  <span>Origami box</span> is ready. </p><p>  In order to make a lid for the box, again a square blank is required.  However, its size will be slightly larger.  All other cover work is done in the same way. </p><p>  What a wonderful thing this is, an Origami Valentine!  With their own hands, everyone can try to create it to complement her gift for the holiday of all lovers. </p>
