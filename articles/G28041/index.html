    <h2>  Yard area </h2><p>  The developer tried to create comfortable living conditions for buyers not only in apartments, but also outside them.  The courtyard of the complex was equipped in accordance with the design developed by Russian and British agencies.  She is modern and dynamic.  Apartments in Yekaterinburg in recent years have become more highly regarded.  If we talk about apartments, which are included in the "Lights of Yekaterinburg", it is worth saying that the price is quite justified.  The complex offers all the conditions for recreation for both children and adults.  The facade is illuminated, which attracts the attention of city residents and is a bright accent of the overall architectural style. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  The complex of apartments "Lights of Yekaterinburg" includes various apartments: from one-room to three-room.  Moreover, the area of ​​the smallest apartments is more than 58 square meters.  The area of ​​three-room apartments in some cases reaches 138 square meters. </p>

    <p>  The developer also provided for the availability of free-planning apartments.  In the case of the acquisition of such real estate, the owners can independently organize the internal space taking into account their own wishes.  Luxurious panoramic glazing gives these rooms an unusual style and elegance.  The layout of the premises can be anything.  This is limited only by the imagination and financial ability of the buyer. </p><h2>  Infrastructure (external) </h2><p>  The complex "Lights of Yekaterinburg", the price of apartments in which are quite high, is located, as already mentioned, very successfully.  The cost per square meter is from 73 thousand rubles, which is a lot for Yekaterinburg.  However, it is worth saying that there is a residential complex in the area with developed infrastructure, in the heart of the city, on the "guest" route.  It has everything that is necessary for life: schools, kindergartens, clinics, shops, hypermarkets, various educational institutions, offices. </p><p>  Thus, it is possible to invest very profitably by buying apartments and renting them out.  Real estate in this part of Yekaterinburg is always in demand.  Residents of more remote areas of the city, having rented an apartment here, will get to their work, significantly saving time and effort.  Many business visitors to Yekaterinburg also seek to rent apartments for a short period in the Yekaterinburg Lights complex.  Prices are even higher than in a hotel, but comfort and convenient location are worth the cost. </p><p>  The author of the project "Fires of Yekaterinburg" (residential complex) is a reliable developer that has existed for more than twenty years in the Russian market.  That is why the construction was completed on time, in compliance with all necessary technologies, and the quality is at a high level. </p>
