The second most popular resort in this part of the country is the small town of Phan Thiet (Vietnam).  The air temperature in these places is rarely below 22 ¬∞ C.  The holiday season, that is, the most favorable season for a holiday in Phan Thiet, is the period from March to September, the so-called dry season.  At this time, prices in hotels, shops and restaurants of the city are much higher. </p><p>  Almost the entire coastal territory of the city is built up with hotel buildings - small or large hotels, bungalows and villas for tourists.  One of the hotels on the coast, Little Paris Resort 3 *, reviews of which are more than positive, are often recommended by Russian tour operators for accommodation.  What do our compatriots having a rest in this Vietnamese hotel say in tourist forums? </p>

    <p>  For this reason, many hotel guests preferred to visit the picturesque beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMui Ne for relaxation - a small village 7 km from Phan Thiet.

From the comments on the work of the staff, sometimes in the reviews there are complaints about the not too thorough cleaning of the rooms. </p><h2>  Active leisure, sport </h2><p>  For sports or outdoor activities the hotel does not have many opportunities.  In addition to bicycles, water sports equipment can be rented <span>on the beach</span> ; the hotel itself has a free billiards room. </p><p>  Fans of active entertainment are most often recommended to visit the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMuine.

    <h2>  SPA, beauty treatments </h2><p>  Beach holidays in the resort town of Phan Thiet can be diversified by visiting spa treatments.  Many Russian tourists enthusiastically talk about the high quality of services in this area at prices several times lower than in large cities of our country.  A relatively inexpensive SPA-center is located on the territory of the Little Paris Resort 3 * hotel complex.  Vietnam and, in particular, Phan Thiet resort itself attract tourists with a large number of inexpensive salons, where every day you can attend sessions of various types of massage for a small fee. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Phan Thiet there is the most popular balneological treatment and prevention center in the country, built on the basis of the Binh Chau natural thermal spring.  Here you can get medical, anti-aging or preventive procedures using natural mineral waters and therapeutic mud.  You can purchase a spa course or limit yourself to a day trip with a swim in the pools with warm or hot mineral water. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite the three-star rating, the Little Paris Resort 3 * hotel practically does not provide any entertainment for guests on its territory.  The hotel staff does not have professional animators; in the evening, the hotel is quiet and calm.  This is what often attracts tourists who prefer to leisurely sunbathe all day on the beach or hotel terrace, calmly swim in the hotel pool in the evening and sleep in their room without too much noise. </p><p>  For those who are planning to visit nightclubs, discos and beach parties on vacation, the Little Paris Resort 3 * hotel, like Phan Thiet itself, may seem too quiet and boring.  The main entertainment venues are concentrated either on the territory of hotels in the coastal zone or in the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMui Ne. </p><h2>  Shopping: what to bring from vacation? </h2><p>  Guests of the Little Paris Resort 3 * often mention in their reviews such a form of leisure as shopping - the purchase of various souvenirs, clothes, gifts and other things.  What can you profitably buy on vacation in a hotel complex? </p><ul><li>  Brand clothes and shoes.  It is no secret that the branded stores of many fashion companies are in most resort towns.  However, taking into account the local currency, Phan Thiet shopping centers pleasantly surprised many tourists with their prices for branded goods. </li><li>  Elite varieties of tea.  The selection of varieties of this drink is huge, the prices are quite favorable.  In addition, tea can be tasted before purchase. </li><li>  Souvenirs with local color.  Carved chopsticks, dishes, incense incense burners, spices, incense, fabrics, colored sand paintings, national clothes and much more - all this can be profitably bought in a large city market.  Here are the whole shopping arcades with exotic fruits.  You can bargain in the market, this allows you to significantly reduce the purchase price. </li><li>  Jewelry.  Tourists are often offered to buy them on the city market, but the guides of travel agencies, as well as vacationers themselves, warn that it is safest to make such purchases in large jewelry stores, where certificates must be attached to the goods. </li></ul><h2>  Excursions, interesting objects, sights </h2><p>  What interesting things can you see in the vicinity of Phan Thiet (Vietnam)?  Local attractions - for the most part - are beautiful natural sites. </p><p>  Most often, tourists are offered to visit the Red (aka Golden) or White Dunes.  Both trips can be made with a guided tour or, much cheaper, by renting a bicycle or motor transport.  White dunes are often called ‚ÄúVietnamese Sahara‚Äù, tourists come here to enjoy the sunset and see the unique <span>Lotus Lake.</span> </p><p>  Red dunes are a favorite place of entertainment for local children who use sand dunes like a snow mountain to ride special sledges.  Tourists come here to ride from the dune too and take some vivid photographs.  Not far from the Red Dunes is another natural wonder - the Red Stream.  This is a shallow canyon, in the depths of which flows a picturesque shallow river with a small waterfall. </p><p>  In addition to the natural wonders of Vietnam, it is worth looking at the monuments of ancient culture that are available for visiting during a day trip.  In the city you can visit one of the most beautiful and unusual places of worship in Vietnam - the Temple of China.  Only 7 km from Phan Thiet, the ancient Cham towers are accessible for visiting - the place of worship of the god Shiva, erected in the 13th century. </p>

    <p>  A little further, on a tiny island, southwest of Phan Thiet, is the largest lighthouse on the entire coast of Vietnam.  The construction of the XIX century, with a height of more than 40 meters, is a stone octagonal tower with a large observation platform. </p><p>  Tourists who are ready to take a longer trip, simply must see with their own eyes the sacred Temple Mount - Taku.  Here you can see several Buddhist pagodas and stone statues, including the famous Reclining Buddha 49 meters long.  The architectural complex on Mount Taku is also a beautiful natural park where you can see representatives of exotic fauna close by and admire the surroundings from one of the high-altitude observation platforms.  Tourists can get upstairs on a walking route from the foot of the mountain, or use the cable car for this. </p>
