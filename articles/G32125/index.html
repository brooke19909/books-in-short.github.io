    <p>  The hotel also provides breakfast for a fee - approximately 7 euros at a time. </p><p>  Pets are strictly not allowed in the hotel.  Smoking is allowed on site. </p><p>  Children under 2 years old are provided with a cot for free, children from 2 to 12 years old extra bed is available on paid conditions - 10 euros per night per person. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Should I take Villa Andrews Hotel as a place for active pastime?  Of course, it‚Äôs worth it, but you must not forget that the hotel itself positions itself precisely in terms of relaxation and enjoyment of vacation.  This is evidenced by the reviews of visitors. </p><p>  For the most part, they say that the hotel has both positive aspects and significant shortcomings. </p><p>  If we talk about the cons, then this is a high fee.  When a client arrives at a hotel, he pays for almost everything, even for air conditioning.  Further, food, which in fact does not differ from the rest of the coast hotels - for breakfast eggs, sausages, cereals, bread, corn flakes, various types of jams and drinks - all that will give you an energy boost for the whole day.  For lunch and dinner, the hotel restaurant offers a lot of local colorful food, vegetables, some types of sweets and meat.  Nevertheless, the team of cooks provides the highest quality and taste of the dishes. </p>

    <p>  These small flaws do not outweigh the advantages of the hotel - always polite staff, clean rooms and territory, a stable Internet signal, convenient location that will not make the visitor sit in the room for a long time. </p><p>  Moreover, this also has the location of the hotel, which is located near the beach area.  Outdoor enthusiasts should rent bicycles to get to their destination.  In addition, it is possible to get to the island's capital by municipal bus. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Villa Andrews Hotel in Kos is a small family-run hotel located on one of the most picturesque Greek islands.  He is an ideal representative of high prices, but also of excellent quality of services provided to visitors.  Reviews of tourists confirm this. </p>
