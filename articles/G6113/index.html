The road from one city to another by car can be a memorable adventure for any Russian or foreigner.  Russian cities can be separated not by hundreds, but by thousands of kilometers.  The Volgograd-Anapa route is very popular among Russians, because Volgograd is far from a small city.  The distance between these cities is about 874 kilometers, and this is an occasion to think about choosing a transport. </p>

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  If you discard cheap, but long and dangerous options like hitchhiking and train hop, then there are 4 traditional ways.  The most beautiful will be an impressive ride in a personal car.  The average in duration and comfort is the Volgograd-Anapa train.  The most uncomfortable and long journey is a bus trip.  Well, the fastest, most comfortable, safest and most expensive flight will be. </p><p>  The choice always remains with the traveler.  Paying attention only to the ticket price is definitely not worth it.  Anapa is the south of Russia, and the road will be very hot, if not sultry.  Saving on a ticket can spoil the impression of both a trip and a vacation.  This is especially true for trains and buses.  In the first case, you can buy a very cheap ticket to the most ordinary trailed reserved seat car without an air conditioner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, such cars do not follow the Volgograd - Anapa route, but only pick up the rolling stock at one of the stations.  Such trains enter key cities of this route.  If there is no acute desire to personally experience all the conditions that are in a reserved seat car in the heat, it is better to take a ticket to a more comfortable car.  It's more expensive, but worth it.  This will definitely bring pleasure to the road itself. </p><h2>  The car is freedom </h2><p>  Drive your own car is always different from all other options.  The driver is free to choose a direction, organizes stops for sleep himself and manages his time more intelligently.  In addition, the road by car is quite fast, but more tiring. </p><p>  Perhaps, the driver ponders the most unpleasant question before the start of the Volgograd - Anapa route.  How to get there?  A standard question for any trip, especially a long one.  It all depends on the driver.  The direct distance between these cities is about 693 km, but along federal highways - about 874. The driver can shorten or significantly extend the route.  The easiest way is to go by GPS-navigator, because he chooses the most suitable path along the tracks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Train Adventure </h2><p>  A train ride is always an atmospheric and even romantic journey.  Especially if the car is not the cheapest or even the SV-class.  The train ticket "Volgograd - Anapa" can be purchased in two ways.  On site or at the box office at the train station.  On the site you can find out from which cars this or that train is formed, and choose a car with the appropriate type and class of service. </p>

    <p>  The road will take about 19 hours.  Fast trains arrive several hours faster.  The time of the road can decrease or increase, it all depends on how often the train will stop in the steppes to miss another train. </p><p>  In general, all the trains on the Volgograd - Anapa route are comfortable.  The general rule for choosing a wagon is one - it should not be trailed.  In most cases, this is a car that has been taken off preservation.  By purchasing a ticket at the box office, the passenger actually trusts the choice of wagon to the cashier.  Given that at times cashiers hold the best places in order to raise the price on the last day, it is more reliable to take a ticket on the website. </p><h2>  Bus story </h2><p>  A bus ride is neither comfortable nor fast.  Perhaps the undeniable advantages of the bus are the relatively low cost of the ticket and the ability to choose a bus.  It is advisable to take more expensive and better.  The appearance of the bus is misleading.  It may be modern and new, but made in China.  In Chinese buses, everything is very good, except for the seats.  For some reason, seats in Chinese buses are extremely uncomfortable. </p>

    <p>  The ticket for the bus "Volgograd - Anapa" can also be taken on the Internet and at the box office.  However, unlike a train ticket, it is best to take a ticket at the ticket office, having previously read reviews about buses and choosing the best option of all.  The best places are the front ones.  In them, shaking is least felt and not so much motion sickness.  This is very important, because the relief of the southern regions suggests the presence of quite winding roads.  In order for the passenger to get sick on the bus, it is not necessary to go along the mountain serpentine.  It will be very reasonable to take pills for motion sickness or a lot of mint dragees on the road. </p><h2>  A plane is better! </h2><p>  The best option for those who want to be at the resort as soon as possible.  Airplane is a quick and comfortable way to move.  The flight will take no more than 2 hours, taking into account small delays.  There is no heat in the cabin, it is always cool there, and food and drink are already included in the ticket price.  The only negative is the ticket price.  However, charter flights are much cheaper.  It is best to check their availability at the box office, because such flights do not fly on schedule. </p>
