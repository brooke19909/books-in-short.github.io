Apple Service Centers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, a new multifunctional tablet from <span>Apple has</span> appeared on store shelves <span>.</span>  <span>iPad Mini</span> for a fairly short period of time has become very popular.  This is not strange, as in the new model changes were made to the design and performance.  A powerful processor, small size and sophisticated appearance led the tablet to worldwide popularity.  That is why new models, such as the iPad Mini 2, 3 and 4, began to be released. </p><p>  Unfortunately, even these reliable and powerful devices have vulnerabilities.  How is it shown?  Most iPad Mini crashes are due to screen damage or sensor failure.  In any case, in order to restore the tablet, it is necessary to replace the screen.  Unfortunately, troubleshooting Apple‚Äôs technology is quite difficult; if you haven‚Äôt yet encountered this, it‚Äôs best to entrust the work to a professional.  In Apple service centers, specialists are able to carry out high-quality iPad Mini repairs in a short time.  If you decide to carry out the repair yourself, then you should be very careful, as this can lead to even more breakdowns.  Let's look at how the screen is replaced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini glass replacement" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1351139.jpg" width="422"></div>

    <h2>  Replacing the screen and glass iPad Mini </h2><p>  <span>Replacing the iPad</span> Mini <span>screen</span> takes quite a while, especially if a beginner does it.  Therefore, if you do not yet have six hours of free time, then it is better to transfer the repair to another day.  This method is suitable not only for the first model, but also for the iPad Mini 2,3,4. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  So, to begin <span>repairing the tablet</span> , you need to take the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  Screwdriver. </li><li>  New glass. </li><li>  Mounting hair dryer, if not, then take a regular one. </li><li>  Stationery knife. </li><li>  Double-sided tape. </li><li>  A plastic card. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini 2" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1351142.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Screen Replacement </h2><p>  After you take all the necessary tools, you can proceed to replace the screen.  In order not to cause the device to an even greater breakdown, follow the instructions. </p><ol><li>  To protect your data, it is recommended that you back up your data.  This can be done via iTunes or iCloud. </li><li>  Remove the tablet cover.  Disconnect all loops. </li><li>  We take a plastic card and separate the glass from the screen.  This must be done as carefully as possible so as not to damage other elements.  First you can start to separate next to the lock button and then move around the perimeter. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini screen replacement" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1351141.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  So, now there you need to unscrew the screen.  First, unscrew all the bolts.  If the screen does not come off, you need to gently pry it with a plastic card.  Try to repair iPad Mini as carefully as possible, do not touch the screen with your fingers and try not to damage the cables on the screen itself. </li><li>  To get a damaged screen, you must disconnect all the connectors.  Remove the touchscreen with tweezers. </li><li>  We disassembled the screen, it is installed in the reverse order.  The touchscreen and the new screen must be installed in their place and fixed.  Try not to touch the screen, as prints will be quite problematic to erase.  After fixing the screen, you need to connect all the cables. </li><li>  Make sure you install everything correctly.  After checking, you need to assemble the tablet. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  You can turn on the device and look at its performance.  If the screen will work, it remains only to remove the protective film.  Remember that the iPad Mini takes quite a while to replace glass, as you need to make sure everything is connected correctly.  Only after you make sure that everything is done correctly, you can turn on the tablet and use it for your own purposes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  When to contact for repair </h2><p>  Everyone knows that the technology from Apple is quite high quality.  But, despite this, you can easily damage the tablet screen.  To do this, just drop, sit down or step on the iPad Mini.  Glass replacement is the only solution in this case. </p><p>  When is it worth repairing a device?  Probably no one will have such a question if the tablet does not work.  Each person will contact the service as soon as possible or try to fix the problem on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safety glass ipad mini" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1354223.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another case is when the screen cracked or partially stopped working (it does not click in one place).  In this case, in order not to spend money, many prefer to get used to the defect.  Such a problem does not greatly interfere with the operation of the iPad Mini.  Replacing glass in this case is optional, as many might think.  But it is not so. </p><p>  With a crack in the screen, the tablet is very susceptible to serious damage.  Dirt or liquid can pass through it, which leads to other problems.  It will be difficult to get rid of them.  Therefore, do not postpone seemingly minor defects. </p><h2>  Causes of iPad Mini Damage </h2><p>  Damage to tablets occurs for various reasons.  iPad Mini was no exception, it is just like other devices, it can break.  Let's look at the causes of tablet malfunctions. </p><ol><li>  The main thing is a violation of the operating rules.  Of course, if you handle the device carelessly, then sooner or later it will lead to breakdown.  Shocks, drops, or pressure on the screen adversely affect the iPad Mini.  Replacing glass is not the only problem that will have to be faced. </li><li>  Moisture and dirt.  If liquid or dirt gets inside the tablet, it will also break.  In this case, you will have to change a lot of parts that will fail. </li><li>  Software crash.  This can happen if you try to install applications that are not compatible with the OS due to the removal of important system applications or the appearance of viruses.  Returning to factory settings may help in this situation.  If you cannot solve the problem, then you should contact the service center. </li></ol><h2>  How to <span>protect your tablet</span> from malfunctions </h2><p>  When you buy a tablet, get a case and a protective film for it.  This will reduce the likelihood of breakage due to bumps or falls.  When transporting the tablet, be careful that there are no sharp objects nearby that could scratch the screen.  You also need to make sure that the device does not overheat.  Make sure that the tablet does not fall into the hands of young children without your presence. </p><p>  If you carefully monitor the device and handle it carefully, the laptop will work for you for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glass ipad mini Price" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1351144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service centers </h2><p>  If your tablet has stopped working, then you can try to fix the problem yourself.  Only you must understand that you are not an expert and can lead the device to an even bigger problem. </p><p>  Of course, the best option is to take the tablet to an Apple Service Center.  Repair will be quite expensive, but professionals will do it and they will give a guarantee for their work. </p><p>  In the iPad Mini, a glass replacement will cost about 3,500-4,000 rubles.  It is quite expensive, but this price includes safety glass and the work of specialists.  If you decide to make the replacement yourself, you need to find the right iPad Mini glass.  The price ranges from 500 to 1000 rubles. </p><p>  And how to further protect your device?  To do this, you can install a protective glass iPad Mini.  Of course, it is a little more expensive, but this can save the device from possible malfunctions.  The price starts from 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  No tablet can be protected 100% from damage.  Apple devices are reliable enough, but different things can happen with such models.  Screen malfunction is a big problem for many tablet owners.  How to fix the problem?  You can contact the service center (price from 3,500 rubles) or on your own (costs only for new glass).  How to make a repair is up to you, but remember that the service will give you a guarantee.  If you try to fix the problem yourself, you can only make it worse. </p>
