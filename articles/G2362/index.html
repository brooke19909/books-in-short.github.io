The explanation for this is quite simple.  The fact is that the specified manufacturer seeks to fill as much as possible all market segments.  In the first half of last year, one rather interesting modification appeared on sale in our country - Sony C2105 Xperia L. An overview of this device, which was no exception to the above rule, is presented in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony C2105 Xperia L" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/556439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The device is available with a predominance of black, white or red.  The base is partially enveloped due to the back cover, so backlash is not typical for the case.  Moreover, even with time, he does not begin to creak.  Dimensions <span>Sony C2105</span> Xperia L are 128.7 x 65 x 9.7 mm in height, width and thickness, respectively.  As for the weight of the device, it equals 137 grams. </p><p>  On the front side, in addition to the display, there is a <span>front camera, a</span> speaker for telephone calls, distance and light sensors, as well as a microphone.  On the left side you can see the microUSB port, and on the opposite - a metal power button, keys for adjusting the volume and taking pictures.  The back of the device is occupied by the main camera with an additional microphone and flash.  The developers have placed the headphone jack on the upper edge.  As for the compartment for installing additional memory and a slot for a mobile operator‚Äôs card, they are located inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="display Sony C2105 Xperia L" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/556440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><br>  Screen </h2><p>  The diagonal size that the Sony C2105 Xperia L display has is 4.3 inches.  The screen is covered with a protective glass Schott 2 source, which is designed to protect it from scratches and other mechanical damage.  This is especially true if you do not use a cover for the device.  The matrix manufacturing technology is not advertised by the manufacturer.  <span>The screen resolution</span> is 854x480 pixels, while the image density is 227 pixels per inch.  The lack of <span>oleophobic coating</span> is one of the main drawbacks of the Sony C2105 Xperia L. display. Reviews from experts and many smartphone owners indicate that fingerprints are rubbed off very badly.  Moreover, the finger does not slide very well across the screen.  The sensor is capable of simultaneously recognizing up to four touches. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The model operates on the Android 4.1.2 operating system with a proprietary shell from the manufacturer - Xperia Home.  Initially, the device does not have any gadgets installed, they must be downloaded separately.  It is considered rather inconvenient that the user of the device cannot independently modify its backlight.  Interesting and useful was the battery saving mode, which is called Stamina.  As for standard software, everything here is the same as in other models from the line - branded services, programs from other developers (for example, file manager and browsers).  It should be noted that the user can delete the unnecessary pre-installed applications without any problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia L C2105 camera" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/556442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  The Sony C2105 Xperia L phone has 8 gigabytes of stationary memory, of which a little more than half is available to the user.  The rest of the space is required to provide for systemic needs.  Although the slot for an additional memory card (up to 32 gigabytes in size) is provided for in the model, it is impossible to download applications to it.  The device operates on the basis of a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with a frequency of 1 GHz. </p><p>  As for RAM, its capacity here is 1 GB.  In terms of performance, there can be no special complaints about the device from its price category on the device.  Applications load fairly quickly, provided that their size is not very large.  Moreover, at this time, heating for modification is uncharacteristic.  With more complex programs, things are somewhat different. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera used in the Sony Xperia L C2105 smartphone is equipped with the latest version (at the time the model was available for sale) of the Exmor RS sensor.  She shoots with a resolution of eight megapixels.  Be that as it may, the pictures obtained with her help cannot be called very clear and high-quality.  For distant plans, vagueness is almost always characteristic.  As for shooting video, it happens with a maximum resolution of 720 p.  The picture on the rollers cannot boast of clarity.  Moreover, it usually has poor stabilization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony C2105 Xperia L reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/556441.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that the model has a front camera of 0.3 megapixels.  There is no need to talk about the quality of her pictures.  The only worthy area of ‚Äã‚Äãits application can be called perhaps video calling. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Nowadays, hardly anyone can be surprised by a removable battery with a capacity of 1750 mAh.  It is this element that is used in the Sony C2105 Xperia L. Anyway, do not forget about the nuance that in this case we are talking about a device that does not differ in powerful system characteristics, and at the same time has far from the largest screen.  From this the conclusion suggests itself that the power consumption of the smartphone is not very high.  And indeed it is.  In particular, in standby mode, a full charge of the battery will last about 454 hours, and with constant conversation - for 8.5 hours.  If you set the maximum brightness of the display and turn on HD video playback, as well as all wireless modules, the device will completely discharge in just four hours.  With all this, do not forget about the special energy-saving mode, which allows you to significantly extend the life of the device without additional charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony C2105 Xperia L review" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/556444.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, we can not help but recall the cost of the Sony C2105 Xperia L. phone. In particular, in the domestic official points of sale for the model asking for the amount starting from the mark of twelve thousand rubles.  Among the main advantages of the device can be noted unless a stylish appearance and an unusual LED backlight.  In all other respects, the device can be safely called a typical middling, the technical filling and performance of which is enough to solve ordinary everyday tasks.  The set of applications installed initially is quite enough to satisfy the requests of not very experienced users, while the quality of the pictures created with the camera is great for posting on social networks. </p>
