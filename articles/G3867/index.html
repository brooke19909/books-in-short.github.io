Inca Empire: capital, culture, history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are very few sources of information regarding the history of the Incas, an ancient Native American civilization.  Most of the information comes from the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries.  Filippo Huaman Poma De Ayahalo - the 16th-century Inca artist left one original and invaluable document - these are drawings and chronicles that give a detailed description of the Inca society.  Realizing that his world could disappear, Ouaman Pomah described all his splendor.  It was the work of his life.  He intended to give it to King Philip II, in the hope that the monarch would see his colony in a different light and change his attitude towards it. </p><p>  In his work, he also described the way of life of the Andean peoples before the Incas arrived - the Indians led a harsh and complex lifestyle, they were almost savages.  But everything changed with the appearance of a being who was half-human, a demigod - the son of Inti, the son of God.  His name is Manco Kapak.  He called himself ‚ÄúInca‚Äù and brought civilization to his world. </p><p>  He taught people to build cities and cultivate the land.  Under his leadership, the Inca world began to flourish.  His wife, Manco Kapaka Okllo, taught women how to weave. </p><p>  Such was the world of the Incas, where one name belonged to both the ruler and his people. </p><p>  100 years after the formation of the Inca empire, in the 15th century, this state, located on the territory of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, ceased to exist.  However, more on that later ... The article will talk about who the Incas are. </p><h2>  The origin of civilization </h2><p>  According to legend, the sun god Inti created the ancestors of the Inca rulers.  These were 4 brothers and 4 sisters who left the Tampu Tokko Cave.  Their leader was Ayyar Manko, who carried a golden staff in his hands.  He had to find a place where the staff would enter the earth, which would be a sign of fertile soil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After long wanderings, Ayyar Manko with his brothers and sisters came to the valley of Cuzco, where the staff finally entered the ground. </p><p>  Defeating the warlike locals, the brothers and sisters founded the capital of the Inca Empire.  Ayyar Manco began to call himself Manco Kapak, which means "ruler of the Incas."  He became the first Sappa Inca (supreme leader). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultura10.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inca Empire Tauantinsuu" class="if uuid-2976197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976197.jpg"></div><h2>  But was it like that? </h2><p>  Ethnologists at the National Center for Scientific Research are not completely sure of the historical existence of the first eight Incas.  Rather, they were mythical characters.  Due to the fact that all currently available information about the Incas is closely related to their epic. </p><p>  Each family of Inca rulers had their own traditions similar to African ones.  Each generation of rulers told a story in its own way. </p><p>  A significant period in the history of the Incas is associated with the ruler of Pachakuti.  Among other things, he was the greatest religious reformer.  During his reign, the Inca people became much less dependent on the high priests of the solar religion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="baomoi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Who are the Incas" class="if uuid-2976140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976140.jpg"></div><h2>  Pachacuti time </h2><p>  In the XII century, the Andes were inhabited by a huge number of different peoples and tribes constantly warring among themselves.  Pachacuti wanted to create an empire that would unite all Andean peoples.  His name, which means "changing the world," perfectly describes his aspirations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He united the tribes around the city of Cuzco and his goals became a reality. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 15th century, the Inca empire was attacked by the Chanka tribe.  The city of Cuzco was threatened.  Pachacuti took command of the army and managed to repulse the attack and, inspired by the victory, began military expansion. </p><p>  Pachacuti seized territory in the region of Lake Titicaca and expanded the possessions of the Incan Empire Tauantinsuyu in the North, right up to the Cohamarca area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="czyp.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inca Empire Tauantinsuu" class="if uuid-2976200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976200.jpg"></div><h2>  A few words about lifestyle </h2><p>  Briefly, the culture of the Incas reflects their life.  When the Incas enslaved the peoples, they gave local rulers special gifts - women and various wonders.  Thus, they made him somewhat appreciative, left him in debt.  In exchange for these gifts, the leaders had to pay the Incas tribute or perform various types of work for them.  From that moment on, they entered into relationships that are historically called vassal dependence.  This could be forced labor, which was called ‚ÄúMita,‚Äù or an unequal exchange called ‚ÄúAine.‚Äù </p><p>  This system of relations with captured tribes has become one of the main aspects of the Inca power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dumielauxepices.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Native American Civilization" class="if uuid-2976180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976180.jpg"></div><p>  Creating an orderly system on such a large scale on the territory of one of the largest mountain ranges on the planet was not an easy task.  The Incas needed to create collective labor, commodity exchange, a management system and ensure security.  All this would have been impossible without the construction of roads. </p><p>  There is no doubt that the Incas already knew what a wheel was.  However, mountain landscapes were not suitable for the use of wheeled vehicles.  Even today, most of the travels in the Andes are on foot.  But the Incas conquered the mountain peaks, creating a developed network of communication routes.  They built bridges in a world that literally hung between heaven and earth. </p><h2>  A few words about the reign of Sapp Inca </h2><p>  Inca power, like any other power, required an impact on the consciousness of people.  And the majestic city of Machu Picchu, according to ethnologists, is only part of the image of power.  For example, the ruler could not face.  His image has always been associated with sacred rituals.  He was revered as the son of the Sun and was a real shrine to the people. </p><p>  The power of the ruler was immortalized after his death, when he joined all the gods and became God himself.  The Chronicles of Huaman Pom describe the Incas understanding of life after death.  They believed that human life force does not disappear after death.  In their view, the ancestors could protect the living on earth. </p><h2>  Capital of the empire </h2><p>  In the heart of the Andes, at an altitude of more than 3 thousand meters, was the city of Cuzco - the capital of the Incan empire.  In 1534, it was almost wiped out by the Spanish invaders.  The city of Cuzco is the political and spiritual center of the Incan empire. </p><p>  In addition to Cuzco, there were several administrative centers; there were not many cities in the Inca empire.  Most of the territory is small villages where the Incas lived and worked on plantations.  Agriculture was the centerpiece of their economy. </p><h2>  Rituals </h2><p>  To understand who the Incas are, you should turn to their epic. </p><p>  In the chronicles of Man Pom, one of the chapters is devoted to a rather strange ritual - capacocha.  During some events, such as a solar eclipse, a volcanic eruption, or an epidemic, children were sacrificed to earn the favor of spirits.  It also happened that these were the children of the leaders of the tribe. </p><p>  Capacocha was an important part of the political and religious cult in Cuzco. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elchaco.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Native American Civilization" class="if uuid-2976187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976187.jpg"></div><h2>  Account system </h2><p>  Although the Incas did not have written language, they used a system of knots and rope plexuses called kipu to record numbers and possibly other information.  Thanks to the decimal system, the taxation of subjects was orderly and efficient. </p><p>  Food taxes were collected throughout the empire and formed in kolpos.  This system provided the population with acceptable living conditions and was an important aspect in controlling the economy of the empire. </p><p>  They lived at high altitudes, where every 5-6 years there could be no harvest, so they just needed to make supplies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kidsdiscover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where the Incas lived" class="if uuid-2976142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976142.jpg"></div><p>  In return, the empire provided security, maintained infrastructure, and provided residents with livelihoods.  For this, large warehouses with essential goods were built everywhere.  Such kolpos were in every region. </p><h2>  Now back to the division of land </h2><p>  The son of Pochakuti - Tupac Inca - continued the conquest of new territories and in 1471 became ruler.  Towards the end of his reign, the empire extended throughout western South America.  He showed the inhabitants of neighboring tribes who the Incas were. </p><p>  In 1493, the ruler was succeeded by his son, Wine Kapak.  The wars of the new ruler on far borders increased the level of discontent in the empire. </p><p>  In 1502, having won the civil war, the army of Atahualpa faced the invaders from Europe.  And although the Incas exceeded the number of Europeans, Francisco Pizarro with a small detachment of conquistadors completely defeated their huge army.  With the help of rifles and horses that the Incas had never seen before, the Spaniards won.  Atahualpa was captured and killed a year later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exame.abril.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where the Incas lived" class="if uuid-2976151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44521/2976151.jpg"></div><p>  However, according to historians, this is not the only reason for the fall of the empire.  At that time, it was in the process of fragmentation and war, which became the main cause of the collapse. </p><p>  The great heyday of the Inca empire was almost as fleeting as its fall.  And now, unfortunately, we can find out who the Incas are from the few sources that have survived to this day. </p>
