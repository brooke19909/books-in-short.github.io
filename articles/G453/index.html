Everything can be insured now - life, real estate, cars, a smile and even a toy.  There are also a huge number of companies involved in this type of financial activity.  But experts advise contacting large ones - they have fewer problems with payments, they are less likely to close, and it‚Äôs easier to make contact in contentious situations.  One of them is <span>Tinkoff Insurance</span> - JSC (joint-stock company), which specializes in <span>insurance of vehicles,</span> real estate, health and the issuance of insurance necessary for traveling abroad (without such insurance you simply will not be given a visa).  In the article we will tell you what the company is, the features of insurance in it and the innovations in the list of services. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  Initially, Tinkoff was created as a bank in 2006 by Oleg Tinkoff.  Now the organization is engaged in a huge number of financial transactions (deposits, loans, payments and transfers, investments), issuing debit and credit bank cards.  At the moment, Tinkoff Bank is one of the largest companies in the market for the issuance of bank cards in Russia. </p>

    <p>  A few years ago, the company began to develop Internet banking, and now it focuses on advertising precisely on this feature (the slogan "Tinkoff - the largest online bank in the world from Russia").  The Internet bank is really well developed in this organization: sites with a large number of sections and services, applications for which can be executed without getting up from a computer, mobile applications that also have wide and affordable functionality.  Applications from Tinkoff can be downloaded from the AppStore or PlayMarket by asking the same name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  Tinkoff Insurance is a joint-stock company that has been specializing in insurance services since 1993.  Since 2013 it belongs to the Tinkoff company and is also headed by Oleg Tinkoff.  The entire load falls on the site, since all insurance policies are issued via the Internet, since the company does not have retail offices.  Moreover, the resource is understandable, pleasing to the eye in terms of color and not overloaded with texts: everything is brief and to the point, and if you need to know more, you just need to open the corresponding link, which is easy to find.  The company is assigned a high level of reliability and a stable rating.  It is successfully developing, is actively advertised and is constantly expanding the list of customers. </p><h2>  Service list </h2><p>  <span>The Tinkoff Insurance company</span> provides several types of insurance services.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Insurance when traveling abroad (without such insurance, visas are not issued, to obtain a document you need a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, a medical policy, and it is also important to know the direction of travel and the period for which you are going to go). </li><li>  Real estate insurance (you can insure an apartment, a house, additional buildings in the form of a garage, utility room, etc., premises for rent, interior decoration, engineering equipment, personal property) against fire, flooding, natural disasters, unlawful interference by third parties . </li></ul>

This form will be discussed below. </li></ul><h2>  CTP </h2><p>  Now, for cheaper used cars, people more often draw up only a compulsory motor liability insurance policy, since its registration is mandatory according to the law of the Russian Federation.  Tinkoff Insurance has such a service.  Since OSAGO, under general rules, protects only in case of an accident, it is possible to issue OSAGO + CASCO.  It will come out more expensive, but there are discounts on such a combination of insurance programs, and reliability will be higher. </p><h2>  CASCO </h2><p>  This policy is now becoming more in demand.  This is due to the fact that CASCO protects against hijacking and other unpleasant situations, but OSAGO, as mentioned above, does not.  Let's see what is a relatively cheap hull from Tinkoff Insurance. </p><p>  Firstly, it protects against fire, explosion or lightning and natural disasters (flooding, hurricane, earthquake, etc.).  Secondly, the Tinkoff Insurance CASCO policy, reviews of which are generally positive (we will talk about this below), provides protection against accidents, unless, of course, you are responsible for the accident and there are no other unforeseen situations on the road (going wild or domestic animals on the roadway, for example). </p>

    <p>  Although the insurance conditions state that compensation payments can be received even in case of guilt.  But this is better to check with the insurer, as the cases are individual.  Thirdly, the policy protects your luggage and pets that you carry in the car.  Fourth, you are insured against any objects falling onto the car.  The most important thing is the protection at hull insurance against theft (theft).  If your car was stolen by third parties, you will definitely be able to receive monetary compensation.  CASCO on a car also compensates for the costs of technical assistance (tow trucks), legal advice and taxis in case of urgent need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to calculate the cost of the policy </h2><p>  The cost of the Tinkoff Insurance CASCO policy can be calculated by going to the website and selecting the corresponding "Calculate cost" option on the main page.  A window will open in which you will need to select the region of car use, year of manufacture, make, model, type of transmission (gearbox) and approximate cost of the car today, in your opinion.  Next, you need to fill out the section with driver information: driving experience, age and contact details (name, phone and e-mail).  The latter are needed in order to send the cost of the CASCO policy and a detailed calculation to the potential insured. </p><h2>  Terms of registration </h2><p>  Detailed conditions for obtaining an insurance policy and concluding an agreement can be found in the rules on the website.  Here are the main points. </p><p>  To issue a policy, you must provide the following documents: </p><ul><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation or constituent documents, if insurance is executed by a legal entity. </li><li>  Documents for the car (certificate of registration in the MREO traffic police, PTS, power of attorney, if any, a gift agreement, etc.). </li><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  A document confirming the value of the car (agreement, checks). </li><li>  Valid or ended insurance contract. </li><li>  Statement on the model. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The third is the possibility of monthly payment.  That is, you can pay CASCO for a year immediately or record the payment once a month in the contract, then the amount indicated in the contract will be deducted from your card regularly.  This is convenient, since you can stop the payment and, accordingly, the policy at any time by going to your personal account on the site and clicking "stop". </li><li>  Fourth - you can get a detailed calculation of the cost of the policy that you want to purchase without leaving your home. </li></ul><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Upon receipt of the Tinkoff Insurance CASCO policy, reviews of which will be presented below, you can continue to use additional free services, which include: </p><ul><li>  a tow truck that delivers the damaged car from the accident site to the service station; </li><li>  departure of the <span>insurance agent</span> upon the occurrence of an insured event (in case of an accident, it can help to issue a Euro protocol so as not to wait for the traffic police when the damage to the car is insignificant); </li><li>  policy delivery, as mentioned above. </li></ul><h2>  When an insured event occurs </h2><p>  When an insured event occurs, you must inform the insurer about this within 1 day.  The deadline for submitting documents is 14 calendar days from the day of the incident.  After this period, the insurance company has the full legal right to refuse to pay any money, and even through the court you will not always be able to achieve a reverse decision.  If the reason for the delay in notification was valid, then by providing a document confirming this (sick leave, travel document, etc.), the insurer extends the period for a certain number of days (under the terms of the contract or at its discretion) so that you can correct the situation and provide the whole package of necessary documents, which includes: </p><ul><li>  car owner's passport; </li><li>  Title </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  vehicle registration certificate; </li><li>  a protocol confirming the fact of an accident, theft, car damage by third parties or falling objects, collisions with animals, and so on, certified by the traffic police; </li><li>  if the car is damaged or lost due to a natural disaster, you need a certificate from the body dealing with this problem, for example, the Ministry of Emergencies; </li><li>  a conclusion from the service station, certified by an expert, in which all the details and elements of the machine to be replaced or repaired, as well as the materials necessary for this, and the cost of all the above are listed (if the repair has already been paid, then all documents are provided that confirm the fact of payment, for example , checks, contracts). </li></ul>
