Backlight Types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Television manufacturers regularly introduce users to new technologies that improve image quality.  Approaches to combining TV screens and LED elements have long been mastered by major companies.  Recently, the source of bright and soft glow also moves to the displays of mobile devices.  Users of traditional lighting based on LEDs can also appreciate the advantages of this solution, but, of course, the backlighting of LED screens in TVs looks most attractive.  Moreover, it is supplemented by other high-tech inclusions used by the developers of this technology. </p>

    <h2>  Backlight device </h2><p>  In the creation of modules for the implementation of illumination, LED arrays are used, which can consist of white LED elements or multi-colored, such as RGB.  The design of the board to equip the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãspecially designed to integrate a specific carrier model into the device.  As a rule, on the left side of the board there are contact connectors, one of which provides power to the LED backlight, and the other is designed to control its working settings.  Also, a special driver is used for <span>LED modules</span> , the function of which is paired with the controller. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ready-made <span>LED strip</span> is a series of miniature lamps that are connected in groups of 3 pieces.  Of course, manufacturers do not recommend interfering with the device of such tapes, but if desired, you can physically shorten or, conversely, make the device longer.  Also, the standard LED backlight provides the ability to adjust the brightness, supports a smooth start and is equipped with voltage protection. </p>

    <h2>  Classification of backlight by installation type </h2><p>  There are two ways to integrate LED backlighting - direct and end.  The first configuration assumes that the array will be located behind the liquid crystal panel.  The second option allows you to create very thin screen panels and is called Edge-LED.  In this case, the tapes are placed around the perimeter of the inside of the display.  At the same time, the LEDs are evenly distributed using a separate panel, which is located behind the LCD display - usually this type of LED backlight is used in the development of mobile devices.  Adherents of direct illumination indicate a qualitative result of the glow, which is achieved thanks to a large number of LEDs, as well as local dimming in order to reduce color stains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  LED backlight application </h2><p>  An ordinary consumer can find this technology in Sony, LG and Samsung TV models, as well as in Kodak and Nokia products.  Of course, LEDs are more widely used, but it is in the models of these manufacturers that there are qualitative shifts towards improving the consumer qualities of this solution.  One of the main tasks that the designers faced was to support the operability of a screen with optimal characteristics under direct exposure to sunlight.  Also, <span>LED-backlighting has</span> recently improved in terms of increasing contrast.  If we talk about progress in the direction of the screen design, then there are noticeable reductions in the thickness of the panels, as well as compatibility with a large diagonal.  But there remain unsolved problems.  LEDs are not able to fully reveal their capabilities in the process of displaying information.  However, this did not prevent LED technology from displacing CCFL lamps and successfully competing with the new generation of plasma screens. </p><h2>  Stereoscopic effects </h2>

    <p>  Modules based on LEDs have many abilities to provide various effects.  At this stage of technology development, manufacturers are actively using two stereoscopic solutions.  The first involves the angular deviation of the radiation flux with the support of the diffraction effect.  The user can perceive this effect during viewing with or without glasses, that is, in holography mode.  The second effect involves the displacement of the light flux, which is highlighted by the backlight of the LED screen in the direction of a given trajectory in the liquid crystal layers.  You can use this technology in combination with 2D and 3D formats after appropriate conversion or transcoding.  However, regarding the possibilities of combining with three-dimensional images, LED backlights are not going smoothly. </p><h2>  3D compatible </h2><p>  This is not to say that LED-backlit screens have serious problems interacting with the 3D format, but for optimal viewing by the viewer of such a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù special glasses are required.  One of the most promising areas of this development are stereo glasses.  For example, nVidia engineers released shutter 3D glasses with liquid crystal glasses several years ago.  To deflect light fluxes, the LED backlight of the LCD screen uses polarization filters.  In this case, the glasses are made without a special frame, in the form of a tape.  The built-in lens consists of a wide array of translucent <span>LED arrays</span> that receive information from the control device. </p><h2>  Backlight Benefits </h2>

    <p>  Compared with other backlight options, LEDs significantly improve the consumer qualities of television screens.  First of all, the direct characteristics of the image are improved - this is reflected in increased contrast and color reproduction.  The highest quality color spectrum processing is provided by the RGB matrix.  In addition, the backlight of the LED screen is characterized by reduced power consumption.  Moreover, in some cases, a reduction in electricity consumption of up to 40% is achieved.  It is also worth noting the possibility of producing ultra-thin screens, which at the same time have a small mass. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Users of televisions with LED backlighting criticize them for the harmful effects of blue-violet radiation on the eyes.  Blueness is also observed in the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù itself, which distorts the natural color reproduction.  True, in the latest versions of high-resolution televisions, the LED-backlit screen has practically no such defects.  But there are problems with brightness control, in which pulse-width modulation is involved.  During these settings, you may notice screen flicker. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Today, the segment of TV models with LED technology is in its infancy.  The consumer is still evaluating the opportunities and advantages that an innovative solution can provide.  It should be noted that the operational disadvantages of LED-backlighting do not confuse users as much as the high cost.  Many experts consider this factor to be the main barrier to the widespread popularization of technology.  However, the prospects for LEDs still remain promising, as their cost will decline as demand increases.  In parallel with this, other backlighting qualities are being improved, which further increases the attractiveness of this proposal. </p>
