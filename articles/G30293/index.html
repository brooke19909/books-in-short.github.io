They expanded and deepened the cave structures of the time of the Hittite kingdom, created huge cities with a population of more than 10,000 people at that time, and built real underground labyrinths.  Cappadocia (Turkey) is known throughout the Christian world for the following cities: </p><ul><li>  Ugryup is an ancient settlement located on the side of a mountain.  Unique houses are caves and are only partially visible on the surface.  It was here, in one of these dwellings, that Saint lived and prayed.  John of Russia. </li><li>  Nevsehir - is located in the central part of the Anatolian plateau, on the territory of which (according to one version) the ancient city of Nissa was located.  To the outskirts of Nevsehir approach the slopes of the mountains, mottled with dilapidated failure houses, in which until recently the townspeople lived.  The eruptions of the volcanoes of Erdzhiyas and Hasandag led to the fact that the earth was covered with a layer of tuff.  Over time, the soft breed has undergone changes and acquired bizarre forms.  ‚ÄúFairy trumpets‚Äù are called by locals amazing pyramids and cones of different colors. </li><li>  Derinkuyu - an underground city that served the seventh century Christians as a shelter from the Arabs oppressing them.  It is believed that it has as many as 20 floors, but archaeologists have so far been able to study only 11. Unfortunately, visitors can see only a small part of the premises, ventilation shafts and outbuildings.  On the surface you will not be bored either.  For example, you can explore the beautiful but abandoned Greek monastery and mosque, which was also originally a Christian church. </li><li>  Kaymakli is another large underground city, which is connected by a tunnel to Derinkuyu.  To date <span>, archaeologists have</span> excavated eight of its floors and opened the top four to visit.  Tourists can see here an extensive system of rooms, ventilation shafts, utility rooms and wells. </li></ul>

It was here that the sermon of St. Paul sounded, and it was this land that became the birthplace of many saints and fathers of the church, who made a huge contribution to the formation of the teachings of Orthodoxy.  It is not surprising that constant persecution, a sense of danger, and a willingness to die for faith influenced the spread of monastic feat.  Monuments of human stamina and spiritual enlightenment can be shown to pilgrims Turkey (Cappadocia).  Tours in Goreme are very popular, because here you can see more than 20 churches carved in the rocks and several monasteries.  The greatest value of this place is the frescoes created in the 9-13th centuries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cappadocia Turkey Attractions" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1004503.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Valley of illahar </h2><p>  This is another famous attraction that Cappadocia (Turkey) values.  It is a natural canyon of volcanic origin with a length of 14 kilometers.  Tourists who come here need to have good physical fitness and be properly dressed.  To go down to the bottom of the canyon, you must go through a staircase with more than 400 steps.  And in order to inspect the temples carved into the rock, they will need to climb steep ladders without a railing, squeeze into narrow crevices and make their way along barely noticeable paths at a dizzying height. </p><p>  Be sure to visit Kirm-Damalti-kilis - the Church of St. George (Cappadocia, Turkey).  The tour will be interesting, because you can see the paintings of seven hundred years ago, which are better preserved than in other places.  You can also visit the Temple with terraces, the Snake <span>Temple, the Church of</span> St. Daniel and the Fragrant Temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of cappadocia turkey" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1004502.jpg" width="540"></div>
