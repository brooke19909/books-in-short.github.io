In this workshop we will try to make a large rose with buds on a stand from a metal-plastic pipe. </p><h2>  How to make a rose from corrugated paper: step by step instructions </h2><p>  For work, we need Italian-made corrugated paper with a density of 180 grams - it holds its shape well and is best suited for large flowers.  It needs two shades: green for leaves, and for buds you can choose to your taste.  Under the color of the foliage, choose a <span>floral ribbon.</span>  We also prepare a thin floristic wire for leaves 1 mm thick, a glue gun and scissors. </p><p>  The pipe must be bent with a ring and bent so that it is stable and well held, and drill holes for a branch with foliage in it.  You will also need a large branch - the diameter of its lower part should be slightly smaller than that of the pipe, and enter it tightly.  We will attach the whole composition to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weddbook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crepe rose" class="if uuid-2447134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2447134.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make rose petals from paper </h2><p>  Let's start creating roses from corrugated paper.  We unfold the sheet of the color that was chosen for the petals, and cut it in half.  One part is folded four times in half in width - 16 layers should be obtained.  We cut them along on both sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We fold the second part in half, and then bend both edges, dividing it into three equal parts.  From this paper we will make wider petals.  Also cut them along. </p><p>  Now we take a smaller sheet, bend it in half and begin to cut off the edge, forming a drop-shaped petal. </p><p>  We take the glue stick from the glue gun and begin to twist it on one side of the rounded edge obliquely.  You do not need to hold the blank in your hands - it is better to put it on the table.  We take out the wand without unwrapping the paper and twist the petal on the other side so that we get a corner.  Fingers stretch the paper to the sides, forming a boat. </p><p>  All petals are made in the same way, but try not to confuse wide and narrow - fold them in different directions.  Narrow will be in the inner part of the flower, and wide - outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crepe rose" class="if uuid-2447147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2447147.jpg"></div><h2>  We make a stalk </h2><p>  The next step to creating a large corrugated paper rose is to make a stalk.  Cut a sheet of green paper with a width of 30 - 40 cm and cut it in half.  We postpone one part - it will be for a large flower, and the second cut in half for buds.  From a large sheet, we begin to cut triangles, forming a fence, without cutting about 1/3 of the paper.  Then we take the scissors and begin to round off the sharp ends.  We will receive a stalk for a rose from corrugated paper.  For buds, the ‚Äúfence‚Äù needs to be made even thinner, with a base of 1.5 cm. We twist the edges in the same way and make another blank for the bud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="italian corrugated paper" class="if uuid-2447125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2447125.jpg"></div><h2>  Corrugated Paper Rose Leaves </h2><p>  Leaves will be cut from rectangles 10 x 20 cm and 10 x 13 cm. There will be 2 large leaves, and 8 small ones.  We cut each of them diagonally and fold the blanks so that the strips along which the corrugated paper look up. </p><p>  Now we take the wire and apply it to one half of the future leaf.  Using a gun, apply a thin strip of glue along the edge and apply wire.  Then again we put glue on the wire and apply the second half of the sheet so that all the strips look up.  Press the paper for better fixation. </p><p>  We take scissors and give the foliage a shape.  We round off the edges, and then we begin to draw our fingers along the strips, creating veins.  If you can‚Äôt do it with your fingers, then we take a spoon or stick and draw along the sheet plate.  It is undesirable to take sharp objects - so you can tear paper.  We take the floristic ribbon and begin to wind it onto the wire, starting from the base of the sheet.  It will be enough 5-6 cm, because then we will fasten these leaves together.  Thus, we make all the other leaves. </p><h2>  We collect leaves in a twig </h2><p>  Now make a twig.  We take one large sheet and arrange opposite two small ones.  We fasten them together with a floral tape.  We tightly wind it at the junction, and then go down until we wrap the entire wire.  After the foliage for the roses made of corrugated paper is fixed, we straighten it, bending the wire as necessary.  This flower usually has 5 leaves on a branch, but 3 pieces can be left. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crepe paper roses - photo" class="if uuid-2447141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2447141.jpg"></div><h2>  Closed Rose Buds </h2><p>  We proceed to the manufacture of the bud itself.  We take a branch and at its ends we pull a piece of yellow paper, forming the center.  Glue them and the petals, pressing them well to the base so that the flower does not come off the stick.  Then we take the first petal and apply glue to its center, and then to the edges.  It should be wrapped around the stick, then our do-it-yourself rose from corrugated paper will look more natural. </p><p>  We straighten it and, in turn, attach the remaining petals in the same way: first, glue the middle, wrap the workpiece around the stick, apply glue on the sides and fix it.  It is advisable to pre-select a place for them, distributing them evenly.  Small petals are attached tightly to the base, and large ones are slightly higher, so that it is more convenient to open them.  Gradually, a do-it-yourself rose made of corrugated paper will appear a form very close to the natural look. </p><p>  When everything is ready, take a green corrugated paper cut by a fence and apply it to the base of the flower.  Try on, pull and begin to stick. </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftedtobloom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of roses from corrugated paper" class="if uuid-2447117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2447117.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembling roses on a stand </h2><p>  For the convenience of further work, we insert a large rose of corrugated paper into the stand and set about making buds.  From the paper for the petals, cut three strips 25 cm wide and cut them in half to get 6 rectangles.  We take one, fold it in half and round the corner on only one side.  Stretch the edge to make it wavy.  Now it remains to bend the middle - and the first petal is ready.  Set it aside and process two more pieces in the same way.  We got the petals to fit the bud.  The following do the same as for the big rose. </p><p>  To add volume to the bud, you can use any materials - paper, foil or bag.  We wrap them around the stick, forming a ball, and fix it with tape.  Then we take a piece of corrugated paper and pull it on the ball and fix it with tape or glue.  Now glue the petals.  The first is tightly wrapped around the middle and continue to create a rose in the same way as the opened bud.  Only the sepals will be directed inward, not outward. </p><p>  Similarly, create another flower.  It remains only to insert the branches with leaves and completely wrap the surface of the branches and pipes with floral tape.  In the same way, you can make a bouquet of roses from corrugated paper to decorate the interior or installation. </p>
