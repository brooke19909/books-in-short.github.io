  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 kopecks in 1984. Main features and approximate cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Could Soviet minters have thought that the attention of numismatists living in the 21st century would be attracted by a change coin of 20 kopecks in 1984?  More precisely, it was not the coin itself that became the subject of heated debate, but a manufacturing defect, which experts call the result of the deterioration of the old Soviet stamp used for minting. </p><p>  Some collectors claim that it is a coin with a defective obverse that is of particular value today. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reverse and obverse coins" class="if uuid-2728595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2728595.jpg"></div><p>  20 kopeks of 1984 was regularly minted from an alloy of nickel, zinc, manganese and copper (the so-called metal neulziber-10). </p><p>  The thickness of the twenty-copeck coin of 1984 is one and a half millimeters, the ribbed edge.  In diameter, the coin reaches 21.8 millimeters, and weighs a little less than 4 grams. </p><p>  The obverse of 20 kopecks in 1984, when viewed with the naked eye, is no different from the other side of the remaining Soviet coins.  The emblem and abbreviation "USSR" are depicted here.  The reverse displays information regarding the year of manufacture and the face value. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1984" class="if uuid-2727966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2727966.jpg"></div><p>  The edges of the coin on both sides (as on all Soviet state emblems) are decorated with oak branches and wheat ears. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To date, numismatists are willing to pay for one coin 20 kopecks in 1984 from 5 to 40 rubles.  The final price depends on its condition. </p><h2>  What are the numismatists-forum users arguing about? </h2><p>  One question does not bother visitors of numismatic forums: are the elements of marriage identified on Soviet coins (in particular, 20 kopecks in 1984), an occasion to consider them unique and, accordingly, expensive. </p><p>  Under the concept of marriage there are a type of collisions, chips and incomplete identity of symbolism, for example, uneven length of ears. </p><p>  The reason for the most heated debate was the chips present on the coins of the early sample, minted according to the pattern of three cents of 1979.  The main question that excites the members of the forum: can chips be called marriage? </p><p>  According to some experts, chips and elements that violate the clarity of lines are present on almost all metal money of the Soviet period, so it is unlikely that these flaws can serve as a reason to increase the cost of lots.  Therefore, not a single coin of 20 kopecks in 1984 is of particular value.  They confirm their verdict with facts: since 1980, Soviet minters began to actively use old stamps.  Therefore, chips and other linings are explained by worn out stamps, and not by manufacturing defects. </p><p>  Numismatists from the warring camp have no doubt that the not-so-good condition of the Soviet coins at their disposal makes them priceless to such an extent that they cannot be sold under the hammer. </p><h2>  Coin features </h2><p>  Modern experts speak of three varieties of coins worth 20 cents.  1984, for many Soviet citizens today is associated with the slogan "The economy should be economical" and, probably, just for reasons of economy, old templates were used to make some banknotes from metal. </p><p>  For example, to create twenty-copeck coins of an early period, a stamp was used for the three-copeck metal money of 1979. </p><p>  On coins of the second type there was a stamp from three kopecks of 1981 of release.  Its uniqueness lies in the unconventional arrangement of the coat of arms and a new design: the obverse depicted the Gulf of Guinea (pictured). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ghanagrio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 20 kopecks 1984" class="if uuid-2727969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2727969.jpg"></div><p>  20 kopeks of 1984 of the third kind were also minted by means of templates for three-kopeyn coins, but stood out against the ‚Äúcongeners‚Äù with a special yellow metal. </p>
