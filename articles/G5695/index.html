Residents of the city got used to them on billboards and looked forward to their erection.  They had to significantly change and improve the appearance of the city.  It was with this calculation that the ‚ÄúFirst Nikolaev‚Äù <span>residential complex (Yekaterinburg) was built. The</span> developer changed the height of the towers from 200 to 150 meters due to the financial crisis affecting the real estate sector as well. This decision was dictated by the desire to save on costs. in the real estate market, about forty percent happened. </p><h2>  Construction line </h2><p>  The construction company is engaged in the construction company Uralenergostroykompleks.  The end is scheduled for the end of 2018.  Buildings are being erected in the order provided by the queue.  First twenty-five-story and fourteen-story.  This year, it was planned to complete the construction of two twin towers.  True, as already mentioned, their height will be trimmed.

    <p>  Such construction stages will in no way affect the well-being of already settled residents.  That is how the builder assures.  The construction site will be separated from the living area.  The construction border runs so that the residents do not feel any inconvenience from a neighboring construction site. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúFirst Nikolaev‚Äù residential complex (Yekaterinburg) is located right in the center of the city, which makes all the surrounding infrastructure accessible to its residents.  But at the same time, this is also its drawback.  Since it is in this area that there is an industrial zone and a railway passes.  This all makes living in the complex not so attractive due to environmental conditions and noise. </p>

    <p>  As for transport links, things are much better here.  After all, it is still the center of the city, and there is enough public transport.  Near the complex are schools and kindergartens, which will allow children to get to them on foot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The "First Nikolaev" residential complex (Yekaterinburg) took its place in the center of the big city.  Additionally, the developer does not need to build infrastructure.  Since schools, kindergartens, and shops are abundant around the complex.  And residents living in it can also use them. </p><p>  The developer plans to equip the courtyard.  She will be free from cars.  In the courtyard will be equipped with underground parking for two thousand parking spaces, on the roof of which there will be playgrounds for children, recreation areas for adults.  In addition, the parking lot is also equipped with a wheel wash at the entrance to it. </p><p>  For the comfort of residents, there are separate entrances from the street.  This is so that special equipment, taxis and delivery services do not drop into the yard and create a mess, but stop from the side of the street. </p><p>  What else can ‚ÄúFirst Nikolaev‚Äù housing complex boast of?  Each house has several high-speed elevators that lower residents into the underground parking.  The likelihood of breakdown of the elevator is also provided, and there is a spare control unit. </p><p>  ‚ÄúCaring for everyone‚Äù is the motto adhered to by ‚ÄúFirst Nikolaev‚Äù residential complex (Yekaterinburg).  Residents' reviews are still few.  After all, not all buildings are still built and put into operation due to postponements of the construction period by the developer.  But although the construction company fulfills its promises for a long time, but the houses are equipped with the needs of different categories of residents, even people with disabilities.  Halls, stairs and corridors are equipped with special ramps.  It is convenient for both people with disabilities and small children. </p>
