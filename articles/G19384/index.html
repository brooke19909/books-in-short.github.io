He was the third son in the family of the guards musketeer - a native of an old noble family.  Father Fyodor Ignatievich Ushakov served in his youth, but he never managed to make a career.  In 1747, he resigned as a sergeant and began to live the quiet, measured life of a small landowner (he had about 30 peasants).  The future saint Fedor Ushakov was born in the small village of Burnakovo, owned by his father. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The elder brother of the boy Gavril became a dragoon captain, the other, Stepan, rose to the rank of lieutenant only.  Fedor decided to connect his life with the fleet.  For a young man of his status, it was a strange choice.  At that time, the nobles considered naval service too harsh and prestigious.  In addition, the future saint Fedor Ushakov was not distinguished by iron health and heroic strength.  Physical barriers, however, did not scare him. </p><p>  Having entered the naval cadet corps, Ushakov began to learn how to handle guns and cannons, and studied ship architecture in detail.  Every summer, the cadet had practice.  In the exercises, the future saint Fedor Ushakov got used to real warships.  He had wonderful teachers and mentors, including the future hero of the Battle of Chesme and Admiral Grigory Spiridov.  In the years 1764-1765.  Ushakov sailed from Kronstadt to Revel and to the island of Gotland, and in 1766 he was released from the corps and promoted to midshipman. </p><p>  Very soon, the next Russo-Turkish war began (1768-1774).  The future saint Fyodor Ushakov was promoted to lieutenant and, by appointment, he went south to the Azov-Don Flotilla, commanded by Rear Admiral Alexei Senyavin.  The officer hit the road from Pavlovsk.  From there, he had to transport floating batteries to Azov (which was done). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  War and Peace </h2><p>  In 1772, the holy righteous warrior Fedor Ushakov first became the commander of the ship.  It was a small courier warship.  The boat guarded the Kerch Strait, sailed to Feodosia and Taganrog.  The very next year, under the command of Ushakov, sixteen-gun ships ‚ÄúModon‚Äù and ‚ÄúMorea‚Äù appeared.  The ships cruised along the newly occupied Russian troops of the Crimea and covered the army from the Turkish landing.  After the war, the future saint Fedor Fedorovich Ushakov received the rank of lieutenant commander and moved to St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In peaceful years, the officer regularly served in the capital.  In 1780, he was appointed commander of the court yachts.  This position was convenient for all kinds of careerists.  Being close to the empress meant having a chance of getting into court life, inside which all the cream of St. Petersburg society was.  But the holy warrior Fedor Ushakov did not at all strive for such secular pleasures.  Once again, having handed over the vessels entrusted to him for the winter, he asked Ivan Chernyshev, the head of the naval department, to transfer him to the current fleet. </p><h2>  At the origins of the Black Sea Fleet </h2><p>  At 35, Fedor Ushakov became the captain of the battleship Victor.  On this ship, in the squadron of Rear Admiral Jacob Sukhotin, he went on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea.  Upon the return of the officer, another promotion awaited (he received the rank of captain of the second rank).  Without wasting time on the holidays due to him, Ushakov began to test new ships, moving them from Revel to Kronstadt.  The last time before a long break, he sailed in the Baltic in the summer of 1783, after which he moved to the Black Sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the holy righteous Fedor Ushakov found himself in Kherson, where he was engaged in the construction of ships, the city was struck by an epidemic of plague.  The officer had to split his team, and quarantine part of the team.  In 1784, an experienced sailor became captain of the first rank.  For the successful fight against the plague, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree. </p><p>  Soon Fedor Fedorovich launched the battleship Saint Paul and arrived on it at the newly built base of the Black Sea Fleet Sevastopol.  Meanwhile, the port acquired new marinas, arsenals, warehouses, barracks, and officer houses.  When the construction of Sevastopol was finally completed, Empress Catherine II and her ally, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, arrived in the city.  For his services, Ushakov was admitted to the Empress and sat at the same table with her. </p>

    <h2>  New challenges </h2><p>  The Turkish sultan Abdul-Hamid I was not going to put up with the latest victories of Russian weapons (including the annexation of Crimea).  He set out to return the peninsula.  The seamen of the Black Sea Fleet did not have time to settle in Sevastopol, when the next Russian-Turkish war (1787-1791) began. </p><p>  During the first campaign of that campaign, Ushakov at St. Paul, along with several other vessels, was overtaken by a severe storm.  The disaster occurred near Varna.  "St. Paul" lost the mast, and the current carried him far east to the enemy Abkhazian shores.  But even this misfortune could not unsettle such a talented captain as Saint Fedor Ushakov.  A brief biography of the famous military leader was full of examples of feats and decisive action.  So this time he did not shy away.  The captain and his team managed to establish new sails on the remains of the masts and return the ship to Sevastopol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On July 14, 1788, a battle took place near the island of Fidonisi (it is also known as Serpentine) - the first serious naval battle of that war.  Fedor Ushakov also took part in it.  The Holy Russian Orthodox Church was at the forefront of the ships that repulsed the first attack of the Turks.  The Black Sea Fleet was successful.  The decisive and accurate shooting of frigates damaged the Turkish flagship.  The enemy squadron left the battlefield.  After this defeat, the Turks no longer had superiority in the Black Sea and lost the opportunity to land on the Crimean coast.  For a huge contribution to the victory at the island of the Serpent Ushakov, they were made to rear admirals. </p><h2>  Kerch battle </h2><p>  The next battle of Fedor Ushakov (Kerch <span>Sea Battle)</span> took place on July 8, 1790.  This time, the naval commander commanded a whole squadron that met an enemy Turkish detachment.  The enemy had artillery superiority.  From the first minutes, the Turks rained fierce fire on the vanguard of the Russian squadron.  Something urgently needed to be opposed to this onslaught.  The decision depended on only one person and Rear Admiral Fedor Ushakov was that person.  The holy righteous warrior separated the weakest frigates and, closing ranks, hastened to the rescue of the attacked vanguard, commanded by the fleet brigadier Gabriel Golenkin. </p><p>  With the help of several maneuvers, Ushakov managed to lure the Turkish vice-admiral ship.  The enemy ship had to go between the Russian lines and fall under the crushing dense fire of guns.  Then Ushakov, who was on the flagship Christmas of Christ, together with the rest of the squadron, went on a rapprochement with the Turks. </p><p>  Enemy ships faltered and fell.  From the final defeat they were saved only by their own lightness and speed.  The Kerch naval battle demonstrated the outstanding training and fire training of Russian sailors.  After another defeat, the Turks became worried about the security of their own capital, Istanbul. </p>

    <h2>  Tendra </h2><p>  Fedor Ushakov did not intend to rest on his laurels, but set about organizing a new important naval operation.  On August 28, 1790, his squadron, consisting of 36 ships, unexpectedly attacked the Turkish fleet (also 36 ships), which stopped between Tendra Spit and Hajibey.  Rear Admiral‚Äôs actions were on the border of courage and self-confidence.  The Turks, with the numerical equality of the ships of the most dangerous battleships, had 9 more, which again gave them artillery superiority (1360 guns versus a little more than 800). </p><p>  Nevertheless, it was the reckless courage of the Russian fleet that led the enemy to bewilderment.  The Turks, despite their numerical superiority, prepared to retreat, some of the ships had already retired a considerable distance.  As expected, the Ottoman rearguard, which was in an extremely vulnerable position, fell behind.  Then Vice Admiral Said Bey, who commanded the squadron, decided to go to the rescue of the slow courts.  As a result, his ship Kapudaniya, together with the Meleki Bahri, was surrounded.  The Turks fought fiercely, but were defeated.  After the bloodshed, the <span>Most Holy Prince</span> and favorite of the Empress <span>Gregory Potemkin</span> arrived at the Nativity of Christ <span>.</span>  On his recommendation, Catherine II awarded Ushakov the Order of St. George of the 2nd degree (contrary to tradition, according to which this award was given only to military leaders with higher ranks). </p><p>  Fedor Fedorovich returned to Sevastopol, but not for long.  In October, on the orders of Potemkin, Rear Admiral took up cover from the Turkish fleet crossing the rowing squadron, which was supposed to go to the Danube.  After occupying the mouth of the river, it was supposed to storm the important Ottoman fortresses of Kiliya and Ishmael.  The task was completed.  Ushakov‚Äôs actions helped the army capture strategic fortresses on the Black Sea coast.  Most distinguished Alexander Suvorov, whose assault on Izmail and today is considered one of the most bloody assaults in the military history of mankind. </p>

    <h2>  Kaliakria </h2><p>  Meanwhile, Istanbul changed power.  The successor of Abdul-Hamid I Selim III was discouraged by the success of the Russians at sea and near the walls of Ishmael, but decided not to lay down his arms.  As a result, the end of the campaign was somewhat delayed, and the last naval battle of that war took place on July 31, 1791. </p><p>  On the eve of the Ottoman fleet concentrated near Varna, and then headed towards the cape Kaliakria (modern Bulgaria).  Unexpectedly, he was attacked by a Russian squadron under the command of Fedor Ushakov.  The Turks were taken by surprise.  Some of their ships were unprepared for battle due to the upcoming Ramadan holiday.  Nevertheless, reinforcements in the form of Tunisian and Algerian corsairs joined the Ottomans. </p><p>  From the first minutes of the battle, Ushakov, without losing a minute, began to draw closer to the enemy.  For mobility, his vessels were lined up in three columns.  This position was the most advantageous in terms of surprise attack.  The Turks, learning about the appearance of the Russian fleet, began in a hurry to cut the ropes and set the sails.  Several ships collided with each other, which caused panic and turmoil to intensify even more. </p>

    <h2>  Another victory </h2><p>  In the Turkish squadron, seniority belonged to the Algerian flagship.  This ship, along with several other ships, tried to circumnavigate the Russian flotilla.  Fedor Fedorovich in time understood the enemy‚Äôs maneuver.  His ship, the Nativity of Christ, advanced forward and headed across the enemy unit.  This decision was a complete surprise for both their own and for others.  According to tradition and unwritten rules, the captain had to stay in the heart of the battle order, from where the easiest way to control the course of the battle.  However, at a critical moment, when the fate of the entire collision was at stake, Ushakov decided to give up on the established order.  His ship shot the flagship of the Algerian Pasha with well-aimed fire.  The ship had to retreat back. </p><p>  After some time, the entire Black Sea Fleet became close to the Turks and attacked them in a friendly outburst.  The flagship "Christmas" was in the center of the Ottoman squadron.  The enemy‚Äôs resistance was broken by a powerful onslaught.  The Turks again fled. </p><p>  By coincidence, a ceasefire was concluded on the same day, July 31.  Fedor Ushakov learned about the end of the war on August 8.  Rear Admiral received this news from Field Marshal Nikolai Repnin.  The key campaign in Ushakov‚Äôs life ended, immortalizing and glorifying his name.  It is time to return home. </p>

Meanwhile, the situation on the world stage remained tense.  Russia joined the <span>anti-French coalition,</span> which opposed the revolution <span>,</span> which was dangerous for the conservative monarchies.  This foreign policy step was taken by Catherine II.  However, in 1796 she died.  Her son Paul I continued the foreign policy of his mother.  In 1798, he appointed Fedor Ushakov as commander of the Mediterranean squadron, and a year later made him admiral. </p><p>  During the campaign, the military leader showed himself not only as a brilliant strategist, but also as an outstanding diplomat.  He contributed to the creation of the Greek Republic under the protectorate of Turkey and Russia, participated in the battles for the Ionian Islands and the liberation of Italy from the French.  Saint Admiral Fedor Ushakov led the blockade of Genoa and Ancona.  After assisting the allies in the anti-French coalition, the admiral returned with his squadron to Sevastopol. </p>

    <h2>  Recent years and heritage </h2><p>  In 1802, the holy warrior Admiral Fedor Ushakov began to command the Baltic rowing fleet, then he was appointed head of the St. Petersburg naval teams.  At the age of 62, the military commander retired.  He settled in the Tambov province, where he bought a small estate.  Here he found the Patriotic War of 1812.  Tambov province needed a militia chief.  He was elected Fedor Ushakov.  The Holy Russian Orthodox Church resigned due to illness. </p><p>  In old age, the admiral devoted himself to a modest religious life and charity.  He often visited the Sanaksar Monastery located near his estate.  The naval commander died on October 14, 1817 in his village Alekseyevka in the territory of the modern Republic of Mordovia.  The relics of the holy righteous warrior Fyodor Ushakov were buried in the walls of the Sanaksar monastery. </p><p>  Together with Admiral Nakhimov, this commander became a symbol of the glory of the Russian fleet.  In many cities, monuments were erected in his honor or streets were named.  In 1944, the Order of Ushakov was established in the USSR, and in 1953, based on his biography, the film "Ships storm the bastions" was shot. </p><p>  Despite the fact that in the Soviet era, repression against the church became commonplace, and the Sanaksar monastery was closed, the grave of the admiral was saved.  After the USSR collapsed, and the Russian Orthodox Church was able to recover, the question was raised about the canonization of the famous naval commander.  On the one hand, he became famous as a great officer, and on the other hand, in his old age he began to lead a humble religious life.  In 2001, by decision of the Russian Orthodox Church, a new canonized warrior appeared - Fedor Ushakov.  The saint, whose relics are still stored in the Sanaksar monastery, has become a figure not only of the naval, but also of religious veneration. </p>
