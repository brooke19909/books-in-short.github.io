Many care about where Leonardo da Vinci was born and who he was.  He is known as an artist, anatomist and engineer.  In addition to numerous discoveries, this unique man left behind a huge number of different puzzles that the whole world is trying to solve to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2081881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62130/2081881.jpg?1562091193"></div><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  When was Leonardo da Vinci born?  He was born on April 15, 1452.  It is interesting to know where Leonardo da Vinci was born, and specifically in which city.  There is nothing easier.  His surname came from the name of the place of birth.  Vinci is an Italian city in the then existing Florentine republic. </p><p>  Leonardo was the illegitimate child of an official and an ordinary peasant girl.  The boy grew up and was brought up in the house of his father, thanks to which he received a good education. </p><p>  As soon as the future genius was 15 years old, he went to the apprenticeship with Andrea del Verocchio, who was a talented sculptor, painter and representative of the Florentine school. </p><p>  Once a teacher, Leonardo took up one interesting work.  He agreed to write an altar image in the church of Santi Salvi, which depicted the baptism of Christ by John.  Young da Vinci participated in this work.  He wrote only one angel, which turned out to be an order of magnitude more beautiful than the whole image.  This circumstance was the reason that <span>Andrea del Verocchio</span> decided never to pick up his hands again.  His young, but incredibly talented student was able to surpass his teacher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After another 5 years, Leonardo da Vinci becomes a member of the guild of artists.  There he began with particular passion to study the basics of drawing and many other compulsory disciplines.  A little later, in 1476, he continued to work together with the former teacher and mentor Andrea del Verocchio, but already as a co-author of his creations. </p><h2>  The long-awaited glory </h2><p>  By 1480, the name of Leonardo da Vinci became famous.  I wonder when Leonardo da Vinci was born, could his contemporaries suggest that he would become so famous?  During this period, the artist receives the largest and most expensive orders, but after two years decides to leave his hometown and moves to Milan.  There he continues to work, writes several successful paintings and the famous fresco "The Last Supper". </p><p>  It is during this period of life that Leonardo da Vinci begins to keep his own diary.  From there we learn that he is no longer just an artist, but also an architect-designer, hydraulics, anatomist, inventor of all kinds of mechanisms and decorations.  In addition to all this, he also finds time to compose riddles, fables or puzzles.  Moreover, interest in music awakens in him.  And this is only a small part of what Leonardo da Vinci became famous for. </p><p>  Some time later, a genius realizes that mathematics is much more interesting than painting.  He is so keen on exact science that he forgets to think about painting.  Even later, da Vinci begins to show interest in anatomy.  He leaves for Rome and has been there for 3 years, living under the ‚Äúwing‚Äù of the Medici family.  But very soon joy is replaced by sadness and longing.  Leonrado da Vinci is upset about the lack of material for anatomical experiments.  Then he tries to engage in various experiments, but even this does not lead to anything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Life changes </h2><p>  In 1516, the life of an Italian genius changed dramatically.  He is noticed by the king of France <span>Francis I,</span> truly admired by his work, and invited to the court.  Later, the sculptor <span>Benvenuto Cellini</span> will write that although Leonardo's main work was a very prestigious post of court adviser, he did not forget about his work. </p><p>  It is during this period of life that da Vinci begins to develop the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan aircraft.  First, he manages to come up with the simplest model based on wings.  In the future, it will serve as the basis for a completely crazy project at that time - an airplane with full control.  But even though da Vinci was talented, he could not invent a motor.  The dream of an airplane turned out to be impossible. </p><p>  Now you know exactly where Leonardo da Vinci was born, what he was fond of and what life path he had to go through.  The Florentine died on May 2, 1519. </p><h2>  Painting by a famous artist </h2><p>  The Italian genius was very versatile, but most people think of him exclusively as a painter.  And this is no accident.  Leonardo da Vinci's painting is true art, and his paintings are real masterpieces.  Over the riddles of the most famous works that have come out from under the brush of the Florentine, thousands of scientists from all over the globe are beating. </p><p>  Selecting several paintings from the whole variety is quite difficult.  Therefore, the article will feature the top 6 most famous and earliest works of the author. </p><p>  1. The first work of a famous artist - "A small sketch of a river valley." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2081857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62130/2081857.jpg?1562091193"></div><p>  This is a really neat drawing.  It depicts a castle and a small wooded slope.  Sketch made with quick strokes with a pencil.  The whole landscape is depicted in such a way that it seems as if we are looking at the picture from some high point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  2. "Turin self portrait" - created by the artist at about 60 years old. </p><p>  This work is interesting to us primarily because it gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the great Leonardo da Vinci looked like.  Although there is an opinion that a completely different person is depicted here.  Many art historians consider the "self-portrait" a sketch for the famous "Mona Lisa".  This work is considered one of the best works of Leonardo. </p><p>  3. "Mona Lisa" or "Mona Lisa" - the most famous and perhaps the most mysterious picture of an Italian artist, painted in about 1514 - 1515. </p><p>  She in itself is the most interesting fact about Leonardo da Vinci.  There are so many theories and assumptions connected with the picture that it is impossible to recount them all.  Many experts claim that the canvas depicts an ordinary <span>Italian woman</span> against a very unusual landscape.  Some believe that this is a portrait of the Duchess of Costanza d'Avalos.  According to others in the picture, the wife of Francesco del Gioconda.  But there is a more modern version.  It says that the great artist captured the widow of Giovanni Antonio Brandano named Pacifika. </p><p>  4. "Vitruvian man" - a drawing created as an illustration for the book, tentatively in the years 1490-1492. </p><p>  It very well depicts a naked man in two slightly different positions, which are applied to each other.  This work received the status of not only works of art, but also scientific work. </p><p>  5. ‚ÄúThe Secret of the Supper‚Äù by Leonardo da Vinci - a picture showing the moment Jesus Christ announced to his disciples that he would be betrayed by one of them.  It was created in the years 1495-1498. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2082461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/2082461.jpg?1562091193"></div><p>  This work is as mysterious and mysterious as the Mona Lisa.  Perhaps the most truly amazing thing in this picture is the story of its writing.  According to many historians, Leonardo da Vinci for a long time could not write Judas and Christ.  Once he was lucky enough to find in the church choir a beautiful young man, spiritualized and so bright that the author's doubts disappeared - here he is, the prototype of Jesus.  But the image of Judah remained unfinished.  For three long years, Leonardo wandered around the backwoods, looking for the most despicable and infamous man.  Once he found one.  It was a drunkard in the gutter.  Da Vinci brought him to the workshop and wrote Jude from him.  How unimaginable was the author‚Äôs surprise when it turned out that he wrote Jesus and his betraying student from the same person, who was just met at different times in the life of the latter. </p><p>  The "Secret of the Supper" by Leonardo da Vinci is also famous for the fact that on the right hand of Christ the master portrayed Mary Magdalene.  Due to the fact that he placed her this way, many began to claim that she was the legitimate wife of Jesus.  There was even a hypothesis that the contours of the bodies of Christ and Mary Magdalene denote the letter M, which means "Matrimonio", that is, marriage. </p><p>  6. ‚ÄúMadonna Litta‚Äù - a picture dedicated to the Mother of God and the Baby Christ. </p><p>  <span>Madonna with a baby</span> in her arms is a very traditional religious plot.  But it was Leonardo da Vinci's painting that became one of the best in this field.  In fact, this masterpiece is not very large, only 42 x 33 cm. But it still really amazes the imagination with its beauty and purity.  This picture is also notable for its mysterious details.  Why is the baby holding a chick in her hand?  For what reason does his mother have a dress in the place where the baby is pressed to her chest?  And why is the picture so dark? </p><p>  Leonardo da Vinci's painting is not just beautiful paintings, it is a whole separate kind of art, striking the imagination with its indescribable magnificence and bewitching secrets. </p><h2>  What did the great creator leave to the world? </h2><p>  What is famous for Leonardo da Vinci in addition to paintings?  Undoubtedly, he was talented in many areas, which, it would seem, cannot be combined with each other at all.  However, in spite of all his genius, he had one entertaining character trait that did not fit in with his business very much - he liked to abandon the work he had begun and leave it so forever.  Nevertheless, Leonardo da Vinci nevertheless brought to the end several truly brilliant discoveries.  They turned the then ideas about life. </p><p>  The discoveries of Leonardo da Vinci are amazing.  What can we say about the person who created the whole science?  Do you know paleontology?  But it is precisely Leonardo da Vinci who is her ancestor.  It was he who first made an entry in his diary about a certain rare fossil that he managed to discover.  Scientists are still wondering what was being discussed.  Only an approximate description is known: a certain stone, similar to petrified honeycombs and having a hexagonal shape.  Leonardo also described the first ideas about paleontology as a science in general. </p><p>  Thanks to da Vinci, people learned to jump from planes without crashing.  After all, it was he who invented the parachute.  Of course, initially it was only a prototype of a modern parachute and it looked completely different, but the importance of the invention does not become less from this.  In his diary, the master wrote about a piece of linen fabric, 11 meters long and wide.  He was sure that this would help a man to land without any injuries.  And as time has shown, he was absolutely right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2081865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62130/2081865.jpg?1562091193"></div><p>  Of course, the helicopter was invented much later than Leonardo da Vinci died, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe aircraft belongs to him.  It does not at all resemble what we now call a helicopter, but rather resembles an inverted round table with one leg, to which pedals are screwed.  It was due to them that the invention was supposed to fly. </p><h2>  Unbelievable, but it is a fact </h2><p>  What did Leonardo da Vinci create yet?  Incredibly, he also had a hand in robotics.  Just think, back in the 15th century, he personally constructed the first model of the so-called robot.  His invention had many complex mechanisms and springs.  But most importantly - this robot was humanoid and even knew how to move its hands.  In addition, the Italian genius came up with several mechanical lions.  They could move by themselves using mechanisms such as sentries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2082458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/2082458.jpg?1562091193"></div><p>  Leonardo da Vinci made so many discoveries on earth that he became interested in something new in space.  He could watch the stars for hours.  And although you can‚Äôt say that he came up with a telescope, in one of his books you can find instructions for creating something very similar to him. </p><p>  Even with our cars we owe da Vinci.  He came up with a wooden car layout having three wheels.  All this design was set in motion by a special mechanism.  Many scholars believe that this idea was born back in 1478. </p><p>  Among other things, Leonardo was fond of military affairs.  He came up with multi-barrel and rapid-fire weapons - a machine gun, or rather, its prototype. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2082481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/2082481.jpg?1562091193"></div><p>  Of course, Leonardo da Vinci could not help but come up with something for the painters.  It was he who developed the artistic technique in which all distant things seem blurry.  He also came up with chiaroscuro. </p><p>  It is worth noting that all the discoveries of Leonardo da Vinci were very useful, and some of his developments are used today.  They are only slightly improved. </p><p>  Nevertheless, we cannot but admit that Leonardo da Vinci, whose contribution to science was enormous, was a real genius. </p><h2>  Water - a favorite element of Leonardo da Vinci </h2><p>  If you like diving or at least once in your life diving to a considerable depth, then thank Leonardo da Vinci.  It was he who invented scuba gear.  Da Vinci constructed a floating cork buoy that held a reed tube for air above the water.  He also came up with a leather bag for air. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci, biology </h2><p>  Genius was interested in everything: the principles of breathing, yawning, coughing, vomiting, and especially heartbeat.  Leonardo da Vinci studied biology, closely linking it with physiology.  It was he who first described the heart as a muscle and almost came to the conclusion that it pumps blood in the human body.  Yes, Vicny even made an attempt to create an aortic valve prosthesis through which blood flow passed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2081919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62130/2081919.jpg?1562091193"></div><h2>  Anatomy as an Art </h2><p>  Everyone knows that da Vinci was interested in anatomy.  In 2005, researchers discovered his secret laboratory, where he allegedly dissected stony corpses.  And this, apparently, had an effect.  It was da Vinci who accurately described the shape of the human spine.  Among other things, it is believed that he discovered diseases such as atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis.  Another Italian managed to excel in dentistry.  Leonardo was the first person who depicted the correct structure of teeth in the oral cavity, describing in detail their number. </p><p>  Wear glasses or lenses?  And for that it‚Äôs worth saying thanks to Leonardo.  In 1509, he wrote down in the diary a certain model of how and with which you can change the optical power of the human eye. </p><p>  Leonardo da Vinci, whose contribution to science is simply invaluable, has created, studied or discovered so much that is impossible to count.  His brilliant hands and head precisely belong to the greatest discoveries. </p><h2>  Something interesting </h2><p>  <span>The Italian artist</span> was a very mysterious figure.  And, of course, to this day there are various interesting facts about Leonardo da Vinci. </p><p>  It is known that he was an encryptor.  Leonardo wrote with his left hand and in very small letters.  Yes, and he did it from right to left.  But by the way, Da Vinci wrote equally well with both hands. </p><p>  The Florentine always spoke in riddles and even made prophecies, most of which came true. </p><p>  Interestingly, not where Leonardo da Vinci was born, a monument was erected to him, but in a completely different place - in Milan. </p><p>  It is believed that the Italian was a vegetarian.  But this did not prevent him from being a steward of court feasts for thirteen years.  He even came up with several culinary "helpers" to facilitate the work of cooks. </p><p>  Among other things, the Florentine insanely beautifully played the lyre.  But even this is not all the interesting facts about Leonardo da Vinci. </p>
