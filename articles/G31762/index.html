  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocheted picture: description, examples and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The assertion that the fantasy of needlewomen has no boundaries is absolutely true.  Indeed, literally every day, the craftswomen come up with some new and original thing.  Of course, some are in demand with a limited number of people.  But others are gaining enormous popularity.  Become a trend, to acquire which almost everyone dreams.  The last such invention was a crocheted picture.  This product looks really impressive and unusual.  Therefore, further we study the technology of its implementation. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  The studied products in most cases are made from yarn residues.  Because, depending on the complexity of the picture, the number of shades in it varies.  Some require a hundred flowers!  However, experienced needlewomen note that beginners should not immediately undertake serious work.  Only after long trainings will it be possible to perform crocheted paintings, which are original reproductions of great artists. </p><p>  First you need to understand the technology and practice a little.  And after improving his skills.  In any case, at the preparatory stage, you need to come up with a plot by drawing a sketch of your idea, or find a suitable option among the finished paintings.  Then pick colors for them, trying to get the most accurate tone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted pattern" class="if uuid-3005495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005495.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the choice of yarn </h2><p>  Craftswomen who are professionally engaged in crochet crochet patterns claim that it is better to use one type of yarn for work.  That is, to knit a picture of wool, acrylic or other materials.  In the future, it will be possible to mix different knitting threads, beating the details with the features of the texture.  But at the initial stage it is difficult to do.  Therefore, it is important not only to select the yarn of a suitable color, but also to select skeins with the same composition, density and thickness of the thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which hook do you prefer? </h2><p>  Another important part of the preparation, preceding the execution of a crocheted pattern, involves the choice of instrument.  Indeed, the success of work directly depends on its quality.  Therefore, experienced needlewomen recommend paying special attention to the purchase of a hook.  For beginners it is better to choose one that is made of metal.  It is easy and convenient for them to work, largely because it provides a good glide of the thread.  However, do not buy a tool that is too long.  The ideal one that is comfortable to hold in your hand.  We determine the size, focusing on the prepared yarn.  So that the picture does not turn out too holey or the picture is completely lost, you need to work with a crochet equal to the thickness of the knitting thread. </p><h2>  Knitting a simple pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pattern description" class="if uuid-3005063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005063.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen can sketch a sketch of a painting on graph paper.  And then work out the outline of each detail in the cells.  This will allow you to calculate the number of loops and rows for each shade of yarn.  For beginners, a similar technique can also help.  However, do not try to portray a complex portrait or landscape.  You can sketch the so-called children's drawing.  For example, similar to the one presented above. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To complete a crocheted panel picture, you need to take gray yarn and knit a chain of the desired length.  Then tie it in a spiral and form the mole‚Äôs breast.  Then we take a black knitting thread and form a trunk.  In addition, we knit handles and legs, also starting with chains, we sew.  Now we are preparing two white ovals - eyes and one pink - nose.  Then we knit the fabric of the desired size.  We start with light green yarn, and then turn to grassy color.  And finally, we collect a crocheted picture panel.  Using a needle and thread, we sew all parts of the mole and place them on a green base.  Next, embroider the mouth, eyes, forelock, pens, leaves.  If desired, we knit flowers and arrange them with the next layer.  We complement the craft with a frame, and afterwards we leave it to ourselves or present it as a gift. </p><h2>  Picture in sirloin technique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pattern" class="if uuid-3005042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005042.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting idea does not require a combination of different shades of yarn.  After all, this picture is knitted with a thread of one color.  However, it is better to choose monochrome yarn, and not motley, gradient or other unusual.  The essence of the technology is quite simple and accessible even for beginners.  Work should be according to the scheme.  The reader will be able to view several interesting options above.  An empty cell alternates with a filled one.  As a result, it is possible to connect the silhouettes of various animals, people, objects and other things.  Moreover, this technique can be used not only for crocheted crocheting.  Workshops are also suitable for decorating garments, pillows, napkins, and even tablecloths.  The main thing is to knit one double crochet and two air loops when an empty square is indicated on the diagram.  And three double crochet - when filled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Pictures from fragments </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pattern step by step" class="if uuid-3005468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005468.jpg"></div><p>  Very similar to fillet knitting is another technology.  It also allows you to work on schemes.  Even according to what we presented in the previous paragraph.  However, in this case, the needlewoman will not have to knit the stitches marked with empty cells.  Very original and unusual paintings, crocheted (the girl in the hat, for example, presented above), consist of separate fragments.  Therefore, the task of the master is to connect the silhouettes of the characters depicted in the diagram.  Then remove all the strings, place the parts of the picture on a fabric canvas and carefully sew on a fabric base.  In conclusion, supplement the picture with a frame.  Although many needlewomen frame the image with a knitted ribbon, complement the second part and use it as pillowcases for decorative pillows. </p><h2>  Fabric-based painting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted picture idea" class="if uuid-3005058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005058.jpg"></div><p>  Another original idea implies very simple and accessible actions even for beginner needlewomen.  It begins with the preparation of the background.  Any fabric serves them.  The image above illustrates the combination of the two materials.  If desired, the reader can also distinguish between the background zone using a fabric of different colors.  After that we start knitting ideas. </p><p>  In this case, it's a cute ladybug.  It is performed in the same way as the mole from the cartoon, which we studied earlier.  However, all parts of the animal are not stitched together, but are superimposed on the base in a different sequence.  First, the distant legs and tail, then the trunk, the proximal legs, the outer and inner parts of the ears and horns, the head, eyes, nose and mouth.  After that, several chains of rays should be attached to the canvas, and on top is a circle-sun.  We place flowers on the field.  And finally, we sew on our cow a bang, a flower and a bell.  We complement the sun with a nose, eyes and a smile.  Then we frame the crocheted picture, the photo of which is proposed above. </p><h2>  Volumetric paintings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric knitted pattern" class="if uuid-3005106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005106.jpg"></div><p>  This simple idea involves preparing any flower you like.  In this case, lilies.  The scheme is proposed above.  We make a flower on it and attach the finished product to the wire, and then to the fabric base.  We stretch the canvas and decorate the frame. </p><h2>  Chain picture </h2><p>  Well, the last interesting technique, which we would also like to tell readers about.  It will certainly appeal to all newcomers.  And all because it is performed quite differently from the previous ones.  This is its uniqueness.  However, to perform it, you will have to prepare a piece of paper and glue or a fabric cloth and a needle with a thread.  Each needlewoman has the right to choose the most suitable option for her.  So, in this paragraph, we propose making pictures of crocheted chains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted picture of chains" class="if uuid-3005493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3005493.jpg"></div><p>  Work begins with transferring the selected image to the base.  You can use special paper for this.  After that we prepare a chain of black color.  Lubricate the outline of the main parts of the picture with glue and glue the chain.  If the reader prefers to use a needle with a thread, then the chain should be sewn strictly along the contour.  Then we prepare chains of other colors and fill in the parts of the picture.  At the same time, you can arrange the knitted rope horizontally, vertically or twisting in a circle. </p><p>  When in this way it will be possible to complete the whole craft, put it to dry (when using glue) or immediately supplement the frame and place it in a very visible place.  However, it is important to note that some paintings by needlewomen prefer to be voluminous.  For example, the depicted bear should be supplemented with pompons, which should be sewn on top of the work.  The dog in the second picture walks along the field with flowers.  For them, you should tie chains of bright colors and also attach on top of the work. </p><p>  Now our reader knows how to make a crocheted picture.  Flowers, plants, various animals and even people seem to come to life if a person with imagination and love for creativity takes up the matter. </p>
