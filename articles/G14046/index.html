    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the general positive picture outlined by the guests of the Starlet Hotel 3 * hotel, its reviews also contain some negative comments: </p><ul><li>  some kind of sluggish staff in terms of response to complaints and requests from guests; </li><li>  the furnishings, furniture, appliances and everything else are incredibly old and shabby, and therefore the hotel urgently needs repairs if it wants to keep customers; </li><li>  no matter how many guests are accommodated in the room, they give out only one key card (as a result, if one person needs to leave, the second needs to wait for him in the room or sit without light); </li><li>  the balconies in the rooms are absolutely not adapted to spend time on them (there are no tables or armchairs), and there is also no dryer or at least an elementary clothesline; </li><li>  the gym is very crowded, there is no ventilation system, because of which there simply is nothing to breathe; </li><li>  the lobby area is incredibly small - there is practically none; </li><li>  maids do not consider it necessary to do wet cleaning (at best, it will be done once a week); </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel has two elevators, quite often there was such a situation that only one works, which is why large queues were created; </li><li>  water is periodically turned off (both hot and cold), but in most cases the problem is solved within a couple of hours; </li><li>  carefully monitor how much is withdrawn from your card when paying for services (it is not uncommon that, counting on the carelessness of guests, employees write off more than necessary); </li><li>  the air conditioning in the room is so "ancient" and weak that it practically does not cool the air due to its clogging; </li><li>  the <span>television shows</span> very <span>poorly</span> - it snows and fonit, and the channels are almost all local (only in some rooms the Russian Channel One catches). </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel for yourself, it is best to rely on the reviews of tourists who have visited many places.  So, a quite popular place to stay is the resort Starlet Hotel 3 * <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate that the main reasons for this choice are a favorable location and affordable price.

One of them is breakfast, which is incredibly varied and satisfying, compared to other similar institutions in Vietnam.  In addition, the hotel guests are provided with all the necessary list of related services: a gym, a swimming pool, rental bicycles, and organization of excursions and more.  Separately, it is worth noting the gorgeous views from the window, which slightly smooth out the negative from outdated room decoration. </p><p>  This hotel can be recommended to those tourists who go for vivid impressions, and not for luxury.  For the minimum cost, you will get quite decent living conditions, saving a certain amount for entertainment and excursions. </p>
