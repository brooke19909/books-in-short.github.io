He was born on April 19 in 1958.  Once upon a time in the Soviet Union everyone knew this name.  Today, few people remember this singer.  The musician is still alive.  Imant Vanzovich (photo proves this) looks great.  He is a successful organizer and director of water music shows. </p><h2>  About Opus </h2><p>  The musical career of the singer began in the construction battalion in Riga.  There, the local commander selected the most talented in terms of music recruits.  Imant Vanzovich turned out to be one of them.  The first team with which he began to perform was Zvayznite.  It was during this period of time that the musician met Sigmar Liepins, who in the future will play an important role in his musical career. </p><p>  Imantha gained popularity after serving in the army.  He began performing in the Opus band, where Mirdza Zivere was the soloist.  The leader of this ensemble was Sigmar Liepins.  In 1984, the song "You Need to Think About" won the All-Union Award at the "Song of the Year" festival.  This hit was sung by absolutely all the inhabitants of the USSR.  Tickets for the band‚Äôs concert were sold out in minutes. </p>

    <p>  The first Latvians studying at GITIS were namely Mirdza Zivere and Imant Vanzovic.  The biography of the singer has changed after the 80s.  Indeed, a few years after the founding of VIA "Opus" broke up.  The group disappeared from television screens and radio stations forever.  What is the reason? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The artists said that they were just very tired of wandering around cities and hotels.  After all, from the whole calendar year they managed to stay at home on the strength of 1-2 months.  But each of them had his own personal life.  In addition, the group toured for a penny.  They had no connections to give "left" concerts.  And with time, both Mirdza and Imant realized that songwriting was not their thing.  Directing is what both former students of GITIS are doing now.  In this university they studied at the directing faculty, not in vain! </p><h2>  What after "Opus"? </h2><p>  Already in the 90s, Imant Vanzovich tried again to return to the world stage.  He even performed several compositions with Ugis Praulins.  But these songs were too philosophical, filled with thoughts and ideas.  At that time, the people did not need this.  Therefore, the singer decides to finally put an end to his career as a singer. </p>

    <p>  Since the 2000s, Vanzovic has successfully staged water-music shows.  And he does it well.  Today he officially represents the French company Aquqtique show, which has long reached the world level. </p><h2>  A bit about personal </h2><p>  Imant Vanzovich was married several times.  His first wife is a musicologist.  Today in Latvia she works as a radio director.  The second, Inguna, together with Imant put on water-music shows.  They have a joint child. </p>
