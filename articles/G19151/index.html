    <h2>  Eternal beneficiaries </h2><p>  Are pensioners paying land tax?  Some tend to believe that older people in Russia are completely exempt from this category of payments.  This is actually not the case.  There is a certain list of taxes that are not levied on citizens who have reached retirement age.  But some payments still have to be paid.  If this happens, then, as a rule, the elderly are given certain bonuses or a reduction in the tax rate.  Therefore, to some extent, pensioners are eternal beneficiaries.  And only as a last resort do they pay taxes in full.  This fact will have to be taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  Property or land? </h2><p>  Is there a land tax for senior citizens?  The thing is that the payment being studied raises a lot of questions.  After all, as already mentioned, in older people, most taxes are subject to benefits.  And this must be taken into account.  Land tax is often considered a payment for property owned.  More precisely, it is called a property contribution.  It is not right.  The population should clearly understand that property and land are clearly separated from the tax authorities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why take this fact into account?  All due to the fact that pensioners do not pay property tax.  But the situation regarding the land is mixed.  Which one, exactly?  What awaits older pensioners who own land or land?  Understanding all this is not as difficult as it seems.  Especially if you do not confuse the property payment and land.  Then without any problems it will be possible to answer the question posed. </p>

    <h2>  No release </h2><p>  Are pensioners paying land tax?  In Russia, no citizen is fully exempted from this payment.  This means that all owners who belong to the category of taxpayers (that is, after adulthood) must, to one degree or another, pay taxes on land.  And no exceptions.  Anyway, about whom it is a question - about disabled people, large families or senior citizens. </p><p>  Accordingly, it should be concluded: land tax for pensioners takes place.  But at the same time, do not forget about the belonging of this category of persons to beneficiaries.  Despite the fact that you will have to give money for the plots, in some cases you can not calculate bonuses from the state.  Which ones?  Is there a land tax benefit for retirees? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__g1h"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__g1h"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__g1h"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__g1h"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__g1h"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Base reduction </h2><p>  Yes, she is.  True, as already mentioned, not everyone is granted a privilege.  We will talk about the categories of pensioners who can use the "bonus" from the state a little later.  First you need to understand what the benefit is.  This is an important point.  Maybe there is no point in her? </p><p>  Again erroneous opinion.  Any benefit in Russia allows you to get a good return.  Regarding land payments, we can only say that the land tax rate for pensioners is applied to a reduced base.  Accordingly, older people do not pay the full amount of money.  And this fact is already pleasing.  What amounts will the land tax rate be applied to?  It, in accordance with the Tax Code, is set by the government in a certain amount.  But the tax base for pensioners is reduced by 10,000 rubles.  For example, if a plot costs 300,000, then an elderly person must take into account a cost equal to 290,000. And calculate the tax from the second amount. </p>

    <h2>  Categories of beneficiaries </h2><p>  It has already been emphasized that not everyone is eligible for such a bonus.  Are pensioners paying land tax?  Yes.  But in some cases, not the full amount, with a tax base reduced by several thousand rubles.  Who is eligible for this benefit?  In the Tax Code of the Russian Federation categories of persons are prescribed who are able to take advantage of the offer from the state.  Who belongs to them?  The following citizens are distinguished: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Cavalry of the Order of Glory. </li><li>  Heroes of Russia and the USSR. </li><li>  Disabled (1 and 2 groups).  And also those who received their status in childhood or became such during nuclear exercises. </li><li>  Veterans of war, disabled WWII. </li><li>  <span>Victims of Chernobyl</span> or other serious accidents (this point is best specified). </li><li>  People who have tested nuclear weapons or eliminated such accidents. </li><li>  Persons who received radiation sickness. </li></ul><p>  You may notice that ordinary pensioners without any features are not included here.  Therefore, they will pay land taxes in full. </p>

    <h2>  The ambiguity of laws </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear that tax incentives for land tax are provided to pensioners.  But only in some situations.  Nevertheless, many emphasize quite interesting facts.  Namely, the ambiguity of Russian legislation.  The thing is that land taxes are regulated by municipalities.  Each region has its own rules and rates in this matter.  The Tax Code indicates that in a particular region pensioners may be assigned special benefits.  For example, full exemption from land taxes.  It is not prohibited.  Therefore, it is not always possible to quickly understand the issue under study. </p>

    <h2>  To pay or not? </h2><p>  Land tax benefits for pensioners are available in Russia.  Moreover, in some cases for all categories of people who went on a well-deserved rest.  Many are wondering if retirees should pay for land receipts they received.  Actually this question is quite controversial.  Again, because of all the above.  The thing is that all tax receipts must be paid.  But it is recommended that you first call the administration of the city district and find out there about the bonuses provided to pensioners.  Or contact the tax office and clarify all information of interest. </p><p>  It is likely that an elderly person will not have to pay the land tax in principle.  A rare occurrence, but it occurs.  But if we are talking about the previously listed categories of people, then they do not need to pay for land.  Instead, it is recommended that you take one action that will help you avoid receiving unnecessary receipts. </p><h2>  I have the right! </h2><p>  Quite often, pensioners complain that they, beneficiaries, receive land tax <span>receipts</span> .  This is not the best phenomenon.  It should be noted that we are talking exclusively about citizens who are 100% exempt from paying money for land.  What to do in this case?  It is required to contact the tax service with a receipt and a statement of the established form.  The document must indicate the presence of an elderly person of certain benefits.  Evidence is attached to the application.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  awards and orders; </li><li>  medals; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  disability certificates; </li><li>  land documents; </li><li>  certificates of veterans or combatants (including the Second World War); </li><li>  civil passports. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to attach SNILS, but this is not necessary.  This confirms the benefits of pensioners for land tax.  After that, payments will not be sent to the citizen.  And you will not have to worry about paying land tax. </p>

    <h2>  If the payment came? </h2><p>  What should I do if I received a receipt for payment of land tax?  As already noted, do not panic.  A small memo will help to clearly act in this situation.  In fact, it is easier to solve the question than it seems.  So, a citizen should: </p><ol><li>  Find out: is a pensioner exempted from making a contribution?  He may not have to pay a land tax.  To do this, call the tax office. </li><li>  If there are benefits, then the previously listed documents and a statement of the established form are attached to the receipt. </li><li>  Next, the pensioner must apply for a land tax exemption.  It is enough to submit an application with a package of documents.  You do not need to pay a receipt.  With benefits (discounts) on tax, the payer will be given a new payment.  And already it should be paid. </li><li>  When a citizen is not entitled to benefits or full exemption, the contribution must be paid in full. </li><li>  If before applying to the tax receipt was paid, then if there are benefits, you will need to issue a refund.  To do this, you need to write a statement, attach the details of the account to which money is transferred to the documents indicated earlier. </li></ol>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from all that has been said?  Land tax for seniors is a rather difficult topic.  It is full of features that will have to be specified in each city separately.  Moreover, this must be done regularly.  Or rather, annually.  Indeed, according to the law, the land tax is fully regulated by municipalities.  At the same time, there are beneficiaries among older people who in any area do not pay the payment at all.  But you will have to declare your rights in the manner prescribed by law. </p><p>  Accordingly, land tax for pensioners exists.  And quite often, citizens must fully pay the receipts they received.  The payment being studied is one of the few that is difficult to understand.  After all, basically retirees are either completely exempted from payment, or provide all those who have gone on a well-deserved rest with some kind of bonuses. </p><p>  For real estate, which is located on the site, as has been emphasized, pensioners usually do not pay.  Property tax for this category of persons does not take place.  And you need to remember this.  The best decision regarding the issue under study is a call to the city administration and the regional tax service.  Only there they will be able to answer: land tax privileges for pensioners are laid or not. </p>
