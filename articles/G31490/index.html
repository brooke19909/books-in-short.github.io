    <p>  What is he like?  In fact, this is a hybrid of classic accumulative life insurance, to which an investment component, presented as mutual funds, is added.  This approach involves placing part of the portfolio (if the client wishes) in more risky and at the same time profitable financial instruments. </p><h2>  What is interesting about this combined approach? </h2><p>  Among the very first advantages it should be noted the availability of standard insurance coverage.  What does this mean in practice?  If a person decides to use such a combined tool, then he receives insurance to cover the initial investments and the amounts received as a result of investments.  To this aspect, many are quite frivolous.  Although, admittedly, accidents occur quite often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Insurance programs are aimed at combating their consequences.  They help maintain a stable financial position even in the most unforeseen circumstances. </p><p>  The statement of such a problem is quite popular: if a person has lived to the end of the insurance period, and he has no problems, he will receive the amount deposited and the interest that has run over it.  That is, money is not lost, and there is protection. </p><p>  At the same time, a lot of pleasant bonuses are provided, which can vary in different companies.  The most popular - in the event of a client losing his ability to work, the insurance company makes contributions for him, so that, ultimately, he receives all the necessary payments. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2>

But in the case we are considering, there is still a small feature.  And it consists in the income received.  So, insurance savings programs allow you to get about 5-6%, which in our conditions does not even cover inflation.  This is due to the conservative allocation of funds.  And there is no desire to save it for decades.

    <p>  And here comes investment life insurance.  Rosgosstrakh or another company is not important.  The role is played only by the mechanism itself.  So, a significant part of the funds goes to investment tools.  Their ratio in this case is usually 1: 4.  That is, for every monetary unit that goes to the insurance part, four are invested. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Profitability between investments can be written in approximately the same ratio.

    <p>  If the interest is too high (30 or more), then there are two options: either scammers or organizations that invest in very dangerous assets.  Yes, there is such that profit of 70, 100 and 300 percent per year is possible.  But the likelihood of burnout here is also very high.  Therefore, if there is a desire to save your money and not lose it, then you should focus on indicators in the region of 20-30 percent.  Then there will be a low probability of losses, besides that, it will be insured, and by the end of the term solid capital will be collected. </p><p>  To avoid falling into the hands of scammers, you should always ask about where the money is invested, ask for supporting documentation, and, of course, check it through other channels.  You should also carefully study the investment life insurance contract, and if in doubt, consult a third-party lawyer (preferably not from across the street from the company). </p><h2>  Features in the Russian Federation </h2>

    <p>  Let's talk with an example about investment <span>life insurance.</span>  <span>Sberbank</span>  The profitability of one of the largest representatives of this type of service in the Russian Federation allows you to increase real, not nominal capital, up to 15 percent per year.  Of course, this is in the optimal perspective.  It may be such that it gives an increase of only 5%, but this is already an increase. </p><p>  It is worth noting that <span>the investment</span> life insurance <span>program</span> is still designed for quite significant amounts.  So, you need to save at least 3 months of income on the deposit in order for the application to be considered. </p><p>  Why is there such an inconvenient restriction?  The fact is that the market is constantly experiencing periods of growth and decline.  And the likelihood of catching luck exists in the medium term.  And for this you need to wait.  And working with small amounts and deposits in such cases is extremely inconvenient. </p><h2>  What is the opinion of people about this? </h2>

    <p>  So, we already know a lot about investment life insurance.  Reviews will complement the existing picture.  If you look at the information presented on the Internet, then most people evaluate this financial toolbox positively. </p><p>  First of all, they mention insurance.  After that there are flattering reviews about many investment programs of specialized companies.  So, they further break down their customers ‚Äôinvestments into several parts.  One goes to very reliable investments like precious metals, the other - to the shares of companies that operate successfully, the third - to securities with increased (slightly) risk and profitability. </p><p>  Preferential taxation is also noted.  So, in the Russian Federation, taxes are levied only on that part of the income that exceeds the Central Bank refinancing rate. </p><p>  Of course, many recall that there are risks.  First of all, you should strive for the tenth road to bypass scammers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

As a result of the improvement of what is, investment life insurance has arisen.  This approach allows you to maximize the benefits for all enterprises that do this.  But you should not concentrate on something alone and in one company.  Well, if the money is dispersed in two or three organizations.  And even better - if their number is about five to six.
