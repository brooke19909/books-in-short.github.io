Lomonosov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of where Lomonosov studied was likely to cause bewilderment of the current generation.  Meanwhile, he is far from idle.  Now that young people are seeing an increase in interest in the past of their country, it will not be shameful to recall their great sons.  After all, history is known to be made by people. </p><p>  Mikhailo Vasilievich was born in the Arkhangelsk North.  Lomonosov did not leave behind his autobiography or memoirs, and therefore it is not known exactly how his childhood and youth passed.  It is only known that he was left without a mother early.  Father (a good man, but, according to the memoirs of Lomonosov himself ‚Äúbrought up in extreme ignorance‚Äù) married a couple of times, and his third darling became an evil stepmother for 9-year-old Misha. </p><p>  <span>The</span> boy received <span>primary education</span> from a local clerk S.N.Sabelnikova.  The child‚Äôs passion for books hardened the already unkind stepmother, as a result, life in his father‚Äôs house became unbearable.  Wanting to study, secretly from his father in 1730 with a convoy he went to Moscow.  It is unlikely that any of his companions could have suggested that the guy walking nearby would be called the luminary of Russian science.  Let‚Äôs talk about where Lomonosov, the first Russian world-famous natural scientist, encyclopedist, astronomer, chemist and physicist, poet, philologist, geologist, metallurgist, artist, historian and genealogist, studied. </p>

    <h2>  Granite science </h2><p>  There were many obstacles to his admission to school; he even had to impersonate the son of a Kholmogory nobleman.  Be that as it may, the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy nevertheless accepted young Pomors.  Mikhail Vasilievich was older than all school students, and therefore constantly suffered ridicule from his younger comrades.  However, neither adversity, nor other people's attacks repelled the desire to learn.  Lomonosov immediately showed his extraordinary abilities.  He was distinguished by perseverance and perseverance, for the year he passed the program of three classes.  He enthusiastically read chronicles, patristics and other theological books taken in the library of <span>Zaikonospassky monastery.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1734, Mikhail went to Kiev and spent several months within the walls of the Kiev-Mohyla Academy. </p><p>  In 1736, the school leadership was ordered to choose the best student to study at the university at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.  Given the abilities of Mikhail Vasilyevich, the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy chooses him.  And then what?  What was his future fate?  Where did Lomonosov study further? </p>

    <p>  According to one version, the theological career of the future great scientist was cut short, and did not even have time to begin, since the story with the forgery of documents was revealed.  As a result, the ordination did not take place, but a capable seminarist was sent to the field of natural science. </p><p>  Under the guidance of V.E. Adodurov, he began to study mathematics, and he became acquainted with experimental physics from Professor G.V. Kraft, and independently studied versification.  According to the testimony of early biographers, during this rather short period of study at the St. Petersburg Academy, Lomonosov ‚Äúlistened to the initial foundations of philosophy and mathematics and was very eager to do this, practicing the poem in the meantime, but nothing came out of his last works.  Excellent was the tendency towards experimental physics, chemistry and mineralogy. ‚Äù </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to biographical data, in the same 1736 he was sent from St. Petersburg to master mining in Germany.  In addition to the declared training, Lomonosov strengthened his knowledge of the German language, studied French and Italian, dancing, drawing and fencing.  I got acquainted with the works of philosophers.  There is no detailed information about how and where Lomonosov studied during this period.  There are records that he spent three years in Marburg.  There he met his beloved teacher <span>Christian Wolf, and</span> there he met his future wife.  Russian students quickly made friends with German classmates.  Together they hosted youth feasts and parties.  However, the purposeful Lomonosov spent his scholarship on books and an apartment.  For him, always in the first place was study and science. </p><h2>  The first scientific steps in the homeland </h2><p>  In 1741, Lomonosov returned to Russia and began working at the Academy of Sciences.  In 1745, he had already become a professor of chemistry and an academician.  MV Lomonosov conducts scientific and literary activities.  In an effort to develop domestic science, Mikhailo Vasilievich is seeking the opening of the country's first university.  And now this Moscow university bears his name. </p><p>  Lomonosov himself was a unique scientist who owns outstanding discoveries in completely different fields of knowledge: astronomy, physics, chemistry, linguistics and literature. </p>

    <h2>  Literary activity of Lomonosov </h2><p>  While working on works in the field of exact sciences, Mikhailo Vasilievich did not forget about Russian speech.  He created a new Russian grammar, brought together spoken and literary languages.  Its contribution to the development of linguistics is difficult to overestimate.  To streamline the literary language, he proposed limiting the influence of Church Slavonic, as well as many foreign words, replacing them with expressions of native speech. </p><p>  Lomonosov suggested using three styles - low, mediocre and high.  High should be used when writing odes, holiday speeches, heroic poems.  The average style is acceptable for friendly correspondence.  But the low was suitable for creating comedy, writing epigrams and songs.  Here, the use of colloquial vocabulary was easily allowed.  So Lomonosov harmoniously combined the old and the new.  His literary and poetic works had a huge impact on the further development of the Russian language and literature. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  This man possessed deep knowledge in the field of exact sciences, spoke several European languages.  Natural genius allowed Lomonosov to lay the foundation of Russian technical terminology.  The rules formulated by him in this area are of great application at the present time.  Often people, especially today's youth, do not even realize that many scientific terms proposed by scientists are used today.  Take, for example, the words that are now heard by everyone: specific gravity, movement, experiments, the axis of the Earth ... </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, very little is known about the personal life of Lomonosov, his wife and children.  Almost all sources talk more about his scientific activities.  Lomonosov‚Äôs life was entirely devoted to science.  Even in his odes, he called for labor and development of science for the good of the Fatherland. </p>
