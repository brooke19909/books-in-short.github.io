Since then, choosing a game for hanging out in the company of friends, people are not limited to banal checkers, cards and dominoes.  And what is still known about this type of entertainment, like a board role-playing game, we learn from the article. </p><h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  Reading a fantastic book, we involuntarily plunge into a story invented by someone, we represent ourselves as the main character.  Sometimes one wants to gain a magical gift, fight dragons, go into space and explore the galaxy.  Many people have their favorite character, in the image of which he would like to visit.  Board <span>role-playing games</span> allow you to plunge into a fictional world, compose your story, create any scenario and have fun. </p><p>  It all starts with the choice of a host who comes up with the plot, stages, tasks and goals of a fun pastime, although you can play according to a ready-made scenario.  Each participant in a fun undertaking chooses a character for himself, characterizes him, endows him with special qualities.  The host announces where the events take place, who surrounds the main characters, who needs to fight and with whom. </p><p>  However, each board-based story-based role-playing game has a number of specific rules, due to which the game goal is achieved.  Otherwise, everyone would be a winner and it would be uninteresting to play.  For this purpose, we came up with various role-playing systems - rules and a certain framework for each game, thanks to which there remains excitement and interest.  Game attributes (for example, dice) do not always indicate the number of moves, the values ‚Äã‚Äãdropped can be answers to the question - did the bullet injure the hero or did he remain unharmed?  Did the villain catch the princess or was the knight saving her?  In more complex games, you need to calculate ahead moves, negotiate, arrange tenders and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The opinion that such entertainment is only for children is wrong.  New board role-playing games, the assortment of which is very wide today, is quite capable of occupying an adult for the evening.  Consider the most popular and sought after of them. </p>

    <h2>  "Mafia" </h2><p>  This board role-playing game is designed for 8-12 people.  Each of them takes a card on which his role is indicated.  Basically it is a doctor, a sheriff, a maniac, 2 mafiosi and civilians.  By the rules, when night falls in a fictional world, everyone falls asleep.  At this time, the mafia wakes up, gets acquainted and chooses a victim.  It happens that the healer saves the victim.  The basic rule is silence! </p><p>  When choosing a victim, everything happens without words and rustles, so that civilians do not immediately figure out the mafiosi.  In the next round, the chief mafiosi must guess the sheriff, then the sheriff tries to figure out the mafiosi.  They take turns pointing the presenter at the suspect, as a positive answer, the presenter nods his head.  The next morning, someone dies, and the residents of the city, led by the sheriff, are trying to identify the killer.  Each player tries to make excuses, invents a legend for himself, then by voting they remove those who are under suspicion.  There are times when the mafia can not decide on the choice of the victim, then the leader counts the miss and civilians do not die this night.  The main intrigue of the game is who will defeat the mafia or civilians? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board role-playing rules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2089194.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  "Imaginary" </h2><p>  The rules of the board role-playing game are very simple.  There is no permanent presenter.  A new participant is selected for each round.  The player draws a card where the word is written, the phrase, or the picture is drawn.  He needs to explain to the participants as much as possible within one minute what is written / depicted on the card, but the word itself cannot be called.  You can use gestures, ideas, a story.  A guessed player gets points, and it is his turn to explain. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board story role-playing games" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61436/2080775.jpg"></div>  "Treasure map" </h2><p>  This game is more likely to be for children, however, if you come up with an interesting plot, then it can captivate adults as well.  First you need to draw a map, in the center of it is a treasure and many paths that lead to it.  On the way there are various traps, forcing players to retreat, return to the beginning, skip a move, or, conversely, receive additional moves or move several cells forward.  This idea is designed for 4 players, the number of moves is decided by dice.  The one who first got to the treasure wins.  If there is no desire to fantasize, then you can buy a ready-made card and play on it. </p>

    <h2>  "Who am I (What am I)?" </h2><p>  This is a very funny game.  Its essence is that players cling to the head of the tablet where the names of animals, inanimate objects, names of celebrities can be written.  The player does not see what kind of plate he has, but he sees the plates of other players.  Everyone in turn asks a question, for example: "Am I female?"  Others answer him.  These leading questions need to guess who the participant is in the framework of this game.  In the store you can buy a set of plates, but making such a board role-playing game with your own hands will not be difficult.  It is only necessary to make cards with different names on self-adhesive paper and prepare hoops for the required number of players. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board role-playing games" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61436/2080692.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  "Dead Season" </h2><p>  Events unfold in a post-apocalypse setting where surviving people break up into companies and try to reach the finals by completing group tasks.  It all starts with the fact that players choose their characters, enter the community.  However, each of them receives his own individual task, by completing which you can become a winner.  Everything is secret, if someone is suspected of treason, they can kick him out of the group.  Thus, the player loses. </p><p>  In the game, there are zombies who are trying to destroy the survivors, there are uprisings of communities, overcome diseases, hunger, accidents are possible.  Each group must jointly fight all troubles, but also not to forget about their secret missions.  It is impossible to calculate the moves ahead, so you will have to solve problems as they arise.  For the move, the player selects a map where the event is indicated and its solutions.  The actions of each participant are decided by dice.  The more people in the company of people, the faster trouble can be overcome.  For a successful outcome, the colony receives points. </p><p>  Do not forget that for every hero of the "Dead Season" you need to spend food.  If she is missing, the character dies.  For this, points are removed from the company, and the chance to win is reduced.  To carry out tasks and fight crises, you have to find various objects, find a common language with the inhabitants, fight zombies, choose the outcome of an event.  Usually there are several solutions, but not all of them will give a positive result.  The outcome of the game is unpredictable, the winner can be a whole community or an individual player.  It is possible that the winner will not be at all. </p>
