    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Green Peace Hotel Alanya 3 * refers to small hotel complexes, it contains only eighty-five rooms.  Despite the fact that the hotel has three stars, it is highly appreciated by our compatriots.  In addition, they consider it the most suitable in terms of price and quality, which is very important when planning a budget trip. </p><p>  Built Green Peace 3 * (Turkey) was in the early nineties of the last century and worked for a very long time without renovation.  However, over time, the buildings dilapidated, and the rooms began to need updating.  Therefore, a year ago, the hotel complex carried out repair work, which had a positive effect on its rating among Mahmutlar hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is approximately eleven thousand square meters.  According to tourists, the whole territory is surrounded by greenery.  She is very clean and well-groomed, and bright flowers delight all guests with their beauty. </p><p>  Green Peace Hotel Alanya 3 * is one six-story complex, in which rooms and a restaurant are located.  Almost all apartments in the hotel complex are classified as standard. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  The location of the hotel complex is always important for vacationers.  The hotel is approximately five hundred meters from the small resort village of Mahmutlar.  Alanya (Turkey) is located nine kilometers from the hotel.  This distance cannot be an obstacle for those who want to see the sights of the city or go on a sea excursion.  They often depart precisely from the marina of Alanya. </p><p>  However, keep in mind that most Mahmutlar hotels are very far from the international airport.  Our hotel complex is no exception to the general rule, it is from Antalya, where tourists from Russia fly to, separated by more than one hundred and thirty kilometers.  Therefore, get ready that the road to <span>Mahmutlar (Alanya / Turkey)</span> will take you several hours.  In addition, along the way, the bus will bring other tourists to hotels, which will further increase the time spent on the road. </p>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Green Peace Hotel Alanya 3 * has its own beach, consisting of sand and pebbles.  It is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, but beach towels are not provided at the hotel.  The sea in the coastal zone is very clean and transparent.  However, the entrance to the water is very inconvenient, on the way of tourists there are large slippery slabs.  In windy weather, bathing becomes extremely dangerous and can cause injuries to tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many write in their reviews that it is worth buying special shoes for the beach.  Without it, you risk injuring your legs and ruining your vacation. </p><h2>  Green Peace 3 *: service </h2><p>  For three stars, the service in the hotel complex is provided at a high level.  Guests enjoy free Wi-Fi.  It works throughout the hotel complex, however, Green Peace 3 * guests (Turkey / Mahmutlar) often write that not all rooms have a stable signal.  In some apartments, it barely allows you to access the Internet, so guests have to go down to the restaurant or sit out in the lobby at the reception. </p><p>  For an additional fee, the hotel will clean up dirty things.  They will be given to the laundry or dry cleaning, and then carefully hung in the closet. </p><p>  If you need the help of a doctor, then know that he is always in place.  A professional health professional will quickly examine you and prescribe the necessary medicines that can be purchased at a pharmacy or on site. </p>

    <h2>  Talk about entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel complex has something to entertain yourself in your free time from swimming.  First of all, do not forget about the work of animators.  Every day they try to make the rest of the guests more eventful and interesting.  In addition, the hotel staff can always be contacted for help in organizing excursions.

Often bicycles are rented, it is very convenient to inspect the surroundings on warm Turkish evenings. </p><h2>  What to do on vacation with children? </h2><p>  Most tourists prefer to relax in Turkey with children.

Kids can also spend time in a separate section of the large pool.  Here, children do not interfere with adults, but are under their vigilant supervision. </p><p>  If necessary, the restaurant will bring guests high chairs, but a children's menu is not provided.

    <h2>  Rules for staying with children </h2><p>  The hotel can be accommodated with a child of any age.  Children under the age of six, sharing the same bed with parents, can stay in the hotel complex absolutely free.  The same rule applies to babies up to two years of age who are provided with an extra bed.  There is no need to pay extra for their placement. </p><p>  If your child is from seven to twelve years old, then for him you will need to pay half of the cost of living an adult.  Older children staying in an extra bed will cost about seventy percent of the cost of a room for one adult tourist. </p><p>  If necessary, one extra bed or two childrens beds can be installed in one room.  This service is not included in the total cost of living, therefore it is paid at check-out by a separate bill. </p><h2>  Some nuances of checking into a hotel </h2><p>  Please note that pets are not allowed in the hotel complex.  They are best left with relatives or friends. </p><p>  Check-in takes place at two in the afternoon, if you have free apartments you can be settled a little earlier.  However, as tourists say, this is extremely rare.  There are cases when our compatriots got into their room after three in the afternoon.  Check out from the apartment until noon. </p><p>  If you have booked a hotel online, in some cases it will be impossible to cancel your reservation.  Therefore, be careful when planning an independent trip. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel complex operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Guests eat in the main and only restaurant of the hotel.  However, restaurant reviews about Green Peace 3 *, left by our compatriots, are very different.  There is a feeling that guests are secretly divided into two categories.  Some are absolutely dissatisfied with food and call it unworthy even of ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù.  Such tourists write that meat is rarely served in a restaurant, and if it appears on tables, it is far from the best quality.  Of all meat dishes, the cook succeeds only those that are prepared from chicken.  The same problem with baking.  It does not differ in variety, and if we talk about quality and taste, many vacationers do not even know what it can be compared with.  In general, they were satisfied only with fresh vegetables and fruits, to which no complaints were made. </p><p>  But guests from another group write that the dishes at the hotel are cooked at home.  Of course, they also note that the food can hardly be called luxurious, but still it is quite varied and tasty.  Satisfied tourists also say that dinner every day is accompanied by live music, and tables are greeted by hungry vacationers with utterly polished dishes and crystal-white tablecloths.  Waiters serve guests almost instantly and with an invariable smile on their faces. </p>

    <h2>  Green Peace 3 *: room description </h2><p>  We already mentioned at the beginning of the article that almost all rooms in the hotel complex are standard.  Their area does not exceed twenty squares, and three adults can accommodate here. </p><p>  All rooms are equipped identically.  They are equipped with a safe, individual air conditioning, telephone and satellite TV.  The floors in the apartments are covered with ceramic tiles, the same coverage is on the balcony. </p><p>  Bathrooms include a shower and hairdryer.  Rooms are cleaned daily; towels are changed as often.  However, not all room reviews are positive.  Some guests complain of poor sound insulation, dirt and not entirely new bedding.  It happens that tourists were accommodated in rooms with an unpleasant smell, which could not be eliminated even after a long airing.  Many rooms have views of the sea and green areas.  Hotel guests are advised to choose those apartments that overlook the courtyard.  They are the most quiet and calm. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the hotel is quite good for budget travelers who are economical about money.  For a small amount they get a nice room, good service and the opportunity to swim in the gentle waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  If this is your main goal, then feel free to choose this hotel for a relaxing holiday with the whole family. </p>
