    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not only positive moments are characterized by the rest at the Sun Siyan Iru Fushi Maldives hotel.  The reviews indicate a number of significant shortcomings, among which it is especially worth noting: </p><ul><li>  the attitude of the staff towards the tourists is slightly cool; </li><li>  the maids do the cleaning very quickly, which naturally affects its quality (despite the tip); </li><li>  because of the stone breakwater around the island, the coral reef is badly damaged, and therefore it will not be possible to see many fish and underwater beauties during snorkeling; </li><li>  places in restaurants are booked in advance, and therefore it will not work every night to visit a new institution (you also have to reserve a place for the entire stay); </li><li>  the villas are very close to each other, and therefore there is no sense of privacy;  there are always a lot of people in the territory; </li><li>  overpriced food prices in restaurants (especially on holidays); </li><li>  the main restaurant mainly offers Asian cuisine, which not everyone will like; </li><li>  slow waiters; </li><li>  in houses the smell of the sewerage is periodically felt; </li><li>  maids rarely change bedding; </li><li>  many mosquitoes; </li><li>  evening entertainment ends early enough when no one else wants to sleep; </li><li>  in the villas that are located on the beach, there is no privacy, since there are always a large number of people who strive to look at your territory; </li><li>  the hotel does not solve the problem of insects and rats; </li><li>  ashore periodically makes a large number of plastic bottles, bags and other vital products of tourists; </li><li>  there is no special pier for airplanes, and therefore they fly directly to the island, which is unsafe for vacationers, and also creates a lot of noise; </li><li>  poor wireless internet signal; </li><li>  the hotel is constantly being renovated, and therefore it is very uncomfortable to be in houses that are not far from the marina; </li><li>  near the villas there are no bathtubs to wash your feet from sand (in order not to carry dirt in the room, you have to water your feet from plastic bottles). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Travelers have already had a definite impression of The Sun Siyam Iru Fushi Maldives hotel.  Reviews of tourists are quite diverse, but on their basis certain conclusions can be drawn.  Those who have visited this hotel more than once, note that recently the quality of service has slightly deteriorated.  This is not surprising, because the hotel is quite old, and the prices for accommodation are among the lowest.  Nevertheless, the sea and magnificent nature do their job.  Despite the minor flaws in the <span>hotel, the Maldives</span> leaves the most positive impression. </p>
