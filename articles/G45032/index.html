All Inclusive L Rate: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Beeline company is one of the leaders <span>in the</span> Russian <span>cellular market</span> .  Tariff offers from this operator are presented in a wide range.  One of the most popular lines is All Inclusive.  What are its features?  What are the specifics of the evolution of tariffs in this line?  What services within the framework of this offer is it particularly beneficial to use? </p><h2>  Features of the tariff line </h2><p>  The features of the Beeline All-Inclusive tariff line are that the operator provides subscribers with the opportunity to use communication services in a comprehensive format as part of a monthly fee.  That is, the services included in the tariff (voice, SMS, mobile Internet) would be more expensive if each subscriber bought separately.  For example, the Beeline tariff ‚Äú <span>All Inclusive L‚Äù</span> in one of the very first versions suggested that for a monthly fee of <span>500 rubles</span> per month (Moscow region), a user would be able, firstly, to talk 300 minutes when calling any operator‚Äôs numbers, firstly secondly, write as many SMS and MMS as you like and, thirdly, download up to 600 megabytes of data from the Internet - without speed limits.  The only thing that perhaps should be noted is that there is not too much of the specified amount of Internet traffic, even if you use the network from a mobile device.  Therefore, this type of tariff is calculated more likely for users who do not have a special need for online resources. </p>

    <p>  Our thesis regarding the limited adaptability of Beeline All-inclusive tariffs to the Internet can confirm the following fact.  Another offer of the line - XXL - suggests that for 1000 rubles of subscription (Moscow region) a person will receive 900 minutes of calls, an unlimited number of messages, however, the amount of prepaid online traffic at full access speed will not change - 600 megabytes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transition is not free </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that switching to Beeline <span>All Inclusive from</span> other operator tariffs may not be free (although it is possible that the company's policy may change over time).  In this case, the amount on the balance sheet must exceed that which is required to be paid upon transition. </p><h2>  The goal is optimization </h2><p>  Top managers of the operator also spoke about the features of tariffs of the Beeline line of All Inclusive.  In particular, in one of the statements it was noted: the goal of introducing the tariff is to provide customers with the opportunity to use several services at the same time within the framework of optimal prices.  At the same time, the proposals were allegedly arranged in such a way that, by default, clients should not experience the need to connect any additional options.  To the tariffs of the line in question, both individuals and organizations can connect. </p>

    <p>  The specifics of the monthly fee of the type "All inclusive": the amount is debited by the day (with a prepaid system, in other cases - monthly).  In some configurations (for example, when concluding an annual contract), subscribers can receive a significant discount on the use of services.  But!  If a person did not spend some minutes during a billing period (say, a month), then they will not be carried over to the next. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tariff: prepaid or postpaid? </h2><p>  We said above that subscribers have two options for connecting to line tariffs.  The first is prepayment.  Its essence is that communication services are provided by the operator with a positive balance in the account.  The second option is postpay.  When using this format, the availability of funds plays a secondary role - all expenses can be compensated later, based on the invoice issued by the company.  Which of the two options for applying the tariff for the All-Inclusive line can be more profitable? </p><h2>  Imaginary cheapness </h2><p>  The opinions of experts on this subject are mixed.  However, analysts say - everything is very individual.  As for the benefits in absolute terms (that is, calculated on the basis of the ratio of costs to received services), postpaid tariffs, as a rule, look preferable.  Actually, the Beeline company, as we already noted above, is inclined to configure its offers in this way - at a discount in case of postpaid registration.  There is another side to the benefits.  The fact is that not all subscribers manage to accurately monitor their expenses on cellular communications.  And therefore, the invoice sent by the company at the end of the month can be quite impressive, but at the same time in many cases smaller than if a person used the prepaid system.  An unexpected "overspending" often occurs, for example, when using the Internet - when a subscriber simply forgets to leave a mobile browser, and data continues to be downloaded from online. </p>

    <p>  Some prefer a compromise option - use "auto payment" with a prepaid system.  That is, if the funds on the balance run out, replenishment occurs automatically from a bank card or electronic wallet - most operators allow this to be done, and Beeline tariffs are no exception: reviews by many subscribers confirm that such a system works without failures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, there are a large number of users who prefer the postpaid option for various reasons.  Beeline tariffs "All inclusive XL, XXL" and more "younger" of their "brothers" allow you to use this format of interaction of the subscriber with the operator. </p><h2>  Rates </h2><p>  We will study specific examples of tariffs offered by Beeline as part of the line in question.  In the spectrum of such - sentences indexed by letters from M to XXL, probably by analogy with the size of clothes.  Unites all tariffs, as we have said, the principle of the merger of various, potentially expensive, services.  Moreover, in aggregate, they turn out to be cheaper than if each of them were used separately.  The exception is perhaps the Internet, the volume of which, subject to full access speed, is not too much. </p><h2>  From the youngest to the oldest </h2><p>  The ‚Äúyoungest‚Äù line tariff is ‚ÄúAll inclusive M‚Äù.  The monthly fee for it in some regions is 300 rubles.  per month.  In return, the client receives 150 minutes of calls (any local operators) and 30 SMS.  It turns out that you can talk on average about 5 minutes a day and send 1 message.  The Internet, as we have already said, in unlimited (and with traffic up to 600 megabytes - also at high speed) format is attached. </p>

    <p>  The next "seniority" tariff "Beeline" - "All inclusive L".  The monthly fee for it in one of the regional configurations is twice as much as for the previous offer - 600 rubles.  per month.  This, by the way, is more than in the "Moscow" subtype noted by us at the very beginning of the article - there are 500 rubles.  True, more minutes are given than when doubling twice - 360, which is equal to about 12 calls per day (per minute).  But SMS and MMS can be written as much as you like. </p><p>  The tariff "Beeline" "All inclusive XL", which operated for some time in the Perm Territory, offered subscribers for 540 rubles.  900 minutes of calls per month, unlimited messages and unlimited Internet.  It is interesting that in the same region at the same time with this service the tariff ‚ÄúAll inclusive. Unlimited‚Äù was also in effect.  For it, for 840 rubles per month, the subscriber received an unlimited number of local calls, as well as calls to Beeline numbers in other regions.  Messages could also be sent as many as you want.  Internet traffic was also decent - 1.5 GB before the speed limit. </p>

    <p>  The XXL tariff was already considered at the beginning of the article (in its Moscow version).  In the regions, in principle, the ratio of the size of the monthly fee and the minutes provided is similar.  In some cases, Beeline may offer not ordinary line tariffs.  These include, for example, such an offer as All-Inclusive-Super, which is quite advantageous, as many experts consider, for travelers.  In one of the regional modifications, this tariff involves several thousand minutes of calls and free Internet when traveling around Russia. </p><h2>  Luxury option </h2><p>  You can also note the <span>Beeline tariff plan "</span> All-inclusive L-Suite" in one of the versions.  Within the framework of the corresponding offer, the subscriber can, having paid 6500 rubles, use more than 4 thousand minutes of calls during the year, send more than 36 thousand SMS, any number of MMS.  And most importantly - the conditions for using the Internet, this tariff suggests significantly more favorable than in many other offers of the line - 2 GB per month without speed limit. </p>

    <p>  We see how wide the range of conditions is that offers us within the framework of the tariff line and ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù Beeline: 300 rubles, 500, 6500 - all for the needs of users of various categories. </p><h2>  Budget format </h2><p>  Experts note that in many regions there are tendencies for the annual reduction in the cost of the relevant proposals of the operator.  The line is over 3 years old.  Today there are regions where the price of some Beeline All Inclusive tariffs is 150 rubles.  As a rule, this applies to proposals of type M, however, as we have determined above, the number of minutes that is included in this monthly fee may be quite enough for customers who do not talk on the phone very often. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews regarding the tariff line are generally positive.  And this, taking into account a rather extensive geography, where Beeline introduced its all-inclusive offer: Moscow, the Urals, and other regions.  Among the possible minuses of tariffs, as noted by subscribers, are local calls, which are included in the monthly fee.  However, as some users believe, offers within this line-up are well combined with additional options from the operator.  Moreover, even with the most budget ones - like the option where the monthly fee for the tariff "Beeline" "All inclusive" - ‚Äã‚Äã150 rubles.  By connecting the appropriate options, you can provide fairly inexpensive long-distance calls. </p>

    <p>  Some subscribers advise paying attention to additional conditions when choosing the tariff for the All-Inclusive line.  In particular, it may turn out that the fee for switching from the current service to a new one will be higher than what is currently available.  That is, making changes to your account, you should immediately before this procedure familiarize yourself with the most relevant information on the All Inclusive line. </p><h2>  Do not overpay for exclusive </h2><p>  Another caveat: in some regions, the service of linking to the federal mobile number of the city number is popular.  This service is especially widespread in the capital: <span>Beeline (Moscow)</span> provides <span>tariffs</span> with the corresponding opportunity in a wide range.  It includes the all-inclusive line.  The fact is that the monthly fee for using a city number can be substantial.  Often, it exceeds Beeline‚Äôs ‚Äúyounger‚Äù mobile tariffs.  Therefore, when studying relevant information from the operator, special attention should be paid to additional conditions for using the number. </p><h2>  Tariff Evolution </h2><p>  As we noted above, the Beeline All Inclusive line is periodically updated.  Changes at the same time in the same tariffs can be significant.  It happens that a particular offer rises in price.  For example, one of the tariffs of the line - ‚ÄúAll for 300‚Äù became more expensive, its price rose from 300 to 390 rubles in August 2014.  Then, by the way, the same offer appeared for 150 rubles, about which we spoke above. </p><h2>  Competitors in action </h2><p>  Experts note that both the regional offices of the operator and Beeline - Moscow - continue to design tariffs for the All Inclusive line according to the principle: more services for less cost each.  Analysts also noticed an interesting trend - the reduction in price of intranet packets.  We can say that a certain course has been taken for their free.  In many respects, experts say, Beeline's policy reflects changes in the mobile communications market.  In particular, the All-Inclusive tariff has a full competitor of the same name from Megafon in very similar price segments.  The Beeline policy in some manifestations has competitive advantages, analysts say.  For example, when a subscriber calls to other numbers of this operator, tariffing is carried out separately relative to the package of minutes, which is designed for off-net calls.  For some other mobile providers, on the contrary, on-net calls that are supposed to be the cheapest or even free are included in the prepaid minutes package.  However, in the conditions of using the tariff, other operators can indicate a larger number of prepaid calls (formally this will be completely true) and thereby incline the choice of the subscriber in their favor. </p><h2>  Intercity for the subscriber </h2><p>  Among the special advantages of the tariff line, experts note low-cost long-distance calls - this applies even to the most low-cost service options.  Analysts also consider a daily subscription fee to be a significant advantage - provided that the client has connected on a prepaid basis. </p>
