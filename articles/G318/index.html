The concepts of service, entertainment, food, excellent natural and climatic resources, lack of visas, established charter and regular air supply further contribute to the increase in tourist flows to the territory of Turkey. </p><p>  <span>Especially popular among Slavic tourists is the resort region of Alanya.</span>  <span>It will be discussed in the article.</span> <span><br></span> </p><h2>  Alanya as a resort area: location, features, advantages </h2><p>  Alanya is a very pleasant, atmospheric and cozy area on the Mediterranean <span>coast of Turkey.</span>  The only drawback of Alanya can be considered its remoteness from the airport of Antalya, which accepts most tourist charters.  But this nuance will soon be corrected, after the local Alanya Gazipasa airport is completed and begins to receive international flights. </p>

    <p>  Currently, the road to Alanya from Antalya is 90-150 km.  It takes about two and a half to three hours in time, which is not so small after flights, with stops and landings near hotels. </p><p>  All other characteristics of Alanya as a resort are very positive.  This is the most budgetary and democratic region of Turkey, the Turks themselves often relax here.  Operators advise planning a trip at any convenient time, but not immediately after the end of Ramadan, because at that time Alanya is a kingdom of locals who behave much more cheeky than the most daring Tagil, and hotels at this time begin to sharply reduce their assortment by buffets to save. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you choose from the southern resorts of Turkey, then Alanya and Kemer are the Russians themselves.  In hotels and even in shopping centers, locals who are not averse to making money are perfectly spoken in Russian, and the service is perfectly focused just on the needs of our compatriots (animation, show programs, a mini-club for children, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù). </p><h2>  Hotel Oba Star Hotel Spa 4 * (Alanya, Obagol).  general information </h2><p>  This cozy resort is located 120 km from Antalya Airport, near the center of Alanya in the village of Obagol, on the first coastline.  The hotel was built in 1989, and in 2010 the complex was overhauled, renovated and rebranded. </p><p>  The complex consists of one main building on five floors and a 5-storey building Anex. </p><p>  Check-in takes place after 14:00, you need to return the number on the day of departure until 12:00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oba Star Hotel Spa 4 Reviews" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/2002504.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel rooms, according to reviews, are quite cramped.  But all of them are of the same category and have the same equipment, this eliminates the possibility of tourist discontent with the fact that ‚Äúneighbors have more rooms‚Äù for the same price. </p><p>  The road to the beach is short and comfortable, but the tourists themselves did not praise the beach with enthusiasm, or rather the beach itself is good, clean and well-maintained, but the entrance to the sea is uncomfortable and sometimes rocky. </p><p>  Reviews about the hotel Oba Star Hotel SPA 4 * are quite adequate, tourists note the pros and cons of the location and service of the hotel, taking into account its budget. </p>
