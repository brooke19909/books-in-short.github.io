A lot of various entertainments, fascinating attractions and animations for young visitors, delicious cuisine from the chefs of local restaurants and cafes make visiting the entertainment center a real holiday.

    <p>  The pools of the water park are filled with water that has passed a multi-stage cleaning system using the most modern technologies developed by the German company Best Water Technology.  The complex cleaning process does not stop even for a minute, and visitors leave enthusiastic reviews about the Caribia water park as one of the cleanest water areas of the city. </p><h2>  For extreme, adults and small </h2><p>  The guests of the center are waiting for <span>water slides of</span> varying complexity.  Caribia is a water park where every visitor, regardless of age, can experience his courage.  Here are a few slides: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúFree fall‚Äù is a slide with a small, 25‚Å∞ angle of inclination and a smooth descent, which is great for those who feel not very confident on the rides. </li><li>  The Black Hole is a winding tunnel 9 meters high and more than 8 meters long.  This is an attraction for daredevils who are not afraid of enclosed space. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBodyslide‚Äù is a slide over 8 m high, with bizarre trajectories for lovers of high-speed descents. </li><li>  Multislide is a slide for everyone to enjoy.

Several ethnic bathhouses are open here, each of which in its own way has a rejuvenating and healing effect on the human body. </p><ul><li>  You can relieve tension and stress, which are inevitable for residents of a metropolis, in a Russian bathhouse or <span>Finnish sauna,</span> alternating a steam room with a cool font or shower. </li><li>  <span>O-Furo Japanese Bath</span> helps to maximize relaxation and strengthen the cardiovascular and nervous systems. </li><li>  A Turkish hammam will best prepare the body for subsequent cosmetic procedures. </li><li>  In ancient Rome, the terms were an important part of society.
