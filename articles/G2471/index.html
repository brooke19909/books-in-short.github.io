Not far from the largest lake, only seven kilometers away, there are several wonderful ponds.  They are located at the foot of the mountains.  Their official name is Quarry, but locals call them ‚ÄúWarm Lakes‚Äù.  On Baikal you can meet many inexplicable phenomena, and these reservoirs are one of them.  The Lakes Teply are not called by chance.  In the summer season, the water in them is almost hot, the temperature reaches 28 degrees.  This uniqueness is easy to explain - the lakes are fed by underwater warm springs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warm lakes on Baikal" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1159637.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, what water bodies are included in the complex ‚ÄúWarm Lakes on Lake Baikal‚Äù?  First of all, it is the Emerald (one of the largest), the Tale and the Dead.  Although they are located nearby, however, they do not have connected channels.  The water in each of them is completely different, which gives the reservoirs a special uniqueness.  Scientists have found only one explanation: apparently, the reason lies in the chemical composition of the soil and underwater sources. </p><h2>  Emerald Lake </h2><p>  The reservoir with such a beautiful name is the largest of the three representing the Warm Lakes on Lake Baikal.  Its maximum depth is about 47 meters.  The emerald lake is quite widely known among tourists and fishing enthusiasts.  Along the coastline are <span>recreation centers</span> with cozy clean rooms.  Fishermen come here to enjoy sitting with a fishing rod.  And the water world of the lake will not upset them.  In the Emerald are pike, perches, carps and other species.  Even in winter there is no shortage of tourists.  Almost everyone wants to try their hand at such an unusual activity as underwater fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on Baikal warm lakes" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1159638.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourism is not developed in these parts, as it is very difficult to approach the water.  Only on one side is there a mound of stones that can be used to get to the coastal zone.  However, the surrounding nature of these places deserves attention.  It can be called virgin and untouched by time.  Dense thickets of poplars mixed with rare plants that have been preserved since primitive times.  The trunks of the trees are so large that even five adults are not enough to grab them.  It is this unique nature that attracts tourists to visit these lands. </p><h2>  Fairy Tale Lake </h2><p>  Fairy tale lake with a shallow depth of not more than 2 meters.  Marshy peaty shores.  There are no fish in the local waters, since in winter the lake completely freezes.  Near the lake is a low mountain with a beautiful name - Monomakh hat.  The local attraction is often visited by tourists.  Often tours are organized. </p><h2>  Infrastructure on the territory of the warm lakes </h2><p>  Arriving tourists can spend an organized holiday on Lake Baikal.  Warm lakes are considered a conservation area, so you have to rest a little at a distance.  However, you can go to these places on excursions.  Tourist complexes in the summer season offer vacationers separate houses.  On the picturesque shore of a forest lake there are cottages.  They work all year round.  There is a cottage with 5 comfortable rooms, an excellent kitchen, a games area, with satellite TV, a convenient pier.  Paid parking, catamaran rental, a real Russian bath.  Paid entrance for unregistered tourists.  The mountain of Love is especially popular.  There are many savage tourists in the summer season. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The shore of the Emerald Pond is a protected area, so the tent camp is located on the banks of the Snezhnaya River.
