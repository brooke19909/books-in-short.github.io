    <h2>  Maritime Museum in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  This store has the status of one of the largest in the world.  The maritime museum is one of the oldest in Russia.  Its history begins in 1709, with the Model Camera founded by Peter I.  It was a repository of shipbuilding drawings and structures.  After almost 100 years, in 1805, the collection of exhibits of this Model Camera became the basis of the collection of the Maritime Museum.  After another 103 years, the institution was named after the founder - Emperor Peter the Great.  The museum has been given its modern name since 1924.  Initially, the storage was located in the Main Admiralty.  Then, in 1939, the museum moved to the building formerly the Stock Exchange.  February 1941 was marked by the opening of the exposition in new rooms.  To date, the history of the Russian fleet is graphically presented in 10 halls of the first floor, containing the main exposition of the museum.  Another 3 rooms of the exhibition complex, in which temporary exhibitions of some objects and exhibits from collections of private collections and other repositories are held, are located on the second floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Faberge Museum in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/470308.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  House of the company "Singer" </h2><p>  When visiting interesting places in St. Petersburg, you should definitely visit this building.  It is considered one of the most famous masterpieces of modernist architecture.  The house is located on Nevsky Prospekt.  In 1902-1904, a six-story building with an attic was built in the Art Nouveau style, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 7 thousand square meters.  This building was designed by Pavel Suzor specifically for the Singer company (at that time it was one of the most sought-after architects).  In style, technique and designation, it was an innovative project.  Initially, the leadership of the Singer sewing machine company was to build a skyscraper like the one that was already being built in New York at that time.  It was supposed to be a multi-story building with lots of offices.  However, in the center of the cultural capital, construction was not allowed above 23.5 m (to the eaves).  The architectural proposal of architect P. Suzor was the solution: six floors with an attic end with an elegant tower.  It, in turn, was crowned with a glass globe with a diameter of 280 cm. Thanks to the tower directed towards the sky, the impression of high-altitude is created, however, the lightness of the construction does not overshadow the domes of the Savior on Spilled Blood or Kazan Cathedral towering above Nevsky Prospect. </p><h2>  <span>Garden of paradise</span> birds "Mindo" </h2><p>  When planning a vacation, many family tourists ask themselves: "What to see in St. Petersburg with a child?"  Mindo Bird Garden will give unforgettable sensations to both children and adults.  Visiting this exotic rainforest, you can visit surrounded by virgin nature and admire the most beautiful colorful birds brought from expeditions from all over the world.  <span>A kakarik, a parrot, an</span> amadina, a turtledove, a siskin, a canary and other representatives of the feathered world form the basis of the exhibition.  Excursions are regularly held in the garden, during which new and interesting information about the life of birds is told, which here, not being afraid of the presence of people, make nests, flood trills, and sometimes they can arrange mating games.  In addition, in this place you can simply enjoy the extraordinary beauty and charming singing of birds.  And in the store you can buy live butterflies and souvenirs.  The <span>Bird of Paradise</span> Garden is open all days except Monday.  The cost of entry into weekdays for adults is 250 rubles, for pensioners and children under 14 years old - 150 rubles.  On weekends and holidays the price for admission is increased: 350 and 200 rubles.  respectively.  Children under 3 years old admission is free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most interesting places of St. Petersburg" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/470312.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Savior on Spilled Blood </h2><p>  This architectural monument is a vivid example of the "Russian style" at a late stage of evolution.  The image of the <span>Savior on Blood is</span> collective, oriented to the Russian Orthodox churches of Yaroslavl and Moscow of the 16-17th centuries.  So, for example, the appearance of the church was greatly influenced by the architecture of St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral.  The basis of the temple‚Äôs composition is a compact four-piece crowned with a five-domed tent with a height of 81 m. An asymmetric painting group is created by nine chapters crowning the Savior on Spilled Blood, several of which are enameled, the rest are gilded.  The interior is made of mosaics.  Its area is 7065 square meters.  It was created according to the sketches of Vasnetsov, Nesterov, Ryabushkin, Belyaev, Kharlamov and other artists (the total number of creators exceeds 30) in the studio of Frolov.  The mosaic composition of the temple is one of the largest in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/470313.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Pushkinskaya, 10 </h2><p>  In the recent 1989, musicians and artists arbitrarily settled an empty house and gave it the name of the Free Culture Partnership.  Galleries, clubs, artists' studios and museums coexist in this place.  It is in this courtyard that John Lennon Street is located.  An unparalleled collection of unique documentation and a collection of works of unofficial art created in the 2nd half of the 20th century are on display at the Museum of Non-Conformist Art.  Young rock bands perform at Fish Fabrique.  Fans of avant-garde music, literature and philosophy should pay attention to the Gallery of Experimental Sound. </p><h2>  Stroganov Palace </h2>

    <p>  In the middle of the 18th century, on the site of this museum was the old mansion of Count S. G. Stroganov, who on one dry day completely destroyed the fire.  The landlord ordered the building to be rebuilt, and F. Rastrelli developed a project for the new residence.  Stroganov‚Äôs house was known throughout St. Petersburg for ‚Äúopen lunches‚Äù.  Absolutely any neatly dressed passer-by could come to visit and eat in the company of the count.  Some openly used this, visiting three times a day, however, arrogance was quickly suppressed.  Restoration work in the palace-museum lasted almost 20 years, but the result justified the efforts of the masters.  Each new hall that opens to the eyes surpasses the beauty of the previous one.  Here you can see the mineralogical collection on the background of books, half-columns recessed in the mirrors and painted ceilings.  The facade is still decorated with stone bas-reliefs with images of either Count Stroganov or Rastrelli himself.  The palace contains a unique collection of art treasures.  Today it is a research institute and restoration center.  Since 1989, the Palace was transferred to the department of the Russian Museum.  The exposition, which is dedicated to Russian collectors of the 17-19th centuries, is constantly working. </p>
