History of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ryazan is in the thirty largest cities in Russia, it is located 198 km from Moscow.  The population is 515 thousand people, originally the city was called Pereyaslavl.  Before answering the question of how old Ryazan is, we will plunge a little into its history. </p><p>  This city gradually grew up on the Oka River, on fertile lands, water meadows, forests full of various wild animals, and ponds where there were a lot of fish.  For many centuries, the Oka was the main route leading to Europe; it connected Pereyaslavl with other Russian lands, with the Asian East and Byzantium.  Some chronicles indicate that once upon a time there was a certain transition or link through the Oka to the Don through Pereyaslavl-Ryazan. </p>

    <h2>  Ryazan: the history of the city </h2><p>  During its excavations, many treasures with silver hryvnias, dirhams, Byzantine and Arab coins were found during excavations.  When they began to erect the first stone Kremlin and its highest tower, it was called Glebovsky, as it looked at the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Borisoglebsky Cathedral.  In the X century, Prince Svyatoslav, subjugating some lands along the Oka River, fighting the Khazar Khaganate, subjugated the Kiev state.  But in the era of feudal wars, these territories were part of the principality of Chernigov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of the XI century, the struggle between the Chernigov and Vladimir princes began for influence in Pochie.  It was at this time that the first mention of the city dates back.  The pop of the Elias Church, Mark in 1570 wrote that in the summer of 6603 (1095) the city of Pereyaslavl-Ryazan was laid next to the church of St.  Nikola Old.  But from this date we must begin to consider how old Ryazan is, but more on that later. </p>

    <h2>  Time for a change </h2><p>  During the internecine wars, the ancient <span>Kremlin of Pereyaslavl-Ryazan</span> occupied a small territory in total area.  And further along the ancient architectural buildings, you can trace the <span>growth of the Kremlin,</span> because there were monasteries along the borders of the city.  In the XIV century, towards the Spassky Monastery, the city developed in a southern direction.  In the XV century, the Dukhovskaya monastery was founded, which became the northern protrusion of the Kremlin.  Then, in different directions - Troitsky, Solotchinsky, etc. The Ryazan Kremlin soon consisted of a chain of fortified posts.  At that time, it was a powerful system of defense fortifications. </p><p>  By the fourteenth century, Pereyaslavl became the largest city of Pochye and the capital of the principality, its heart was a wooden Kremlin with 12 towers, which was a defense located inside the grand ducal court and the houses of wealthy citizens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the Kremlin with stone buildings began under Prince Fedor Olegovich.  The Assumption Cathedral was one of the first to be built, today only the apse of the once white-stone masonry of the 15th century, cleared for modern viewers, has been preserved from it. </p>

    <h2>  History of the big city of Pochye </h2><p>  Once in 1460, the khan of the Great Horde, Akhmat, wanted to take the city, but could not, since the Upper Posad of the Kremlin already existed, and around the settlement of the bishop and Borisoglebsky cathedral there was a prison - on the outside there was a reinforced ring constructed of a wooden stockade and watch towers where market, <span>inns,</span> parish churches and taverns. </p><p>  The 16th and 17th centuries were marked for Ryazan by numerous peasant riots against the landowners who ruined their households.  This plight of the peasants led to famine and epidemics in 1601-1603.  In 1606, Ryazan joined with its suburbs to the people's leader Ivan Bolotnikov. </p><p>  In 1611, Ryazan was one of the first to initiate the convocation of militias for the liberation of Moscow, Prokopy Lyapunov was elected the head of this movement, who led the detachment to Moscow. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, Ryazan governorate was formed, and then - the province.  The city of Pereyaslavl-Ryazan received the name Ryazan with its own coat of arms, which depicted a warrior with a sword and a hat of Monomakh. </p><p>  In the Patriotic War of 1812, people were evacuated to Ryazan and transported thirty thousand wounded.  Then 15 thousand Ryazans entered the fight against the enemy. </p><p>  By 1860, 21.6 thousand people lived in Ryazan, at that time M.E.Saltykov-Shchedrin was its vice-governor.  The population of the city by 1897 doubled, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city was 12 square meters.  km </p><p>  After the 1917 revolution, widespread demonstrations and rallies began.  The people did not have confidence in the Provisional Government because of the famine that had begun.  On October 30, 1917, Soviet power was established in Ryazan. </p><h2>  The war with the Germans and the beginning of the world </h2><p>  In continuation of the answer to the question of how old Ryazan is, it is worth noting another very important fact in the life of this legendary city.  The front line approached the Ryazan region in the fall of 1941.  Then there was a terrible bombing, which claimed many lives and destroyed houses.  The city has been under siege since November 1941.  The difficulties consisted in the fact that there were no units of the regular Soviet army nearby, so the defense was held by ordinary citizens.  As a result, German troops were stopped from the city 30 km. </p><p>  Literally immediately after the war, a sharp revival of the city begins.  Industry, science are developing, institutions are opening.  Today Ryazan is known for its valiant airborne training center. </p>
