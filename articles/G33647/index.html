It is important to consider many factors, but the main emphasis is on various materials.  It is they who determine the calculation of the cost of <span>building a house,</span> form <span>estimates, develop a</span> project, and so on.  All figures are taken on the basis of average values ‚Äã‚Äãtaken from different sources.  However, no significant difference will be observed.  As a result, you can get a fairly reliable cost of future construction of the house. </p><p>  First you need to choose the technology of construction of buildings and structures and the type of material: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation of the cost of building a house" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17593/342980.jpg" width="600"></div>

The price of the land intended for the object is not taken into account.  A significant role in the cost is provided by the development of the project, since this is a ready-made projection document of the building, according to which the construction process will be carried out. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Brick building </h2><p>  This <span>type of building</span> material is the most popular, famous, but also expensive.  The construction of a building box costs 15,000 rubles per sq. M.  m., but with facade cladding.  Further already more expensive.  For example, the construction of a turnkey brick house from 25,000 rubles per square meter.  m. It is important to rely on a complete set of the building: budget, standard and premium.  If you choose an ordinary one-story brick house measuring 10x10 meters, with a simple gable <span>roof made of metal,</span> you need to expect that the construction of the building will cost about 2914100 rubles.  The calculation of the cost of building a house will include materials, unloading, construction and <span>transportation costs.</span>  It is quite good if the pay is also taken into account by the brigade of workers, which is important.  Thus, the calculator for calculating the cost of building a house can show the finished price for any type of object, material and decoration.  It is enough to set the desired parameters, and the system will give exact numbers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home construction cost calculator" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17593/342981.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  You need to understand that different organizations can count completely differently.  Some take into account the prices of some manufacturers, guided by their high quality, while others may call ordinary building materials something unique, significantly raising the price of them.  Before developing a project and an estimate, you should go over the construction sites yourself, where there is a special calculator for preliminary calculation of the cost of building a house.  This will allow you to get a first impression of prices, knowledge of what you have to pay for, and what is already included in the calculation price.  Thus, nobody will be able to deceive the future homeowner.  The main thing is to own at least some information and have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cost of various materials and construction services. </p>
