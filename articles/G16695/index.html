Marhaba Beach is one of the best hotels of its kind that people of average income enjoy.  This complex of buildings is located almost on the beach - the greatest distance from the sea is no more than two hundred meters.  We can say that it is ‚Äúcomposed‚Äù of several hotels - ‚ÄúCaliph‚Äù, ‚ÄúClub‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù.  They are located in a very beautiful park, which is seated at the same time with evergreen fir and lush palm trees.  From here it is close to both the airport in Monastir and the center of Sousse, which is famous throughout Tunisia.  Marhab Beach is only two kilometers from this historic site.  Therefore, the hotel can be safely called both beach and city.  This is convenient for those tourists who came to sunbathe, and those who want to see the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia marhab beach" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/294576.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The complex itself, which is part of the Tunisian hotel chain "Marhaba", was built in the 80s, but at the beginning of this century it underwent a major overhaul.  The rooms are standard for resort hotels.  Almost all of them have balconies.  Of course, there is air conditioning, telephone, bathroom.  Television with many programs (including Russian-language ones) is installed only in the main building and is paid extra (like a minibar).  However, this is a typical hotel for a country like Tunisia.  Marhaba Beach has good pools - both outdoors and indoor.  They have children's departments.  Here you can eat well - three restaurants (the main one is designed for four hundred people), as well as four bars.  Interestingly, the buffet diet in this complex applies only to breakfasts, snacks and salads.  Main dishes are offered to choose from, but √† la carte is a tradition of this hotel chain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
