For hotel guests, heading out to this Egyptian Las Vegas in the evening is a completely natural activity.  The boring nightlife of the Land of the Pharaohs, with all its dynamism, is rich in its special, somehow tangible-Arabic style and charm.  However, an even greater attraction for tourists is the opportunity to comfortably see the historical relics of the ancient and the richest underwater world of the unique Red Sea, saturated with fauna and flora, as in prehistoric times. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel in resort infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel complex is fairly new (it was built in 2007) and is located in the strip of sandy beaches of Sheikh Bay.  These paradise places annually receive about 65% of all visitors to the Land of the Pharaohs.  The diverse infrastructure of the legendary resort with world-famous water parks, restaurants, discos, attractions, water sports centers naturally complements the resort potential of any hotel located here, including the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He established himself in the resort business as a family hotel.  Here, those who have come comfortably to rest with children, families feel from the side of the staff and the administration effective care for the comfort of their vacation.  The hotel complex "Reef Oasis", according to the reviews of vacationers in it, has a high rating.  He really is quoted. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Consider the positioning of the current hotel according to the official ratings of hotel complexes in Sharm El Sheikh.  Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa ranks sixth as a family hotel, eighth as a spa hotel, tenth as a resort hotel, tenth as a romantic hotel, sixteenth in terms of beach characteristics ... </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs not easy for him to compete with the hotel complexes of the leading chains in the world: Inter Continental Hotels Group (Britain), Wyndham Hotel Group (USA), Marriott International (USA), Hilton Hotels (USA), Accor Group (France).  However, if, in addition to the aforementioned positions in the hotel business, we add, in addition to ratings, the indicator ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù, then the place of the hotel in question will be significantly higher.  After all, the current minimum price of a tour to Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) for 8 days and, accordingly, 7 nights with the already taken into account the cost of the flight, all inclusive meals, medical insurance and transfer is $ 1100.  At the same time, we note: arrivals should also take into account the cost of buying a visa - $ 25 per person.  Based on these statements, it is clear why there is an opinion among holidaymakers that the Reef Oasis hotel chain is one of the best in Egypt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Architecture and landscape design of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel itself was built according to an elegant low-rise ‚Äúeastern‚Äù project: two-story buildings with stylized arches and half-ring columns cover the vast area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe main pool from the leeward side (from the south-west). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reef oasis blue bay resort spa 5" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/762472.jpg" width="403"></div>  The pool complex is unique.  The very form of the artificial reservoir created for the boring holiday of the guests of the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) resembles an ink blot in outline.  Moreover, the pool is designed both for swimming, swimming, playing water polo, etc., and for relaxation: the blots of petals cross the bridges, in the center there is an "island" with palm trees, which can also be reached by walkways.  Here, to the delight of holidaymakers, there is a hotel water park with slides.

    <p>  There is another pool at the hotel, which serves to relax.  For some of the guests of Reef Oasis Blue Baoy Resrt 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) this place is their favorite.  Some do not even bother to go down to the sea from here.  Indeed, why, if in the relaxation pool area from 11-00 to 15-00 the Relax Pool Bar is open - a bar ‚Äúup to 16 years old‚Äù with soft drinks, snacks and free low-alcohol Egyptian production.  Here, friendly companies took their place, while spending their vacation time in the atmosphere of the lounge.  Especially in the pool area holidaymakers from Germany like to be.  There are enough sun loungers and umbrellas so that vacationers can take their favorite place without rushing. </p><p>  The entire territory of the hotel complex is very beautifully illuminated in the evening.  The impression of professional landscape design is enhanced by this creative aesthetic approach. </p><p>  The territory of Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa is quite large, landscaped with palm trees and irrigated lawns.  In the evening it is pleasant to walk along its neat streets. </p><h2>  Great beach </h2><p>  The beach is located several levels lower than the hotel.  Special lifts are being lowered to him by spa people.  A free hotel shuttle bus is also available.  The beach is large and comfortable, there are enough territories, sun loungers and umbrellas for all spa travelers.  The bar, working on it, in the range provides snacks, fast food, soft and low alcohol drinks (the last ones are dosed) to vacationers at the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa 5 *.  Reviews of the reef located in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach are worth a more detailed description. </p><h2>  Underwater world </h2><p>  This is one of the richest underwater fauna and flora of reefs in the entire Sheikh Bay.  He is a favorite place for divers.  It is no coincidence that hotel guests basking on its beach, almost constantly near the coast, can see several boats on the roadstead. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reef oasis blue bay resort 5" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/762473.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <p>  It is no coincidence that the words ‚Äúreef‚Äù and ‚Äúoasis‚Äù appear in the name of the hotel complex. </p><p>  The administration is constantly holding an action: it gives one diving dive for any interested guest (it is carried out in a specialized center operating at the hotel complex) for free.  It can hardly be called a waste of money.  According to statistics, about 80% of the "shareholders" from the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa 5 * want to make a second, already paid dive.  Reviews, a description of the underwater world of chic gorgon reefs from such lovers of outdoor activities - a real decoration of the hotel‚Äôs pages on tourist sites on the Internet.  A rarity nowadays is a lively reef completely close to the shore, accessible even to beginner swimmers.  Among the chic gorgon corals, characterized by pleasant shades of blue and pink, hundreds, thousands of colorful fish swim. </p><p>  It is no accident that the <span>famous traveler</span> Jacques-Yves Cousteau, compiling a list of the ten most paradise corners of the underwater world of the <span>globe,</span> gave one of the positions to these places.  Reviews of hotel guests, underwater photo hunters are full of underwater photographs <span>of parrot fish;</span>  <span>butterfly fish;</span>  plataks, similar to huge scalars;  surgeon fish.  Colorful flocks of fish here and there enliven this kingdom of Neptune.  More experienced divers exploring great depths and underwater caves tend to meet (of course, from afar) with moray eels, rays. </p><p>  Here, vacationers have the opportunity to get an international class diver certificate.  The hotel diving school offers special courses designed for both beginners and experienced athletes.  Some readers will notice that the underwater world can be admired without scuba gear, and using only a mask, snorkel and fins.  Snorkeling - this is the name of this lesson, and does not give 20% of those impressions that diving gives to holidaymakers.  Guided divers organize memorable excursions for holidaymakers who have learned to dive. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  The guests of the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort 5 * hotel eat in six restaurants and eleven bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reef oasis blue bay resort spa 5 sharmelsheikh sa" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/762470.jpg" width="403"></div>  In addition to the main restaurants Bay View and Sea Breeze, working on the principle of a buffet within the all inclusive system, tourists are booked by three specialized restaurants: fish, French cuisine "La Romantic", Italian cuisine "Al Dante", a 24-hour bistro restaurant (snack bar) in French style).

Here is the state supermarket of fixed prices "Carrefour", which is very popular among guests of Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort Spa 5 *.
