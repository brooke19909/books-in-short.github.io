Its inhabitants no less than others need comfortable housing.  Most of the city is built up and populated, and quite a while ago.  If we talk about modern buyers of apartments, they give preference to new buildings with thoughtful layouts, developed infrastructure and excellent location. </p><p>  New residential neighborhoods and even residential neighborhoods are gaining more and more popularity, where it is possible to purchase an apartment at the stage of building a house on very favorable conditions.  Of course, when buying an apartment not just in a new building, but in a new residential quarter, you need to put up with the lack of developed infrastructure, at least until the completion of construction.  But the cost of an apartment in a house at the stage of excavation is significantly lower than after putting the house into operation. </p><p>  Microdistrict "Rainbow" in Cheboksary is a new residential microdistrict, a project of large-scale residential development of the city, attracting a lot of attention.  Our task within the framework of this material is to evaluate the project from all sides, to give it the most objective assessment. </p>

    <h2>  About microdistrict </h2><p>  The unique infrastructure, the latest technology - that is what distinguishes the new residential neighborhood "Rainbow" (Cheboksary).  The large-scale residential development project fully lives up to its name.  It is based on the concept of bright colors, expressive and catchy architecture, which allows residents to make each day special bright and memorable.  A unique example of an integrated approach to the creation of a residential complex and the arrangement of the territory: here you can not only live a full life, but also relax without leaving the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The microdistrict is designed from residential buildings, interconnected by a wide boulevard.  The developer is confident that he will become a favorite place for walks of all residents. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The developer of the Raduzhny microdistrict in Cheboksary has chosen an excellent place for the implementation of his project - the busy Pirogov street.  The area is perfect for a comfortable life, it is located not far from the highway, therefore, problems with moving around the city will not arise for residents with a private car or those who will use public transport. </p>

    <p>  New buildings are being erected in the heart of the city, not far from its cultural and historical center, but at the same time, residents of the microdistrict will be able to enjoy the peace, tranquility and regularity of life.  And all this is largely due to the successful location in all respects.  Public gardens and parks located within walking distance of residential buildings will provide the comfort of life in a large city that many dream of. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Microdistrict "Rainbow" (Cheboksary) creates all conditions for a comfortable life.  The project does not provide for the creation of additional infrastructure.  But this is not necessary.  Indeed, on the territory of the microdistrict and within walking distance from it there are all necessary infrastructure objects, including social ones: a kindergarten, a school, and a polyclinic.  Not far from the new buildings there are enough shops, bank branches.  In addition, the first floors of new buildings will be reserved for commercial organizations, which will maximize the level of comfort provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Literally a block from the complex there is a modern cinema, cafes, restaurants, which allows residents to organize their leisure time exactly the way they want it and without unnecessary movement around the city. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The microdistrict occupies an impressive area, which is why the developer has envisaged large-scale improvement of the adjacent territory.  A wide cobbled boulevard with recreation areas, benches, gazebos, rare trees and shrubs is the visiting card of the project, its full decoration.  According to the plan of the developer, it unites the whole concept and should become a favorite place for walks of residents of the microdistrict. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Apartments in Cheboksary (Microdistrict "Rainbow") are distinguished by a variety of layouts.  Spacious, bright one-, two- and three-room apartments with excellent views are what residents of the first commissioned houses appreciated.  If you are looking for a small apartment for a family of two people, or, on the contrary, have been looking for a spacious apartment with isolated rooms and an additional bathroom for a large family with children for a long time, you will surely like the Rainbow (Cheboksary) microdistrict. </p><p>  The responses of the first residents focus on spacious kitchens, ideal not only for cooking, but also for family dinners and receptions.  Due to non-standard layouts, spacious halls, isolated rooms and separate bathrooms, it is possible to provide the necessary comfort and privacy to each member of even a large family.  The presence of a wardrobe in some apartments was attributed by many to very impressive advantages, because this is an excellent opportunity to get rid of bulky wardrobes, while properly organizing the clothes storage system. </p>
