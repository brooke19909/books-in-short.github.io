    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  No one knows for sure when and how the Shakuran Falls appeared.  Scientists attribute his birth to a severe earthquake that occurred here in 1892, the power of which, according to various estimates, was from 7 to 9 points.  They say that then the part of the Maly Shapach mountain, which is located near the Amtkel river, could not stand it and fell down.  As a result, a dam formed. </p><p>  A little later, the river below the collapse dried out and overgrown with green plants, and above it formed Lake Amtkel.  It was the water that caused the emergence of dozens of new caves that have a connection with the pond, and Shakuran Falls.  There are no legends and myths about this. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The most beautiful Shakuran waterfall is located in the Gulripshsky region of Abkhazia, in the gorge of the same name, created due to erosion and weathering of soft rocks (travertine, limestone, and so on).  It feeds on the waters of the Shakuran River, originating from the purest springs of the Zebeldinsky Gorge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To get to this place, you need to walk or go in a jeep.  No sandals and shoes, just sneakers.  It is advisable to bring along a guide who will show you how to get to the Shakuran Falls best. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristic of Shakuran Falls </h2><p>  Shakuran Falls consists of 4 sinks located not far from each other.  The uppermost one, 30 meters high, runs away from the cliff in a thin stream and powerfully capsizes down into a stone amphitheater, directly onto a huge cone with an ominous ‚Äúhuman-like head‚Äù (its top resembles it so much).  You can go down to the lake for swimming, which combines all 4 plums, to the left of any of them, along a narrow path.  You can also swim through the cave with cold water of the Shakuran River.  Only for this you need to wear a wetsuit and good shoes, as well as bring a waterproof flashlight. </p><p>  The volume of a stream of water directly depends on the amount of precipitation.  In the rainy season, Shakuran Falls appears before travelers in all its grandeur.  It becomes luxurious and magnificent.  At such a time, you can look at him indefinitely.  It is worth noting that, judging by the reviews given by tourists about the Shakuran Falls in Abkhazia, he never runs amok.  On the contrary, it calms, creates a sense of peace and lyrical mood.  And that's great! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cascades and caves </h2><p>  The total height of Shakuran Falls is about 250 meters.  But his real grandeur can be observed not only from above.  It is enough to climb onto a cone in the middle of the lake, consisting of limestone and never formed to the end, so that you can see an unusually beautiful and amazing view.  Here you can even observe with your own eyes how underground funnels and hollows are formed. </p><p>  In the niches of the lower cascade, which flows into the Jampal River, and the middle one, you can see 3 caves, the largest of them has a length of 3 meters.  They are very beautiful: sagging formations of various forms, created from salt, clay and other natural minerals (stalactites), hang from the ceiling.  Toward them, from the bottom of the caves, streaked mineral cones and pillars (stalagmites) are striving.  All together it looks grandiose!  It is worth noting that part of the Shakuran River flows in the longest of the caves.  You can visit it, but it is better after acquiring special equipment and the necessary experience. </p>

    <h2>  Road to Shakuran Falls </h2><p>  The waterfall itself is beautiful, but the road to it is even more picturesque.  It begins somewhere on the Zebeldin Highlands, along which the Shakuran River flows.  Then it smoothly passes into a rocky place created over the millennia by the forces of water and wind, then flows into a path that leads through a grove with boxwood.  The trees in this forest are very strange and unusual, with curved trunks.  At the sight of them, you begin to feel as if you are shooting in some kind of science fiction film. </p><p>  From the boxwood grove to the Shakuran gorge there is a steep path, completely covered with dense vegetation and moss.  The air here is quite humid and heavy.  Therefore, a trip here is strictly forbidden to asthmatics and people suffering from other lung diseases.  However, the rest should also be careful.  In order not to fall down, walking on slippery stones, you need to wear shoes that can provide good grip.  It is also recommended that you hold onto the wire held here especially for insurance. </p><p>  When traveling to Shakuran Falls, you will also have to go through a stone arch with the interesting name ‚ÄúWolf Gate‚Äù, a canyon with multi-ton boulders and mysterious tunnels.  In order not to get lost, it is worth taking a guide with you, able to tell about everything that can only meet along the way.  If you decide to visit Shakuran Falls with him, the tour will be interesting and informative! </p>
