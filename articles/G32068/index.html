Turkey and Egypt, as well as Greece, Tunisia and Thailand occupy the leading lines in the <span>list of tour operators.</span>  But sooner or later, the moment comes when you want something new.  Realization of this need may well be helped by a trip to Riga. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.9496487" data-lng="24.105186499999945" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/4/7/9/3479.png"></div><p>  So, the exact direction is chosen.  Already half the battle is done.  But do not rush.  Before joyfully packing your bags, charging your digital camera and looking forward to new experiences, it is worth familiarizing yourself with important information about Riga. </p><h2>  Tourist town </h2><p>  When it comes to choosing a destination for your vacation, it's easy enough to get confused.  After all, the world is so huge!  And every corner of it offers its own, completely unique flavor.  When an even tan and idle pastime on the beach is no longer pleasing, you can go on a trip to Riga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newmarketholidays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas market in Riga" class="if uuid-2485727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485727.jpg"></div><p>  Riga, able to charm and bewitch with medieval beauty, hospitably opens its doors to every traveler.  This city surprisingly combines the mystery of the structures of antiquity and the indefatigable energy of our time.  Fans of history will undoubtedly be interested in long unhurried walks along the old streets.  Where, if not in Riga, you can admire the lush greenery of numerous parks and squares, lovingly maintained in an amazing order!  And after the promenade, you can skip a couple of glasses in one of the cozy bars, of which you will meet a lot on your way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the one who decides that Riga is such a small town, stuck somewhere in the past, is mistaken.  This is a real metropolis, living a busy life.  He is like and not like his ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù - Tallinn and Vilnius.  There is where to have fun in a noisy company, or to go shopping. </p><p>  It would seem, how can you harmoniously combine the vibrant nightlife and the splendidly preserved medieval look of the city?  However, Riga succeeds brilliantly. </p><p>  Such an incredible mix will help not to remain indifferent and gladly meet guests again, many, many times. </p><h2>  What is important to know about Riga </h2><p>  Before visiting Riga, it will not be superfluous to learn a little about its history and features.  Riga is the Latvian capital, and in combination - the recognized cultural capital of Europe.  It is the largest Baltic city.  At the time of Latvia's entry into the Russian Empire, it occupied an important place both in industry, and in commercial and cultural spheres. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveriga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house of blackheads" class="if uuid-2486052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2486052.jpg"></div><p>  Riga is located on the shores of the Baltic Sea.  The city has many park areas, squares, ponds, which makes it incredibly beautiful, conducive to hiking. </p><p>  The climate is temperate, the weather will please both in winter and in summer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Until 1990, Riga was the most densely populated city in the Baltics.  However, after the population was pretty thinned due to emigration. </p><p>  If you look at the national composition, then the majority of the population is Latvians, a little less Russians live in Riga. </p><h2>  Curious places to visit </h2><p>  Upon arrival in another country, I want to get acquainted with the most interesting places, look at the unique architecture, monuments.  There is something to visit in Riga.  And here is a short list of places to visit, so that a trip to Riga will be remembered for a long time: </p><ul><li>  Art lovers will appreciate the Museum of Jewelery.  This is a kind of private collection of a family of local jewelers who have been collecting national jewelry for 20 years.  There are copies made by the owners of the Museum, as well as real old originals. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dome Cathedral" class="if uuid-2485736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485736.jpg"></div><ul><li>  To visit Riga and not visit the Town Hall Square is completely unforgivable.  The square is an old city center.  This is a very busy place.  Notable features are the Town Hall and the House of the Blackheads. </li><li>  The magnificent Botanical Garden is accessible to visitors all year round.  It grows not only representatives of the flora of Latvia, but also many species of exotic plants.  Wildlife lovers will enjoy visiting this marvelous place.  Paid entrance. </li><li>  Once on the Town Hall Square, one cannot help but notice the mysterious <span>House of the Blackheads.</span>  Despite the frightening name, its story is quite prosaic.  Lovers of unique architecture are encouraged to look at this building.  True, you won‚Äôt be able to get inside.  Since 2012, the office of the <span>President of Latvia</span> has been located there <span>.</span> </li><li>  If we talk about houses, then in Riga there are many interesting.  One of these is the Cat House.  It is noteworthy that the spiers of its towers are decorated with figures of black cats.  Hence the name. </li><li>  From childhood, everyone remembers the cartoon about the Bremen Town Musicians.  So, in Riga you can see the monument to the famous four.  And they say, if they rub their noses, then their wishes come true. </li><li>  No self-respecting traveler will pass by Old Riga.  This is a whole area - the oldest part of Riga.  Here you can visit the Riga Castle, <span>Dome Cathedral,</span> St. James <span>Cathedral</span> and many other attractions. </li><li>  By the way, the Dome Cathedral is famous for its organ concerts.  As well as a very complex architectural style - a mixture of different directions in architecture. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveriga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Verman Garden" class="if uuid-2485740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485740.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Another point is the Verman Garden.  Green alleys with fountains are combined here with night clubs.  You can stay until the morning! </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of places that will be interesting to visit.  Not to list all the parks, small public gardens, museums and modern art galleries.  At every step you can accidentally come across a wonderful amazing corner.  But, as evidenced by numerous reviews, a trip to Riga will be remembered by each guest for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What documents are needed </h2><p>  Those wishing to make a trip to Riga for tourist purposes should remember that Latvia is a member of the European Union.  This means that a foreigner will need to obtain a Schengen visa in order to get into the country without problems. </p><p>  The question naturally arises: what documents are necessary for a trip to Riga? </p><p>  The first step is to clarify that there are several types of visas: </p><ul><li>  <span>Schengen visa.</span>  Upon receipt of such a visa, the traveler also gets the right to move through the territories of all countries that are members of Schengen.  Usually, it is she who is considered as a travel visa, which is very convenient. </li><li>  Transit visa.  This visa is designed for the traveler to transfer from one aircraft to another when the flight is not direct.  At the same time, a visa does not give a foreigner the right to leave the airport. </li><li>  Long term visa.  A kind of almost alternative to a residence permit.  The holder of such a visa receives the right to stay in the territory of a foreign country for a period of over 90 days and up to 6 months. </li></ul><p>  If the main goal is to visit the country as a tourist, a Schengen visa is the best choice. </p><p>  So, to get a visa to travel to Riga, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Fill out the form.  If the rest is planned by the whole family, then you need to fill in for each family member. </li><li>  International passport. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="travelgeektara.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat house" class="if uuid-2485745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485745.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  If a minor receives a visa, then a birth certificate must be provided instead of a passport. </li><li>  Insurance policy.  It should cover more than 30,000 euros.  And it acts on the territory of any country that is part of the Schengen. </li><li>  Two color photos of a standard size. </li><li>  Any confirmation of intentions to visit Riga.  For example, it can be airline tickets or hotel reservations. </li><li>  Bank statement. </li><li>  Consular fee receipt. </li></ul><h2>  Additional documents </h2><p>  This list is basic but not exhaustive.  Additional documents may be required if a foreigner plans to visit Riga for employment. </p><h2>  How to get from St. Petersburg </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to Riga.  For example, some people choose to travel to Riga by car.  It all depends on which city will serve as a starting point.  From St. Petersburg, a trip to Riga is offered through Pskov. </p><p>  The roads are lightly loaded, so the path will come out relatively fast.  Before departure, you should refuel, as there are very few refuelings after the border. </p><p>  On the way to Riga, you will have to cross the border with Estonia.  The queue needs to be booked through the online service in advance.  The procedure may be time-consuming. </p><h2>  How to get from Moscow </h2><p>  If you go on a trip to Riga from Moscow, then the route on the M9 highway is recommended.  The distance will be about 950 kilometers.  And in time, a trip to Riga from Moscow by car will take an average of 12 hours.  The road surface is normal.  According to reviews, there are not many cafes and gas stations on the highway.  Crossing the border takes a lot of time.  With heavy workload up to 8 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelshop.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magic views of Riga" class="if uuid-2485725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485725.jpg"></div><p>  There is another option to go on the M1 highway, through Belarus. </p><p>  When traveling to Riga by car, it is important to consider the rules of Latvia.  So, motorists are forbidden to use a radar detector there.  And it‚Äôs better to put a reflective vest in the car. </p><h2>  Railway </h2><p>  A trip to Riga is also possible by train.  It should be noted that not every route can turn out direct, without transfers.  So, for example, a train trip from Tallinn to Riga is possible with transfers in St. Petersburg or in Moscow. </p><h2>  Travel by car </h2><p>  To make a trip to Riga by car, you need the following: </p><ul><li>  Actually the car itself. </li><li>  Green card, which will have to be issued in advance.  This is an analogue of car insurance, as in Russia. </li><li>  Without a Schengen visa, Latvia, a member of the EU, will not be allowed. </li><li>  A good helper will be a navigator for moving along unknown routes. </li><li>  Merry company and good mood! </li></ul><h2>  Bus ride to Riga </h2><p>  It is not necessary to be torn between a choice - an airplane or a train.  A trip to Riga by bus will be for many the most convenient option. </p><p>  For example, a direct bus runs from St. Petersburg several times a day.  Such a ticket will cost about 3,000 rubles, and the transfer will take about 12 hours.  You can take up to three bags with you.  Comfortable buses with free Wi-Fi and power sockets for charging gadgets are available. </p><p>  Getting from the capital will be somewhat more difficult.  The bus runs once a day, the ticket price is higher, and the travel time will take up to 15 hours. </p><h2>  A few words about cellular communications </h2><p>  In a foreign trip can not do without cellular communications.  In Latvia, you can buy a SIM card on a prepaid card, which is easy to find in every kiosk, train stations and even in supermarkets.  So calls abroad will be even more profitable. </p><p>  In Riga, the main mobile operators are TELE2 and LMT. </p><p>  Free and paid Wi-Fi networks are also widespread in Riga.  In many public places you can easily connect and use the Internet. </p><h2>  Gastronomy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.balticbeach.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga streets" class="if uuid-2485752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82910/2485752.jpg"></div><p>  When you visit another country, it will be interesting to get acquainted with its gastronomic features.  There are many different restaurants in Riga, where they will gladly treat guests with their national dishes, which are sometimes very surprising. </p><p>  Although the Latvian and Russian cuisines are somewhat reminiscent of each other, it will be unusual for a Russian traveler to taste beetroot soup.  Unlike the usual dishes, in Riga such a soup is served cold.  It can be found in the menu called aux zupa. </p><p>  In general, Latvian cuisine is replete with unusual dishes and combinations of products.  And yet, after lunch in any restaurant or cafe, satiety is more than guaranteed.  What a Latvian onion bug is worth!  The unusual dish turns out to be a steak, which is served in Riga with a special onion sauce.  And for dessert you can treat yourself to a buberte.  You should not be afraid, this is an incredibly tasty semolina, which everyone was probably fed in childhood.  Only here they like to combine it with whipped cream, sometimes adding a handful of nuts and cranberry sauce.  Few people will refuse such porridge! </p><p>  The most common product in Latvian cuisine is perhaps fish.  It is used here in all possible forms.  There are fish casseroles with vegetables, and fried herring, which is served with the already familiar onion sauce, and the same herring, only already baked on charcoal.  And also many types of sandwiches, salads.  Salmon can be tasted in a variety of forms at every step. </p><p>  If we talk about drinks, here Riga will also bring a few surprises.  Kissels are very popular here.  They are so diverse that you can taste both sweet honey and sour, from peas or oats with the addition of yogurt.  In addition, bread kvass is very popular. </p><p>  Among the most famous alcoholic drinks is Riga Black Balm.  You can‚Äôt visit Riga and at least once not try it.  It is worth paying a little attention to liquors.  You can try unusual vodka from tomatoes.  Beer in Riga is very excellent and, like the whole kitchen, has its own original features. </p>
