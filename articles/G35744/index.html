The quality of a knitted product largely depends on the correct choice of source material.  When purchasing, it is important to evaluate the composition, color and thickness of the thread. </p><p>  Linen yarn is made from plant fibers and is highly valued by craftsmen due to its strength.  It is also recognized as the most durable, because it was used by the ancient Egyptians - it was part of the bandages for mummies, which are perfectly preserved to our time. </p><h2>  Yarn manufacturing technology </h2><p>  From ancient times, flax was cultivated in the southern and eastern countries.  From ancient times, it was considered an agricultural crop and was used to create yarn from which wardrobe items were then knitted and woven. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarn production" class="if uuid-2831647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2831647.jpg"></div><p>  To this end, stalks of flax flax were harvested, which were first dried and then soaked for a long time to separate the fibers from its core.  The resulting soft tow was battered and combed, dividing it into ribbons.  The result was a strong flaxen thread, which turned into yarn as a result of twisting several of these fibers. </p><p>  In ancient times, this was done manually, a little later - on a spinning wheel, and now it is entrusted to professional machinery.  And the process has undergone changes, and the quality of yarn, too.  However, the properties of flax remain unchanged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Its unique properties </h2><p>  Linen yarn is highly valued in knitting and is quite expensive due to its natural characteristics: </p><ol><li>  This is the most durable of all types of natural threads. </li><li>  It does not rot, and time makes yarn products even better. </li><li>  Regulates heat transfer, which allows you to keep warm in the winter cold, and in the sultry summer creates a cool. </li><li>  It absorbs moisture well and dries faster than its other types of yarn. </li><li>  Does not form statistical electricity. </li><li>  Knitted items from flax retain their original appearance after washing: they do not sit, do not stretch and do not deteriorate at high temperatures. </li><li>  It has hypoallergenic properties and does not cause skin irritation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="moiraravenscroft.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Linen yarn" class="if uuid-2832309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2832309.jpg"></div><p>  It is used for machine knitting and for knitting and crocheting. </p><h2>  Few cons </h2><p>  True, the described yarn can distinguish some disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  It is poorly bleached and stained. </li><li>  Things from it are a little rough, they are easily wrinkled and difficult to iron out. </li><li>  A new thing can be pricked, but this is solved by first washing and wearing it for some time. </li></ul><h2>  Quality material is the basis of a masterpiece </h2><p>  Dressing flax is of no small importance when choosing yarn.

Her thread is absolutely inelastic. </p><p>  Sometimes mixed yarn is found on sale, which in addition to linen contains cotton, wool or viscose.  Fine products are also made from it. </p><h2>  Variety of yarn according to the method of torsion </h2><p>  The following types are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Textured - porous, fluffy, soft, voluminous and well stretched. </li><li>  Single-twisted - formed by twisting from several threads that have a smooth surface and the same length. </li><li>  Reinforced - made on the basis of synthetic threads entwined with woolen and cotton fibers. </li><li>  Multi-twisted - made by re-twisting already twisted yarn. </li><li>  Shaped - obtained by twisting threads of different lengths and thicknesses. </li></ol><p>  Where to use twisted linen yarn?
