Phuket Island (Thailand): description, holiday season, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Where is Phuket located in which country?  The answer to this question is not to look long.  The island belonging to the Kingdom of Thailand, with the capital of the same name, is one of the most popular modern tourist destinations.  He is one of the top best entertainment "capitals" of Southeast Asia, along with Pattaya and Bangkok.  When to go to Phuket to relax, what time of year and which beach to choose?  We will deal with this in the article below. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Where is Phuket located in which country?  The island occupies the most important place in the territorial structure of the Kingdom of Thailand.  This is one of its smallest provinces, which includes in addition to the capital island another 39 surrounding islands.  Due to its size, the island of Phuket leads the list of the largest islands in Thailand.  It takes 76th place in the world geographical ranking. </p><p>  According to the description, Phuket is similar to a pearl of irregular shape.  It stretches over twenty kilometers in width and almost fifty kilometers in length.  The size of the island of Phuket is an area equal to 540 square kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.designtrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Beach" class="if uuid-3217222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217222.jpg"></div><p>  Phuket is one of the main tourist centers of the Kingdom of Thailand, which boasts the best beaches in the Asian part of the world.  Today, this exotic resort receives millions of tourists from all over the world every year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The most popular version of the formation of Phuket says that the island was once part of the mainland, but as a result of tectonic activity, a piece of land was separated by a strait.  Phang Nga Bay, which contains more than forty islands of various sizes, is historical evidence of geographical natural anomalies. </p><p>  Due to archaeological work, the result of which are three thousand-year-old arrowheads found in the Kamala region, it can be assumed that Phuket was inhabited by people a few millennia ago. </p><p>  The likelihood of Stone Age inhabitants living here is unknown, but some of the definitely early settlers were sea gypsy peoples (Moken and Cheo Le), an Austronesian ethnic group.  Their kindred contemporary representatives can still be found today, however, contact with them is difficult, because these peoples have their own language and culture that are difficult to understand even by the Thais themselves. </p><p>  The first sailors settled in Phuket, probably at the beginning of the Iron Age.  They viewed this land area as a transit point on the way from India to China.  At that time, this island was known as Manikram ("Crystal Mountain") and as Hai Leng ("Sea Dragon"). </p><p>  The life of the island was enriched during the visits of merchant ships from Persia, Arabia, and Burma.  The port city was one of the stops on the Silk Road.  Immigrants from neighboring countries began to descend from the courts, eventually building a cultural and religious state with their own traditions. </p><p>  The first written sources mention Phuket either under the name Jank Ceylon, or as Thalang Bangkhli - in general, the geographical element did not have a single name.  The modern island received its official name only in 1967. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first Europeans began to flock to Phuket in the fourteenth century.  The Portuguese, French and British traveled here in search of inaccessible metals, but had a ban on access to mines.  The nineteenth century became the pinnacle of the tin boom.  Phuket at the end of the century became the second fastest growing city after Bangkok.  This period was the era of the settlement of the island by Chinese workers, who introduced their traditions into the cultural history of the province.  A special ethnic system gradually pushed the indigenous and Muslim inhabitants along the coast. </p><p>  At the head of industrial progress in Phuket were the Portuguese.  They owned the mines, streets, and entire neighborhoods in which the mansions held by successful workers were built.  Thus, Phuket is imbued with the spirit of sailors with a Sino-Portuguese accent. </p><p>  With the production of tin, other industries flourished.  So, for example, on the island began growing growth of Hevea tree, shrimp, fishing industry appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Industrial Phuket" class="if uuid-3217262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217262.jpg"></div><p>  In the 20th century, Phuket was on the verge of economic extinction: mines were depleted, the cost of tin fell, business and trade declined due to Japanese occupation.  Only a few Chinese families were financially held on the island, and they revived the province to a modern tourist center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The impetus for the beginning of mass tourism, as in the case of most Asian resorts, was given by hippies in the 70s of the 20th century.  In 1967, the island and the mainland were connected by a constructed bridge, and ten years later an international airport opened. </p><p>  In the 80s, local residents staged mass protests and actions against tin processing plants.  A byproduct of the industry has done enormous damage to Phuket‚Äôs environment.  In 1992, the last mine was closed.  The environmental scandal has become a global advertisement for a new tourist destination. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Prior to the downturn in the metals industry in the 1970s, tourism was of no importance to the economic prosperity of Phuket.  And even despite the fact that the island was the most popular Thai destination among tourists, it remained the most exotic and wild: sometimes unpaved roads were impassable, and criminal activity did not die out. </p><p>  After completion of construction and the opening of a bridge to the island, a permanent overland communication with the mainland began.  In the early 70's, a number of hotels were built, which became the first tourist "chord".  Modern Phuket is based on two economic pillars - rubber manufacturing and tourism.  According to 2011 data, nearly six million foreign tourists and about two and a half million residents of neighboring provinces visited the Thai resort. </p><p>  The growing popularity of Phuket and its becoming one of the best world vacation spots forced the central airline "Airports of Thailand" to expand international traffic, which will double the annual passenger traffic.  Only service companies offering hotel rooms may not be able to cope with such an application for promising tourist success, because, despite the active development of complexes and hotels, there are not enough places for guests.  Tourist and hotel centers with four and five stars are especially in demand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kayak.co.th" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket beaches and hotels" class="if uuid-3217265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217265.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the variety of beach vacations, travelers are attracted by the cultural and historical island attractions.  Local markets and souvenir shops offering relatively restrained monetary policies can also boast of demand.  Since the demolition of the first mines and factories, Phuket has acquired world-class golf courses, which are also very popular among tourists.  Travelers from all over the world travel to the Thai island to plunge into the landscapes of the underwater world of the Andaman Sea, as well as learn about sex tourism, which is officially banned in the Kingdom of Thailand. </p><p>  Since 1975, the island has been the base for underwater and land expeditions to the Similan Islands, which are recognized by many authoritative publications as the best places for scuba diving.  Over one and a half million underwater species enthusiasts come to Thailand annually. </p><p>  In the late 80s, the first golf course was built in Phuket.  Due to the uniqueness and picturesque scenery of the island, the number of venues for this game continues to grow here, which currently meet international standards and host various prestigious competitions.  Thailand is currently the leader in the number of golf tourists coming. </p><p>  Holidays in Thailand and its provinces is a dream for many travelers.  Before you go to the Southeast state, you need to be prepared for some unpleasant moments.  So, for example, the time difference with Phuket for observers of Moscow time is four hours.  For most Russian tourists, this fact will not have any negative impact.  And travelers from Krasnoyarsk will generally feel at home, because in their city and in Phuket, the clock hands occupy the same position. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The population of the Thai province, according to 2011, is more than 350 thousand people - registered permanent residents.  Most of those who can be found on the streets of the island are either visiting Thais who have decided to earn extra money in Phuket, or international tourists.  Boldly speaking, the population of the island is constantly changing at an average of 700 thousand people.  The official language of Phuket is Thai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tribus-et-ethnies.kazeo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thai people" class="if uuid-3217270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217270.jpg"></div><p>  The provincial population predominantly professes Buddhism (71 percent), visitors from Malaysia adhere to Islam (24 percent), and the group that occupies the third largest place is relatives of sea gypsies (4 percent). </p><p>  More than one hundred thousand people in Phuket are descendants of Chinese immigrants, the first workers on the island.  The oldest inhabitants of the province are sea gypsies living in their villages remote from the tourist epicenter. </p><p>  Also in the Thai province live many people from Burma.  True, the government still can not establish the exact figure, because these immigrants prefer not to register. </p><p>  Phuket residents are no exception in the reputation of a friendly and welcoming Thailand.  They also sincerely support the prosperity of their homeland and want the world to not stop calling the Southeastern state a "land of smiles." </p><p>  Many say that tourism spoiled the people of Thailand, industrial growth made them cynical.  Habitual oriental friendliness often hides a decent overpricing for certain services and goods.  Probably, you should beware of imposition and deception anywhere in the world where tourism is developed.  Tourist scam can be found in clothing stores, among representatives of delivery services, as well as in the transportation business. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Remember where is Phuket, in which country?  Thailand is famous for its tropical location.  The monsoon climate prevails here, due to which the year is divided into two seasons.  The low (wet) period lasts from late spring to mid-autumn; the high (dry) season lasts from November to April.  The only thing that remains unchanged is the temperature of the water, so the rest on the island lasts all year round. </p><p>  Phuket in May meets daily showers, which last for fifteen minutes and can begin every couple of hours.  During the wet season, it rains every day, usually in the afternoon.  There are lingering showers, but rarely.  In summer, a strong current occurs on the beaches of the island‚Äôs west coast, which may not be safe for tourists. </p><p>  In the drought season, cloudiness and tropical winds are practically absent.  February, March and April delight tourists and residents with the highest air temperature.  This period is the most successful for visiting Phuket. </p><h2>  Areas and beaches of Phuket </h2><p>  The tourist hub of Phuket is its western coast.  This is where a large number of hotels, bars and, of course, beaches and bays are located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket101.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Phuket" class="if uuid-3217272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217272.jpg"></div><p>  The list of areas where a tourist would be better in Phuket will look as follows: </p><ul><li>  Bang Tao (also known as Laguna Beach) is probably the most luxurious and expensive beach on the island.  Wealthy people flock here from all over the world.  Here are located the majority of five-star hotels, as well as the legendary Laguna Phuket complex. </li><li>  Surin is a beach filled with the atmosphere of a traditional Thai village.  Theme holidays are becoming more and more popular every year, therefore complexes are being built, infrastructure is developing, and beaches are being filled with visiting seekers of the ‚Äúroots‚Äù of the Southeast state. </li><li>  Kamal Beach - a beach with pristine and almost untouched nature awaits tourists in this unique area.  Here are hotels awarded with three and four stars.  Phuket FantaSea, famous throughout Thailand, is located on this coast. </li><li>  Patong is the most popular beach of which there are no more in Phuket.  Perhaps this area is the center of tourism in the province.  All nightlife is concentrated on Bangla Road, thanks to which Patong is called "Little Pattaya."  Family and hungry tourists have nothing to do here. </li><li>  Karon Beach - This beach is considered the cleanest place on the island.  Here are located restaurants, shops, hotels for every taste.  A comfortable stay in the area is suitable for any type of tourist, especially couples with children. </li><li>  Kata Beach - a beach with poorly developed infrastructure is suitable for those who are looking for peace and tranquility.  There are stunning ocean views in the area. </li><li>  Nai Harn is a small cozy bay in the south of Phuket.  The only hotel and a couple of quiet restaurants offer tourists to enjoy peace and quiet. </li><li>  Nai Yang - a beach that is part of the national park.  Its water area is protected by stunning coral reefs.  Here you can not meet water sports with scooters, so you can enjoy the incredible view of the confluence of the sky and the ocean. </li></ul><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In what country and where is Phuket, everyone knows.  Thailand is rich in history and various cultural monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dy.163.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buddha statue" class="if uuid-3217276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217276.jpg"></div><p>  In the island province you can see the following objects: </p><ul><li>  Figures of the Big Buddha, located in almost all the temples of Phuket.  The huge size allows you to see it from different parts of the island.  The statue rises above the ground by about 500 meters. </li><li>  The true spirit of culture and traditions can be found in the Thai village of Phuket.  Residents of an authentic place will demonstrate a real dance show and realistic sword fights. </li><li>  There are more than thirty Buddhist temples on the island, but the most famous is Wat Chalong Temple.  The date of its construction is still unknown, but there are legends that the construction is more than 150 years old. </li><li>  At Cape Promtep you can capture perhaps the best sunset.  Not only tourist groups, but also national wedding processions come to this observation deck.  Here you can admire another traditional ritual. </li><li>  Phuket Elephant Sanctuary - a reserve in which a natural environment for the life of elephants is created: here there are jungle, and ponds, and mud baths. </li><li>  The snake farm is the most extreme and exotic show in which giant cobras and royal pythons take part.  This idea is best avoided by faint-hearted tourists. </li><li>  In the city of Phuket in Thailand, the On-On Hotel is located.  It is one of the oldest and cheapest hotels on the island.  The movie "Beach" was shot in one of his rooms. </li></ul><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Every season in Phuket is famous for its holidays and festivals.  Here, such events are loved, and most importantly, they know how to organize them. </p><p>  Thao Thep Crassattri and Thao Si Sunthon are the most popular holidays held in the province on March 13th.  This day is celebrated by national heroes who defended their independence in the fight against the Burmese conquerors. </p><p>  The planned December holiday in Phuket can be memorable, because at this time on Kata Beach such a marine holiday as the Royal Regatta is held.  Also on the island became an annual international triathlon tournament. </p><p>  In November, Patong Beach becomes the venue for the legendary Travel Holiday, however, you need to book accommodation here in advance.  In autumn, Thais also celebrate the most romantic and beautiful holiday, Loy Kratong.  In April, you can join the locals in the celebration of the New Year.  In May, Phuket does not stop, but this impression may arise due to rainy weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tuniu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket nightlife" class="if uuid-3217280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217280.jpg"></div><p>  Phuket‚Äôs nightlife is raging all over the island.  Hundreds of bars and discos for every taste await customers around the clock.  Patong's most famous club is Famous.  Particularly popular is the institution Hollywood, the entrance to which is free, but you will have to pay for cocktails. </p><h2>  Children's Phuket </h2><p> Many people wonder: where to relax in Phuket with children, and most importantly, what to do?  Entertainment will be for children of any age.  You should start by visiting various nature reserves with exotic animals.  The most common attraction in Asia is elephant riding, which is offered on almost every beach on the island.  The Butterfly Garden is especially popular with family tourists, where many insects of the most unknown colors and sizes flutter in the halls. </p><p>  In the center of the island there is a grand park of King Rama IX with playgrounds and a lake with tropical trees.  Also, guests of Thailand can visit the water park on Mai Khao, Dino Park on Kata, go-kart park and a giant bungee. </p><p>  Family tourism requires a safe vacation with increased comfort.  For this, families with children most often choose the areas of Karon, Kata Beach, Bang Tao and Surin beaches for living.  This is the epicenter of a calm and comfortable stay, where there is everything you need nearby: from supermarkets and restaurants, to pharmacies and playgrounds. </p><h2>  Tours and prices </h2><p>  Phuket can allow tourists with any financial opportunities to enjoy their vacation.  Year-round warm sea, clean beaches, free discos and many festivals - all this cannot but attract Russian travelers.  Most often, guests of the "land of smiles" stay in hotels and hotels awarded with three or four stars.  The most financially optimal tour offers a system of free breakfasts or "All inclusive".  The level of ticket prices depends on the season.  The lowest price of a tour to Phuket, which includes a flight from Moscow and a two-week stay of two people with check-in at a three-star hotel with breakfast included, will approximately amount to 65 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ddproperty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket View" class="if uuid-3217281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3217281.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The time difference with Phuket and the whole of Southeast Asia did not scare a single Russian who went to experience the depths of the Indian Ocean and the delights of Thai massage.  Tourists say that they spent time on the island pleasantly and cheerfully.  The beaches are clean, the water is warm, the cuisine is traditional, entertainment for every taste.  Travelers say that the island has a very beautiful nature - the jungle, mountains, waterfalls, blue lagoons.  The reviews of excursions in Phuket also say a lot of positive things.
