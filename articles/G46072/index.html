Children of the Soviet country who died for their homeland: Leonid Golikov, Zinaida Portnova, Marat Kazei, Valya Kotik, Vasya Korobko, Larisa Mikheenko - there are dozens, hundreds, thousands of them ...

    <h2>  Larisa Dorofeevna Mikheenko: a brief biography </h2><p>  Larisa Mikheenko was born in the town of Lakhta (near Leningrad) in 1929.  Her parents, mother Tatyana Andreevna and dad Dorofei Ilyich, were ordinary workers.  Mom lived a very long and difficult life, and her father did not return from the Soviet-Finnish war. </p><p>  1941 year.  <span>Summer holidays.</span>  The girl and her grandmother went to the uncle's Kalinin region, but they did not have time to return home.  The war began, and the village of Pechenyovo, Pustoshinsky district, was almost immediately occupied by the Nazis.  Uncle agreed to work for the Germans and was appointed a village headman, and he evicted his elderly mother and pioneer niece to a bathhouse, leaving them to their fate.  Grandmother and the girl were constantly starving, they had to fight, beg and survive, eating a quinoa and peeling potatoes.  Good-natured neighbors who periodically fed bread and milk did not let an elderly woman and granddaughter die of starvation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In the partisan detachment </h2><p>  Spring of 1943.  A friend of Larisa Raisa was handed a summons indicating to come from the youth camp.  This meant that the girl, along with the other guys, would be sent to Germany to work.  Therefore, the girlfriends decided to take refuge in the local partisan detachment, which operated since the beginning of the German occupation.  Beginners were not particularly happy there, and the existence in the forest turned out to be difficult. </p>

    <p>  But the girls did not change their minds to fight against the invaders and, in the face of their older comrades, they made a partisan oath of allegiance to the motherland.  And soon they began to receive important tasks that adults were technically difficult to complete.  The Germans drove the cattle taken from the population to the village of Orekhovo, and the young barefoot scouts with empty baskets went to the Nazi den itself (supposedly for seedlings of cabbage).  From this campaign, the girls brought very valuable information: the number of stationed Germans, the time of their shift, the location of firing points.  After a short time, partisans came into the village and recaptured cattle, unjustly requisitioned by the Germans. </p><h2>  On a responsible assignment </h2><p>  The next task of Larisa was a visit to the village of Chernetsovo.  The girl, posing as a refugee, got a job as a nanny to a local resident. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Also, the girl, along with her friends, distributed propaganda leaflets.  Girls often held such actions in crowded places, most often in churches for church holidays.  Having changed clothes as beggars, the girlfriends turned to the locals allegedly for alms, while they themselves quietly put leaflets folded several times in their pockets and bags.  On the account of Larisa there was even one detention by the Germans, but the girl managed to escape before the enemies found out about her involvement in the partisans.

Having called for one of such operations as an assistant, Larisa, who gathered valuable information about the security regime and the likelihood of mining the bridge over the Drissa River, took part in the bombing of the train.  In addition, the girl managed to convince the miner that she would be able to quietly sneak up close to the bridge and set fire to the approaching train <span>.</span>

    <p>  At the risk of herself, Larisa completed the task with "excellent".  It was for this feat that the fearless girl was awarded (posthumously) the <span>Order of the Patriotic War of the</span> 1st degree.  November 1943  Larisa and two of her associates went on reconnaissance in the village of Ignatovo.  This was the last outing of the partisans.  A traitor was found in the village (according to assumptions, Larisa’s uncle), who surrendered their appearance to the Germans.  In the ensuing unequal battle, two of her companions died, and Larisa herself was interrogated and tortured.  The heart of the brave patriot of her land, who was only 14 years old, stopped beating on November 4, 1943.  Larisa was shot by the Germans. </p>
