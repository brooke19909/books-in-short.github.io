It can be arranged in such a way as to live here even for several days. </p><p>  Usually houses for summer cottages are built from timber.  This material is environmentally friendly and does not require a lot of time during construction.  The house is assembled according to the principle of the designer in a few days. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Summer houses for summer cottages appeared in the 17th century in Germany.  It was in those days that the first gardening associations began to be organized, and, strangely enough, it was the Germans who came up with such "entertainment" as rest in the country. </p><p>  On the territory of our country, houses began to appear only in the thirties of the last century.  Then the main material for the construction was plywood.  The buildings were no more than 16 square meters.  m., the layout consisted of two rooms and a kitchen. </p><p>  In the late 1940s, suburban real estate was legalized at the level of legislation; the state issued land.  Mass construction began. </p>

    <p>  Summer houses for summer cottages (pictured) were built from the remains of old houses, broken furniture, plywood.  Buses and metal garages were installed at the sites. </p><p>  The latest trend (and not only in Russia) - houses made of timber, which are easily transported from one point to another.  For nature lovers, this is a great opportunity to be closer to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  Houses made of timber do not have all the functionality of an apartment or a full-fledged country house, but still they have many advantages: </p><ul><li>  erected as soon as possible; </li><li>  can build with your own hands; </li><li>  do not require interior decoration; </li><li>  a minimum budget is required for construction; </li><li>  glued or profiled timber - these are environmentally friendly materials; </li><li>  no monumental foundation is required, only the foundation; </li><li>  long term of operation; </li><li>  you can put the structure even on loose soil; </li><li>  esthetic external and internal appearance. </li></ul><p>  If you plan to use a summer house for summer cottage in the winter, it is better to give preference to a rounded beam with a diameter of 200x220 mm, or profiled - with a section of 150x220. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  In most cases, a summer house has only one studio room and a room for household needs.  Recently, the popularity of stationary buildings with a terrace, which can act as a place for tea and cooking, has increased. </p><p>  Manufacturers of houses offer collapsible structures.  They consist of modules that can be removed and installed in a new location. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Summer houses for summer cottages</span> <span>(inexpensive to build) can be not only one-, but also two-story, it all depends on the desire and capabilities of the customer.</span>  Also, the model range has the following options: </p><ul><li>  arbor houses; </li><li>  buildings with two exits, for comfortable use of the structure; </li><li>  constructions that perform the role of a change house; </li><li>  houses with a canopy and porch. </li></ul><p>  At the request of the customer, the house can be designed according to an individual outline design. </p>

    <h2>  Several construction rules from manufacturers </h2><p>  Having decided on the construction of a summer house for a summer house, you should use the advice of manufacturers: </p><ul><li>  the blank wall of the building should “look” to the west or northwest; </li><li>  the entrance should be facing southeast or south. </li></ul><p>  In this case, in the morning the sun will shine inside the house, and in the evening there will be no heat indoors.  If, immediately after the construction, finishing finishing and painting of the external walls is carried out, then at least five years no maintenance work will need to be done with the house at all. </p>

    <h2>  We build a house with our own hands </h2><p>  In the implementation of ready-made house projects, which can be done independently or with the help of third parties, it is recommended to observe the elementary requirements for buildings on their own land plots: </p><ul><li>  from the street to the building should be at least 5 meters; </li><li>  from a neighboring site at least 3 meters; </li><li>  from the passage also a minimum of 3 meters. </li></ul><p>  If the site is uneven, then the house is located on a hill, otherwise moisture will accumulate under the building. </p><p>  <em>Base.</em>  After choosing a project and a place for the house, center work is carried out.  Pegs and cord are used.  The easiest way to apply ready-made concrete slabs.  The soil layer is preliminarily removed (about 10 cm deep), gravel is laid along the perimeter of the future structure, rammed, slabs are laid. </p><p>  <em>Floor.</em>  Wooden logs are laid on the base, which are pre-treated with an antiseptic.  As a waterproofing material, roofing material is used.  Bridges are installed between the side lags.  Now, moisture-proof plywood is placed on top, fixed with screws, in increments of about 40 cm. </p><p>  <em>Walls.</em>  All walls (side, back and front) should be assembled separately.  A frame of edged boards is installed.  Bridges are mounted between the posts over the entire height of the frame, which is fixed with screws with a length of 125 mm.  Walls are attached to it. </p><p>  <em>Roof.</em>  Now you can mount the roof, starting with the installation of rafters.  A vapor barrier film is placed on the crate and covered with corrugated board or metal tile.  If the house is not supposed to live in the winter, then it is not necessary to insulate the roof. </p><p>  Installation of the heating system, electricity and water supply can be carried out at will, as well as the interior decoration of the house. </p>
