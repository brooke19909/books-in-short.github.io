If you happen to be the owner of a rare banknote of Russia, then you can sell the find to connoisseurs 10, 50, and sometimes 100 times higher than its face value!  If you yourself are a collector of rare Russian bills, then you will also be interested to know how you can replenish your collection.  Which banknotes are most valued today - read on. </p><h2>  Denominations </h2><p>  Here, the rare banknotes of Russia, respectively, are the money that is no longer printed on the "State Sign".  The most valuable are 5-ruble notes.  They officially stopped printing back in 1999.  Nevertheless, they still remain a relevant means of payment.  And theoretically, such banknotes can be found in circulation. </p><p>  Here are the approximate prices for these rare banknotes of Russia: </p><ul><li>  The bill in good condition - about 250 rubles. </li><li>  Exclusive safety (‚Äúpress‚Äù) - more than 500 rubles.  But on such a banknote should not be the slightest trace of circulation, or folds. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare numbers of banknotes of Russia" class="if uuid-3086424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086424.jpg"></div><h2>  Modification Year </h2><p>  If you are looking for rare Russian banknotes, then the second thing you should pay attention to is a modification.  You can easily find her year in the lower left corner of the banknote. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of Russian paper money, as we see, has not changed much since 1997.  But to increase the level of protection against counterfeiting, wear resistance, certain changes are periodically introduced into the appearance and composition of the bill.  For cash flow is completely painless, but for collectors, many bills in this vein become valuable. </p><p>  To understand which bills are considered rare banknotes of modern Russia, we briefly consider the history of their modifications: </p><ul><li>  year 2001.  The first modification of Russian paper money was made.  Denominations as a result of it acquired luminescent properties - the face value depicted in the lower left corner began to glow with a yellow-greenish light in ultraviolet rays.  Also, in the lower left part, to distinguish from old issues, a small vertical inscription ‚Äú2001 modification‚Äù was applied. </li><li>  2004 year.  The second change in the properties of Russian banknotes.  It is considered the most ambitious - almost all bills in circulation of 10, 50 and 100 rubles of this particular modification.  The main innovation here is the appearance of a metallized "diving" thread.  On the back of the bill, it comes to the surface with five shiny areas.  Special protective fibers were also introduced - in the ultraviolet they glow in red, gray, light green.  There are also two-tone.  The small vertical text here is appropriate - "2004 modification". </li><li>  2010 year.  This modification affected big money - 500, 1000 and 5000 (issued since 2006) rubles.  The main difference is the introduction of special machine-readable security authentication features that are recognized by automatic devices. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.1shilling.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare banknotes of modern Russia" class="if uuid-3086428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086428.jpg"></div><h2>  Modification Cost </h2><p>  Consider how much the rarest banknotes in Russia cost on modification. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's start with the bills in good condition.  Without modifications: </p><ul><li>  5 rubles - 250 p. </li><li>  10 rubles - 350 p. </li><li>  50 rubles - 1000 p. </li><li>  500 rubles - 1,500 p. </li><li>  1000 rubles - 1500 p. </li></ul><p>  Now - the 2001 modification: </p><ul><li>  10 rubles - 200 p. </li><li>  50 rubles - 800 p. </li><li>  100 rubles - 800 p. </li><li>  500 rubles - 1000 p. </li></ul><p>  2004 modification notes: </p><ul><li>  1000 rubles - 1050 p. </li><li>  5000 rubles - 5050 p. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="monetaprice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare 5000 banknote of modern Russia" class="if uuid-3086423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086423.jpg"></div><h2>  What modifications are the most expensive? </h2><p>  Once again, we recall that this is the cost of satisfactorily preserved notes.  When you have in your hands an untouched banknote of the ‚Äúpress‚Äù state, its price increases 2-3 times in comparison with the above. </p><p>  If you have an old piggy bank, you have found a long-term "nest egg" in the pocket of your old clothes, be sure to check the bills for modifications.  If there is no inscription about it, you have the opportunity to sell a banknote ten times more expensive than its face value (we are talking about banknotes 5-100 rubles).  If there is no protective tape on a large banknote, the connoisseur can purchase it at a price 2-3 times higher than the face value. </p><h2>  AA Series </h2><p>  We now turn to the rare series of banknotes of Russia.  As you know, each of the notes has its own individual number.  And every 10 million banknotes - its own series.  These are two letters that you will see before the 7-digit number of the bill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One of the rare series of banknotes of modern Russia is AA.  Such a combination of letters is affixed, respectively, at the very beginning of the production of any modification of paper money.  And such banknotes are very much appreciated by collectors. </p><p>  The connoisseur can offer a price that is 3 times higher than that indicated on the bill (except for its face value).  The most valuable here will be a series of "AA".  This is a 500-ruble note issued in 2001.  They can be bought from you for 3000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare series of banknotes of modern Russia" class="if uuid-3086426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086426.jpg"></div><h2>  The first experimental series </h2><p>  Among the rare series of 5000 banknotes of modern Russia, the so-called experimental ones are most valued.  They are periodically issued by the State Sign for specific tasks: to test the quality of new paper, ink, and to study the durability of banknotes.  To track the experiment, they are marked with a special series and, as a rule, put into circulation in a certain region of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The first such prototypes were 50-ruble banknotes of the AB series and 10-ruble banknotes of the AL series, relating to the 2001 modification.  They were printed on experimental paper, which was then coated with water-repellent varnish.  If such a bill miraculously escaped returning to the "State Sign" and ended up in your wallet, moreover in good condition, you can sell it for 3000 rubles.  Shabby banknotes, on average, are estimated at 1,500 rubles. </p><p>  The rarest in this category are banknotes of 100 rubles in the AB series.  You will be happy to get such a find even for several tens of thousands of rubles. </p><h2>  The second experimental series </h2><p>  The second <span>batch of experimental</span> banknotes was issued in 2006.  They became 10-ruble bills, designated by the series of FF (paper test) and CC (paint test).  This is the 2004 modification money.  As for the cost, the FF ten-ruble is estimated at 1,500 rubles, and the Central Ten-ruble - at 1,200 rubles. </p><p>  The varnish coating was tested on banknotes of 100 rubles of the 2004 modification.  This is a series of UU, CC, FF.  Moreover, paper, varnish were tested at UF, FF, and CC were reference.  The reference point against which experimental money was compared.  Their cost today is approximately the same: 300 rubles - in satisfactory condition, 600 rubles - to the degree of preservation of the "press". </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the rarest banknotes of Russia" class="if uuid-3086419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086419.jpg"></div><h2>  Third experimental series </h2><p>  The latest dilapidation experiment was carried out in 2016.  Again, 100-ruble notes were involved.  We tested the varnish coating, preparing to issue new 200- and 2000-ruble banknotes.  There were immediately eleven experimental series.  They are easy to remember, because everything starts with "U": </p><ul><li>  B. </li><li>  UO. </li><li>  UCH </li><li>  CSS </li><li>  Uh. </li><li>  UK. </li><li>  UN. </li><li>  UE. </li><li>  STR. </li><li>  UB. </li><li>  UA. </li></ul><p>  A separate batch, K, was also released. </p><p>  Moreover, Gosznak divided them into five experimental batches with numbers 1-4 (the batch number is the first digit in the seven-digit number of the bill).  Collectors note: the larger the number, the stronger the smell of paint from the bill.  Series "K" is distinguished by the fact that the banknotes in it are matte, without any varnish coating. </p><h2>  Substitution Series </h2><p>  The last variation of the ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù series of banknotes is the so-called replacement series.  As for the Russian Federation, they appeared in our country relatively recently.  The first issue of banknotes with series of substitution occurred in 2014.  As you remember, then commemorative colored notes were printed for the Olympics in Sochi.  In addition to them, substitute notes were printed. </p><p>  Such paper money distinguishes the letters "Aa" in the series.  Collectors appreciate such banknotes for their small numbers - their circulation is 100-150 times less than the main one.  Why are they printed?  To replace rejected bills within the main issue.  Connoisseurs will buy from you such a banknote 2-3 times more expensive than its value, minus the face value. </p><p>  The following ‚Äúsubstitutions‚Äù were published simultaneously with the start of the printing of ‚ÄúCrimean‚Äù banknotes.  There were significantly fewer than Sochi.  This paper money is allocated by the KS series.  Due to their rarity, collectors will offer you for such a banknote a price several times higher than its face value. </p><h2>  Valuable bill numbers </h2><p>  Now let's pay attention to the rare numbers of banknotes of Russia.  Take a close look at these seven numbers: </p><ul><li>  All characters are the same.  These are banknotes with the number 1111111, 5555555, 7777777, etc.  Considered exclusive among collectors.  If you find such a banknote in your wallet, be sure - they will buy it from you for 3-5 thousand more than the face value. </li><li>  Serial number or reverse serial number.  We are talking about banknotes with the number 1234567 or 7654321 of the most diverse series.  The price of their collectors will be slightly lower than for the previous ones, but you can still easily sell 1000 rubles more than the face value. </li><li>  Radar detectors.  These are numbers 7654567. Cheaper than the previous two.  But nevertheless, it is possible to sell them to a connoisseur several hundred rubles more than the face value. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="nordklad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare banknotes of Russia" class="if uuid-3086430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086430.jpg"></div><h2>  The most expensive bills </h2><p>  What should be, for example, a rare 5000 banknote of modern Russia so that its sale is as profitable as possible?  In conclusion, we consider two options for banknotes, which are appreciated among connoisseurs much more than everyone else: </p><ul><li>  With the number 0000001. Accordingly, this is the first bill in the series.  Regardless of the face value, you can sell it to the connoisseur for an amount of at least 25,000 rubles.  Therefore, it is worthwhile, at least for the sake of interest, to check the number of all paper money falling into your wallet. </li><li>  Samples.  We must say right away that the cost of such rarities does not fall below 40,000 rubles.  Denomination here does not play a significant role.  The fact is that the samples are not intended for mass use at all - only for official use.  Therefore, they can get into circulation only by chance, as a result of an error.  Such paper money is often easy to identify by the inscription "sample" or by numbering - it will contain only one zeros (0000000). </li></ul><p>  Of course, the combination of several valued by collectors signs influences the value of the bill.  For example, a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù number of seven sevens and a face value of ‚Äú5 rubles‚Äù.  Or the first bill with the number 0000001 in a rare experimental series. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotoartefakt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rare series of russian banknotes" class="if uuid-3086427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3086427.jpg"></div><p>  Checking how much money gets into your wallet is not only worth it if you are a collector.  As you can see, such attentiveness can bring you from several hundred to tens of thousands of rubles.  And there is nothing to do: check the modification, series and number of the banknote.  And, of course, to find someone who wants to buy a rare banknote for a high price. </p>
