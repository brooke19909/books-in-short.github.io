    <h2>  Accommodation for tourists </h2><p>  Most vacationers in their reviews describe in sufficient detail the procedure for their placement in the hotel Sunrise Hotel Rhodes 4 * <span>(Greece, Rhodes).</span>  After analyzing, we can conclude that, depending on the time of day, there are no problems with accommodation.  Basically, everyone is satisfied with the staff and the rooms themselves.  Only some tourists say that they got the rooms are not very successful, in remote buildings.  But, as a rule, hotel staff never refuses vacationers in a request to relocate them to a particular room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  One of the undoubted advantages of this hotel, vacationers consider its location.  The chic sea with blue water and the sandy beach attracts most tourists.  The rental service for sun loungers and parasols is paid.  For a set of two sunbeds and umbrellas, the visitor needs to pay eight euros.  You can also pay for this service for several days at once.  In this case, a person is assigned a nameplate.  However, the sand on the beach is quite clean, in principle, rest without a sunbed is also possible.  Visitors also note that the beach is literally a stone's throw from the bar and restaurant.  Each vacationer can spend his breakfast, lunch or dinner on the Mediterranean coast, enjoying the beautiful view and the stunning sounds of the water. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This is an important aspect for many tourists.  When choosing a new vacation spot, most people attach particular importance to the quality of food.  As for the hotel Sunrise Hotel <span>Rhodes 4 * (Rhodes,</span> Lindos), then on this issue the opinions of visitors differ.  Of course, absolutely everyone likes the all-inclusive system.  Most tourists thought the food was ok.  That is, everything was enough, the choice is wide enough, the quality of the products is also completely satisfied.  But still, there are those vacationers who did not really like the food in this hotel.  They note a not very large selection of meat dishes, the almost complete absence of children's food accessories and uniformity.  However, in most cases, vacationers are satisfied.  Also, many note a fairly large abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Bar </h2><p>  At the bar, all drinks are also included in the price here, even alcoholic.  However, all this splendor only lasts until twelve in the morning.  After this time, the bar is open for another hour, but for the money.  Visitors note that, in comparison with Russian prices, alcohol here is not very expensive.  But still, after twelve, only a few people usually remain near the bar. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Here the opinion of vacationers is absolutely identical.  All visitors say that the rooms are always clean.  Cleaning is carried out daily: dust, floors, bathroom are wiped.  In general, everyone was happy with everything.  Tourists also note that the cleaning is timely and fast enough, about ten to twenty minutes.  That is, there are no such cases that you need to get into the room, and there they wash it. </p>

If there are any problems on the technical side of the room, then all problems will be fixed as soon as possible.  The hotel also has the opportunity to rent a car.  This service, by the way, is also paid. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  An incomparable advantage <span>of the Sunrise Hotel</span> Rhodes 4 * <span>hotel</span> , according to reviews, is its unique location.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Sunrise Hotel Rhodes is not very large, but there is everything you need for a pleasant, quality stay.  The village of Lardos is a very interesting and beautiful place.
