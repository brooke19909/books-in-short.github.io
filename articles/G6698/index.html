    <p>  From time immemorial, Sami have inhabited the land here.  From their word ‚Äúurinate‚Äù, which translates as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, the name of the city went. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The city of Monchegorsk <span>(Murmansk region), a</span> photo of which can be viewed in the article, is located outside the polar circle on the shores <span>of Imandra</span> and Lumbolka <span>lakes</span> .  The relief is flat, most of it is at an altitude of 120-130 m above sea level.  The city plan was developed by architects in such a way that the streets located from west to east hide residents from adverse winds.  Not far from Monchegorsk, the Murmansk - St. Petersburg highway runs, and rail links with these cities are also established.  There is a bus transport and minibuses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The city of Monchegorsk in the Murmansk region is located in the northern part of Russia.  The climate is moderately cold.  A large amount of rainfall occurs, the bulk of which falls in the summer months.  The average July temperature is +12.9 ¬∞ C, January - -12.8 ¬∞ C.  Since Monchegorsk is located beyond the Arctic Circle, on this parallel one can observe such natural phenomena as the northern lights, characterized by colorful flashes in the sky, which occur due to contacts of rarefied air with particles of the solar wind.  Also at this latitude are stable polar and <span>white nights.</span>  The first lasts from early December to mid-January, the second - from early May to mid-August. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monchegorsk, Murmansk region" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1265676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The problems of the region </h2><p>  The city-forming enterprise Severonickel, located on the territory of the city, at the end of the last century with its emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere affected the ecology of the region.  This led to the fact that the city of Monchegorsk in the Murmansk region was practically left without vegetation.  However, after the conversion of the enterprise, the picture changed.  <span>Dwarf trees</span> began to grow <span>,</span> elk, bears and hares characteristic of the region appeared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the last century, according to the pollution of water resources and atmospheric air, the area around the city with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1400 square meters.  km belonged to the zone of superhazardous pollution.  From the beginning of the century to the present day, the plant has almost 5 times reduced sulfur dioxide emissions, and the situation has ceased to look so depressing. </p><p>  Also urgent is the need of citizens in high-quality drinking water.  The main reserves of fresh water are in Lake Monche, the excess concentration of impurities of harmful metals in the flood period is noted in some samples by 100 times. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  In 1937, in connection with the development of copper-nickel deposits, the village of Moncha-Guba, now Monchegorsk (Murmansk region), received the status of a city.  After the arrival of geologists who confirmed the presence of the breed, the construction of a working settlement began.  In the conditions of permafrost, immigrants worked, electricity was provided.  In the 70s, it turned out that the deposits of nickel ores are very scarce, and now the company works mainly on imported raw materials. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monchegorsk city of Murmansk region" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1265674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Over the years of the existence of Russia as an independent state, the population of the city has been constantly decreasing, the total figure was approximately 26 thousand people.  Mostly Russians live, the proportion of other nationalities is relatively small. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Monchegorsk <span>(Murmansk region)</span> has the status of a single-industry town, and recently an economic program has been developed to reduce the risks that exist for cities of this status. </p><p>  Of the educational institutions, except secondary schools, there is a branch of St. Petersburg University.  Lesgaft, music school and art school. </p><p>  The city does not have a very developed hotel chain, but the picturesque nature in its vicinity makes tourism in the region a promising business.  Here is a unique Lapland Nature Reserve. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the city has few shops and large shopping centers.  An acute problem is the lack of a modern healthcare system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monchegorsk Murmansk region photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1265673.jpg" width="600"></div>
