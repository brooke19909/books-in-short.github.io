  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mongoloid race</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Mongoloid race is a race of the indigenous inhabitants of northern and eastern Asia, as well as areas of the Far North. </p><p>  It is quite numerous: the number of people who belong to it is about 20% of the total <span>population of the Earth.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Mongoloid race: signs</strong> </p><p>  Representatives of this race have straight hard dark hair, a yellowish tint of skin, brown eyes, prominent cheekbones of the face, a narrow or medium wide nose with a low nose bridge, moderately thickened lips, and a typical skin fold of the upper eyelid that covers the lacrimal tubercle in the inner corner of the eyes.  This fold is called an epicanthus.  A characteristic feature of the Mongoloids is the weak development of the hairline. </p><p>  The Mongoloid race is similar in many ways and origin to the <span>American Indians,</span> who rarely have an epicanthus, the nose is stronger, and the general characteristics of the Mongoloid appearance are often smooth.  In Asia, it is customary to subdivide the Mongoloid race into two main groups - the Pacific and continental: the second differs from the first with darker skin, a very large face, orthognathism, and rather thin lips. </p><p>  <strong>Representatives</strong> </p><p>  Bright representatives of the Mongoloid race are the Mongols, who enslaved most of Eurasia in the 13th century.  Classical Mongoloids (northern Mongoloid race) are also Kalmyks, Tuvans, Buryats, Yakuts.  Mongolians include the <span>Siberian Tatars,</span> which are mixed with the so-called West Siberian race.  Residents of southern China, Japanese, Koreans belong to the southern Mongoloid race, which has signs of mixing with Australoids.  In the population of Southeast Asia and Indochina, this admixture is even more noticeable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>History</strong> </p><p>  All experts in anthropology no longer question the proximity of the Americanoid and Mongoloid races.  Mongoloid Asians and American Indians have a lot in common.  This is manifested not only in the <span>external appearance,</span> but also in genetic traits (MT-DNA and Y-chromosomes are the same).  There is also a similarity of beliefs (the cult of the raven, or the cult of the eagle). </p><p>  Some studies also state that the modern Mongoloid race is younger than the American race.  Typical same Mongoloids (Central Asian type), some scientists attribute to the group of the youngest races.  The question of the origin of the eastern trunk as a whole (the ancestors of the Indians and Mongoloids) is rather complicated.  It is believed that a typical Mongoloid race was formed in Central Asia in a severe climate.  There are many options for its origin, scientists have to find the truth. </p><p>  The incipient Mongoloidism in the Neolithic era appeared in Europe (Bavaria).  The Mongoloid race is distinguished by spade-shaped incisors, and they were just discovered in the synanthropes, who lived 420 thousand years ago. </p><p>  <strong>Territories of contact with other races</strong> </p><p>  These are such zones as the territory of <span>Central Asia,</span> Siberia, and Kazakhstan.  Initially, the Great Steppe was inhabited by Iranian-speaking representatives of the <span>European race</span> (Scythians), but from about the 5th century the Mongoloids settled here. </p><p>  Australoids originally lived in Southeast Asia, but subsequently the Mongoloids penetrated this territory. </p><p>  The Mongoloid race is divided into several sub-races - North Asian, South Asian, Arctic, Far Eastern, American. </p><p>  In addition to three (four, according to another classification) large human races with subraces, there are still small races, special ones, but their origin is not clearly established.  Presumably, they could have formed from ancient poorly differentiated populations at the border of <span>climatic zones</span> (small races - transitional), through contacts of people of different races (small races - mixed), or as a result of distant migrations to unusual living conditions, when it was necessary to adapt to them and to develop other signs or to revive those that were (metamorphic subraces). </p>
