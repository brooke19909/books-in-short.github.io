Which satellite has more Russian channels?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Internet is gradually replacing other ways of disseminating information, but television is still flourishing.  Satellite television is gradually becoming more popular than other methods of broadcasting, but in order to access free channels regularly, you need to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the satellites work. </p><h2>  Satellites </h2><p>  Television satellites are in orbit of the planet in the equator and constantly rotate with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.mediasat.info" data-author=": " data-source="http://en.mediasat.info/2017/03/22/126-ukrainian-channels-broadcast-via-4-satellites-according-to-national-broadcasting-council/"><img itemprop="image" alt="What channels on which satellites" class="if uuid-2231182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231182.jpg"></div><p>  So, each satellite covers a certain territory of the Earth with its signal, which, in fact, depends on which channels on which satellite are located, because certain parts of the planet are inhabited by different nations. </p><h2>  Antenna Operation </h2><p>  The satellite antenna is a ‚Äúplate‚Äù that collects a signal from space in its center and amplifies it to a certain stability.  To receive high-quality broadcasting from remote satellites, you need to install a large diameter antenna.  A converter is installed in the center of each ‚Äúplate‚Äù, which picks up the signals, further converting them into sounds and an image, transmitting them to the receiver.  The latter is installed directly near the TV and plays the role of a receiver.  It finally decodes the signal and transmits the resulting image directly to the screen.  For this, special software is installed in it, which determines which channels from which satellites the device will receive (only free, paid or previously encoded thanks to the installation of new software). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The advantages of satellite broadcasting </h2><p>  Among the advantages should be highlighted: </p><ul><li>  superior quality of transmitted image and sound; </li><li>  unlimited choice of channels (almost all television stations available today broadcast on satellite frequencies); </li><li>  a large number of free channels; </li><li>  the ability to record broadcasts; </li><li>  wide availability (regardless of region of residence); </li><li>  low cost of equipment; </li><li>  the ability to view the program guide directly in the system options. </li></ul><p>  If there were fewer items on this list, perhaps television would not have gained such popularity today. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The main disadvantage is that, no matter what channels are broadcast on which satellite, in bad weather the signal will disappear.  Weather dependence is especially evident when the sky is very cloudy, it rains or snows.  The signal quality also depends on the direction of the antenna; its converter must be facing south, since all satellites are located in the equator area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aaatv.com.au" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.aaatv.com.au/services/satellite-tv/"><img itemprop="image" alt="On which satellite are the Russian channels" class="if uuid-2231183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231183.jpg"></div><p>  If there is an obstacle in the space between the antenna and the satellite, the signal will disappear.  A vivid example: braiding the converter with grapes, flowers or the appearance of a new tree. </p><p>  Also, the receiver must be serviced periodically, since the channels change encodings from time to time and disappear from the screens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of installation and broadcasting </h2><p>  A detailed list of which channels and on which satellites are broadcasting will be presented below.  The main feature in this matter is the choice: watch only free channels or purchase a specific package from a satellite TV provider. </p><p>  If you want to watch your favorite shows and not pay monthly fees for it, consumers most often order a set of two antennas for installation.  This allows you to expand the list of received channels to signals from satellites Eutelsat W4, Astra 4.9 (Sirius), ABS, Yamal and Hotbird. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aerials4u.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.aerials4u.org/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which satellite has more channels" class="if uuid-2231185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231185.jpg"></div><p>  Which satellite will show more Russian channels on depends on the model of the receiver-receiver and its operating system.  So, many channels are now switching to broadcasting in HD quality, while older receivers do not support this, and even when receiving a signal, they will not be able to display the image on the TV screen. </p><p>  Absolutely all television channels <span>from satellites</span> broadcast in the C or Ku bands, which differ in frequency. </p><h2>  <span>Channel list</span> on ABS </h2><p>  This satellite operates in the Ku band and covers almost the entire territory of Eurasia, therefore it is very popular among Russians.  There is only one paid package on the satellite - MTS-TV, the remaining channels are in the public domain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, which satellite has more channels with Russian content?  Let's count together.  ABS satellite offers the following channels for viewing: </p><ul><li>  RU TV; </li><li>  "TNT4"; </li><li>  "Friday"; </li><li>  Moscow Trust; </li><li>  "Moscow 24"; </li><li>  "TV3 +4"; </li><li>  TV TOP SHOP; </li><li>  RBC </li><li>  "Belarus 24"; </li><li>  "TV3 +2"; </li><li>  "Star"; </li><li>  SRW; </li><li>  Fashion TV; </li><li>  "World 24"; </li><li>  TNV; </li><li>  "World"; </li><li>  "Point TV"; </li><li>  "World +4"; </li><li>  "TNT4 +2"; </li><li>  "Together RF"; </li><li>  "My world"; </li><li>  TNT; </li><li>  Channel 8 </li><li>  "360 Channel (Moscow Region)"; </li><li>  TNT +4 and +7; </li><li>  Shopping TV; </li><li>  "Union"; </li><li>  "2X2" and "2X2 Urals"; </li><li>  "Equestrian World"; </li><li>  "Kaleidoscope"; </li><li>  "World HD". </li></ul><h2>  Satellites </h2><p>  It is impossible to answer which channels on which satellites broadcast, knowing only their names.  Astra, for example, is represented by four satellites, spreading their signal to different territories.  Two of them do not have Russian-language channels at all, the third broadcasts Pepper international, and the latter is popular in Ukraine, since it has most of the channels of Ukrainian and in the public domain.  On it, the paid Ukrainian television Viasat-Ukraine also spreads its signal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.satellitetoday.com" data-author=": SES, " data-source="http://www.satellitetoday.com/regional/2015/09/10/ses-launches-ultra-hd-channel-for-tern/"><img itemprop="image" alt="What channels from which satellites" class="if uuid-2231190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231190.jpg"></div><p>  The Amos satellite also broadcasts mainly Ukrainian channels, but carries on its frequencies some Hungarian, Romanian and Israeli ones. </p><h2>  Hotbird channels </h2><p>  This source of information distributes the signals of many television channels in Europe and our country.  Among his pay-TV packages are only foreign offers, and Russian-speaking ones are presented in the public domain.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  RBC </li><li>  TNT; </li><li>  "News"; </li><li>  "RTR Planet"; </li><li>  Chanson </li><li>  "Russia 24"; </li><li>  Euronews; </li><li>  RU-TV; </li><li>  MusicBox Russia; </li><li>  TV RUS; </li><li>  "STS"; </li><li>  "K +"; </li><li>  "ORT" ("Channel 1"); </li><li>  ORT HD; </li><li>  "New world"; </li><li>  "NTV Mir"; </li><li>  Russian Bestseller </li><li>  8 TV RU; </li><li>  "Present"; </li><li>  "Union" and so on. </li></ul><p>  On which satellite can Russian channels be found in large numbers?  Of course, this is Yamal. </p><h2>  <span>List of channels</span> on the Yamal satellite </h2><p>  This source of information is also available in space in several variations under the same name.  Each of its varieties carries on board a wide list of publicly available <span>federal channels</span> and distributes them in different ranges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazprom.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.gazprom.com/press/news/2014/december/article210849/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which satellite has more Russian channels" class="if uuid-2231195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231195.jpg"></div><p>  Among its information flows, citizens are most interested in: </p><ul><li>  TNT; </li><li>  REN-TV; </li><li>  Disney </li><li>  "Home"; </li><li>  "Russia 24"; </li><li>  "Star"; </li><li>  "Russia 2"; </li><li>  "TV3"; </li><li>  NTV; </li><li>  "STS"; </li><li>  NTV; </li><li>  "Pepper"; </li><li>  "Yu" and others. </li></ul><h2>  More satellites </h2><p>  Which satellites will be preferred on which satellites?  It depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence.  So, specifically for residents of the Far East, the Urals and Siberia, the Express satellite broadcasts its frequencies.  On its board there were paid channel packages and free, but with a temporary displacement relative to Moscow.  Specialized broadcasting for Siberia is also available on the Bonum satellite. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": chaz9127, " data-source="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1zqi1c/every_single_satellite_orbiting_earth_in_a_single/"><img itemprop="image" alt="What channels are on which satellite" class="if uuid-2231207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231207.jpg"></div><p>  If you choose a satellite solely by the number of free channels, then from the remaining list you can select ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù, ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù, ‚ÄúAzerSpice‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntelsat‚Äù.  The latter is also popular due to the large number of radio stations.  Among less common variants, Russian-language channels in small numbers can be found on the Asiasat satellite. </p><h2>  Paid Popularity </h2><p>  What satellites are which channels located?  This is approximately understandable, now you should deal with the popularity of such a source of information as Eutelsat W4, because in the above list it is not mentioned anywhere.  The peculiarity of this satellite is that its broadcasting provides broadcasting of paid channel packages such as Tricolor and NTV Plus throughout the country.  Due to the maximum popularity of these operators among the population, this satellite has gained popularity in our country.  Of course, almost all channels on it are encoded and are opened only to subscribers after payment, but you can also find on its list the open frequencies of the Orthodox Soyuz and Kazan TNV. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So on which satellites are the Russian channels in greater quantity?  It all depends on the desire to watch free broadcasts or purchased channel packages from popular operators.  In most cases, citizens prefer to save money and prefer to periodically change the settings of their receivers.  At the same time, it is best to direct your antennas to the Yamal, ABS, or HotBerd satellites.  At the same time, one should be prepared for periodically having to lay out a certain amount to a specialist who is able to return the missing channels, and they will necessarily disappear with time.  Also, free television (even on satellite broadcasting) rarely provides subscribers with good picture and sound quality.  The dependence of the operation of such equipment on the weather is very high, and you will have to pay extra for each breakdown. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ityunit.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.ityunit.com/2017/11/how-to-install-tstv-satellite-dish-watch-free.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="What channels are broadcast on which satellite" class="if uuid-2231211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2231211.jpg"></div><p>  Paid operators offer their subscribers more favorable conditions, since the quality of their broadcasting is always at the highest level and at the same time the weather dependence is not so strongly felt.  Operators also offer customers professional service maintenance of specialized equipment in the event of a breakdown.  At the same time, broadcasting of channels also equally spreads throughout the country, the main thing is that there should be a sky over it.  Maybe thanks to such qualitative advantages, most of the subscribers today are switching to paid satellite TV operators and are ready to pay a fixed amount for the timely elimination of any problems. </p><p>  Paid operators regularly offer new customers promotional offers for connecting and buying channel packages.  Such ways to save have always attracted people, and this case is no exception.  There are more and more subscribers willing to pay to watch their favorite shows.  Of course, the owners and those who want to put themselves a "plate" for free use are also many. </p>
