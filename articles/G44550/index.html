    <p>  Nine years and two weeks after the death of Joseph Stalin, his youngest son passed away.  His fate was tragic, although to many he seemed a darling of fate.  The circumstances of the death of V.I. Dzhugashvili remain mysterious today. </p><p>  About how Vasily Stalin died, few knew.  Maria, the woman who became his last love, was not among them.  At the end of February 1962, she was not very politely asked to leave the small Kazan apartment, which became the last earthly abode of the “Kremlin celestial,” Major General and son of “the most powerful man on the planet.” </p>

    <p>  A certain Nusberg, an employee of the state security and the Serbsky Institute, who was considered Vasily’s wife, rushed to Kazan after the unsuccessful trip of Marisha and her aunt to Moscow for the truth.  The attempt was really naive, they could even get to Voroshilov himself, but instead of the "first red officer" who, according to their idea, could intercede for Vasya, they saw an old man with an extinct look, honestly admitting that he did not solve anything else. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The decisive lady began by expelling a tenant not registered on her from the living space, namely Mary.  Then she got down to business.  Some injections completely paralyzed the will of the prisoner of the fifth floor of Khrushchev’s, and on March 19, “who needs” reported to “who needs” that V. I. Dzhugashvili was no longer there. </p>

    <p>  The Kremlin decided to simplify the entire ritual as much as possible so that the smallest possible number of people would know where Vasily Stalin was buried.  It is not known what NS Khrushchev was frightened of by a dead man who was broken during his lifetime, but even veteran pilots were forbidden to wear awards, escorting their commander and comrade to the last journey.  The orders were under civilian coats, and when fighting friends bowed low, they were visible. </p><p>  And after decades, every pilot of the war years, arriving in Kazan, found out where Vasily Stalin was buried and visited his grave, thereby expressing, sometimes only to himself, loyalty to his memory and respect for his son and father.  It may seem to someone a fallacy such an attitude towards the dictator and his spoiled descendant, but it deserves at least respect. </p><p>  The people present at the funeral noted a lack of military honors, it seemed unfair to them.  Vasily was a brave officer, and if only one enemy plane was shot down (according to other sources - two), it was only because after Jacob's capture, his father forbade him to risk his life. </p>

    <p>  Mysterious traces of beatings were also noticed on the face, and how some woman covered his uniform with tulle, apparently at someone’s direction.  There were a lot of people, the sad news in the provincial city spread quickly, and now it was no longer possible to hide the number of the site at the Arskoye cemetery in Kazan, where Vasily Stalin was buried. </p><p>  Time gradually puts everything in its place.  Today, it is clear to almost everyone that the heartbroken son accused his father's associates of poisoning him in a fit of temper, and, having done many other stupid things, did not conduct anti-Soviet agitation.  Vasily Iosifovich was very uncomfortable with the leadership of that time, he did a lot and said wrong, but the cruelty shown to this brave and open person was excessive.  In 1999, he was completely rehabilitated.  The body was reburied next to Maria at the capital's Troekurovsky cemetery. </p><p>  The Moscow grave of Vasily Stalin did not become a place of pilgrimage, but someone still brings flowers to it. </p>
