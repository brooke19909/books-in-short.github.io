Soviet newspapers in the front pages published their portraits.  Live radio journalists reported unparalleled, incredible achievements that other countries could not boast of.  Their names, along with the names of the top leaders of the state, were known to both children and adults.  Swift, daring, fearless.  People for whom, it seemed, there were no barriers - the first Soviet pilots stormed new records of speed and altitude.  Among them was the pilot Anisimov - a native of a small Russian village, who took a place among the best aces of young Soviet aviation. </p><h2>  From the Novgorod outback </h2><p>  The village of Visits in the Novgorod region today is not distinguished by anything remarkable.  And at the end of the century before last, it was a very small village, which can be found in the vastness of Russia.  Here in 1897 the future Soviet <span>test pilot Anisimov</span> was born <span>.</span>  <span>Alexander</span> Frolovich did not even know the month of his birth.  Modern biographical sources cannot be unambiguously determined whether he was born in July or November.  Therefore, they write - he was born on November 28 (according to other sources on July 28).  Information about the parents of the pilot was not preserved - apparently he did not like to remember his childhood. </p>

    <p>  It seems that from a young age the guy was interested in technology.  By the age of 15, he graduated from a four-year school in Novgorod.  Driver and mechanic - these were the first working professions.  In native Rides with such a specialty, he could become an indispensable person.  But he stayed in Novgorod - until 1914 he worked as a driver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An interesting fact: having become a famous pilot, Anisimov for several years led the line of five red fighters that flew during the parades over Red Square. </p><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  In 1914, exactly on one of the possible birth dates of Alexander Frolovich (July 28), the First World War broke out.  After 3 days, the Russian Empire entered into a fierce European battle - on July 31 mobilization was announced and the Novgorod driver changed his driver's jacket to a soldier's uniform.  The aviation units of the Russian army were the largest among the allies, but there were sorely lacking qualified specialists in them.  Soldiers who had technical specialties were sent to training and became aviation mechanics. </p><p>  Anisimov got to study at the ShMAS (school of junior aviation specialists), which was formed on the basis of the Polytechnic Institute in St. Petersburg.  The courses of motorists in an accelerated manner prepared mechanics for servicing aircraft at the front.  After completing training, in February 1915, a new mechanic arrived in the 4th aviation fighter squad - non-commissioned officer Anisimov. </p><p>  Test pilot - in tsarist Russia, a peasant guy couldn‚Äôt even have such a dream.  But the first step on the road to heaven was taken. </p><h2>  Warlet </h2><p>  The revolution and the ensuing Civil War made it impossible to return to peaceful work.  Alexander Frolovich was in the ranks of the revolutionary detachments that overthrew the Provisional Government and fought with the cadets of the Vladimir School, who staged counter-revolutionary demonstrations.  Having joined the Red Army, he continues to serve in aviation.  The senior minder serves the planes that make combat flights over the positions of the white whales and white poles, conduct reconnaissance in the rear of the army of Yudenich.  But there was already a goal for himself to ascend into the sky, and Anisimov was seeking directions to study at the Egorievsky theoretical military aviation school.  The old monastery, which housed cadets, small cells for two people and intense classes - the school gave only theoretical knowledge.  He still had to learn to fly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Having mastered the theoretical part of training (1922), cadet Anisimov undergoes flight training at Kachinsky and Moscow aviation schools (1923).  A year later, a flying school in Serpukhov - here he masters the skills of aerial shooting and bombing.  After training in the combat units of the Air Force of the Red Army, military pilot Anisimov, already well prepared for any tasks, comes to the service.  The difficult road to heaven has been covered. </p><p>  Anisimov believed that a pilot is an artist in the sky.  Therefore, he must have his own airwriting.  Young pilots sometimes said that he was afraid of competition and therefore did not reveal the secrets of his skill. </p><h2>  Conquering the sky </h2><p>  A rumor flew over the combat aviation units - a fighter appeared in Kiev with impeccable aerobatics.  Alexander Frolovich really had great flying talent.  His favorite technique was piloting at low altitude - accurate calculation, sophisticated technique, courage and a great feel for the car.  In a short time, the young pilot was able to achieve great success and was appointed to command the link in the 3rd Kiev squadron.  The invitation to become a test pilot at the Research Institute of the Air Force (1928) was a well-deserved recognition of his skill.  Although he was a difficult person - he liked to argue, could sharply object.  Many were puzzled by his favorite word "guy."  What this meant, no one knew.  Under various circumstances, from surprise to contempt. </p>

    <p>  During this period, the pilot Anisimov became the tester of new models of fighters.  <span>Pavel Sukhoi,</span> under the leadership of Sergei Tupolev, created the I-4 - the first all-metal light fighter.  The I-5, which was designed by N. Polikarpov and D. Grigorovich, later became the main aircraft model in fighter aircraft.  Anisimov gave a ticket to the sky for these cars.  Alexander Frolovich on I-4 participated in another grandiose project of Soviet aircraft designers - ‚ÄúLink‚Äù, which involved expanding the range of light fighters - delivering them over long distances, suspended under the wings of a large aircraft.  In 1931, Anisimov was appointed to command a detachment of testers of the Air Force Research Institute. </p><h2>  In the ranks of the best </h2><p>  Many prominent Soviet pilots were Anisimov‚Äôs colleagues in test work at the Air Force Research Institute.  M. M. Gromov, A. B. Yumashev, I. F. Kozlov, A. I. Zalevsky.  Warm friendships connected him with a talented pilot and tester - Valery Chkalov, whom he met at the Yegoryevsk flying school.  They often flew in pairs - Chkalov and Anisimov.  Alexander Frolovich respected Valery, who was 7 years younger than him.  Best friends on earth - in the sky they became implacable rivals.  Their impromptu air battles, which the whole airfield watched with bated breath, often ended with official penalties.  But testing new cars, the pilots considered it their duty to test their flying qualities in any, the most difficult conditions. </p>

    <p>  Another classmate at a flying school is P.I. Grokhovsky.  He became a designer, whose inventions Alexander Frolovich had to test.  Grokhovsky was seriously engaged in parachute landing systems.  It was he who came up with a way to drop cargo using a breakdown.  The tester who piloted the plane during the experiment was A.F. Anisimov. </p><h2>  Interesting </h2><p>  For violation of flight regulations and air hooliganism, Anisimov and Chkalov were frequent ‚Äúguests‚Äù at the airfield guardhouse.  Often, they were brought directly from the cell to the airfield in order to show foreign delegations the combat capabilities of the latest Soviet fighters.  And then both pilots created in the sky all those risky elements, because of which they were sent to guardhouse. </p><h2>  Interrupted flight </h2><p>  The death of Alexander Anisimov came as a result of <span>an accident.</span>  On October 11, 1933, a film group arrived at the airport to shoot Anisimov‚Äôs flight on an I-5 fighter.  The demonstration flight took place at a low altitude and was saturated with elements of aerobatics.  Before landing, the pilot several times dived directly onto the movie camera, taking the plane out of a dive above the ground.  Then he made an immelman, and so it happened several times.  At the next execution of the figure, the plane seemed to freeze at the top point of the immelman with the wheels turned upside down.  Losing speed, he began to sink down.  So he fell to the ground - right on the cab, with wheels looking at the sky.  The conclusion of the aviation commission - the accident occurred due to a broken steering wheel control pedal.  On that day, the talented test pilot and masterly ace aerobatics pilot Anisimov died.  The biography of his aviation achievements was cut short as suddenly as a broken pedal mount, which cost the pilot a life. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p><strong></strong>  Oddly enough, but there is another version of the death of an outstanding aviator.  Polar pilot M. Kaminsky recalled that before landing, Anisimov made a ‚Äúdead loop‚Äù several times, while at the bottom of its trajectory the plane almost touched the ground.  At this time <span>, an</span> R-5 <span>reconnaissance aircraft landed</span> at the airport.  Its trajectory intersected with the direction of movement of the I-5, which was piloted by Anisimov.  To avoid a collision, Alexander Frolovich tried to take the fighter to the side, but the height was too low.  The plane winged the ground - the pilot died. </p><p>  V.P. was a witness to this tragedy.  Chkalov.  At the funeral of his friend, he stood on guard of honor and was completely depressed.  There were tears in his eyes. </p>
