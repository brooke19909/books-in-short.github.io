The Petrine reforms brought the country out of medieval stagnation and put it on a par with the European powers.  How did he do that?  Read the article to the end, and you will learn about the most significant Peter's reforms. </p><h2>  Provincial Reform </h2><p>  After the Great Embassy, ‚Äã‚ÄãPeter decided to radically change the administrative division in Russia.  For which he carried out the reforms that turned Russia into one of the leading world powers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="saint-petersburg-russia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg in the 19th century" class="if uuid-2527452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2527452.jpg"></div><p>  In the history of Russia, 1708 was marked by a provincial reform.  The state was divided into 8 provinces.  Each was headed by the governor, whom Peter chose independently.  Thus, the whole country was under control, which prevented riots and uprisings. </p><p>  The goal of the provincial reform was to abolish the old administrative division of the country and create a new European state.  In addition, Peter not only strengthened the autocratic power, but also created an effective taxation apparatus. </p><p>  After the provincial reform, the army and navy were promptly supplied with the necessary equipment, which contributed to the victory of the Russian Empire in the Northern War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background of the Northern War </h2><p>  At the end of the 18th century, a conflict was brewing between the countries of the Baltic basin.  Sweden captured the Baltic states and occupied the Baltic Sea.  The Russian Empire, together with Denmark and Saxony, concluded the Northern Union, according to which Russia pledged to start military operations in 1700. </p><p>  The main reasons for Russia's participation in the conflict: </p><ul><li>  access to the Baltic Sea, which ensured state security and economic development; </li><li>  resolution of the territorial dispute over Karelia and Ingermanland. </li></ul><h2>  Joining Ingermanland </h2><p>  After the outbreak of the Northern War, Peter was determined to conquer the disputed Ingermanland territory.  By 1704, it was transferred to the Russian Empire.  And in 1706, Peter the Great was developing a project on provinces.  To verify the practical implementation of the bill, the king first introduced it in Ingermanland.  Thus, the decrees of 1706 appeared Ingermanland province. </p><p>  During the defeat in the Northern War in the southern regions of the country: Astrakhan, Don cities, Bashkiria, uprisings and riots break out.  There were several reasons for the unrest: </p><ul><li>  long defeats in the Northern War; </li><li>  recruitment kits; </li><li>  tax collection. </li></ul><p>  To end the unrest, the provincial reform began.  Peter the Great began to establish imperial power in the field. </p><p>  Ingermanland, which was located on the banks of the Neva, was limited to the Gulf of Finland, Lake Peipsi and Ladoga. </p><p>  In the possessions of the first province was a fairly vast territory.  It included not only Ingermanland, but also part of the Novgorod lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Later, Ingermanland province was renamed St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="history-maps.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://history-maps.ru/pictures/all_1/r_183_0/s_4_1/max_36/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ingermanland in the 19th century" class="if uuid-2527447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2527447.jpg"></div><p>  After the victory, the construction of the second capital, St. Petersburg, began near the village of Lesnoy. </p><h2>  Battle of the Forest Village </h2><p>  Russia got involved in a long war without completing army reform.  In this regard, the Russian Empire for several years suffered defeat after defeat. </p><p>  However, 1708 in the history of Russia completed the series of defeats of the Russian army.  <span>The battle at the village of Lesnoy is</span> considered the "mother of the Poltava battle."  This is the bloodiest and fiercest battle in the Northern War.  Russian and Swedish soldiers fought until the last soldier. </p><p>  The battle began on September 28, 1708.  Peter the Great commanded the Russian forces, and Carl commanded the <span>Swedish army</span> .  Levangaupt's detachment came to the aid of the enemy regiments.  In order to prevent the Swedish armies from uniting, Peter fought a battle at Lesnaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petroart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of Poltava" class="if uuid-2527434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2527434.jpg"></div><p>  The battle took place in a small clearing near the forest.  This circumstance did not allow the Swedes to completely transfer their troops and realize numerical superiority. </p><p>  The battle ended in victory for the Russian army. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  1708 in the history of Russia was a turning point for the state.  The war continued until 1721, but during this period Russia did not defend, but, on the contrary, seized new territories.  Permanent defeats in the Northern War ended after the battle at the village of Lesnoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yaplakal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian troops" class="if uuid-2527439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2527439.jpg"></div><p>  The events of 1708 in Russia strengthened and modernized the state.  The country has become a European superpower. </p><p>  Foreign and domestic policies strengthened the country and led it to victory in the Northern War and access to the Gulf of Finland.  Since 1721, Russia has become the Russian Empire. </p>
