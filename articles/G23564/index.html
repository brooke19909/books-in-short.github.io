This speaks first of all of the cunning and insincerity of a person who says so.  Is a bluffing person bad or is bluffing good? </p><h2>  Bluffing player </h2><p>  The original interpretation of the word says that bluffing is a deliberately false exaggeration of one‚Äôs capabilities, abilities or virtues.  That is, if you look in more detail, it turns out that the absolute synonyms of the term ‚Äúbluff‚Äù are the words ‚Äúlie‚Äù, ‚Äúdeceive‚Äù. </p><p>  However, in card games, such as poker, bluffing is a perfectly acceptable technique used by players taking risks to win.  That is, they deliberately exaggerate their capabilities and the power of the cards in their hands.  Why do they do it?  The answer is very simple: other players, believing in a bluff, the cunning of this player, may be afraid to continue playing with him and raise bets.  Accordingly, they save and the gain will go to the player who deceived them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluff it" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39141/1052909.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  However, bluffing in poker does not mean winning.  The company may not pay attention to exaggeration or simply not believe in it.  In this case, the players continue the game, and the person talking about the excellent layout of the cards will lose without options.  That is, it turns out that bluffing acceptable in this game is basically the same risk.  After all, it is unrealistic to find out in advance whether the remaining players will believe the bluffer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This tactic is used in addition to poker in other card games, such as preference.  Here it is also directly related to risk. </p><h2>  Bluffing in everyday life - good or harm </h2><p>  The fact that an exaggeration of one‚Äôs capabilities is normally perceived during a card game is quite understandable - that‚Äôs why it is a game.  But in everyday life, everything is much more complicated.  Constantly bluffing sooner or later will create a reputation as a liar and a person with whom almost no one wants to deal.  No matter how anyone would like to tell others about a villa in Hawaii or a black belt in karate, sooner or later the fraud will come out.  Someday, either you yourself will have a chat, or one of the "well-wishers" will tell others that your villa in Hawaii is just a cottage, and quite far from the city. </p><p>  The same goes for advances in martial art.  Life is multifaceted and unpredictable.  It is likely that a situation will arise during which you will have to demonstrate your special ability to tame the enemy, and at this time you can do absolutely nothing, because the black belt in karate is just a figment of your imagination.  Here is a bluff - a word that sounds pretty pathetic in itself can significantly ruin your life.  It is unlikely that people who sincerely believe in your stories will continue to communicate with you after disclosing the fraud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Falsehood </h2><p>  In emergency situations, when, as they say, all means are good, bluffing can be beneficial.  Take, for example, tourists traveling in the snowy mountains.  The weather is a capricious lady, and suddenly a storm that struck everyone lost their way.  If not experienced tourists but beginners come together, it is only natural that a panic could begin.  But this is already completely undesirable in such a critical situation, when a sober view of things is necessary.  In this case, if someone present, who more or less keeps himself in control, exaggerates the information and says that he knows where the path is and how to get back, then a little worried companions, instead of starting to panic, will help determine landmarks or prepare a place for an overnight stay.  In a specific example, bluffing is the only way to take control of a situation and find a way out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluff guile" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1053236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bluffing to reduce suffering </h2><p>  Another model of a situation in which bluffing can be justified is an exaggeration of the possibility of recovery for terminally ill relatives.  That is why, when making a diagnosis incompatible with life, doctors most often report it not to patients, but to relatives.  Unfortunately, if the patient knows that his days are numbered, he will usually burn out in a matter of days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluff word" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39141/1052904.jpg" width="600"></div>  Those patients who were convinced by the bluffing relatives that with the help of high-quality medications they will soon recover, can live for quite a long time and die quietly, without unnecessary suffering and worries.
