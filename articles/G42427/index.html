However, you can multiply your savings, just put the money into your bank account.  Thanks to the contribution, you can not only save your money, but also get a good profit in the form of a monthly accrual of interest on the invested amount. </p><p>  In order to pre-calculate the possible profit, you can use the deposit calculator.  Specifying the necessary parameters, deposit amount, monthly deposit of money into the account and the period for which you want to invest money, you will receive the total deposit amount, as well as see the amount that will be credited to you in the form of interest on the deposit. </p><p>  The advantage of a deposit to the bank is not only that your money will remain intact, but will also increase.  After all, keeping money at home is not only not profitable, but also dangerous, because a fire or just a house theft can happen.  And having made a contribution, you can not worry that something will happen to your savings.  You can also take out insurance, then in case of bankruptcy or other situations, you are guaranteed to receive your money.  Therefore, you absolutely have nothing to worry about. </p><p>  When making a deposit, followed by constant replenishment of the account, you can get a higher percentage.  In general, the interest rate depends not only on the term of the deposit, but also on the amount you invest and the possibility of making additional funds monthly.  Before you make a deposit, you need to familiarize yourself with all the rules for its registration, most often the client‚Äôs disagreements with the bank begin when a certain amount of money is withdrawn.  But the bank does not pay the deposit in part until the deposit expires.  Therefore, before signing the documents, be sure to familiarize yourself with all the rules and charges, so that subsequently there are no problems with getting your money.  Some banks allow you to cash out the accrued interest on a monthly basis, but not the principal amount. </p><p>  If you still doubt the profitability of making a deposit, check out the offers of several banks and choose the most suitable conditions for you, because all banks offer different conditions and different fees for depositing funds.  Also decide on the period for which you are ready to contribute money. </p><p>  And if you want to know in advance how much you will receive in excess of your contribution, use the online version of your profit calculation http://www.tcsbank.ru/. </p></div></article>
