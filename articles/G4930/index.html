Rest can be informative, beach, entertaining or mixed, when a person can have fun and diversify the trip with interesting excursions, visits to entertainment venues and a stay on the beach.  In this regard, Vietnam provides a great choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-270411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/270411.jpg?1532642125"></div><p>  When it is better to go on vacation to this country, it depends on what the tourist expects from the trip and which city he is going to.  In Vietnam, the terrain is very diverse, in addition, the country has a considerable length from north to south, so at the same time different weather conditions reign in opposite corners of the state.  The trip will bring only joyful emotions and good memories, if the rest is not overshadowed by constant rains.  When thinking about when it is better to go to Vietnam, you should opt for the dry season.  In the south, it lasts from December to April, and in the north - in May, June, September and October. </p><p>  When choosing well-known resorts, it is necessary to book hotel reservations in advance, because many experienced travelers know when it is better to go to Vietnam, and you just don‚Äôt have time to buy a tour.  At the same time, not too advertised cities will gladly welcome guests even during the peak season, and rest in them is no worse than at the famous resorts.  The optimal period for traveling to <span>Phu Quoc</span> is November ‚Äì March, with the exception of February.  In Phan Thiet, tourists feel great in the winter months, in Hoi An from mid-spring to the end of summer, in Da Nang - from October to March, in Nha Trang - from February to September. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-270410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/270410.jpg?1532642125"></div><p>  For many, the concept of when it is better to go to Vietnam does not mean good climatic conditions, but the cost of tours.  During the rains you can also have a very good rest, during this period there are not so many travelers, hotels are half empty and make significant discounts to customers.  In addition, you should not think that there are heavy rains all day, rainfall is short, and you can easily wait in a cafe or visit museums and other educational places in order to get to know Vietnam better. </p><p>  Where it is better to go depends on the desired vacation.  If you need a beach, it is preferable to go to Phan Thiet.  This is a beautiful seaside resort with sand dunes, the city has a huge number of hotels and restaurants, where they prepare amazing seafood dishes.  For lovers of educational holidays, it is best to go to Hanoi - the capital of Vietnam, as it is the most colorful city from the entire Asian region.  Tourists will notice a peculiar combination of West and East, will be able to wander along the spacious streets, admire the ancient colonial villas, visit near quiet lakes and relax in the bosom of amazing nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-270412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/270412.jpg?1532642125"></div><p>  If there is a question about where and when it is better to go to Vietnam with children, it is recommended to take a vacation in October or June and go to Nha Trang.  There is Winperl Park, Monkey Island is located nearby with all kinds of attractions.  Adults will enjoy a diverse nightlife, coral reefs, white sand and mud hospitals.  Holidays in Vietnam will be remembered for a long time, because it is a very colorful and interesting tourist country. </p><p>  Read more at <noindex>  <span>Gkd.ru</span> </noindex>  . </p>
