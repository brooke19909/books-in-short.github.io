How to make a paper ribbon flower</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To decorate institutions, offices, kindergartens, schools, restaurants use paper flowers.  Bright paper tapes, corrugated rolls or colored office paper are suitable for them.  Although in the floristic departments you can buy the most diverse in width, color and texture of the tape.  Let us consider in more detail how to make <span>paper flowers:</span> roses, peonies, chrysanthemums, forget-me-nots, mallow. </p><h2>  Ways to make roses </h2><p>  Each master makes roses in his own way.  For decorative purposes, when flower heads are glued to branches, thick paper is taken.  It is better to take a velvet dark red or burgundy color.  Cut the paper into squares.  Make a circle out of them.  Now spiral from the edge to cut the strip to the center.  Try to keep the line straight.  Then, taking the middle in the fingers, you begin to twist the rose bud.  Fasten the edge of the paper and stick it to the branches. </p><p>  You can make a flower out of paper tape.  To do this, take a corrugated long tape 6-8 centimeters wide.  Bend the edge throughout the tape a centimeter out.  Now insert the wire with or without stamens on one edge, form the core by tightly wrapping the paper. </p><p>  Next, in a circle, wrap the <span>ribbon, adjusting the</span> shape of the rose.  At the last stage, glue the edge, wrap the stalk with green paper, fasten the leaves.  If you wrap everything with wrapping paper, diluting the flowers with artificial branches, decorative berries, small flowers, you will get a bouquet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make paper flowers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634756.jpg" width="343"></div>

To do this, draw a circle on the sheet, divide it into sectors, then round the petals.  Now, with scissors, cut out the sector and bend the petal with them. </p><p>  That is, put a third of the sector on the blade of the scissors, holding the paper with your fingers, pull the petal up.  As a result, the edge is rounded.  Collecting such petals in a flower, you can achieve magnificent volumes.  Children can create a bend with a pencil. </p><p>  How to make paper flowers from patterns?  Cut the tape into squares.

    <h2>  Making peonies out of squares </h2><p>  For lush flowers you need corrugated or wrapping paper.  Fold it in several layers in a square.  Its size determines the diameter of the future flower.  Now fold the shape back into a small square.  On both sides, cut in zigzags at the edges.  These will be the petals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flatten the paper to a large square.  "Accordion" bend from one edge to another all the paper.  In this case, the zigzag determines the fold width of the accordion.  If the width of the resulting strip is large, then make small cuts on each side.  Tie up with tape or wire.  Spread each layer up, adjusting the shape.  So fast you can make <span>paper</span> <span>flowers with your own hands.</span> </p><p>  To diversify their color scheme, add a core.  To do this, fold an accordion from another paper, similar in width to a strip of flower.  Notch along the edges, creating a lush fringe of stamens.  Straighten the harmonica of the flower and the core, lay on top of each other, fold it again in folds. </p><h2>  Continuing to create lush flowers </h2><p>  Connect the resulting line with the edges to each other so that the core is on the other edge.  Attach the flower to the stem, begin to straighten the petals one at a time, lifting the stamens up.  Depending on how the edge of the accordion is rounded, you get a different shape of asters, chrysanthemums, peonies, etc. The nested center of the flowers also helps to keep the shape of the flower, creating the desired volume.  You can also create spherical marigolds. </p><p>  How to make a paper flower ball: </p><ul><li>  Take corrugated paper in several layers (the more there are, the more magnificent the product). </li><li>  Make a square or rectangle in diameter of the flower. </li><li>  Fold the accordion. </li><li>  On both sides, round or sharpen the petal. </li><li>  Bend the accordion in half, defining the middle. </li><li>  Make shallow cuts and secure with wire or tape if the ball hangs from the ceiling. </li><li>  Carefully spread each layer on both sides, give the shape of a petal.  Form layers not only up, but also down, creating a ball. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper ball flower" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634781.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to make paper flowers in an unusual shape? </h2><p>  Thin paper (corrugated, creped, packaging) well takes any shape.  Here's how to make forget-me-nots: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Take a bead (its size determines the width and depth of the petal). </li><li>  Attach to paper and cut the rectangles. </li><li>  Put a bead in the middle of the segment, tighten the edges tightly on both sides. </li><li>  Cut off the tip from one edge and fix it with colorless glue.

If you take a tennis ball, you will get large flowers.  They can easily be built by older preschoolers, since making large paper flowers is not difficult.  By combining them in bouquets, you can decorate the music room for the holiday or give it to mothers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make paper flowers instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634784.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Elongated flowers </h2><p>  Using scissors and glue, you can create a wide variety of flowers: lupine, calla lilies.  You make lupine from a wide paper tape.  To do this, cut a long strip.  From one edge, bend the paper a centimeter (for this side you will glue the flower to the stem).  From the other end, cut the paper to the fold line.  The width of the stripes determines the width of the petal.  Despite the ease of manufacture, only school-age children will be able to make paper flowers with their own hands. </p><p>  Then round each strip with scissors inward (if you put the segment with a fold towards you, then twist the edges of the stripes in the same direction).  Next, make a stalk by pasting a wire or stick with green paper.  Make pointed leaves right away.  It is enough to fold the paper with an accordion, sharpen the edge and round the petals (not much, just to give a bend). </p><p>  Take the stem, around it begin to twist the obtained lambs in a spiral.  The resulting rings look out.  A lupine form is created.  Glue the leaves to the bottom of the stem, also in a circle, straighten each petal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper flower bouquet" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634785.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a large paper flower with a needle and thread? </h2><p>  For large flowers that are placed in floor vases, more material is needed.  From a roll of paper tape, cut a long strip.  Fold it in several layers.  If there is not enough volume, then put the same paper of a different shade on top.  Bend one centimeter three to five centimeters.  Cut into strips to the fold line. </p><p>  To make it convenient, pinch the edge with clothespins.  Now sew on a typewriter along the whole edge.  On a stalk with stamens (the same end of the paper with strips is twisted, only their ends are twisted, dipped in glue and colored semolina), glue them by wrapping a paper tape with petals.  Spread the flower, stick the leaves. </p><p>  Here is another workshop.  We will tell you how to make paper flowers in the <span>form of a peony,</span> poppy or rose. </p><ul><li>  Stitch a wide paper tape in the middle. </li><li>  Fold in half (the more layers taken, the more magnificent the flower). </li><li>  At the end of the stem, attach a piece of cotton wool and glue it with the same paper, getting a bud. </li><li>  Wrap the tape around the bud, periodically lubricating with glue and adjusting the shape. </li><li>  Finish work on sepals, stems and leaves. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a flower out of paper tape" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634772.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  More ways to make flowers </h2><p>  In the above way, you can quickly make asters.  To do this, cut the tape so that you get a trapezium, on top of which you decorate with small cloves or zigzags.  You also stitch from the other end, form an aster. </p><p>  If you cut the tape with ‚Äúfences‚Äù two centimeters wide, then when creating a flower you will get a kind of velvet.  The middle of such a flower can also be made in the form of a candle flame (wrap it with cotton wool and glue it with the same paper). </p><p>  River flowers can be obtained if the tape is cut into centimeter stripes.  Next, ‚Äúthin out‚Äù the stripes once, that is, we get a strip - a void - a strip.  Round the remaining petals.  Stitch the tape, attach to the stem.  In this case, make the middle of a contrasting color.  This method is quick, but only available to older students.  Manual stapling can cause paper to warp in the hands of children. </p><p>  With preschoolers, another way of making flowers is suitable.  Also simple and original.  So, how to make a paper flower bouquet in one lesson? </p><ul><li>  Hand out square sheets of paper with color patterns in different sizes.  For example, a flower with five petals with a diameter of 15, 10, 8 centimeters. </li><li>  Translate the patterns into squares of paper and cut them out. </li><li>  Thread a bead at one end of the green wire. </li><li>  Slide all the petals from the other end onto the wire, starting with the smaller size. </li><li>  Glue the sepals and leaves. </li></ul><h2>  A method of making flowers for patient </h2><p>  Many masters individually cut the petals and form bends of flowers, trying to bring them closer to the original.  So, for callas, a wide sheet is cut out, a bend is formed and the stamens are wrapped.  In many flowers, each inflorescence is collected separately.  Consider this process on the example of mallow. </p><p>  How to make paper flowers: instructions </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make big paper flowers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634764.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <ul><li>  Draw a flower pattern on thick paper in the form of a circle cut in a spiral.  Only the lines are not even, like a rose, but wavy. </li><li>  Now each petal with a pencil or scissors needs to be bent, like a lupine.  At the same time, the petals look "from themselves." </li><li>  Next, wrap a flower on a pencil, glue the core. </li></ul><p>  You form such heads on the panel in inflorescences.  If you need a bouquet, then attach them to the stem from all sides. </p><p>  According to the same plan (the formation of each petal), lilacs, lilies of the valley are created.  Only paper tape is cut into long strips, which are bent with a pencil into lumps.  From afar, the illusion of small details is created.  And to emphasize the shades of one color, they twist two different ribbons onto the stem. </p><h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  So how to make a big paper flower?  There are a lot of manufacturing methods!  Children can make flowers according to patterns of different colors.  Stringing layers on each other, get field plants.  The fastest way to create curvaceous forms are crafts from solid paper ribbons.  The paper is folded in accordion, the edge of the petal is cut out and glued to the stem.  Any paper is used for flowers.  By crushing the material with a pencil, hands, other objects in different ways, a bend of the petal is formed.  Try to make the flowers described in the article, and in the process of work new ideas will come. </p>
