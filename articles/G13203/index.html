This is a clear consequence of the fact that travelers are tired of spending their holidays in Turkey or Egypt, where usually all-inclusive.  Therefore, many begin to look for some kind of exotic - the Philippines, Cuba, Indonesia or, in the end, Cyprus, which attracts with its hearty traditional cuisine and beautiful ancient sights. </p>

    <h2>  A bit about the island </h2><p>  Absolutely all categories of tourists go to the island: from young companies to elderly couples.  Cyprus is divided into the main resorts, many of which have their own characteristics that attract this or that type of vacationers.  For example, Paphos is famous for its calm, moderate relaxation, and Ayia Napa - for a lot of fun bars, cafes and discos.  On the island of <span>Cyprus, 4-star hotels are of the</span> highest standard.  But 3 * hotels will not be so good (that is, it is worth choosing either between 4 and 5, or between 2 and 3).  To visit the island, Russians will need a visa.  It is very simple, Cyprus is not included in <span>the Schengen area</span> .  Provisions are made out upon arrival at the airport, you only need to have a couple of photos that meet the standards.  Different tour operators ask for small pre-filled profiles indicating the profession, last name and first name and other details of life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Residence </h2><p>  Cyprus offers the usual hotel categories for any tourist country: five-, four-, three- and two-star hotels.  The quality of service here will be at a fairly high level.  However, if you do not want to spend the whole day at the hotel, tied to the "feeding trough", you should take only breakfast to go to local restaurants for lunch and dinner and taste delicious Cypriot cuisine.  The <span>4</span> star <span>hotels</span> located on the island of <span>Cyprus</span> in terms of rating and quality of service are at about the same level, so it‚Äôs worth starting with choosing not a hotel, but a resort area. </p><h2>  Resting on Paphos </h2>

    <p>  A pompous resort town that hosts mostly wealthy people who want to see the sights or enjoy the beautiful natural beauty.  There are no noisy discos or fun bars for young people, there are no animated entertainment programs for families with children.  But there are expensive and luxurious restaurants and bar establishments.  Located on the island of Cyprus (Paphos) 4-star hotels, reviews confirm this fact, have a very high level of service.  However, it is worth knowing that many treshki have more convenient beaches than fives.  This is due to the history of the construction of the latter: they were designed to receive foreign citizens such as the French and Germans who prefer swimming in the pool rather than the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel "4 stars" in Paphos </h2>

    <p>  Cyprotel <span>Laura Beach 4 *</span> is objectively one of the best accommodation options in the entire resort.  It is located near the airport (this is a plus, since there will not be a long transfer, and the noise of the aircraft, of course, is not heard), in the city of Paphos, near the main attractions such as the Tomb of the Kings or Water Park of Aphrodite.  It has different categories of rooms (bungalows, standards and studios), developed internal infrastructure (pools, tennis, fitness center, health club, sauna, bars and restaurants, entertainment for children) and a wide range of additional services (currency exchange, laundry, tour desk souvenir shop).  The rating of hotels in Cyprus ("4 stars") puts this option on one of the first lines, so you should not worry about quality. </p><h2>  Relaxing in Ayia Napa </h2><p>  "Second Ibiza" is perfect for relaxing fun young companies.  The nightlife of this resort is the liveliest key in all of Cyprus.  There is even a street called Club Street, due to the large concentration of entertainment venues on it.  This is what caused the increase in prices not only for souvenirs and meals in cafes and restaurants, but also for hotels.  Therefore, purchases here should be done very carefully, because in neighboring towns there are similar products at a price of two, or even three times lower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Cyprus.</span>  <span>4 Star Hotels</span> in Ayia Napa </h2><p>  Napa Plaza Hotel ("4 stars") - a hotel located on the second coastline, that is, at a distance of more than two hundred meters from the sea, but less than a thousand.  It does not accept customers under the age of 16 (a fairly common practice in countries close to Europe, such hotels are becoming more popular every year).  It has rooms of categories not lower than suites (that is, there are no economical and standard ones), staff can offer deluxe rooms or special rooms for newlyweds.  In addition, all of them are designed for a maximum of 2 people to stay.  A huge number of bars and restaurants, theme nights, a gym, swimming pools and other attributes of a luxury hotel are available to guests.  The list of "Cyprus: 4 star hotels (Ayia Napa)" includes such a high-quality hotel as So White Bontique Suites 4 * thanks to its special style, designed in snow-white colors - connoisseurs are delighted! </p>

    <h2>  Resting in Limassol </h2><p>  The symbiosis of Paphos and Ayia Napa is a resort town of Limassol, which combines elements for a relaxing holiday with kids, respectable and wealthy people and cheerful youth.  Entertainment to everyone's taste.  It is located approximately in the central part of the island, which will allow especially curious people to look into all corners of Cyprus.  It is in this city that a large number of Russian-speaking population lives - mainly young people who traveled around the world and, having fallen in love with the beauty of the island, remained to live in Limassol.  You can turn to them for help - they love it.  Such youth is very active and knows a lot of ‚Äúinteresting things‚Äù about Cyprus: where to eat, what to buy and when to see.  They are easy to find on social networks. </p><h2>  Mini tour of the hotel </h2>

    <p>  On the island of <span>Cyprus (Limassol) 4-</span> star <span>hotels</span> (first line) are located close to each other.  The highest quality of them is Mediterranean Beach 4 *, which has taken an attractive, juicy place in a sandy bay.  The hotel area is simply amazing: immersed in fragrant flowers and palm groves.  It does not have ordinary rooms - they all belong to the upper classes - deluxe, superior, family large and many others.  For children, a whole entertainment program is provided, which occupies them from early morning to evening.  Such an opportunity allows parents to truly relax and, for example, take a walk along the twelve-kilometer promenade, equipped with fascinating bars, souvenir shops and artists right on the street.  This hotel (unlike many others) has a really good compliment system for guests (from a small present to each client upon arrival to a large one on their wedding day).  Hotels in Cyprus "4 stars" (reviews have said this more than once) are very fond of encouraging their customers, perhaps this is due to the good nature of the locals.  By the way, all of them, walking along an ordinary street past foreigners, smile or, for example, ask about how things are and mood, without any second thoughts.  This is not surprising, people in hot countries do not like to get angry. </p><h2>  Resting on everything ready </h2>

    <p>  All Inclusive is a once-favorite leisure system, especially among Russian travelers.  Despite the convenience of such a vacation, it is gradually becoming a thing of the past.  More and more tourists, turning to travel agents, ask only for breakfast or half board.  Perhaps this is right, how can you learn from within the culture of the country, if you spend all the time in a hotel behind closed doors?  But nevertheless, this system will be convenient, for example, for large families, since quite large sums will leave to feed in a cafe or restaurant.  All-inclusive 4-star hotels on the island of Cyprus are characterized by a rich buffet, animation program and many bars in the area where you can take drinks an infinite number of times.  But in general, experts recommend lovers of such a leisure system to go to more familiar countries - Turkey, Egypt - since such vouchers have a lower cost there. </p><h2>  Mini-rating of hotels of Cyprus 4 * </h2><p>  1. Avlida 4 *.  (Pathos) </p><p>  2. Cyprotel Laura Beach 4 *. (Paphos) </p><p>  3. Napa Plaza Hotel 4 *.  (Ayia Napa) </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Active travelers have the opportunity to rent a car at a fairly low price.  The 4 star hotels located on the island of Cyprus provide this service, it can be ordered at the reception.  Others can examine any sightseeing object as part of a group.  Mostly it is worth visiting places such as Nicosia (the capital), the ancient city of Amathus near Limassol, a nature reserve - Mount Troodos.  Another type of recreation is water parks, a dolphinarium or the largest golf courses in Paphos. </p><p>  Have a nice trip! </p>
