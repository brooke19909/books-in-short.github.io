Rest: Peresyp, Kirillovka</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rest on the Sea of ​​Azov has always been considered budgetary.  Every summer families with children and lovers of silence and unity with nature flocked here.  The shallow, quickly warming sea, the absence of nearby megacities and industrial enterprises, the steppe air saturated with iodine - what more could my soul wish for?  Far inland the washed-up sand spits advanced.  On the one hand is the sea, on the other is a freshwater estuary ... Here, excellent fishing.  But the best that tourist camps give visitors is relaxation.  Pounding is one of such braids.  It starts from the center of the balneological resort Kirillovka (Zaporizhzhya region, Ukraine).  About recreation, housing and prices on the spit Peresyp read in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Where is Kirillovka located </h2><p>  The village is located in the very south of Zaporizhzhya region, quite far from the gas-polluted industrial metropolis.  This is a seaside village.  Two sand <span>spits</span> adjoin to it <span>: Fedotova</span> and Peresyp.  The first separates the Sea of ​​Azov from the Utlyuk estuary.  Spit Fedotova began to be built up recently, but very intensively.  Now there is a very developed recreation infrastructure.  The rash stretches over a nine-kilometer chain and separates the sea from the Milk Estuary.  Wellness camps and tourist camps lined both sides of the two streamers.  Rest The rash gives a quiet, peaceful.  For noise, you should go to Fedotov’s scythe.  It is separated from the mainland by the deserted island of Stepok.  The resort village of Kirillovka from the city of Melitopol is 65 km away.  The nearest railway station, Akimovka, is 42 km away. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist bases - rest.  Peresyp, Kirillovka </h2><p>  In the seventies of the last century, when Fedotov’s spit was resting only as a “savage” in tents, pioneer camps, boarding houses and sanatoriums began to be built with might and main in the tents.  These monuments of the past still rise on the shore.  Some of them underwent a complete reconstruction and turned into modern hotels and tourist centers. </p><p>  Rest Peresyp offers a budget than on the spit Fedotova, but more expensive than in the center of the village of Kirillovka.  You can also reduce the cost of your stay by living on the so-called second line.  These are bases and hotels near the water, but fresh - Milk estuary.  You will have to walk about a hundred meters to the sea, which, you see, is not so much.  In some boarding houses or recreation centers in Peresyp there is a cafe with loud music, but they are incomparably smaller than on Fedotov’s spit.  This area is for wildlife lovers.  A narrow strait separates Peresyp from another spit - Stepanovskaya, which is a wildlife sanctuary. </p>

    <h2>  "Seaside Galatea" </h2><p>  This is another very popular recreation center in Kirillovka.  Kosa Peresyp in the place where this cultural and health center is located (4 km from the center of the village) is noticeably narrowing.

This is “Economy” (shower on the floor), “Standard”, “Superior” (with air conditioning), “Suite” (two-room).  Two dining rooms of the base offer three meals a day according to the "buffet" system.
