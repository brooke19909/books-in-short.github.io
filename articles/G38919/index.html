A wired monopod with an AUX cable and a button on the handle is a non-volatile solution.  It does not need to be charged and charge controlled. </p><p>  Wireless with a built-in button and a battery will be a convenient solution, but due to the discharge of the battery, the device may stop working at the wrong time.  The device with a wireless remote control is similar to the previous version, but the disadvantages include hand occupancy and the likely loss of the remote control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="futurocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monopod selfie stick reviews" class="if uuid-2240351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2240351.jpg"></div><p>  The appropriate type is selected, you need to take into account the reliability and versatility of the mount.  It must be firmly fixed.  It is desirable that there are rubberized inserts.  The telescopic tube extends easily.  It does not bend, and in the connection areas they do not scroll under the mass of the smartphone.  And the monopod head should rotate freely. </p><p>  It is necessary to determine the dimensions of this device.  Indeed, portability is important for some, while functionality is important for others, and any size can be.  Given the basic selection criteria, it will turn out to purchase a suitable device that will allow you to take high-quality selfies. </p>
