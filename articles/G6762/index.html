    <p>  Despite the fact that there are positive reviews about the partnership with LLC, Start-Invest is not considered by experienced investors as an alternative investment direction.  People who are constantly working in this direction are well aware of the fact that not a single investment in the foreign exchange market can bring guaranteed income.  That is why the company's promise to pay 5% per month is put under a big question mark.  History says that not one of the most successful managers will ever take responsibility for their client‚Äôs money.  He can familiarize himself with his strategy, can provide a trading history, but he will never promise even a minimum level of profit.  Investing in Forex is a highly profitable, but very risky area.  So there is something to ponder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Company Offers </h2><p>  The reviews tell about the numerous partnership programs from Start-Invest LLC more than once.  New investors are attracted by the following offers: </p><ol><li>  "Partner".  To participate in the program you need a contribution of 16 thousand rubles.  The reward will be credited for bringing new customers.  The amount of the fee will be 10% of the profit from the attracted investor.  The offer is valid for actual Start-Invest customers, whose employee feedback is impeccable. </li><li>  "Regional partner."  To participate in the program, the contribution must be at least 318 thousand rubles.  The conditions for calculating fees are the same as in the previous program. </li><li>  "Regional office."  The minimum contribution should be at least 952 thousand rubles.  Terms of cooperation are retained. </li><li>  "International Representation."  Under the program, an individual contract is concluded with a legal entity or with a physical, but with the status of an entrepreneur.  Main conditions for participation in affiliate programs are preserved, and there is a need to open an office. </li></ol><h2>  What do experts say about affiliate programs? </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to investment experts, the company's proposals are not only unprofitable, but also very alarming.  In world practice, people working on affiliate programs are not required to invest in companies.  They act as intermediaries and advertising agents.  In the Start-Invest company, the feedback of investors about which is very alarming because of suspicions of fraud, only actual investors can become partners.  The company teaches double benefits.  Pay attention to the fact that, regardless of the size of the entry fee, partners will receive a similar reward.  The question remains whether it makes sense to invest a lot to get the same 10%. </p><h2>  Company interest rates </h2><p>  Start-Invest is a financial company that is ready to pay each investor 5% of the amount of investment.  The minimum deposit must correspond to an amount of at least 5 thousand rubles.  The partnership lasts from 3 months to a year.  At the same time, there are deposits called ‚ÄúRentier‚Äù, ‚ÄúAccumulative‚Äù, ‚ÄúAccumulative urgent‚Äù and ‚ÄúChildren's funded‚Äù.  Their difference lies in the size of the down payment and in the duration of the cooperation.  For all programs, accruals of no more than 5% per month are provided.  An exception is the Cumulative Urgent program, in which bonuses of 3%, 5%, 7% and 10% are available.  Each time you deposit and withdraw funds, a fee of 2% will be charged from the client.  Citizens of the Russian Federation will pay <span>income tax on individuals</span> in the amount of 13%.  Tax is levied on the amount of interest received.  It remains to answer the question of why, due to the accruals made by the Start-Invest company, the feedback from investors has a negative connotation. </p><h2>  What did investors manage to calculate? </h2>

    <p>  Professional investors, considering the company's offer, made very interesting conclusions for themselves.  They calculated the probable return on investment of $ 1,000.  The result surprised them very much.  So, for example, a person deposits $ 1,000 into an account and loses 2%.  He has $ 980 left in his account.  Here, minus 1% is also allowed to the bank, which charges a fee for its services.  As a result, the initial amount is already not 1 thousand dollars, but 970 dollars.  A month later, the account will be 1018 dollars.  When deciding to withdraw them, the client again pays 2%, and he receives $ 998 in the account outside the company.  <span>Income tax</span> is nowhere to remove.  Given that the minimum term of partnership is 3 months, then 15% can be forgotten.  Profitability will be a little more than 10%, taking into account all commissions and deductions.  It is worth considering partnership with the company only in the long term, another option is not rational.  That is why professional participants of the investment market about the company "Start-Invest" leave comments of a warning nature, with the expectation that newcomers evaluate the offer in detail before accepting it, weigh the pros and cons. </p><h2>  Positive aspects of the project: investors' view from the other side </h2>

    <p>  In contrast to the negative comments about the company "Start-Invest", there are reviews with a positive connotation.  Investors pay attention to the fact that similar projects simply do not exist.  Attention is drawn to a number of advantages.  This is the full responsibility for trading risks and a fixed percentage.  An important point is the loan agreement, which is signed in paper form.  The documentation is mailed to a company partner.  In accordance with a written agreement, Start-Invest (investment company) assumes the obligation to return the funds and interest after a clearly defined period.  Despite skepticism about a monthly yield of 5%, annual growth will be 79.5%, which is much more than the best financial institutions offer.  As an advantage, you can consider the possibility of replenishing the account in the partnership process and the ability to withdraw part of the funds from it if necessary. </p><h2>  Wide network </h2><p>  The Start-Invest company, in which a private investor can register a private investor, offers its services throughout Russia.  Online projects are accompanied by real offices and representative offices in different cities of Russia.  The main office is located in Cheboksary.  The company itself is positioning itself as an international organization.  On the pages of the official website a list of certificates for investment activities is presented.  The company's customers have repeatedly said that they can count on help at any time.  Professional support is provided not only online, but also directly in offices. </p><h2>  What encourages the formation of distrust? </h2>

    <p>  Experienced investors, despite a number of advantages of the company, warns those who invest in Start-Invest.  This is due to the fact that no reporting is provided within the company.  As you know, the company invests in foreign exchange markets, which provides for the availability of information about transactions.  After one of the investors asked about access to the reports, company representatives replied that this data was confidential.  In the future, the company plans to activate MyFXBook to provide data on operations and as confirmation of real actions in the foreign exchange market.  While this information is closed, there will be doubts about the actual work, there will always be a likelihood that Start-Invest, whose employee reviews are flawless, pays interest by attracting new investors.  Simply put, it is an ordinary pyramid. </p><h2>  Openness and respect </h2>

    <p>  Even if we consider the fact that Start-Invest is a <span>financial pyramid,</span> it will not be possible to make complaints about the quality of customer service.  Anyone can ask for help at any time.  As one of the company's clients wrote, he even managed to successfully communicate with the management of the organization, which patiently and calmly answered questions.  There was even experience of repeated telephone communication with the director and his deputies.  Loyal and attentive attitude to potential partners is expensive.  Each is given as much time as each individual situation requires.  When dealing with provocative questions, courtesy and respect do not disappear.  You can even talk about the European level of service. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Universal offers and a non-standard partnership scheme are precisely those moments that attract attention to Start-Invest.  Reviews and facts have a completely different direction.  You can meet both the responses telling about the company as a reliable and trusted company, as well as those that make you think about the reality of the existence of the investment direction.  Today it is very problematic to say whether the LLC is a real operating company for investing funds in the Forex market or if it does not represent anything more than a typical money pyramid.  Statements of both opponents and fans of the company can be put under a big question mark.  The fact remains that the company has been operating for 4 years, and the Internet has not yet been strewn with complaints of non-return of funds.  You can consider the negative as a black PR.  In any situation, every person who considers the enterprise as a potential partner should study in detail his activities and history.  Rationally look at possible income and risks.  Reviews are so ambiguous that it makes no sense to build on them. </p>
