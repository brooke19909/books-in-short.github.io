    <p>  We will decide what may be needed to make wooden handmade products.  The most important thing is the material from which the craft will be made.  All logs are prepared by a special method, for this they are dried to 15% moisture, but experts say that the best option is 8-9%.  It is important not to forget that wood differs in its strength and structure depending on the species. </p><p>  To process the product, you need an assembly table or workbench.  Further, an electric tool is necessarily purchased - a milling cutter, a circular saw and a grinder, as well as a slotting and jointer. </p><p>  A hand tool will also come in handy, which includes all kinds of planers, chisels, and hacksaw-rewards.  In order to put a picture on the product, you can get drills and engravers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Drawings of wooden products are also needed in order to understand what a finished object will be.  It is advisable to independently develop sketches or borrow them from more experienced craftsmen. </p><h2>  Joining products on sliding grooves </h2>

    <p>  This is one of the simplest and most common types of bonding, so it is recommended for beginners.  You will need to cut the same and straight stripes, the width of which will be the same as the thickness of the workpiece, then insert these parts into each other. </p><p>  Prepare two pieces of plywood or a tree in the shape of a rectangle.  Saw grooves in the middle that are half the length of the workpiece.  The width of such a fastener should be the same as the width of the part.  The result is a strong and stable cross.  If the grooves are cut at the corners, then it will be possible to create an angular strong figure.  You can thus collect four pieces and get an excellent frame for the box or a rectangular shape for crafts.  Such a connection is also perfect for creating round things, for example, mills or turbine wheels;  making souvenirs and children's toys;  furniture manufacturing. </p><h2>  Wood polishing steps </h2>

It is carried out using a swab wrapped in a thin cloth and impregnated with varnish, which is applied to the product in different directions and impregnates it.  This procedure is done in order to fill the smallest pores and cracks on the base of the tree.  After drying, the surface is treated with fine-grained sandpaper, and then the coating is again applied in two layers one after another.  After drying, the product should be treated with the composition for the last time, diluting it one to one with the varnish.  The prepared thing for two days is in a closed cabinet. </p><p>  - The polishing.  For this, a varnish is used, before working with which the swab is moistened with a small amount of vegetable oil.  It is brought to the side, and the composition is distributed in smooth circular movements.  All processes are performed in three stages, and after each application, the surface is sanded with fine sandpaper, then cleaned of dust.  If everything is done correctly, then after drying the last layer a small gloss will turn out. </p><p>  - Polishing.  It is carried out so that the surface acquires a mirror shine.  After all the layers dry well after polishing, the base is treated a little with the finest emery paper, which is pre-wetted in oil.  Then a small amount of polish is applied to the tampon, and the surface is rubbed with the composition until a gloss appears.  In order to improve the strength characteristics of a wood product, this procedure is repeated several times.  At the last stage, the surface is wiped with a soft cloth soaked in water. </p><h2>  Effect of aged wood </h2>

    <p>  In order for the wooden products created with their own hands to become exclusive, the aging effect is used, which can be obtained in three ways. </p><p>  The chemical method is only suitable for hardwood, as they have tannins in their composition.  To do this, the surface must be covered with ammonia, after which it will darken and acquire a characteristic gray shade. </p><p>  Using the thermal method, you can age <span>wood products of</span> any species.  Initially, the surface is treated with a stain, and then it is scorched with a soldering iron until a natural texture pattern appears on it.  Then the carbon is removed with a brush.  Everything is varnished. </p><p>  The mechanical method (often called branching) is best suited for conifers.  For this method, you need a metal brush, which you need to cut through the wood fibers - remove the soft layers, after which hard fibers will appear, which will give the material an aged look.  Using this procedure, you can hide small defects that appear in the process.  At the last stage, everything is varnished or painted. </p><h2>  Finishing Technology </h2>

    <p>  <span>Wooden products</span> created with their own hands are coated with paint after manufacturing.  Thanks to this, they will be especially beautiful and practical.  This is done using a swab or a soft brush.  Small surfaces, as well as wooden carvings, are best painted with watercolor thin brushes. </p><p>  Before use, the stain is diluted a little, after which it is easily applied in several layers, the amount of which will depend on the desired color.  Since all parts of wood absorb paint in different ways, it is impossible to coat the product in one go.  After each stage, the parts are completely dried without fail, then you need to walk a little along the surface with sandpaper, remove dust and apply the next layer. </p><h2>  Care </h2><p>  In order for wooden products created with their own hands to look beautiful, they need special care.  Steam and moisture easily penetrate, but just as easily evaporate.  To protect the coating, it is best to use decorative wax.  Humidity cannot harm products that are coated with this composition.  It is applied with a brush in several stages.  This layer will be an excellent protection against minor mechanical damage.  For application, you will need a tissue swab with which the wax is rubbed with wide movements in the direction of the wood texture.  For drying, it is necessary to withstand the product one night at a temperature of + 20 ¬∞ C. </p>
