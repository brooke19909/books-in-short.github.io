The presence of numerous hotels of varying degrees of comfort and price category makes it possible to choose the best option for accommodation.  All hotels are located in close proximity to the sea.  However, many of them do not have their own beach, and guests are forced to visit the village.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, this factor should be taken into account. </p><p>  It is also necessary to pay attention to the availability of additional services in the form of organizing recreational activities for vacationers.  Those who come with their children should take into account the opportunities available at the hotel for children (the presence of a club, playground and animation programs). </p><p>  Not all hotels make payments in cashless form.  In addition, when booking rooms, a prepayment is often required, reaching the amount of the stay per day.  This can be an additional inconvenience for vacationers. </p><p>  Separately, you should pay attention to the organization of catering, which can both be included in the cost of living, and paid separately.  As a rule, meals that are not included in the price are somewhat more expensive.  Therefore, you should not save on it.  After all, the main thing on vacation is the most comfortable living conditions. </p><p>  Given all the factors, you can safely plan a vacation trip to Novomikhaylovskoye (Tuapse district).  Hotels here are always welcome new guests. </p>
