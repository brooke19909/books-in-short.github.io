The newest word in this area is the 4K Ultra High-Definition format.  For many, this is just a set of letters.  So, 4K UHD TVs - what is it?  The most popular at the moment can be called a Full HD monitor.  Ultra HD can be defined as a device that can transmit an image with active pixels.  There are, in turn, a huge number of them (more than eight million).  The resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels. </p>

This has become the benchmark standard for clarity.  Below we consider varieties of screen sizes. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, at the moment, the resolution for clarity happens: </p><ul><li>  Full HD (progressive scan 1080); </li><li>  1080i (interlaced); </li><li>  HD Ready (720 pixels per inch). </li></ul><p>  The latter is the most common of them, because today almost all TV channels and DVDs have this resolution (720 x 480).  But this format can be considered obsolete.  If you already buy a new <span>TV, it</span> is <span>better</span> not to consider this option at all, even if it will be a large diagonal and at a bargain price.  When choosing a television receiver, it is still worth paying attention to the frequency in hertz.  It should be at least 120. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  4K extension </h2><p>  4K format appeared recently, in 2005.  It‚Äôs not so easy for the human eye to see the difference in the latest resolution and the already familiar 1080. It is especially difficult to see the difference if the <span>resolution of 1080</span> shows, for example, Blu-ray. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4k uhd tvs reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175599.jpg" width="597"></div>  The difference is perceptible when watching special demos from manufacturers.  To determine the purchase and its feasibility, you need to consider all the advantages and disadvantages of the product you like.  So with a high-definition TV.

    <h2>  What are the benefits of the Ultra HD extension? </h2><p>  The huge screen shows with incredible clarity, it is impossible to see individual pixels on it, as on 720p analogs.  This is an indisputable plus.  The same as the realism of what is happening on the screen: you can feel like part of the movie scene.  The saturation of colors and transitions from shade to shade allow you to see the whole variety of natural and artificial colors. </p><p>  Even if the movie or broadcast is broadcast in the wrong format, a special feature will allow you to adapt the image in 4K.  The receivers are equipped with many additional features.  In televisions with this resolution, for example, voice or gesture control, the ability to synchronize them with other devices, for example with a personal smartphone, can be installed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  4K adaptation </h2><p>  The broadcasting of channels itself does not yet take place in Ultra-HD, but thanks to the adaptability, you can purchase a screen with this extension and enjoy a clear picture.  Almost all 4K UHD TVs combine the adaptation function.  What does this give the simple viewer?  Nothing but the opportunity to see the smallest details even in long-loved programs. </p><p>  A new image format opens up new possibilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4k uhd tvs worth buying" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175600.jpg" width="475"></div>  For people whose work is connected with photography, 3D graphics, production of games and, of course, films, the new TV will be a great assistant.

    <h2>  Disadvantages of the latest resolution </h2><p>  And now a little about the minuses that are present while operating such a novelty as 4K UHD TVs.  What could it be? </p><p>  Not wide distribution of content.  In our country, few channels have switched to HD, and Ultra HD is not available to everyone, and you will have to pay for it separately.  It is included only in paid channel packages, and their selection is small.  The price category is high.  And although operators have been working on this issue recently, the service is not available to most consumers. </p><p>  A more complete impression of the new broadcast can be obtained if the devices connected to the TV pass through the cable not now common 1.4 HDMI, but already improved 2.0. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4k uhd lg tvs" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175601.jpg" width="465"></div>  Output 1.4 will be able to do the image conversion, but still part of the extension will be lost.  The new 2.0 cable will allow you to watch movies even at up to 60 frames per second, while the modern analogue only reproduces 30. When choosing a new TV, it is advisable to pay attention to the fact that there are several HDMI ports.  4K UHD-TVs, which are only positive customer reviews, are likely to take a certain place in the consumer market, and, apparently, not the last.

    <h2>  OLED: The New Generation </h2><p>  CRT TVs have long evolved into modern liquid crystal or plasma panels.  But the top rightfully occupy <span>OLED TVs 4K</span> UHD.  What is it?  This panel consists of <span>organic LEDs.</span>  This technology is very popular among manufacturers and interested buyers, as it is very new in concept.  The main advantage of such a panel is a curved screen.  Allows this ability to realize many bold decisions.  For such a panel, you do not need to create additional backlight, like for another screen, for example LED 4K UHD.  The previous generation LCD TV will not be able to technically approach the backlight problem. </p><p>  4K OLED panels are truly the best combination for the TV to date.  Such a screen is quite large (from 55 diagonals and above).  The price, of course, is also rather big.  On average, it is about 400 thousand rubles.  For some models, the price reaches one million rubles.  Many household appliance manufacturers have already presented their TV sets with a similar extension.  The leaders in this segment are Sony and Samsung. </p><h2>  Sony KD-65X9005B </h2><p>  This model is one of the most bought.  However, the cost at the current rate for residents of Russia will not seem affordable for everyone - about two hundred thousand rubles.  To enjoy all the delights of the latest technology, it is worth paying a good price.  This TV is already equipped with an HDMI 2.0 port and the already familiar HEVC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tvs samsung 4k uhd" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175602.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thanks to the presence of these gadgets, the TV will not become obsolete for a long time.  The quality does not change at all when the picture is enlarged.  You can see the smallest details in high definition.  Sony's 4K UHD TVs have a wide range of sizes and a wide selection of models.

    <h2>  "Samsung UE65HU8500" </h2><p>  This model appeared at about the same time as the above.  The price of Samsung 4K UHD TVs is not much different from their competitors - about three hundred thousand rubles.  But this particular model looks very stylish.  It can fit into any interior and will be its decoration.  The main difference is, of course, a curved screen.  This is an innovation that makes people freeze with delight.  Immersion in the picture becomes even more realistic.  The effect of full presence is created.  This TV immediately attracts attention.  An HDMI 2.0 port is also present, which is an important plus. </p><h2>  "Toshiba 58L9363" </h2><p>  This model can be called the most affordable in the class of 4K TVs.  It was with its appearance that other manufacturers were forced to revise prices downward.  This TV does not have many functions, but the second generation allows you to watch new 3D. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led 4k uhd tv" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175603.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are no latest ports, but in order to watch the new Ultra-HD format on it, there is everything you need.  And most importantly - there is a realistic transfer of color gamut and the smallest details of images.

    <h2>  Panasonic TX-50AX802 </h2><p>  In addition to the natural ability to reproduce the latest image quality, this model has an interesting function that rewinds real-time broadcast programs.  It is called Freetime.  An Internet connection allows you to create an owner‚Äôs profile directly on the TV screen, which helps them share videos with friends.  So, in addition to watching programs in the highest quality, now you can spend time even more interesting. </p><h2>  LG 55UB950V </h2><p>  The design of the TVs of this brand is always impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4k uhd tvs sony" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1175604.jpg" width="574"></div>  This model was no exception.  4K UHD LG TVs contain many different gadgets and have a very light operating system - webOS.  This is an exceptional system, which is only available in electronics from LG.  The TV is able to please all the benefits of Ultra-HD - from color reproduction to clarity.

    <h2>  4K UHD TVs.  Is it worth buying? </h2><p>  You can make a purchase of a new screen with Ultra HD right now, since in the near future it is possible to replace the current formats with more clear ones.  Such a model will not have time to become obsolete in the coming years.  Of course, technology does not stand still, and not far off the emergence of newer models (for example, 8K, superior to modern 1080 is not 4, but 8 times).  True, this can only be available on screens of a very large format, and it will be difficult to see the difference.  While development and large-scale production is not expected.  Due to the high cost, demand will be small.  If funds allow, you can now enjoy a beautiful picture at home.  As they say, you have to pay for quality.  4K TVs are no exception. </p>
