The true story of the disaster</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The legendary first flight of the Titanic was supposed to be the main solemn event of 1912, but instead it became the most tragic in history.  An absurd collision with an iceberg, an unorganized evacuation of people, almost one and a half thousand dead - this was the only voyage of the liner. </p><h2>  History of the ship </h2><p>  Banal rivalry served as an incentive to begin the construction of the Titanic.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a liner is better than that of a competitor, it occurred to the owner of the British shipping company White Star Line Bruce Ismey.  This happened after their main rival, Kunard Line, launched the largest ship at that time, the Lusitania, in 1906. </p><p>  The construction of the liner began in 1909.  About three thousand specialists worked on its creation; more than seven million dollars were spent.  Recent work was completed in 1911, and at the same time the long-awaited launch of the liner took place. </p><p>  Many people, both rich and poor, sought to get the coveted ticket for this flight, but no one suspected that only a few days after departure, the world community would discuss only one thing - how many people died on the Titanic. </p>

    <h2>  The tragic foresight of the death of the Titanic </h2><p>  The fictional story of <span>a ship wreck</span> in the <span>Atlantic Ocean,</span> which later turned out to be prophetic, was written by British journalist William Thomas Stead in 1886.  By publishing, the author wanted to draw public attention to the need to revise the navigation rules, namely, he demanded that the number of seats in the ship's boats be consistent with the number of passengers. </p><p>  A few years later, Stead again returned to a similar topic in a new story about a ship crash in the Atlantic Ocean that occurred as a result of a collision with an iceberg.  The death of people on the liner occurred due to the lack of the required number of boats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How many people died on the Titanic: the composition of the drowned and the survivors </h2><p>  More than 100 years have passed since the most discussed shipwreck of the 20th century, but each time during regular <span>trials</span> new circumstances of the tragedy are clarified and updated lists of those who died and survived as a result of the liner‚Äôs death appear. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  The wreck of the ship "Titanic".  Fatalities and survivors: gender composition </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Affiliation </td><td>  Total amount </td><td>  Died </td><td>  % dead </td><td>  Saved </td><td>  % saved </td></tr><tr><td>  Men </td><td>  1670 </td><td>  1332 </td><td>  80 </td><td>  338 </td><td>  20 </td></tr><tr><td>  Women </td><td>  422 </td><td>  106 </td><td>  25 </td><td>  316 </td><td>  75 </td></tr><tr><td>  Children </td><td>  109 </td><td>  52 </td><td>  48 </td><td>  57 </td><td>  52 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  2201 </td><td>  1490 </td><td>  67.7 </td><td>  711 </td><td>  32.3 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  This table gives us comprehensive information.  The ratio of how many women and children died on the Titanic is the most telling of the disorganization of the evacuation.  The percentage of surviving women is even higher than the number of surviving children.  As a result of the shipwreck, 80% of men died, most of them simply did not have enough space in lifeboats.  High death toll among children.  These were mainly representatives of the lower class, who were unable to get on deck on time for evacuation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to save people from high society?  Class Discrimination on the Titanic </h2><p>  As soon as it became clear that the ship did not stay on the water for long, the captain of the Titanic, Edward John Smith, ordered the women and children to be put into lifeboats.  At the same time, access to the deck for class III passengers was limited.  Thus, the advantage in salvation was given to representatives of high society. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  The death of the Titanic.  The composition of the dead and survivors by class </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Affiliation </td><td>  Total amount </td><td>  Died </td><td>  % dead </td><td>  Saved </td><td>  % saved </td></tr><tr><td>  I class </td><td>  325 </td><td>  122 </td><td>  38 </td><td>  203 </td><td>  62 </td></tr><tr><td>  II class </td><td>  285 </td><td>  167 </td><td>  59 </td><td>  118 </td><td>  41 </td></tr><tr><td>  III class </td><td>  706 </td><td>  528 </td><td>  75 </td><td>  178 </td><td>  25 </td></tr><tr><td>  Command </td><td>  885 </td><td>  673 </td><td>  76 </td><td>  212 </td><td>  24 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  2201 </td><td>  1490 </td><td>  67.7 </td><td>  711 </td><td>  32.3 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  A large number of dead people became the reason that for the past 100 years, investigations and litigation have not stopped.  All experts note that on board during evacuation there was <span>discrimination based on gender</span> and class.  At the same time, the number of surviving crew members was greater than representatives of class III.  Instead of helping passengers board the boats, they escaped first. </p><h2>  How did people evacuate from the Titanic? </h2><p>  Unorganized properly evacuation of people is still considered the main cause of mass deaths.  The fact that how many people died during the crash of the Titanic testifies to the complete absence of any control over this process.  In 20 lifeboats could accommodate at least 1178 people.  But at the beginning of the evacuation they were launched into the water half full, and not only by women and children, but also by entire families, and even with tame dogs.  As a result, the boat occupancy rate was only 60%. </p>

Class III people were able to get on deck only at the end of the evacuation, and therefore, even the crew members eventually escaped more.  Numerous clarifications of the causes and facts of the shipwreck confirm that the responsibility for how many people died on the Titanic rests entirely with the captain of the liner.

    <h2>  Memories of eyewitnesses of the tragedy </h2><p>  All those who pulled a <span>lucky ticket</span> from a sinking ship into a lifeboat received unforgettable impressions of the first and last flight of the Titanic liner.  The facts, the number of deaths, the causes of the disaster were obtained thanks to their testimony.  The memories of some surviving passengers have been published and will forever remain in history. </p><p>  In 2009, Millvin Dean, the last woman from the Titanic passengers who survived, passed away.  At the time of the shipwreck, she was only two and a half months old.  Her father died on a sinking liner, and her mother and brother escaped with her.  And although the woman had no memories of that terrible night, the disaster made such a deep impression on her that she forever refused to visit the shipwreck and never watched feature films and documentaries about the Titanic. </p>

A piece of steel was tested, and scientists proved that the metal of which the liner body was made was of poor quality.
