The ancient beauties of Rome, the canals of Venice, the shops of Milan ... This is what is heard, what everyone knows about.  Have you ever heard of Chianciano Terme?  Meanwhile, it is a wonderful thermal resort, one of the best in its profile.  Which one?  This is what we propose to learn from our material. </p><h2>  Siena Province </h2><p>  First of all, at least briefly tell about the province of Siena in Italy, because it is there that the resort of interest to us is located.  Siena is located in the Tuscany region (pizza lovers probably know about this), and its administrative center is the city of the same name.  In Siena, which consists of 36 communes, a little more than 260 thousand inhabitants live (in Italy, the commune is the territory consisting of one main city - the commune is named after it and gets its name - and the surrounding area). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecohoteledy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuscany Region" class="if uuid-3222213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222213.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient times, Siena was called the Siena Republic and was the main competitor to Florence (which is located next to Siena).  In the mid-sixteenth century, it became part of the Tuscan Duchy, and now is the most famous part of Tuscany.  It is in Siena in Italy that there are many attractions of this entire region - and not only the sources of interest to us.  The Franks Road - evidence of ancient routes, many ancient castles and medieval squares, several UNESCO heritage sites - all this and much more can be found in the province of Siena.  Therefore, we strongly recommend staying there at least for a couple of days - you will not be disappointed! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chianciano Terme </h2><p>  So, Chianciano is, as we have already mentioned, a thermal spring.  And this is one of the thirty-six Siena communes, with its history, traditions and picturesque views, as well as attractions.  Even going to Chianciano Terme for a spa treatment, it‚Äôs worth highlighting a day or two just in order to slowly explore the main city of the commune.  She is very small - there live less than ten thousand people.  By Russian standards, it‚Äôs like a village where everyone knows each other. </p><p>  The commune has its patron saint - this is St. John the Baptist, the day of celebration of which falls on June 24.  And the thermal springs located in Chianciano Terme are no less than the oldest in the world!  They were known even at the time of the Etruscans - and this is the fourth century BC.  By the way, the famous emperor Augustus was treated precisely at the local resorts. </p><p>  Chianciano is known for the fact that, despite the presence of a prestigious resort (which flock from all over the world), it is quite calm here, and if you are looking for peace and solitude, the community of Chianciano on the Tuscan hills will suit you very well.  Holidays in Chianciano Terme can be perfectly combined (or supplemented) with balneological procedures, thereby simultaneously killing two birds with one stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toscanaovunquebella.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Chianciano Terme" class="if uuid-3222216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222216.jpg"></div><h2>  Source Specialization </h2><p>  Each thermal spring has its own treatment profile.  Karlovy Vary (another well-known source located in the Czech Republic), for example, goes to eliminate problems with the stomach, intestines and esophagus - they treat ulcers, intestinal disorders, and so on.  As for the thermal resort of Chianciano Terme, its specialization is diseases of the liver and biliary tract, as well as the musculoskeletal system and respiratory system.  In addition, diabetics come here - healing sources help to successfully overcome diabetes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Medical resort </h2><p>  In total, several sources operate on the territory of the balneological resort in Chianciano Terme, but four main ones.  These are Aqua Santa, Aqua Fucoli, Aqua Santissima and Aqua Sillen.  Next, we‚Äôll tell you a little more about each of them, but first you need to say that in Chianchano Terme a unique structure has been developed aimed at cleansing and healing the body.  In addition to the sources, there are diagnostic, medical and rehabilitation centers of completely different profiles, mud and inhalation centers, beauty salons and spas.  It is important that each of these institutions works all year round and receives patients of any age within its walls. </p><p>  Understanding Chianciano Terme's infrastructure is easy.  The resort has three main buildings.  The diagnostic center includes various medical facilities, a spa center includes beauty establishments, and Terme Sillene directly sources. </p><h2>  Aqua Santa </h2><p>  It is the most popular source of all four.  It has the most comfortable temperature - plus 33 degrees, and in its composition it contains sulfate, calcium, bicarbonate, as well as several other useful macrocells.  Drinking water from Aqua Santa on an empty stomach in the morning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecohoteledy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Santa" class="if uuid-3222220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222220.jpg"></div><p>  The source is located surrounded by centuries-old trees, the view from here is amazing.  The panorama here inspired Federico Fellini for the movie ‚Äú8 and a Half,‚Äù and the writer <span>Luigi Pirandello</span> made Aqua Santo in one of his stories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Aqua Fucoli </h2><p>  Aqua Fucoli, located in the resort's eponymous park, is a cold spring, the water temperature is only 16 degrees above zero.  And although the composition of the water is about the same as that of the source of Aqua Santa, the ratio of the components is somewhat different.  Water from Aqua Fucoli is taken after a meal in the afternoon.  Both Aqua Santa and Aqua Fucoli are intended for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, but the water in Aqua Fucoli is weak and is considered as a supplement to Aqua Santa. </p><h2>  Aqua Santissima </h2><p>  The third source is mainly used by those who came to treat respiratory diseases.  It is hypothermic, there is a huge amount of mineral salts, and therefore its waters are the best suited precisely for combating the above ailments.  Water temperature - plus 24 degrees, it is used either in the form of inhalation, or as an aerosol. </p><h2>  Aqua Sillen </h2><p>  Finally, the warmest Aqua Sillene (+38.5 degrees) due to its moisturizing and nourishing properties (such components are included in it) is used not so much in the treatment of diseases (except diseases of the musculoskeletal system), but in cosmetology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lastminuteterme.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sillen" class="if uuid-3222221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222221.jpg"></div><p>  Water of this source is also actively used in mud therapy.  It is interesting, by the way, that this source is located on a hill, where before, during the time of the Etruscans, there was a temple - there the Etruscans performed their magical rites. </p><h2>  Contraindications </h2><p>  In some situations it‚Äôs forbidden to come for treatment to Chianciano Terme.  Contraindications to the procedures are: the presence of cancer, the acute stage of any of the existing ailments, failure of one or another organ (cardiac, for example). </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What are the attractions in Chianciano Terme?  First of all, there are several viewing platforms, from where views of the fluffy hills of Tuscany, groves of oak and beech, and the transparent expanse of a local lake called Trasimeno open up with incredible beauty.  First of all, we recommend climbing up to the observation decks - so, having reviewed the surroundings, you can, though fluently, but still get to know the whole territory for many miles around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chianti.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chianciano Terme Center" class="if uuid-3222207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222207.jpg"></div><p>  In the town of Chianciano, which consists of two parts, the old and the new, stretching along the thermal springs, many ancient buildings that represent the historical heritage are still preserved.  Beautiful castles and palaces, the building of the city hall, several temples - each building impresses with its appearance, its atmosphere.  In addition, there are many picturesque and very cozy parks, on the tracks of which you can walk around the clock.  In general, there is definitely something to see in Chianciano Terme.  And if you feel hungry or want to "shop", at your service are wonderful restaurants with very tasty cuisine (as, indeed, everywhere in Italy), souvenir shops and shops. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  There are enough hotels in Chianciano Terme, so there are no problems with the choice of housing.  From hotels with four stars you can pay attention to the Admiral Palace, which is located in the very center of the commune.  It has its own spa center with a relaxation room, the hotel tasty food, the rooms are clean and tidy, it is nice to be in them.  Another good four-star hotel is the Grand Hotel Terme, which is located between the main square of the city and a large forest, where you can safely walk.  There is also a spa, and the rooms are warm, which in the cold season in Italy is a great advantage.  And on a high hill in the city center, offering breathtaking views, there is a lower star hotel - Albergo Villa Gaia 3 *.  Next to it are the baths and the old city. </p><h2>  Food </h2><p>  Where to eat in Chianciano Terme  Experienced travelers definitely recommend to look into the pizzeria Rosso Vivo Pizzeria Verace - there, according to reviews, they serve simply divine pizza.  The appearance of the institution is quite simple - ordinary wooden tables, tin-ashtrays, but there is a clean and comfortable terrace, as well as air conditioning.  And in general, the main thing is not decoration, but tasty food - and it is guaranteed to be present in this pizzeria, and not only tasty, but also very satisfying.  The owners of the pizzeria are friendly and sociable - they will not only feed you, but they will also tell you about the origin of the pizza, and demonstrate the process of making the dough. </p><h2>  How to get to Chianciano Terme, Italy </h2><p>  There is nothing complicated about it.  The nearest international airport is in Rome.  After landing there, you should take the train that runs every fifteen minutes to the central railway station of the Italian capital.  Then you need to get to the station called Chiusi.  A regular bus runs from there every twenty minutes directly to Chianciano Terme, and it‚Äôs not far to go - the distance between Chianciano and Chiusi is about seven kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilturista.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chianciano Terme Italy" class="if uuid-3222206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3222206.jpg"></div><p>  If you intend to undertake such a march-throw by car, you should know that your highway is A1.
