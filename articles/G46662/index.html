    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  As you already understood, Dolzhanka is one of the villages of the <span>Yeisk district of the</span> Krasnodar Territory.  It was founded by Cossacks back in the 19th century and is located on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, at the base of the Long Spit.  About 40 km the city of Yeysk developed.  Today the <span>Long Spit</span> is a kind <span>of nature monument of the Krasnodar Territory.</span>  Its unique shell beaches, freshwater lakes and a diverse fauna and flora each year bring here new tourists.  Nearby is the Veterok, a recreation center visited by hundreds of Russians every year. </p><h2>  Base Description </h2><p>  Initially, it was built as a resort and sanatorium base for rest and treatment of Russians.  The Azov coast of Russia was right for these purposes.  "Veterok" is <span>a recreation center</span> located in the village of Dolzhanskaya Yeisk district, on the shore of the Taganrog Bay, in a park zone.  This is a very good place for parents with young children.  Wonderful shallow beaches with golden sand stretch to the horizon, the children are ready to splash around in warm water for days on end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolzhanskaya breeze" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1021967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  All lovers of beach holidays are waiting for the welcoming "Veterok".  The recreation center makes it possible to spend a lot of time in the fresh air, hiking in beautiful places.  However, if you worry that you will be bored in the evenings, then it is completely in vain.  There is a market and shops, cafes and bars, cinemas, as well as a luxury tour block.  That is, you will find here everything you need for an amazing vacation.  In 2004, the Veterok base was reconstructed for the last time.  Dolzhanskaya village offers a number of boarding houses, sports and health centers to choose from, but today we will focus only on this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="debtor base" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1022236.jpg" width="600"></div>

The village Dolzhanskaya succeeded in this.  The recreation center "Veterok" offers accommodation 81 rooms.  These are double, triple, quadruple, junior suites and suites.  Some rooms are located in detached cottages. </p><p>  Now a little more detail.  On the base there are a number of wooden houses designed for 2, 3 or 4 people.  These are ordinary summer buildings without amenities.  In each such house there is a refrigerator and a set of dishes, and a toilet and shower are located on the territory.  In addition, there are brick and wooden houses of a higher class, there is already a refrigerator and a TV, air conditioning.  The toilet, shower and washbasin are one in 2 rooms.  These are considered junior suites.  The suites are still slightly different from them, they are located in brick houses, equipped with air conditioning and a TV, fridge and bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="debtor prices" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1021973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  I must say that this is another point for which the village Dolzhanka is so appreciated by tourists.  The prices here are quite affordable, so a vacation on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov will not affect your budget too much.  Renting a double house without amenities without meals - from 288 rubles per day, a triple house without amenities costs 438 rubles.  per day.  Quadruple without amenities will cost you 563 rubles. </p><p>  Houses with partial amenities, brick or wooden for two people cost 688 rubles a day without food, and for three people - 938. If you are traveling in four, you can rent a similar house for 1250 rubles.  Finally, the beloved brick houses with amenities.

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Meals are not included in the package price, so you can go to dinner in cafes or restaurants in a city like Yeysk.  Dolzhanka also invites you to any of the local canteens, and the easiest way is to dine right at the recreation center.  There is an excellent dining room in which you will be offered three meals a day at a modest price - only 400 rubles per day.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the cuisine here is excellent, the menu contains all kinds of pastries, fresh vegetables and fruits, wines and beer for every taste, which any gourmet will appreciate.  I must say that even sophisticated connoisseurs give these drinks high marks. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Vacationers very warmly remember the time spent here.  All guests emphasize that the base is a huge amount of entertainment.  You can play billiards or go horse riding.  Others like the opportunity to go to the sauna, the third all nights spend all night at discos. </p><p>  Separately, there are reviews of the cinema hall, in which older guests like to spend time.  Those who come with a cheerful, friendly company say that there are excellent conditions for picnics.  There are gazebos equipped with barbecue facilities, as well as a sports ground and tennis court to get in shape after evening gatherings. </p><p>  And finally, without exception, everyone likes the opportunity to travel around the protected area.  The tour desk offers dozens of route options of varying lengths and complexity, but Dolgaya Spit is the most popular. </p>
