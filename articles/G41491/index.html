  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the houses in France? French style concept</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From time immemorial France was considered the standard of style and set the tone and fashion trends throughout Europe.  They imitated this beautiful country, copied it, and were proud of its similarity with it.  It is no coincidence that the aristocracy and members of the royal families conducted small conversations and official correspondence in French, even being subjects of another state.  The influence of the trendsetter also affected architecture.  Now all over the world, including Russia, many people are building French-style country houses. What is so special about it?  What kind of houses are they in France?  Answers can be found in the next article. </p><h2>  Typical french house </h2><div class="photo" data-original="studentizaslobodu.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Typical Alsace House" class="if uuid-3180759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180759.jpg"></div><p>  What kind of picture appears in the imagination at the mention of a French house?  My heart becomes warm from these words.  It seems a dream house, created for a leisurely happy life, filled with love.  Small but spacious, in two or three floors, with a sloping roof, charming with its elegant simplicity, friendly and alluring, drowning in flowers.  Roses, mallow, pelargoniums or clematis are everywhere: on the balcony, on the eaves under the windows, on the site next to the porch.  From this house an atmosphere of warmth and coziness blows.  In the evenings, family dinners are held in the living room for lively conversation, and in the summertime, gourmet snacks are served on the outdoor terrace with a glass of light home-made wine from grapes grown by hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of architectural styles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral" class="if uuid-3184789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3184789.jpg"></div><p>  Each era in the history of the country influenced the formation of architectural styles and determined their characteristic features.  So, houses in France were built in Roman traditions until the 11th century and were not particularly graceful, because the emphasis was placed on the strength and power of the structure. </p><p>  In the XI century, the Roman era begins in Europe.  Vaulted ceilings appear in temples, facades are decorated with sculptures, a round window called a rose is cut above the main entrance.  Kings and nobles lived in formidable impregnable castles, characterized by severity and located more often in the hills or surrounded by moats.  The windows were disordered and could be located at different levels.  The central element of the monastery or castle becomes the main tower - the dungeon, which is surrounded by other buildings of simple geometric shapes. </p><p>  In the late Middle Ages, the Gothic style dominated in France, which is characterized by high narrow forms of towers and windows.  Architectural elements are decorated with carvings and stained-glass windows.  The trend was observed both in temples and in castles and apartment buildings of the aristocracy. </p><p>  The architecture of the French Renaissance was marked by a love of symmetrical lines, columns and pilasters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Renaissance architecture is being replaced by the rococo style.  Roof balustrades, stucco moldings in the form of curls, pediments of various shapes, high pilasters on facades and flower garlands reflect the desire of the French aristocracy for luxury, wealth, and abundance. </p><h2>  Geographical features of the architecture of residential buildings in France </h2><p>  The formation of French architecture is subject not only to the influence of the historical era, but also to climatic conditions, landscape features and traditions of the region.  Especially stand out among the styles of residential buildings in France, the Norman style, Provence and Chateau. </p><h2>  Norman style </h2><div class="photo" data-original="branville.web-sy.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Norman style" class="if uuid-3180752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180752.jpg"></div><p>  As the name implies, the Norman style originated in the province of Normandy.  It combines elegance and Gothic romanticism.  A distinctive feature of the Norman style is a hip roof with wide gables, the ridge of which is decorated with a forged grille and neat spiers.  In the house there is usually an attic, the windows of which are sometimes framed by a stone.  The image is complemented by dormers - original dormers. </p><h2>  Chateau style </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lapresse.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home in france photo" class="if uuid-3180755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180755.jpg"></div><p>  The name of the style comes from the French chateau, which in translation into Russian means "castle".  A house in this style really looks like a real royal monastery and impresses with its grace and splendor.  The style is characterized by a complex facade line, numerous bay windows, arches, ledges, gabled roofs with spiers and multiple chimney pipes. </p><p>  In the house, made in the style of a chateau, a ground floor is surely arranged, which can be used as a cellar for storing wine. </p><h2>  Provence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Provence style" class="if uuid-3180754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180754.jpg"></div><p>  This style embodies the romance of the French countryside.  It is characterized by simplicity and conciseness, not devoid of delicate elegance.  The style is characterized by a sloping roof with dormer windows.  In the exterior decoration of the walls, light shades of plaster are used to avoid overheating under the hot midday sun.  For additional protection against heat and wind, the windows are equipped with wooden shutters.  A constant element of the Provence style is the patio or open terrace on the shady side of the house. </p><h2>  Ancient houses in France: photos and description </h2><p>  Beautiful French architecture of all ages has been preserved not only in fascinating temples and magnificent castles, but also in residential buildings. </p><p>  Walking along the medieval streets, you can easily meet the old houses of France, which have not lost their charm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medieval.mrugala.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="france apartment buildings" class="if uuid-3180743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180743.jpg"></div><p>  For example, an old house in the medieval alley of the town of Carcassonne, located 80 km from Toulouse.  Now a restaurant is organized here. </p><p>  The quaint and unusual house of Marie Antoinette, located in Versailles, attracts attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bienvenue.chateauversailles.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of Marie Antoinette in Versailles" class="if uuid-3180744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180744.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting attraction is the village of Collonges la rouge, located in the Limousin region.  Red sandstone is a characteristic feature of the area.  It was he who served as the main material for building houses and turned the village into a tourist center, attracting more than half a million visitors a year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.france-voyage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old france houses" class="if uuid-3180746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124084/3180746.jpg"></div><p>  The streets of France are simply created in order to slowly walk along them, admire the indescribable beauty, draw inspiration at every step, dream and fall in love! </p>
