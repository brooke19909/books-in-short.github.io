And how pleasant it will be for him to wear a thing sewn by the caring hands of his mother, wife, beloved!  This article proposes to consider the patterns of men's sports and raglan t-shirts, as well as some recommendations for sewing them. </p><h2>  Varieties of Men's T-Shirts </h2><p>  Each man in the wardrobe must have several <span>types of t-shirts</span> that he puts on depending on the season, event (business meeting, going to the office, meeting, leisure) and mood. </p><p>  But there is a certain unspoken classification of them: </p><ol><li>  White T-shirt (more often it is made of cotton fabric) - worn for formal, special occasions or just for a trip on a yacht or around the city with your family. </li><li>  With a V-neck, it is often chosen by a man to relax, walk near the water, to the beach.  And also preferred as a sports men's t-shirt. </li><li>  "Polo" - from cotton fabric, with a small collar and several buttons.  The favorite of many men, regardless of occupation and tastes. </li><li>  Hanley.  It is also a cotton T-shirt, without a collar, but with a few buttons.  Can be worn instead of Polo. </li><li>  “Rugby” is the wardrobe item most beloved by many men.  It has a collar and a small incision in the neck, but does not have buttons.  As a rule, it is sewn from a very durable fabric, which is not at all afraid of repeated washing. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="men's t-shirt pattern" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/1853013.jpg" width="401"></div></li></ol><h2>  Men's t-shirt pattern </h2><p>  How to sew a men's t-shirt?  Next, a simple straight cut model will be considered.  The measure with this method is the minimum amount, which greatly facilitates the task. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, it can be noted that such a cut minimally takes into account the peculiarities of the figure of the person for whom this T-shirt is made.  It's always best to start with a simple one.  And already becoming a more experienced master, you can take for more complex types of cut, which take into account the shoulders, and posture, and so on. </p><h2>  Building a pattern of the back of a T-shirt </h2><p>  To carry out the intended task, it is necessary to take such measurements: </p><ul><li>  half neck circumference - N; </li><li>  half-chest - Cg; </li><li>  product height - Di; </li></ul><p>  Starting to build a pattern for a men's t-shirt, according to the data obtained, it is necessary to build a rectangle whose width (AB).  In fact, this is the width of the future T-shirt and it consists of a half-chest, plus a small allowance for free body fit.  The range of increase for a men's T-shirt of the cut chosen by us can very fluctuate.  In this case, it is enough to stop at 10-12 cm. </p><p>  And the height of the rectangular workpiece (AN) will be equal to the measurement of the height of the product. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, the figure shows that AN is the middle of the back of the T-shirt, and BH1 is the middle part of the shelf.  The top line - AB - is the line of the shoulder level, and the line that is below, - HH1 - is the bottom line. </p><h2>  The construction of the chest line, the width of the back and armhole </h2><p>  We postpone from the point "A" down a third of the taken measure of the semicircle of the chest.  Next, add 8 cm to this value. Let us designate this with a “G”.  Now it is necessary to draw a horizontal from point “G”, which intersects with the front line.  This will be the "G1" point.  So the breast line came out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  To the right side of the “G” point horizontally (chest line), one third of the semicircle of the chest should be set aside and add 6 cm to this indicator. We will designate the resulting point as “G2”.  From it, vertically up, you need to draw a line, which when crossed with the shoulder line gives the point "P". </p><p>  Now you need to determine the width of the armhole of the product: </p><ul><li>  To the right of the “G2” point along the chest line, set aside a quarter of the half-girth of the chest.  Add 4 cm. </li><li>  The new point is called "G3".  The distance (G2-G3) is the width of the armhole. </li><li>  Vertically up from the point "G3" you need to draw a line.  The point of intersection with the line of shoulders is "B1". </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The width of the armhole is divided in half.  Then on the pattern the point "G4" is indicated. </li><li>  From the point "G4" vertically upwards, a line is drawn directly to the bottom line.  The point of intersection is denoted by "H2".  This is a side cut line. </li><li>  Further from point A to the right along the shoulder line, one-third of the neck semicircle value should be set aside, adding another 1 cm to this value. The resulting point is “A1”. </li><li>  Line (A-A1) is the width of the sprout. </li><li>  Then, vertically upward from the point "A1", a line is drawn, which will be the height of the sprout.  And it is equal to half the width of the germ minus 0.5 cm. The resulting point will be called "A2". </li><li>  Line (A1-A2) is the height of the sprout. </li><li>  Now you need to design the neck of the back.  For this, the points "A" and "A2" must be connected by a smooth concave line. </li><li>  From point "P" vertically down, lay 2 cm and mark point "P1".  Next, draw a segment from point "A2" through "P1", slightly prolonging by 1-1.5 cm. It turns out the point "P2". </li></ul><p>  The back of the men's t-shirt is ready. </p><h2>  Building a pattern in front of a T-shirt </h2><p>  The next stage of work on the pattern of men's t-shirts is a cut of the shelf (in front): </p><ul><li>  The width of the neck of the shelf corresponds to the width of the neck of the back (sprout).  In addition, according to the method under consideration, the height of the neck of the front is equal to its width. </li><li>  From "B" to the left horizontally and down vertically, it is necessary to postpone as many centimeters as the line (AA1) is.  The resulting points are denoted by "B2" and "B3, respectively. </li><li>  Thus, BB2 = BB3 = AA1. </li><li>  Next, it is important to form the neckline of the shelf: from point "B2" to point "B3".  This can be done with a compass. </li><li>  It is necessary to postpone 4 cm vertically down from the point "B1". The new point is "P4". </li><li>  Now from “B2” through “P4” it is necessary to draw a shoulder line, extending it by 1-1.5 cm. The resulting point is “P5”. </li></ul><p>  The construction of the main part of the pattern in front of the men's t-shirt is completed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern men's raglan t-shirts" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/1856369.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <ul><li>  From point "A" to point "B" determine the center - point "C". </li><li>  Down from "A" and "B" it is necessary to draw segments equal to a tenth of the exhaust gas.  New points "E" and "E1" are formed. </li><li>  Having connected them, it is necessary to continue to draw lines in different directions for a length equal to AC.  Points "F" and "F1" are formed. </li><li>  Next, the segment BE1 is divided in half, forming a new point "D1".  And from "E" up, you need to postpone half of the segment AE plus add 1 cm. The result is the point "D". </li><li>  Now from C down draw a perpendicular line, the length of which will be equal to the length of the sleeve.  A new point is indicated by the letter "I". </li><li>  From it in different directions it is necessary to postpone FF1 by 2 cm, thereby obtaining "L" and "L1".  Now you need to connect them with "F" and "F1". </li><li>  Thus, by connecting a solid, smooth line connecting F, D, C, F1, D1, we get the okat line of the sleeve of the T-shirt. </li><li>  From “C” down, it is necessary to set aside 11 cm on the CF line and mark a double stroke, and then on the CF1 line - also 11 cm and mark a single stroke.  These are important marks where the sleeve will be sewn into the armhole of the product. </li></ul><h2>  T-shirt with raglan sleeve </h2><p>  The fabric for it can be either knitted or cotton.

    <p>  What is a raglan t-shirt?  This is when the sleeves of the product are covered with the shoulder part of the front and back.  The neck passes smoothly into the shoulders, in simple terms.  Consider building a raglan t-shirt pattern. </p><p>  To start, there are a few general recommendations: </p><ul><li>  In order for the fabric to remain elastic in the places where the seams are made, the details of the pattern must be sewn with a narrow zigzag stitch. </li><li>  And in order for the lower edge to remain extensible, it is necessary to overcast the hem with an overlock.  Then grind, using a double needle for this purpose. </li><li>  The same applies to the decoration of the other edges of the product, it is important that they retain their elasticity. </li></ul><p>  As for the pattern of men's raglan t-shirts, in some ways it is similar to the pattern of a regular sports t-shirt.  The figures show the contour lines of the construction of the back and front, as well as the sleeves. </p>

    <p>  Raglan is being built on the pattern of the front and rear halves.  Set aside 4 centimeters from the highest point of the shoulder along the neckline.  And now you need to combine these points with the highest point of the side seam.  Separate the raglan details and transfer them to the sides of the sleeve corresponding to them. </p><p>  When all this is done, it is necessary to remove the details of the raglan from the front and back of the pattern. </p><p>  All details must be signed so that nothing is confused when sewing T-shirts. </p>
