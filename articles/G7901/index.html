    <p>  The Vuoksa River is one of the most beautiful rivers of the Karelian Isthmus.  It is an unusual water system, including a network of lakes, channels and canals.  The river connects Lake Saimaa, located in Finland, with <span>Lake Ladoga,</span> located in the Leningrad Region. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The name of the river comes from the Karelian-Finnish combination ‚ÄúVuota‚Äù, which means ‚Äúflow‚Äù or ‚Äúflow‚Äù, ‚Äúvuo‚Äù translates as ‚Äúflow‚Äù or ‚Äúchannel‚Äù.  In ancient books, the lower reaches of the river were called "Uzerva" or "new lake". </p><h2>  Vuoksa - can it be called a river? </h2><p>  The Vuoksa River is a complex water system, including a network of lakes that are interconnected by various channels.  This fact allows us only to conditionally calculate its total length.  The total length is 156 kilometers, but in the Finnish territory the river occupies only 13 km.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe river basin is 52.4 thousand kilometers.  Water consumption on the river is more than 600 cubic meters per second. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Vuoksa River: Map of the Current </h2><p>  The river begins on the territory of Finland in Lake Saimaa.  Then it crosses the ridge of Salpausselk√§ and forms the Imatra waterfall.  After that, its channel gradually increases and forms a lake, passing into a narrow channel.  After the village of Vuoksa, it is divided into two arms.  The northern arm passes to Lake Balkhanov, and then after the village of Vasilyevo it is divided into numerous channels that form <span>Lake Vuoksa.</span>  Out of it comes the Tikhaya duct and Vuoks directly, which flow into Lake Ladoga.  The southern arm flows into Lake Sukhodolskoye, from which the Burnaya River flows, flowing into Ladoga.  Sleeves are connected in the <span>Lyubimovskoye lake,</span> forming a horseshoe shape.  From it, water again flows into the river branches. </p>

    <h2>  "Finnish Vuoksa" </h2><p>  The river originates in the Finnish lake Saimaa, located at an altitude of 74 meters above sea level.  Not far from the lake, the Vuoksa River forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Finland and Europe as a whole.  Imatra Waterfall, whose height reaches 82 meters, is also the largest in Europe. </p>

    <p>  In 1929, a hydroelectric power station was built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe waterfall, and the river was directed into a new channel.  The strong and powerful Imatra Falls amazes tourists with its beauty and charm.  It is very popular from May to October.  It is during this period that you can enjoy the full power of the waterfall and see how swift jets of water crash against the stones, creating thousands of refreshing water splashes sparkling in the sunshine by millions of colorful overflows.  In addition, every vacationer who came to these places during the tourist season, as well as on the eve of the New Year and Christmas holidays, can see an incredible water show, accompanied by light illumination and delightful musical sounds of Sibelius compositions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vuoksa River, Leningrad Region.  River hoses </h2><p>  Vuoksa is not only an incredibly beautiful river, but also a clean one.  Its waters are so transparent that even the smallest pebbles at the bottom of the reservoir can be seen through their thickness.  On the territory of our country in winter, it is covered with a thick layer of ice and thaws only in April, when spring fully enters into its own rights.  The Vuoksa River of the Leningrad Region spans 143 kilometers. </p><p>  It flows into Lake Ladoga in the form of two water arms.  The northern arm flows into the lake near Priozersk, the southern one - first passes through the Sukhodolskoye lake, then flows into the Stormy channel.  Today, the water level in the northern arm of Vuoksa has declined significantly.  The reason for this is the overgrowing of lakes that feed the river.  This fact was first recorded back in 1980, when the topographic map of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region, where Lake Balkhanovsky is indicated, was replenished with new thickets that were not there 20 years ago.  In the lower reaches of the northern arm you can see the remains of the ancient Karelian fortress ‚ÄúTiverskoye Gorodishche‚Äù, built in the 9th century.  Vuoksa Lake is also located here, famous for its picturesque bays and bays. </p>

    <p>  The southern arm is still being formed.  Along Lake Sukhodolsky, stretching for 32 kilometers, a six-meter boulder terrace was formed.  Further, the Vuoksa flow to Lake Ladoga is carried out through the Burnaya river. </p><h2>  Riverbed </h2><p>  Vuoksa is just an amazing river.  During its existence, its channel was able to change its direction several times.  Until 1818, the excess water of Lake Sukhodolsky, located in Finland, was constantly dumped into the Vuoksa riverbed.  During the flood of 1818, its waters were washed away by the adjacent territories, which led to a decrease in the level of 7 meters.  As a result of this decline, Vuoksa changed her direction.  In 1857, the northern branch of the river, which until then was the main one, partially dried up, which again changed the course. </p><h2>  Recreation and fishing in Vuoksa </h2><p>  The Karelian Isthmus, where the channel of the Vuoksa River passes, is a popular tourist destination in the north-west of Russia.  The local nature is famous for its beauty and uniqueness.  Amazing white nights, picturesque lakes, a huge variety of fish, mushrooms and berries. </p><p>  Rest on the Vuoksa River will allow you to enjoy its beauty and charm.  Its nature and terrain are so variable that sometimes even experienced travelers are surprised.  <span>Gentle shores</span> pass into high stone terraces, on the top of which pine trees of an unusual shape proudly rise.  Their trunks are sometimes so intertwined that they resemble amazing sculptures.  Among vacationers, local recreation centers are popular - Quiet Backwater, Old Castle and Daisies. </p><p>  The main thing that the Vuoksa River is famous for is fish.  Quiet river backwaters, where nature seemed to have descended from the canvases of artists, are famous for a wide variety of ichthyofauna.  Pike, ruff, perch, bleak and roach - the variety of fish is impressive.  Well, local bream are known far beyond the region.  In the cold seasons, burbot fishing is very popular.  In addition, you can catch expensive trophies here.  Salmon, whitefish and trout are very common in these places.  Numerous travel lovers, fishermen, and in past centuries, emperors prefer the Vuoksa River.  Fishing in these places is simply unforgettable. </p>
