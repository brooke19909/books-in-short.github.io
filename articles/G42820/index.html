    <p>  Together with Druzhkovka, Krasny Liman, Slavic, Svyatogorsky and Kramatorsk, it is part of the Kramatorsk agglomeration.  Nikolaevka itself (Ukraine, Donetsk region) has about 15 thousand inhabitants.  Although it is a city of regional significance (this status was obtained in 2003), it is administratively subordinate to nearby Slavyansk. </p><h2>  The foundation and history of the town </h2><p>  The settlement was founded in 1730 by Danila Bystritsky.  He served as a convoy in the Izyum regiment.  The first inhabitants were the families of two Grunsky brothers.  Then the population grew, and after 2 years there were more than 80 people. </p><p>  It was then that the settlement received its first name - Red Bull.  And not in vain, because in the vicinity there are a lot of deposits of red clay, and the river, which flowed into the Seversky Donets in the Nikolaevka region, eroded it and carried it along the course. </p>

    <p>  The water turned cloudy red. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the village grew, and there were already about 2 thousand people in it.  At the same time, it was renamed Nikolaevka, most likely, in honor of the icon of St. Nicholas, who was in the local chapel. </p><h2>  Industrial development in Nikolaevka </h2><p>  Clay in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNikolaevka and in the surrounding territories turned out to be very high quality.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the first small porcelain factory was founded here.  This was done by the entrepreneur Essen.  Most residents of the village got a stable job. </p>

    <p>  Pottery was also popular.  In Nikolaevka even a professional school of this art was opened.  In the 1930s, two collective farms also operated in the settlement. </p><p>  The war years were difficult for the inhabitants of Nikolaevka, because in 1941 - 1942 the front line was not far.  When the Germans had to retreat, they organized the evacuation of civilians to the west and themselves took out their equipment and soldiers along with them.  So people from Nikolaevka ended up in the nearby village of Varvarovka, Kramatorsky district.  Their native settlement was burned down by the Germans, only 70 of almost a thousand houses remained.  I had to rebuild everything. </p><p>  One of the most significant post-war projects was the construction of the Slavyanskaya TPP in the territory of Nikolaevka.  At that time, it was one of the most powerful in Europe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the conflict that Ukraine is suffering is still in full swing.  Nikolaevka, the photo of the destroyed buildings of which is presented below, also suffered considerable losses. </p>

    <h2>  The village of Nikolaevka in the Crimea: foundation and a brief history </h2><p>  This village is located on the Black Sea coast, at a distance of 40 km from Simferopol.  It has the status of an urban-type settlement since 1988, since no more than 3 thousand people live there.  At the moment it is part of the autonomous republic of Crimea. </p><p>  It was founded in 1858 with the permission of the king, the former sailor Andrei Bobyr, who participated in the Crimean War, in particular, in the First Defense of Sevastopol.  He and his son dug dugouts on the seashore, and so the two families lived the first time.  Then they were joined by migrants from the Poltava region.  They also dug themselves dugouts. </p>

    <p>  Since the situation with drinking water is not very good, they all settled down near the spring Nikolov Key, and therefore the residents later called their new habitat Nikolaevka.  At the beginning of the 20th century, houses built from shell rock and covered with straw appeared in the settlement.  Nikolaevka gradually ennobled.  In 1900, its population was already approximately 350 people. </p><p>  In the pre-war years, a collective farm was organized here, which was engaged in the cultivation of cotton and fishing. </p><p>  In 1941, it was from the vicinity of the village of Nikolaevka (Ukraine) that fire was fired on fascist invaders who blocked the Simferopol-Yevpatoriya road, and this event is considered the beginning of the defense of Sevastopol. </p><h2>  Resort development </h2><p>  Around the beginning of the 1960s, vacationers began to come here little by little.  What attracted them to this outback?  Firstly, the beaches here are covered with small pebbles, and the bottom of the sea is flat, there are no sharp cliffs.  Secondly, housing is always cheaper here than in Yalta or Sevastopol.  Therefore, Nikolaevka is chosen by lovers of a calm and budget holiday, families with children often come.  Also, often on weekends Simferopol residents themselves appear here to soak up a day or two in sunbathing, because it is the closest resort to the <span>capital of Crimea.</span>  In addition, in recent years, Nikolaevka has noticeably become prettier: developed infrastructure, restaurants, mini-hotels have appeared, transport links have been established with Sevastopol, Simferopol, Yevpatoria. </p><p>  Now the rest here can also be more or less varied.  For example, you can taste the dishes of the Crimean Tatar, Armenian, Georgian cuisine, go to the Saki healing lake, visit a natural park or bring children to the Banana Republic in Yevpatoria.  All this is located at a distance of 20 km from Nikolaevka. </p><p>  Also, there is no port, or any harmful production.  Nikolaevka is a truly environmentally friendly resort.  The air here is rich in iodine ions, so it is especially useful for those who suffer from disorders of the thyroid gland.  So all the advantages of relaxing in this Crimean village are obvious. </p>

    <h2>  Ukraine, the village of Nikolaevka (Dnipropetrovsk region) </h2><p>  In general, in the Dnipropetrovsk region there are as many as 9 settlements with the same name.  It is mainly a village.  But now I want to mention the largest of them.  This is the village of Nikolaevka (Ukraine) in the Petropavlovsk district of the above region.  It has good transport links, as it lies directly on the E-50 highway, which connects Dnepropetrovsk and Donetsk, and also directly on the territory of the village there are two railway stations of the Donetsk railway. </p><p>  At first, the village was called Nikolskaya Sloboda, and retired pikemen (kind of infantry) of the Lugansk regiment lived in it.  Previously, their garrison was in Slavyansk, where there was a wooden Nikolskaya church.  That is why they called the new settlement.  Later they moved this church to their settlement.  It is still valid, although it was closed twice in the Soviet era.  They opened it for the second time in 1991, when Ukraine became an independent power. </p><p>  The village of Nikolaevka today boasts one of the best schools in the region. </p><h2>  Nikolaevka (Kiev region, Makarovsky district) </h2><p>  This is a very tiny village with a population of 30 people, but it is interesting because the ethno-complex "Ukrainian Village" is located near it.  This is a unique open-air installation, where dwellings with all utensils in the national style are recreated. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to get to Nikolaevka: after leaving Kiev along the Zhytomyr highway, you need to turn right in the direction of Khmelnaya after leaving the village of Lyubimovka.  After 5 km, there will be a village Nikolaevka (Ukraine, Kiev region).  Or you can get there by regular bus from Kiev.  He is recovering from the Svyatoshin metro station. </p><p>  Of course, it is impossible to tell about all the settlements bearing the name Nikolaevka (Ukraine).  The map is replete with similar names, because almost every region has its own settlement with that name, or even several. </p>
