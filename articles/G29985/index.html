    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  When Rumyantsev was abroad on duty, he began to collect objects of Russian culture and history, paying particular attention to the first printed books, ancient manuscripts, church books, and government documents.  He was able to recreate the collections, surprising quality and wealth. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  In 1814, Rumyantsev submitted a letter of resignation and was fully engaged in the study of Russian history.  He gathered around himself scientists, the result of the scientific work of which was the publication of several dozen books and the foundation of the museum. </p><p>  In 1824, the count began the reconstruction of the <span>house.</span>  <span>The</span> Rumyantsev <span>mansion</span> was decorated with a majestic 12-column portico.  Under the roof of this magnificent building was placed a high relief of the famous sculptor I. Martos with a scene from ancient Greek mythology.  So the palace appears before us in our time. </p><p>  In 1826, Count Rumyantsev passed away, instructing his brother to make a museum out of the house with all his collections.  The count's wish was fulfilled, and a museum was founded in the house, the exhibits of which included all the objects collected by the count.  A visit to the museum for some time remained completely free, and anyone could enter and get acquainted with the presented exhibits.  But after the death of the count‚Äôs brother, whose money the museum lived on, the period of regression began in the history of the mansion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
