Legoland Park is a great place to hang out with your child if you have chosen the capital <span>of Bavaria</span> as a place for family vacations.  In this article, we will tell not only about this interesting time travel (after all, getting here, we all return to childhood!), But also about how to get there on our own. </p><p>  Of course, there are tours to the Legoland from Munich.  But, firstly, it is quite expensive.  Secondly, you will not be limited in time and will be able to stay on the rides for as long as your soul desires.  However, the choice is yours. </p><p>  We simply present here various options and summarize the advice of tourists who visited this wonderful park.  And there are many traveler reviews, because many understand that the positive emotions of a child during a trip are very important.  Moreover, a visit to such a park will cause a storm of positive and leave a wonderful impression for a long time. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.4272753" data-lng="10.296692600000029" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/4/0/1/8401.png"></div><h2>  What is Legoland in Germany? </h2><p>  From the name it is clear that this park is associated with the famous and extremely popular developing designer for children.  The company opened its first attraction city in Denmark in 1968.  All buildings and structures in it were built of multi-colored bricks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are currently six such parks worldwide.  And in Germany he appeared in 2002.  The nearest major city is Munich.  Legoland was opened in the Bavarian town of Gunzburg.  In addition, near Berlin there is also a mini version of this park - the Legoland Discovery Center. </p><p>  Gunzburg is 130 kilometers from Munich.  Therefore, you still need to know how to get there in order to get acquainted with his miracles.  And, believe me, there are plenty of them in Legoland. </p><p>  There are so many of them that visitors are offered a special walk in the park by mini-train so that they can choose where to go with their children.  So you can easily navigate in this amazing town. </p><p>  Therefore, many travelers include this amusement park in their travel program in Bavaria.  Naturally, they are interested in the question of how to get there. </p><p>  But keep in mind that the amusement town is seasonal.  In winter, he does not work.  Therefore, plan to visit it from April to the end of November. </p><p>  Tickets to the park are best taken in advance, online, on the Legolenda official website.  Then there is the opportunity to get a good discount.  In addition - as a pleasant bonus - you do not have to stand long lines at the box office. </p><p>  You just get from Munich to Legoland yourself, with printed tickets.  And then, without wasting time, immediately approach the turnstiles.  Thus, you can enjoy entertainment longer than other tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": Sasa Nikolic, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland (Munich) - tours" class="if uuid-2786593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786593.jpg"></div><h2>  What does Legoland consist of? </h2><p>  From Munich to the amusement park is not difficult to get, and we will definitely return to this issue later, but for now we will focus on the features of this object.  The park is divided into several thematic zones.  We can say that these are 8 different towns and entertainment areas.  These are ‚ÄúLand of Miniatures‚Äù, ‚ÄúKingdom of Pirates‚Äù, ‚ÄúKingdom of the Knights‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorld of Adventures‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A visit to the park also involves a real quest for children - a trip to Legoredo Town, full of breathtaking surprises.  There is also an aquazone - actually a small sea - where water races are held.  And the most extreme attraction is the Lego Test Track.  If you take a chance, the adrenaline supply is guaranteed to you. </p><p>  In addition, the company would not be itself if it had not provided young tourists with the opportunity to create their masterpieces from the famous designer.  Therefore, a special zone has been opened in the park for the development of imagination, where visitors - both children and, by the way, adults, can try themselves in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere. </p><p>  By the way, the highlight of this zone is the exhibition, where all <span>European cities are</span> represented built in lego - in miniature.  Here is the final stop of the small train.  It is called the Miniland. </p><p>  By the way, this exhibition presents not only architectural sights, but also the most picturesque places of the globe, also made of cubes.  By the way, some objects can be controlled using special joysticks. </p><p>  In addition, in "Legoland" there are also playgrounds where the baby can go wild and "let off steam."  It is interesting that in this attraction city there is a real driving school for young drivers.  There, the child can not only learn to hold the steering wheel, but even get the right to pass the exam and instructor. </p><p>  Keep in mind: you can get acquainted with the various areas of the park not only by sitting on a mini-train, but also by climbing to the observation deck of a high tower, the spire of which is visible from almost anywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": Mathias Pohl, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland near Munich" class="if uuid-2786608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786608.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get from Munich to Legoland on your own </h2><p>  <span>The amusement park in Germany</span> is located at some distance both from the capital of Bavaria and from the main attractions of this federal state.  Therefore, although it is said that the "Legolanda" is located in Germany, in Munich, in fact, you will have to go there from this city. </p><p>  There are many ways to get to the famous amusement park.  Firstly, by taxi or by rented car.  Private transfers are also available. </p><p>  Secondly, by train and bus.  In the latter case, the distance Munich - "Legoland" you will overcome in about two and a half hours.  You will spend 60 minutes less by car. </p><p>  To get from the <span>capital of Bavaria</span> to the famous park is not difficult in any case.  Therefore, probably, most tourists are looking for the opportunity to visit it not with a guided tour, but on their own. </p><p>  You can also combine a trip to the park with a healthy lifestyle for the whole family.  In Munich, it is not difficult to rent bicycles.  Have you chosen?  Now take the train, which leaves from Munich's main railway station and goes through the Kleinketz station. </p><p>  From there, you can cycle along a comfortable path through the woods directly to Legoland.  It is literally a couple of kilometers.  Fans of walks can walk this distance on foot, especially in fine weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": GT1976, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland, Munich: photos" class="if uuid-2786590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786590.jpg"></div><h2>  Car </h2><p>  How to get to Legoland from Munich by your own or rented car?  There is nothing easier.  You leave Munich on the A8 highway, overcome the segment between Ulm and Augsburg.  Do not miss the exit to Gunzburg.  But you can‚Äôt get to the city.  Then turn left and follow the road B16.  Stay on Krumbach.  And then pointers to Legoland will appear. </p><p>  Having a car gives you complete freedom.  You can go straight to the park, or you can circle around the area. </p><p>  If you want to see some sights along the way, we recommend stopping by in Ulm and Augsburg.  These beautiful German towns are simply the pearls of ancient architecture. </p><p>  For example, Ulm has the world's highest cathedral.  His steeple rises 162 meters above sea level.  From the observation deck of this church, excellent photos are obtained. </p><p>  But if you arrived at the Legoland parking lot in your car, get ready to pay a daily fee.  It is 6 euros (470 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapme.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to Legoland by car" class="if uuid-2790007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2790007.jpg"></div><h2>  Train </h2><p>  So, we chose public transport to get to the Legoland (Germany).  How to get from Munich to Gunzburg?  The cheapest way to do this is by train. </p><p>  They depart in the direction of Gunzburg from Munich Main Station almost every half hour.  Check your regional train schedules in advance.  Not all of them follow through Gunzburg.  Sometimes, to save time, you will have to change trains in Ulm or Augsburg. </p><p>  The German electric trains themselves - or regional trains - are a very comfortable form of transport.  They are equipped with comfortable seats, there is a lot of optimized space for large luggage and bicycles. </p><p>  These trains seem to have been invented for an inexpensive and near trip.  They go regularly.  They are easiest to get to nearby cities such as Gunzburg.  Regional trains are divided into regular trains, express trains and es-bans (or the trains themselves).  The latter are more reminiscent of high-speed trams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ohgodmywifeisgerman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland (Germany) - how to get from Munich" class="if uuid-2786642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786642.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  So, you got off at the train station in Gunzburg from the train coming from Munich.  How to get to Legoland?  From the station to the entertainment town - about five kilometers. </p><p>  The bus number 818 carries directly to the park from Gunzburg. To get on it, you need to go through the underpass and get to the forecourt.  To her left is a small bus station.  There are three landing platforms.  On one of them the necessary bus also stops.  You won‚Äôt miss it - it is decorated in a very colorful way - it is pasted over with posters with the schedule of the park.  There is a bus every 20-30 minutes.  There is also a free shuttle to Legoland.  But he does not go very often, you need to check the schedule. </p><p>  By the way, the bus is forbidden to eat and drink during the trip.  In the cabin, special inscriptions even hang, from which it is clear that in those 10-15 minutes in which the bus gets to Legoland, passengers will not die of hunger. </p><p>  From the final stop to the park itself you will need to walk about a hundred meters.  Be sure to find out when the last bus leaves back to Gunzburg.  Otherwise, you have to get a taxi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nu.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to Legoland by bus" class="if uuid-2790010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2790010.jpg"></div><h2>  Some secrets of German tickets </h2><p>  In Germany, rail transport is quite expensive.  However, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of your trip.  In various federal states, there are so-called regional tickets that allow you to ride all day round trip, and even combining different modes of transport. </p><p>  Such a document is valid for less than a day, so you need to check the time of your trips every time.  For example, on weekdays it can be used only from 9 in the morning. </p><p>  This means that if you caught a train at this time in the morning, then, given the transfers and lines at the entrance, you will only be in the amusement park around noon.  But then on such a ticket 5 people can go at once, but it costs a maximum of 49 euros, or 3836 rubles.  This is for all five travelers. </p><p>  Thus, if you purchased a so-called Bavarian ticket, be aware that it includes travel throughout the federal state.  That is, this is the price of the train and the bus to Legoland.  Munich is a great starting point for using a <span>Bavarian ticket</span> to travel to an amusement park .. </p><p>  But this travel document is valid only on regional trains and local modes of public transport.  Therefore, do not sit down with him at Intercity.  But in any case, you will save a significant amount.  This ticket will turn your trip into a real pleasure, and cheap. </p><p>  Electric trains come in different ages and comforts.  Often they have a scoreboard where the next station is indicated.  It is very important.  Since Gunzburg is not the terminal station, it is better to carefully monitor the scoreboard so as not to drive. </p><h2>  How to get from Munich airport? </h2><p>  The thing is in which hub you flew to.  For example, Memmingen Airport mainly accepts flights from low-cost airlines.  The distance from there to Gunzburg is about 80 kilometers. </p><p>  If you are by car, then the whole journey will take you no more than an hour.  And what if you arrived at Munich's main airport?  How to get to Legoland?  On trains, it takes you about three hours. </p><p>  First you have to get to the main station of Munich, from there to the railway station of Gunzburg, and then transfer to the "Legoland" bus. </p><p>  There is one more option.  First, you can get from the main airport of the capital by suburban train, which travel every quarter of an hour (the journey takes 40 minutes).  Then you transfer to the direct bus company Flixbas, which goes to Legoland.  Tickets for them are inexpensive - about 8 euros (626 rubles). </p><p>  Buses spend less than 2 hours on the way.  But the problem is that they are sent only twice a day, and both in the morning.  Therefore, some people, in order not to complicate the route for themselves and their children, book a transfer. </p><h2>  Cottage village </h2><p>  Legoland near Munich is also known for the fact that if you do not have enough for one day to enjoy this city of entertainment, then you can settle right here so as not to lose time.  A ten minute walk from the park is a cottage village where you will be offered overnight at affordable prices. </p><p>  You can reserve places in it in advance and online.  The hotel complex is focused on visitors to the park, so it is originally decorated - the way children like it, and has many game areas. </p><p>  The hotel has rooms with a simple design, and bungalows with an amazing design - for example, in the form of a barrel or a medieval castle.  The hotel and its territory are surrounded by forest, so it's nice to just walk here. </p><p>  The price includes parking, breakfast and many bonus-discounts on the services of the park.  Staying here or even not far from the historical center of Gunzburg, you will not puzzle over how to get from Munich to Legoland (Germany).  All the rides will be a few steps away, and the children will get extra time for entertainment.  Therefore, many tourists prefer to spend a couple of nights in the village near the park. </p><p>  Only accommodation is better to book for six months.  The park is very popular, and everything in the vicinity can be occupied.  In addition to the cottage village, there are other hotels located nearby. </p><p>  In any case, the children will be happy if, because of the queues or just a huge number of attractions and various interesting things, they will not have to squeeze into narrow time frames (usually the park starts to close at 16:30 and completely ends at six in the evening), and postpone part fun the next day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland, cottage village" class="if uuid-2786721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786721.jpg"></div><h2>  Should I go from Munich to Legoland: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  It is often written that after the first purchase of this famous designer, children slowly but surely become his fans.  It is not surprising that most of them, having heard about the Legoland, do not give parents peace of mind, dreaming of going there. </p><p>  But of all these parks, tourists usually choose German.  It‚Äôs easier to get to Europe, and from Munich to Gunzburg, as we saw, getting to it is even easier.  Some travelers, having read about the attractions of the park, worry: will their children be able to visit these interesting slides, swings and carousels. </p><p>  But there is nothing to worry about - visitors claim that near each entertainment zone there is detailed information on how old the children can ride here, and even a special rake to determine the possibility of their getting there. </p><p>  Kids who are not yet 4-5 years old, most likely, will not really like it there.  But there is simply no upper limit.  Adults also get maximum pleasure. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to take with them a change of clothes or good raincoats - after visiting the aquazone you will be wet to the skin!  Guests also praised the cottage village near Legoland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelwithboys.com" data-author=": NICCI, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legoland (Munich) - reviews" class="if uuid-2786732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2786732.jpg"></div><p>  Family tourists claim that this is a great option for an overnight stay for one or two nights.  By the way, travelers write that they like the park near Munich more.  Legoland (photos of some of its objects are presented to your attention in the article) in Germany, according to them, is much better than even the company's main park in Denmark. </p><p>  And in the town of Gunzburg itself, it will also be interesting.  It is old-fashioned, with a beautiful historical center, it is good to walk there.  Tourists are not advised to visit Legoland during the peak season and during children's vacations, otherwise you will spend most of the time standing in queues for attractions. </p>
