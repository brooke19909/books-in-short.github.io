    <p>  Usually <span>puberty</span> in boys begins no earlier than 11 years.  At this time, in a certain part of the brain - the hypothalamus - hormones are produced that are called gonadoliberin.  At the same time, puberty (when a man can have children) occurs in young men aged 17-18 years.  But in March 2009, the whole world was shocked.  The youngest dad in the world picked up his daughter.  The newly-made father at that time was only 13 years old. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Alfie Patten became known as the youngest dad in the world.  At 13, he became the father of a wonderful girl named Maisie.  Moreover, Alfie does not look masculine, he is a real child.  His height is only 120 centimeters.  The mother of the little girl was the 15-year-old Briton Chantally Stidmann.  It is noteworthy that at the time of conception, handsome Alfie was only 12 years old.  This story shocked not only the public, but also doctors.  After all, before that it was believed that at this age, men can still not have children. </p><h2>  How the youngest dad misled the whole world </h2><p>  After this story spread throughout the world, Alfie and his girlfriend Chantalli became very popular.  After some time, the press got information from two guys who claimed to have an intimate relationship with Chantally.  Following such a statement, Alfie's fatherhood was called into question.  According to the DNA results, it became clear that the child‚Äôs father is one of the girl‚Äôs boyfriends - Tyler Barker.  He conceived this child at the age of 14.  This magnificent scam was invented by the parents of the girl who were sitting at home without work.  They wanted to become famous, and also earn big money on it.  And they succeeded!  This young couple now knows the whole world.  The most famous television channels and print media sought their interviews.  Alfie, in the end, turned out to be a virgin at all! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  So who is he?  The youngest dad in the world <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the youngest father in the world" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15127/230102.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Several boys are known who became dads at the age of 14.  One of them lives in the <span>Perm region,</span> in Russia.  The youngest father in the world lives in the Russian Federation.  At the time of the birth of the child he was 14 years old, and he studied only in the seventh grade.  Many were also shocked that his sister was the mother of a newborn boy.  Although they were not blood relatives, according to the documents they were considered siblings.  The fact is that the children were orphans, and they were adopted by their own aunt.  Despite their age, new parents are ready to <span>raise a child</span> themselves <span>.</span>  Here is such an unusual story about a young dad. </p><h2>  The oldest dad in the world <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the youngest dad" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15127/230107.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The title "The youngest dad in the world" to date is still definitely not occupied by anyone.  But the name of the oldest father in the world is known.  He became Ramjet Ragawa, who lives in India.  Surprisingly, he broke his own record.  In 2010, he first became the oldest father in the world at the age of 94.  And this was not the limit: two years later, his ‚Äúyoung wife‚Äù, who at that time was over 50, gave birth to his second son.  This amazing story spread throughout the world, many were struck by the age of the "young" father. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the youngest dad in the world is 82 years younger than the oldest.  These unusual facts were found about the fathers. </p>
