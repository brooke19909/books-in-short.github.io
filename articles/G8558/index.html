    <p>  If the family has more than one child, then you can come up with games at home for two children (or more) right on the go.  Let them compete after staying at the computer, who will squeeze out 10 times faster or unscrew the old shelf with a screwdriver.  This is more suitable for boys.  Girls can cook something delicious for dinner.  This is how the game will be combined with benefit. </p><p>  Adults in games also often become children.  Some worry when they lose.  Two adults can play card games.  There are many of them.  Darts help show the accuracy of the eye.  You can practice agility by playing Twister.  At the same time, legs and hands are placed in circles of the same color as roulette showed.  Domino is a great game for two adult participants.  If two girlfriends are gathered, they can try to sing each other.  That one, then the other will drag out the ditty. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Games for two at home: summarize the above </h2><p>  As you can see, for each age category there are their own games.  Very young children enjoy playing with pyramids, soft toys.  You can offer children musical lessons - to sing a song with them, to dance.  Children of the older age group are thus unlikely to be entertained.  They like intellectual pursuits.  They are attracted to the computer.  It is important not to allow the child to sit at the computer for a long time, but to try to distract him with other <span>interesting activities.</span>  You can play cards with him, craft a model of a ship, an airplane together, and then test them in action by launching into the sky or sending a house in a bath to sail.  Many people like the Young Chemist sets (astronomer, nerd).  Adults will also find entertainment.  You can start with the mobile game ‚ÄúTwister‚Äù, and end with a quiet one - chess or card. </p>
