The historical city contains many ancient <span>artifacts,</span> it is impossible to see the <span>sights of</span> Kaluga in 1 day, since there are a lot of them.  The main interesting places are: cathedrals of the XVII-XVIII centuries, noble buildings, former merchant mansions, which were converted into museums with a pleasant home atmosphere. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.5518584" data-lng="36.28509729999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/3/8/1038.png"></div><p>  Kaluga is one of the main cities in space.  The scientist and inventor Konstantin Tsiolkovsky lived and worked in it.  The name of the inventor is associated with many historical sites and <span>attractions in Kaluga.</span>  It is unique that each person will be interested in the topic of astronautics, because the depths of space are almost unknown, and they attract everyone in the world with their secrets.  And having arrived in Kaluga, there is an opportunity to visit the birthplace of cosmonautics in Russia.  In Kaluga, the ideas of traveling through outer space were born. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gotravelaz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of kaluga and the region" class="if uuid-2283053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2283053.jpg"></div><h2>  Kaluga city history </h2><p>  In ancient times, the Kaluga lands were constantly unable to divide between the Principality of Lithuania and the Principality of Moscow.  Lithuanian Tsar Olgerd complained to the Patriarch of Constantinople that the Moscow principality had taken their land from them.  It was from this complaint in 1371 that the emergence of the city began.  However, the Kaluga fortress stood before that. </p><p>  Before Kaluga became a cosmonautics city, it often suffered from various wars and problems: </p><ul><li>  battles with the Tatar-Mongols, who were defeated in the Kaluga region; </li><li>  the fire, after which almost the whole of Kaluga burned down; </li><li>  ‚Äúpestilence‚Äù happened, and about a thousand people survived in Kaluga. </li></ul><h2>  Climate and ecology </h2><p>  Kaluga is located in the central part of Russia.  That is why all seasons are pronounced.  Winters are cold and snowy, autumn is sometimes delayed, but it remains the same golden and beautiful for citizens and visitors.  Spring is blooming and vibrant, and summer is hot and dry. </p><p>  The city was very lucky with the environment.  Kaluga pine forests surround almost the entire city.  That is why, sitting in a city park, you can hear the nightingale singing, just like in a forest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asergeev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaluga city attractions" class="if uuid-2282868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282868.jpg"></div><p>  Description of the sights of Kaluga is inexhaustible, as the city keeps an ancient history. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Museum of the History of Cosmonautics named after K. E. Tsiolkovsky </h2><p>  This is the main and one of the largest space museums in Russia.  Such famous people as the great scientist Korolev and cosmonaut Gagarin participated in its creation.  In 1961, Yuri Gagarin put the first cobblestone in the foundation of the building.  A museum was opened for guests after 6 years.  The building contains many interesting artifacts related to space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uncubemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaluga sights what to see" class="if uuid-2282861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282861.jpg"></div><p>  If you wonder what of the sights to see in Kaluga, then the museum should be the first place to visit.  His most famous exhibits: </p><ul><li>  The model of the space station "Mir"; </li><li>  Original parts of the Vostok ship; </li><li>  collection of various rocket engines created in Russia. </li></ul><p>  It reflects the history that the museum keeps in itself, from the times of the USSR in 1920 to our modern world. </p><h2>  A stone bridge </h2><p>  One of the historical and ancient sights of the city of Kaluga is a <span>stone bridge.</span>  This bridge has a very interesting shape.  In architecture, there is the concept of "viaduct."  This is a bridge in which all arches of different heights.  This type of bridge was actively used by the ancient Romans, but their bridges connected not only roads, but also performed water supply duties, and were called "aqueducts." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For a long time, these bridges were almost never used in buildings, since they were financially expensive buildings.  This landmark of Kaluga was built in 1780.  It is one of the oldest and largest bridges in the world.  And people interested in architecture and history will be interested to see it in life.  The height of the bridge in the center reaches twenty meters and a width of more than 8 meters.  City buses, cars and pedestrians move across the bridge.  In ancient times, on the territory of the bridge were stalls.  Since ancient times, Kaluga has been a merchant city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaluga sights in 1 day" class="if uuid-2282869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282869.jpg"></div><p>  The arches of the bridge, snow-white as the first snow, blend well with the green trees around it.  Previously, a stream ran near, which in our times has already turned into a thicket.  Near the ravine "Beruzei", which in the XVIII century was a feature of Kaluga.  The bridge connected the city with other villages and cities and facilitated trade trips to neighboring settlements.  Near the bridge is an important commercial area in history. </p><p>  The ancient sights of Kaluga and the region are very diverse and almost all are connected with the trading sphere of Kaluga in the past. </p><h2>  Public places </h2><p>  The construction of Kaluga according to the project developed by Pyotr Nikitin began with the creation of several large houses interconnected.  The construction was given the name "Public Places".  According to the idea, the buildings became the main part of the city.  The construction takes the place of the old ruined fortress, which for a long time restrained the offensive of the invaders.  Buildings have the significance of federal cultural heritage.  They are located on the left bank of the Oka, and the building looks like the letter P with large arches for travel. </p><p>  The buildings were erected by order of the governor M. Krechetnikov.  The buildings that were built in 1780 look rather rich in comparison with the surrounding buildings.  The construction of this building cost Kaluga a large capital in ancient times - more than 150 thousand rubles.  The image of the structure reflects the construction of the wooden Kremlin, which existed until the 18th century.  The buildings housed the main branches of city governance: a secular court, an indication of the contempt of society, and rooms for gathering the society.  In 1812, a military hospital was created in part of the construction. </p><p>  And in our time, ‚ÄúPublic Places‚Äù continue to bear their significance.  At the moment, in one of the units is a theological seminary.  In another part is the "State Kaluga branch of Moscow Technical University.  Bauman. "  Other parts are held by different state-owned companies. </p><h2>  Gostiny Dvor </h2><p>  Walking through the sights of Kaluga, one should not forget about the merchant chambers, which retain the memory of the XVII-XVIII centuries.  The streets of Kutuzov, Lenin, Voskresenskaya are transferred instantly to the distant past.  A lot of merchant houses, the beauty of ancient pear trees, simple small churches - all this contributes to a beautiful ensemble of urban beauty. </p><p>  Gostiny Dvor is a historical center of Kaluga trade.  The restored building, as in ancient times, welcomes everyone with its social events and city celebrations.  The yard is a huge complex, occupying a considerable territory, almost a whole block.  The construction of the building was delayed for 45 years due to the greed and stinginess of the merchants.  They already had wooden tents, and they did not want to move and build a single complex.  The architectural monument was often rebuilt and modified.  The ranks are opposite the White House, in which the Kaluga Oblast Administration works. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.nailizakon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaluga sights photo" class="if uuid-2282874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282874.jpg"></div><p>  By their present appearance, the buildings are an ensemble of breathtaking beauty and luxury.  The plaster molding of floral branchy ornaments, low towers and arches, which are located throughout the courtyard, are a kind of ‚Äúgingerbread house‚Äù.  Gostiny Dvor is a vivid example of the style of architecture in Russia in the 17th-18th centuries.  Inside, the entire building is tiled, which resembles wooden paving stones, throughout the territory there are wooden tents and benches.  They can buy products of the city‚Äôs creators.  Pottery, toys, woodwork and weaving, felting and knitting - any goods made by the masters themselves and representing the city‚Äôs folk art in all its glory. </p><p>  It is pleasant to walk and relax on the territory.  Gostiny Dvor is a landmark of Kaluga, a must-see when traveling on the first day.  The color of culture fills with its wealth, grandeur and beauty when visiting this place.  Above is an early photo of the sights of Kaluga - Gostiny Dvor. </p><h2>  Kirova street </h2><p>  In ancient times, the street bore the title of Sennaya, as it used to be driven by horse-drawn carts loaded with hay.  The street is the center of the city, which stores many of the sights of Kaluga.  The former houses of merchants were bought for offices, shops and various city institutions.  On the street there are many art and local history museums and galleries.  The city has enough memorable places, but if you want to see all the most interesting in one day, the attraction of Kaluga that is definitely worth a visit is Kirova Street. </p><h2>  Regional Drama Theater </h2><p>  Governor M. Krechetnikov was a fan of theatrical art.  And the construction of the theater in this territory was his idea.  Twice the building was destroyed by fire.  The third time was under fire in the Great Patriotic War.  After the war, restoration and repair was carried out, and this building has survived to our time. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  The museum is one of the main parts of the culture of the Kaluga region.  He keeps in himself a huge number of paintings that were presented by his doctor N. I. Vasiliev from his collection.  Here you can see paintings by Russian artists and European creators.

The construction occupies a vast territory and is located near the village of Chamordino.  More than three hundred servants of God lived in it, a hospital and a shelter worked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.narvaeparhia.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kaluga sights description" class="if uuid-2282882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282882.jpg"></div><h2>  Yachen Reservoir </h2><p>  If you think what to see in Kaluga from the sights, then the reservoir is the right place.  A place in which unity with nature, its beauty and wealth is combined.  This is an artificial reservoir created by people in the XX century.  It is called the Kaluga Sea.  The reservoir became popular due to an interesting phenomenon: when there is a thunderstorm in the Kaluga region, lightning strikes constantly in the same place on the lake.  A strange natural phenomenon has interested many tourists and scientists.  Such a phenomenon is explained by the fact that a high-voltage charge passes above the water, and it is he who attracts lightning to himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strekoza.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of kaluga in one day" class="if uuid-2282886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73070/2282886.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Kaluga.
