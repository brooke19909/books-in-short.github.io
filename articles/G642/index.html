  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to monitor a child‚Äôs phone through the phone: the best applications and ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No matter how modern children behave, and whatever they think, parents are always worried about them.  And if one day the offspring forgets to warn that it will linger in the sports section or at the lessons, then the parents themselves create many reasons for excitement and anxiety.  There is a way out of this situation and it is very convenient.  No wonder scientists put so much effort and money into the development of information technology. </p><p>  A modern leap in this area allows translating the desire of parents to monitor the child‚Äôs phone through the phone into reality.  Moreover, this does not require additional equipment, just install the desired program on your smartphone and the children will always be supervised. </p><h2>  Parental control on the phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gdemoi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to monitor a child‚Äôs phone through a telephone" class="if uuid-2940477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940477.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to control the movement of the child not only to reassure parents, but also to ensure the safety of the child.  According to statistics, in Russia about 15 thousand children disappear every year, 10% of which are considered missing. </p><p>  As a rule, children cannot constantly be under strict control, however, monitoring their movements is quite possible.  Specialists developed two options: the use of special applications for Android or iPhone, and the services of mobile operators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Control the movement of the child using mobile applications </h2><p>  GooglePlay and the AppStore offer a huge range of parental control programs.  When choosing the necessary utility, developers recommend focusing on its description, technical characteristics of the gadget, as well as paying special attention to real user reviews. </p><h2>  "Where are My Children" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kitaiexpert.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child through an android phone" class="if uuid-2940478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940478.jpg"></div><p>  The application "Where My Children" is a kind of locator for the phone and GPS watch.  You can download the application on Google Play or the AppStore.  The program contains two main options: the ability to track the location of the child and control the charge level of his smartphone.  If it becomes critically low, an appropriate notification is sent to the parent's phone.  This is the simple way the application works.  Tracking a child through the phone today has become much easier, since the program also contains the following functionality: </p><ul><li>  Ability to listen to voice messages.  This peculiar and unique function is inherent in few modern developments.  The parent is given the opportunity not only to listen to, but even record sound around the child‚Äôs phone. </li><li>  Setting movement zones.  This function is not so unique, but from this it does not become less valuable.  Parents can set a specific zone, and as soon as the child leaves its limits, the application will instantly send a notification. </li><li>  Preservation and control of the history of movements.  The program is configured not only to monitor the child‚Äôs phone through the phone, but also provides the ability to save the movement history for the last 2-3 days. </li></ul><p>  The ‚ÄúWhere My Children‚Äù application supports two operating modes: ‚ÄúParent‚Äù and ‚ÄúChild‚Äù.  Therefore, the problems associated with its installation and configuration should not arise.  The "Parent" mode allows you to monitor the movement of the child, while the "Child" mode is intended solely to confirm observation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  KidControl GPS Tracker </h2><div class="photo" data-original="androidx.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to keep track of a child via phone for free" class="if uuid-2940484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940484.jpg"></div><p>  You can monitor your child via the phone on Android for free using the unique KidControl application, which is a special tracker for modern smartphones.  The main advantage of the program is that you can control the child through a computer.  To do this, just go to the official website of the project.  The application, by analogy with the project ‚ÄúWhere My Children‚Äù contains two important functions: the ability to monitor children and battery level.  In addition, the developers thought out and implemented a special SOS button in case of an alarm. </p><p>  There is no charge for installing a KidControl GPS tracker.  The program is equipped with a completely convenient interface and unique simple settings, which allows parents to either monitor the child via the phone for free or set a geofence on the map to receive notifications in case the child leaves their limits. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúMom knows‚Äù </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the application ‚ÄúMom Knows‚Äù cannot boast of certain innovations, it also helps to solve such a global modern problem - how to monitor a child‚Äôs phone through the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="macuser.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Track your baby via android phone for free" class="if uuid-2940492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940492.jpg"></div><p>  The program, similar to its predecessors, is able to set certain geofences and save data on all movements of the child over the past month.  The application ‚ÄúMom Knows‚Äù has such advantages as cross-platform, simplicity and profitability. </p><p>  As regards the installation, different applications must be downloaded to the phone of the parent and child.  Thus, the parent installs the program ‚ÄúMom Knows‚Äù and the child installs ‚ÄúMom Knows: GPS Beacon‚Äù.  Both applications are interconnected, which allows full control of the movements of children in real time. </p><h2>  MobileKids </h2><p>  The problem of most parents - how to monitor the child‚Äôs phone through the phone - this program solves quite successfully.  In addition to the built-in radar, which allows you to know the location of the child, the application contains functions for tracking the addition of new contacts, the time of use of the smartphone, as well as the installation of new software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application to monitor the child through the phone" class="if uuid-2940496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940496.jpg"></div><p>  MobileKids allows parents to set a limit on the amount of traffic transmitted, the number of messages, that is, fully control the actions of the child.  The application contains an emergency call button and a general family chat. </p><p>  The MobileKids parental control system allows you to monitor your child through your Android phone or use gadgets from Apple.  An interesting fact is that parents and children do not have to use phones with the same operating system to keep in touch. </p><h2>  "Lighthouse" </h2><p>  Similar to the Mom Knows application, the Mayak utility does not impress with its functionality, but it will delight you with a brilliant execution of a design idea.  Among all parental control programs, Mayak has the most beautiful and convenient interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techcult.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child via pay phone" class="if uuid-2940498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940498.jpg"></div><p>  The application instantly provides information on the current location of the offspring, the battery level on his smartphone, as well as an analysis of the history of movements.  In case of emergency, the child just needs to use the "Alarm" button, as a message about the likely danger and the address where you can find the child will be displayed on the parents' phone screen. </p><p>  Despite a number of certain advantages, the application contains a significant minus - you can use it for free only for two weeks, after which you will have to pay from 169 to 229 rubles for further use, depending on the supported operating system. </p><h2>  How to track children using operator services? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tarifam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Track your child via a beeline phone" class="if uuid-2940507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2940507.jpg"></div><p>  If your parents didn‚Äôt have a phone at hand, it is recommended to use an alternative method - connect a mobile option for remote childcare.  The best operators offer the following options: </p><ul><li>  "Baby under supervision" from MTS.  Since recently, monitoring a child through an MTS telephone has become more than possible.  The service allows you to determine the approximate location of the child using SMS requests.  Its monthly cost is 100 rubles, and 5 rubles will be charged per request if one subscriber controls more than three people. </li><li>  "Radar Plus" from the "Megaphone".  The service allows you to control the movement of the child within a certain geofence and reports in case of going beyond it.  The cost of the service is 7 rubles per day. </li><li>  "Coordinates" from "Beeline."  The Beeline option provides the user with the opportunity to recognize the location of another subscriber who previously agreed to be controlled.  The "Coordinates" service is not so expensive.  The test period is designed for one week, after which the cost of the service is 1.7 rubles per day.  Therefore, monitoring a child through a Beeline telephone is not only convenient, but also beneficial. </li><li>  "Geopoisk" from "Tele2".  The service allows you to monitor the movement of another subscriber around the clock with his approval.  The connection option is free, and the monthly fee is only 2 rubles per day. </li></ul><p>  All mobile operators provide locator services, but due to a number of specific reasons, smartphone users are still advised to use third-party applications. </p><p>  The parental control system is a valuable weapon in the hands of caring and responsible parents.  The selection of the appropriate application should be based on its functionality and place of residence.  For example, for residents of large cities, the KidControl GPS tracker is an ideal option, while a provincial user is advised to monitor the movements of the child using the ‚ÄúWhere are my children‚Äù application.  In life you have to deal with different situations, so such applications are essential for the peace of mind of parents and the safety of their children. </p>
