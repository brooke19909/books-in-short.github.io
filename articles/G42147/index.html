  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The largest mainland is Eurasia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mainland Eurasia is conditionally divided into two parts - Asia and Europe.  The border between them is considered to be the foot of the Ural Mountains, <span>the Embe River, the</span> Kumo-Manych depression and the coast of the Caspian Sea.  This is the largest continent on the planet.  The area of â€‹â€‹Eurasia is 53.4 million square kilometers.  It includes not only the mainland itself, but also the islands adjacent to it. </p><p>  Mainland Eurasia is the only one that is washed by all the oceans of the planet.  In the west, it borders the <span>Atlantic Ocean,</span> which extends deep into the land, forming the Scandinavian Peninsula. </p><p>  From the south, mainland Eurasia is washed by the Indian Ocean.  Here you can highlight the Hindustan and Arabian Peninsulas.  They are the largest in this part of the mainland.  The largest island in the southern part is Sri Lanka. </p><p>  That part, which is washed by the Pacific Ocean, has the most rugged coastline.  It includes a chain of islands and peninsulas of Kamchatka, among which the largest are the Bolshoi Sundsky. </p><p>  The continent Eurasia has the most even coastline from the side of the Arctic Ocean.  Here you can highlight the Kola, <span>Chukchi Peninsula</span> and Taimyr.  They are the largest.  Not far from the mainland is the island of Novaya Zemlya, <span>Novosibirsk islands</span> and others. </p><p>  The oceans do not have a significant impact on the inner world of the mainland due to their considerable remoteness.  Each ocean forms seas that are adjacent to land. </p><p>  Mainland Eurasia was not thoroughly studied until the 19th century.  Only during this period, travelers began to explore Central Asia, its mountain systems, the Tien Shan, Issyk-Kul Lake and other areas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we consider the relief of the mainland, it turns out that it is much higher than other parts of the earth.  Eurasia has the highest mountain peaks (Everest).  Plains stretching for thousands of kilometers are also characteristic of this continent. </p><p>  Due to this, there is a strong fluctuation of heights throughout the territory of this part of the Earth.  The difference is about 9 kilometers.  The reason for this was lithospheric plates of different ages, which joined together to form the mainland, the largest in area.  They are still in motion, resulting in numerous earthquakes. </p><p>  Most of the population lives on the plains of the mainland.  This part of the planet is rich in minerals.  Here you can find deposits of non-ferrous metals (tin and tungsten), gold, diamonds and other precious stones.  In addition, the continent of Eurasia has numerous <span>oil</span> and gas fields.  Common minerals include coal, bauxite, and salt. </p><p>  The climate of Eurasia has its own characteristics.  The main one is a wide variety of climatic zones.  They change from north to south and from west to east.  Climate depends on the proximity of the ocean, on monsoons and on topography.  The climate of Tibet, the Pamirs and other systems is high mountain.  Closer to the Arctic Ocean, the arctic climate prevails.  It is replaced by a subarctic belt, and then a temperate subtropical and tropical climate follows. </p><p>  In addition to mountain systems, there are many inland waters in Eurasia.  Here you can find the largest rivers in the world.  Lakes are also striking in their size and depth.  Their location depends on the terrain.  Rivers rise high in the mountains and flow into the ocean. </p><p>  Some of the mainland is covered with glaciers (for example, part of Iceland).  They are the original source for many rivers. </p><p>  Eurasia is the most unique continent.  Numerous climatic zones, high mountain systems, vast plains, full-flowing rivers and beautiful lakes make it not like other parts of the Earth.  This determines the feature of the animal and plant world, which is represented here.  There are still many corners of this continent that are not fully understood by people. </p>
