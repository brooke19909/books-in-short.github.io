    <p>  What does a stay at the Perfect Boutique Hotel 3 * look like?  Reviews confirm that the hotel offers truly decent living conditions.  The rooms are spacious with large windows.  The furniture is new, household appliances are working properly, and there are no problems with water.  The maids actually come every day, clean and deliver drinking water.  The food in the restaurant is not bad.  The menu for some tourists seems a little monotonous, but the dishes are always fresh and tasty. </p><p>  The disadvantages include a not very convenient location.
