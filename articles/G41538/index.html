    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative points can be accompanied by a vacation at the Dessole Abou Sofiane Resort ex Abou Sofiane.  So, based on reviews, we can talk about the following disadvantages of the institution: </p><ul><li>  the swimming pool in the courtyard is quite small, and there are no water slides; </li><li>  in order to get the remote control from the TV, you need to make a cash deposit; </li><li>  beach towels are available for a fee; </li><li>  sunbeds on the beach have to be occupied as early as possible, because after breakfast there are no more free places (but hotel employees can willingly put the missing sun loungers for money); </li><li>  the beach is common for two hotels, because of which there is often a crowd; </li><li>  the food in the restaurant is almost unsalted; </li><li>  bath towels and bed linen in the rooms are changed quite rarely (and that, you have to independently require this at the reception); </li><li>  the doors in the rooms creak a lot, and therefore, if someone leaves the room at night or early in the morning, he wakes up almost the entire floor (it would be nice to lubricate the hinges); </li><li>  some rooms have cockroaches; </li><li>  the rooms need redecorating, as well as the replacement of a number of furniture and plumbing; </li><li>  Wireless Internet only works in the lobby, and in the evening, when a lot of people gather, it‚Äôs completely impossible to connect to the network; </li><li>  the staff not only does not speak Russian, but also speaks English very mediocre; </li><li>  high prices for laundry services; </li><li>  animation is practically absent, you have to entertain yourself; </li><li>  strong audibility between adjacent numbers; </li><li>  after using body lotion, which is included in the cosmetic kit, an allergic reaction appears on the skin; </li><li>  local ice cream tastes too specific and not everyone may like; </li><li>  local vacationers constantly crawl out of turn in restaurants and bars, to which the staff is calm enough and even encourages such actions; </li><li>  Entrance to the terrace with tables of the beach bar is paid. </li></ul><p>  If you want to enjoy an exotic vacation and get acquainted with the Arabian culture, pay attention to such a tourist destination as Sousse.  Dessole Abou Sofiane Resort provides travelers with everything you need for a quality vacation.  This and delicious food, and comfortable clean rooms, and high standards of service. </p>
