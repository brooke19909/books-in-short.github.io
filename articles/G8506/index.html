It is done by motorists to get rid of squeaks, to increase the degree of comfort, as well as to improve the sound of music in the cabin.  Moreover, the choice of material depends on the purpose of the noise insulation.  If your budget is limited, then you should not undertake work immediately on the entire machine (especially if you plan to do everything yourself).  It is much better to do everything in parts, gradually improving your skills. </p><h2>  Tools and materials for work </h2>

It is impossible to use any home appliance designed for hair styling, since it will not be able to provide the necessary heat. </li><li>  Knurling roller, by means of which the noise insulation material on the surface is laid and aligned. </li><li>  Large scissors to cut material.

    <p>  Flexible, vibration-absorbing material.  It is a self-adhesive material with aluminum foil applied on its outside.  It has a marking in the form of 5x5 cm squares. Thanks to this marking, it is possible to cut large sheets into elements of the required size and shape. </p><p>  This material is waterproof, does not decompose under the influence of external factors, and acts as an anticorrosive and sealant.  Installation is easy, regardless of terrain.  Surface heating is not needed; without defects, it fits on cold elements of the car body.  The noise insulation mass is not more than 3 kg / sq.  m., stable thickness 2 mm.  The loss factor (mechanical) in the range of 0.25 ... 0.35. </p><p>  You can trim with such material doors, roofs, sidewalls, floors in the cabin, a shield separating from the engine compartment, hood and trunk lid.  Gold type vibroplast is very similar to the one described above, but there are differences.  A square meter of material has a mass per kilogram more, since the thickness is 2.3 mm.  Mechanical losses - about 0.33.  Since this material is thicker, the sound insulation quality is better, all extraneous sounds disappear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bomb Beast </h2>

    <p>  This material is also vibration absorbing.  The multilayer construction consists of several layers, the outer one is aluminum-based foil.  Bituminous and rubber compositions - second and third layers.  When you carry out the installation of this material, you need to warm the surface to a temperature of at least 40 degrees (more efficiently - up to 50).  Since you can‚Äôt do noise insulation with your own hands without heating, you need a good hair dryer. </p><p>  "Bi-Mast" does not absorb moisture, is considered the best vibration isolation material to date.  It has the highest coefficient of performance.  It is worth noting that the loss coefficient is approximately 0.5!  But the mass of the material is rather big - 6 kg / sq.  m., thickness - 4.2 mm.  Ideal for audio preparation of speakers.  They process wheel arches, zones above the driveshaft and silencer, a shield between the passenger compartment and the engine compartment. </p><h2>  Splen 3004, 3008, 3002 </h2>

Easy installation on curved and vertical surfaces.  Moisture-proof, does not decompose under the influence of aggressive environments, and the weight is less than 0.5 kg / sq.  m., with a thickness of 4 mm.  Operating temperature is in the range of -40 ... + 70 degrees.  This material processes the shield between the passenger compartment and the engine compartment, wheel arches, tunnels, doors.  Before you make soundproofing correctly, you need to study all kinds of materials. </p><p>  On sale you can also meet Splen with an index of 3008, which has a thickness of 8 mm, and 3002 - it has 2 mm.  As you can see, the last digit is the value of the thickness of the material.  This material is glued after vibration isolation (discussed above).  In order for the joints to be strong, surfaces must be cleaned and degreased.  The optimum surface temperature is in the range of 18..35 degrees.  If lower, then the properties of the material are lost.  Please note that the application of "Splen" should be done without tension, as it can be damaged. </p><h2>  Antiskrip "Bitoplast" </h2>

    <p>  "Accent-10" consists of a film with the addition of metals, which is located on flexible polyurethane foam.  A sticky layer is applied to the latter.  This material is waterproof and not subject to decomposition; it is also used as a heat insulator.  As a rule, it is used as a <span>sound-absorbing material</span> and heat-insulating.  Able to absorb approximately 90% of the noise.  The thickness is only 10 mm, and the mass is not more than 0.5 kg / sq.  m. Operating temperature ranges from -40 .. + 100 degrees.  Processed with the help of "Accent-10" trunk lid and hood, as well as the partition between the passenger compartment and the engine compartment. </p><h2>  Madeleine </h2><p>  It serves as a seal, but is often used as a decorative material, since it is based on black fabric.  Thickness - no more than one and a half millimeters, on the one hand - adhesive composition, as well as protection against adhesion.  It is used for processing gaps in the decorative elements of the body and interior, dashboard, air ducts.  It is worth noting that these materials are the most common, their quality is at a high level.  But on sale you can find similar products from various manufacturers.  And their price may differ significantly.  Of course, practice shows that at a low price you get the same quality.  But if you wondered how to make noise insulation from neighbors (in the yard, in the case of a metal fence), then you can choose any available material. </p><h2>  Carrying out sound insulation of the hood </h2>

    <p>  Please note that after the soundproofing of the hood, you will not get rid of the sound of the engine.  It is done only to keep warm in the winter.  Bonnet insulation is done using Vibroplast and Accent, discussed above.  The most important thing is to take into account the mass of all the material.  If it is too large, then this will affect the operation of the front suspension.  It is clear that the harsher the winter, the thicker the layer is desirable to do.  But, on the other hand, one should not forget about the ‚Äúnative‚Äù thermal insulation.  It should not be thrown out, it will be best if the new one acts as an aid to the existing one. </p><h2>  Soundproofing car doors </h2><p>  This is where the extraneous noise that comes when the car is moving comes out.  But it will not be amiss to say that the front speakers located in the doors sound much nicer with high-quality sound insulation.  It will be quite enough laying one material - "Vibroplast" or its analogues.  The amount of total material depends directly on the coating area and the thickness of the metal.  But there is no need to heavily weight the door - the hinges will begin to sag and the locks will collapse.  Here's how to make a car door soundproof.  The main thing is to maintain the norm, not to overdo it and not do less. </p>
