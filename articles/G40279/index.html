    <h2>  Entertainment for adults </h2><p>  Would you like to make a trip to the water park "Dzhubga"?  Everyone needs to study the reviews about this place before traveling.  The water park in the village of Dzhubga was erected by Turkish experts, some types of slides were developed specifically for this project.  Entertainment for adults is presented in a wide variety.  The demand is for a large slide that resembles a butterfly in its structure with the name "Tsunami".  Its height is 10 meters. </p><p>  The descent along it resembles the movement of a pendulum - a special bot alternately raises the tourist on one side, then on the other, the scope gradually decreases and the visitor enters the pool.  This attraction is considered the most constructively complex, and the safety equipment at it is of the highest level - lifeguards are watching the movement of everyone going down the hill.  They take the lucky one in the pool.  Children under 12 years old are not allowed to enter the hill.  No less exciting is the Ufil Flying Bords slide with a large number of intricate bends, sharp descents, high climbs and high speed. </p><p>  The popular attraction "Big Hall" with a height of 112 meters.  The slide is equipped with a tunnel with a 30-meter closed section, where a tourist is waiting for a light show and extreme water flight.  The fastest slide is Kamikaze; for less active vacationers, Rafting Slide and Body Slyde are offered.  These attractions are equipped with twists and turns, but their passage is connected with the pleasure of flying, without tickling nerves and only with pleasant emotions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is an opportunity for everyone to feel like a little astronaut, taking advantage of the Space Borde attraction - from the tunnel the ‚Äútester‚Äù gets into the indoor pool, rotates at a calm pace in a downward spiral and ultimately rapidly falls into the main pool.  There are a lot of entertainments for an adult audience - 16 slides, pools, a bar, a pizzeria and much more.  The authors of the water park created all the conditions in order to take the whole day and feel like a happy and cheerful person. </p>

    <h2>  Adult Leisure Reviews </h2><p>  Many believe that one of the best places of entertainment on the Black Sea coast is the Dzhubga water park.  Reviews with positive reviews say that it‚Äôs enough for an adult to simply plunge into a state of childish enthusiasm.  A large number of slides makes the rest unforgettable, and both extreme people and melancholy enjoy the pleasure. </p><p>  Descent from high slides with additional effects of free fall makes the hearts of even experienced fate testers stand still.  The calm flow of the ‚Äúriver‚Äù around the water park plunges balanced people into a state of contemplation and pacifies even mischievous teenagers.  Visitors respond with enthusiasm about the water park "Dzhubga".  Reviews of vacationers about prosaic things, such as food, sanitary condition, the presence of sunbeds, are positive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The stories mention a sufficient number of places for passive relaxation: you can leave a deck chair in the sun and sunbathe, or vice versa, move it into the shade and hide from the hustle and bustle.  Not many manage to relax all day, but those who spend quite a long time in active entertainment always need the support of forces, which is taken into account in the infrastructure of the Dzhubga water park.  Food reviews indicate that there are three places where you can calmly eat. </p><p>  Many note that all three establishments are different - from fast food and traditional three-course dinners to a bar with a huge amount of drinks.  Opinions about nutrition are divided.  Some people think that everything is tasty enough, and some visitors say that if possible it is better to refrain from eating in any of the establishments.  Almost all visitors noted that the territory is always very clean, the water in the pools has almost no smell of bleach, the rest is quite comfortable and colorful. </p>

    <p>  In the teenage part of the park, the rides give more impressions, and other types of fun are also provided on the territory itself.  For example, a climbing wall.  In an unsuccessful attempt to climb to the top, the climber falls into the pool to everyone's fun and pleasure. </p><h2>  What did not like </h2><p>  It is noted with regret that the water in the children's area is not additionally heated, which is why it is very uncomfortable for children to swim and frolic in the morning or evening hours.  And parents worry about the health of their children.  Many attributed this fact to the big minuses, which were repeatedly blamed on the water park "Dzhubga".  Reviews with negative reviews were left to address some of the rules for staying teenagers with parents. </p><p>  They concern permissions to ride high slides.  The safety rules indicate that some attractions are not available for children and adolescents, but if parents take full responsibility, then everyone has the opportunity to ride.  Nevertheless, many complained that children were not allowed on the most extreme attractions, even accompanied by adults. </p><h2>  Pools and meals </h2><p>  The largest pool in the Dzhubga is the Lazy River.  It is stretched along almost the entire perimeter of the water park and is equipped with a slow flow simulation mechanism.  Conveniently located on a swimming vehicle, the tourist travels, exploring all local attractions. </p><p>  For more active users, swimming pools with wave simulations from calm to meter height are offered.  In the water park you can go surfing, for which there is a body of water with special equipment that imitates the waves, quite suitable for beginners and professionals. </p>

    <p>  In the afternoon, the main pool of the aquazone becomes the venue for a fun foam party, where the main participants are children and adolescents.  Everyone who is tired and wants to relax, sunbathe and take a nap, is invited by comfortable sun loungers and the generous Black Sea sun. </p><p>  The issue of nutrition has been quite successfully resolved - it is proposed to use a cocktail bar with a wide selection of soft drinks and alcoholic drinks.  Also on the map of the institution are presented teas, coffee, chocolate and much more. </p><p>  Nearby there is a pizzeria, in the menu of which you can find salads, several types of pizza, burgers, french fries and much more.  The menu of the third restaurant offers traditional dishes of southern and Russian cuisine with a wide selection of salads, snacks, a variety of soups and much more. </p><h2>  Service Rating </h2><p>  Many vacationers, in search of a variety of leisure activities, make a trip to the water park "Dzhubga".  Reviews of tourists are mainly focused on entertainment, but services are not left without attention.  Positive assessments went to the maintenance staff: cleanliness was noted in all rooms and in the recreation area.  Most visitors liked the organization of the process and the availability of safety regulations. </p><p>  About it is written on the stands near each attraction and on the entrance ticket to the water park "Dzhubga".  Rental services for swimming equipment seemed too high and unjustified for the majority, since not everyone had enough bots for comfortable descent from the hills, and deck chairs were often busy.  As a result, it was completely incomprehensible to many how to still soak up the sun calmly. </p>

    <p>  There are significant comments on the rides that Dzhubga Waterpark is proud of.  Reviews of vacationers warn that on some slides, even extreme, there are poorly docked parts that form a small step.  With a high speed of descent, these shortcomings can lead to serious injuries and some tourists have already seen this. </p><p>  The reviews also indicate that even on children's slides you can periodically run into the sharp edges of some connecting element or mount.  There are real cases when visitors received head injuries when flying out of a closed attraction pipe.  Such cases occur infrequently, but vacationers recommend being vigilant. </p><p>  Many stories are dedicated to instructors and rescuers.  Vacationers say that their care was polite and persistent, which saved many children and adults from injuries.  Some tourists noted that the staff sometimes does not fulfill their duties or is neglected.  It is noted that in most cases, instructors try to shift their own responsibility for the life and health of children to their parents, sometimes without apparent necessity. </p><p>  In general, most tourists really liked the Dzhubga water park.  Reviews and impressions of vacationers are filled with vivid descriptions of emotions, photographs taken by a professional photographer, and wishes to those who were not in this recreation area.  Everyone advises to take the time to try all the water rides on their own. </p>
