Since unpleasant situations often happen with our gadgets - they fall out of the hands or pockets and hit a hard surface, thereby disrupting their work, people are looking for phones that can withstand at least minimal impact force and continue to work after it in the usual mode.  Fortunately, such options exist quite enough.  And besides, they have not only shockproof function, but also are perfectly protected from dust and moisture. </p><p>  The article presents the best shockproof push-button phones.  All of them help their owners to forget, finally, about the need to "shake" over their devices.  They provide a decent degree of protection, so there is no doubt in the quality of these devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plusbuyer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof phone with powerful battery" class="if uuid-2920602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920602.jpg"></div><p>  An overview of push-button shockproof phones will help you choose the best model.  Since their number today is quite large, and the characteristics of all gadgets are very good, buyers often fall into a stupor when purchasing a device.  And to simplify the task, you can simply choose one of the leading models, taking into account the characteristics and reviews about it, which are also presented in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ginzzu r62 </h2><p>  In the first place of this top is a very good shockproof phone.  Button models, unfortunately, have already begun to lose their popularity, but this device destroys all stereotypes, due to which it often goes to the first positions of various ratings.  There is a full-fledged radio station with a frequency range from 400 to 470 MHz, while the model is equipped with an external antenna that provides a communication range of about 2 km in a clean field.  In addition, a reasonably good battery is provided here.  Thanks to him, the device can function up to 7 days without recharging with frequent use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button telephone shockproof waterproof" class="if uuid-2920616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920616.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The shockproof phone with a powerful battery pleasantly surprises users with the presence of a radio station, a separate slot for a memory card and support for two SIM cards, which is what people say in their reviews.  Moreover, the owners of this device will like the adjustable clip, designed to mount it on the belt. </p><p>  As for negative reviews, they also come to the address of this model, but much less often than positive ones.  In them, buyers note not too high screen quality, the absence of a frequency scanner, as well as only one contact number.  Otherwise, there are no complaints about this phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tehnoobzor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best shockproof push-button phones" class="if uuid-2920627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920627.jpg"></div><h2>  SENSEIT P300 </h2><p>  This model also had to be included in the rating of push-button shockproof phones.  It has several specific features that will interest any user.  It provides an eight-channel walkie-talkie, a removable antenna, custom channels, an address book for up to 500 entries, and a pretty decent screen with enhanced image clarity. </p><h2>  Opinion of people </h2><p>  The best shockproof phone from the button options, according to customers, they like because of the built-in walkie-talkie, removable antenna, as well as a bright flashlight.  Users claim that a combination of these elements in modern gadgets is a rarity.  In addition, they are enthusiastic about the radio, which can work without a headset, as well as a high-class screen. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, buyers, as a rule, note two points - the susceptibility of the glass to scratches and problems with the firmware.  Fortunately, these nuances do not overlap the advantages of the model, so it continues to be actively sold out in different cities and countries. </p><h2>  teXet TM-512R </h2><p>  The domestic device can boast of high autonomy - it can work for about a month without recharging with constant calls and listening to the radio.  As for security, here the creator has provided inserts made of aviation aluminum at the edges, which are able to withstand fairly high loads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="inlusoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="texet tm 512r" class="if uuid-2920631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920631.jpg"></div><h2>  Comments </h2><p>  The opinion of people about this phone comes down to one thing: it is very good for use in various climatic conditions, as it perfectly withstands both heat and frost.  In addition, in this model, users like a high class of protection, the presence of power pads on the outside, as well as a capacious battery that can be easily removed at any time. </p><p>  Negative reviews of people come not so often, but when choosing a device to listen to them is still worth it.  Users, as a rule, are unhappy with the ability to write only one number in the contact book.  In addition, not all owners are satisfied with the lock, which does not in any way prevent an accidental response to a message when the gadget is in your pocket or bag. </p><h2>  Ark Power F2 </h2><p>  A shockproof phone with a powerful battery is popular not only because of this advantage, but also due to the loud speaker, the SOS button and a capacious contact book.  There is also a rather bright flashlight.  This phone, as a rule, is purchased for older people, since for them it seems to be an ideal option - a large screen, convenient buttons, not too much weight design. </p><h2>  What buyers say </h2><p>  In their reviews, users most talk about the benefits of the model.  They like it thanks to a loud speaker, a great battery, an emergency call button inside the joystick, a radio that works without an antenna, and the ability to set up a quick call for nine contacts.  In addition, people enthusiastically respond about a bright flashlight that turns on and off in one motion. </p><p>  The only significant drawback that buyers often point out is the location of the speaker.  Since it is located behind, a telephone conversation is heard by everyone around.  But at the same time, even despite frequent complaints about such an occasion, people are generally satisfied with the purchase and use it with pleasure, not being afraid to break or damage it if it gets into the water. </p><h2>  Caterpillar cat b30 </h2><p>  Another popular shockproof phone.  Button models, as a rule, have a fairly powerful battery, and this gadget is no exception.  He is able to work offline for about a month.  The gadget looks quite brutal, so it is most often purchased by men.  As for the functionality, here it is very modest, but the degree of protection is quite high, so you should not be afraid of the integrity of the structure after an impact. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reichelt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best shockproof push-button phones" class="if uuid-2920632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920632.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer feedback </h2><p>  There are various comments about the device in question.  People really like 3G support, which is surprising, since in push-button models it is difficult to find such an addition.  In addition, users respond positively to the compactness of the device, as well as a fairly large amount of memory. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, people distinguish only too mediocre camera, as well as a small screen.  The first moment is really a significant minus, but far from everyone speaks out about the second, since it is difficult to call it a negative side, because the phone itself has not too large dimensions, and therefore its parts can not boast of size. </p><h2>  RugGear RG128 Mariner </h2><p>  The rating is completed by a model with an excellent degree of protection and decent characteristics in general.  Here there is support for two SIM cards, a sufficient amount of memory, which can even be expanded if desired, as well as two batteries in the kit (main and spare).  This model is well protected not only from shock, but also from the ingress of moisture inside.  At the same time, the device in question looks pretty decent, therefore it is popular among different segments of the population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technogog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button shockproof phones rating" class="if uuid-2920636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920636.jpg"></div><h2>  Comments </h2><p>  In the reviews of the owners of such a phone, in most cases there are indications of precisely positive aspects.  First of all, they note a decent degree of <span>protection against shock</span> and moisture.  In addition, users enthusiastically talk about a capacious battery and moderately loud dynamics.  They also often indicate such an advantage as the low weight of the device, which is only 127 grams, which pleasantly surprises every modern person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fresnostaffingagency.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button shockproof phones review" class="if uuid-2920654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2920654.jpg"></div><p>  The shockproof waterproof push-button telephone is not without drawbacks, although it is very difficult to find them.  Among them, people note the lack of support for 3G, as well as the so-called mocking amount of memory, which must be further expanded at their own expense.  Otherwise, buyers do not see any flaws.  These shortcomings do not overlap the dignity, because of which the gadget is acquired by adolescents, businessmen, the elderly and other categories of the population. </p>
