  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beautiful crochet topics: patterns for women</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are just starting to master the hook, it is best to hone your skills on tops.  They can look like T-shirts with narrow or wide straps, tied around the neck or back, like swimsuits, look like classic T-shirts with a cropped bottom, or look like ‚Äúbat‚Äù blouses.  In any case, novice craftswomen quickly crochet topics.  Patterns for women selected the most simple knitting, but the products are very elegant. </p><h2>  Basic rules for knitting tops </h2><p>  For work, you will need measurements of the length of the neckline and the product from the shoulder to the armpit, from the armpit to the waist, grasping the waist, chest, arm, neck.  Depending on the model of the top, certain measures fall out. </p><p>  For summer models, take cotton yarn, a thin hook (No. 1-2.5).  Choose the color scheme taking into account clothes with which you will wear a topic.  Before work, knit a sample with different hooks, change the yarn to choose the best option.  Next, take measurements, wash and compare the results. </p><p>  A crocheted female topic can be made without patterns if you knit on yourself.  To do this, start work from the bottom of the product.  For elastic, choose a dense pattern (from 2 centimeters).  Measure it with your waist, chest and only then close it in the ring. </p><p>  Now knit in a circle, periodically trying on yourself.  Having reached the armpit, mark with needles on the product in front and the back of the top.  In the same way, determine the neck and length of the straps.  The last step is to tie the neck, armpit with ordinary single crochet or pico columns (three air loops with one base).  If you knit the model on another person, then draw patterns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Top of square motifs </h2><p>  Knitters often resort to products from motives: beginners do not get tired of work, and professionals can knit elements even in traffic jams.  Consider the steps of creating a top from square motifs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet tops for women" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779921.jpg" width="247"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To begin, draw a full-length model pattern, determining the length of the product, the straps, neckline and waist circumference.  Next, connect the motive, conduct preparatory work with it, measure the dimensions and calculate how many elements are needed for the top.  Pencil note their location. </p><p>  If you have a small space, scatter the obtained centimeters for all reasons, that is, knit the pattern in one more row.  If, on the contrary, the elements protrude a few centimeters, then you need to replace the yarn, take a hook with a lower number or reduce the number of rows. </p><p>  In our version, you need fifty-two squares to crochet a summer topic for women.  Choose small motive schemes, then the product will be more elegant.  The element we have chosen is suitable for women of any complexion. </p><h2>  Square motive pattern </h2><ul><li>  Lock a chain of eight loops into a circle. </li><li>  Each row begins with lifting loops. </li><li>  <span>Alternate a double crochet</span> ( <span>SNR</span> ) and a loop.  It turns out 12 columns. </li><li>  Alternate a bump (three double crochets with one base and a single top) with three loops. </li><li>  You start the third row from the middle of the arch of the first bump of the last row.  Knit arches of five loops with half columns.  It turns out 12 arches. </li><li>  Now form the corners of the square.  From the middle of the arch of the bottom row, you collect 6 loops, knit a half-column in the middle of the next arch.  Next, on the next arch, dial a loop, 5CHN, three loops, 5CHN, a loop.  Finish the element with a half-column in the next arch of the previous row.  Then start the pattern again with six loops. </li><li>  In the last row, the pattern is as follows.  Where there were arches of six loops, knit 5CHN.  Next, go without knitting corners to knit corners, knitting 7CHN, a loop, 7CHN over the columns of the lower row. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet topic for women schemes" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779926.jpg" width="250"></div></li></ul><p>  From the second motive, you begin to create an entirely female topic crocheted.  Mark the connection diagrams on the pattern with a contrasting pencil.  You start connecting the elements in the top with the second motive.  To do this, attach the squares with the right side, knit an unbound element according to the drawing, pulling the thread through the columns of the finished motif. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can do otherwise: immediately connect all the squares, and then fasten all the elements together with <span>connecting columns</span> .  After that, tie up the top, go to the straps. </p><h2>  Openwork crochet topics: schemes for women </h2><p>  Openwork T-shirts can be knitted from the middle, combining different patterns.  For example, find your favorite wide pattern of border, lace, shuttlecock or combine individual motifs into a single canvas.  The resulting pattern will go under the chest. </p><p>  The bottom of the canvas can be decorated with ordinary arches from air loops.  To make the product not look like a simple grid, alternate arches with filled columns.  For example, every two arches with 7 loops, knit nine double crochets. </p><p>  In the next row above the posts will be three empty arches.  The columns are staggered.  The penultimate row is decorated with arches from the columns, and in the last row you knit pico.  Because of the "frank drawing" this topic (crochet) for full women will not work, choose a scheme with a denser pattern. </p><p>  Then go back to the beginning of the lace, work on the top of the top.  It can be completely connected by fans.  First make arches.  Fill them with capes without air loops.  And in the next row, alternate these columns with loops.  With this pattern, the usual ‚Äúpineapples‚Äù begin.  Next, knit straps, tie a neckline, armpits.  As you can see, there are no particularly complex patterns in openwork models. </p>

    <h2>  Open Tops, crochet T-shirts for women </h2><p>  Schemes of such products with a bodice fit in parts, that is, first work on the cups, then go to the bottom and straps.  Knit a cup from the middle as follows. </p><ul><li>  Collect three lifting loops and seventeen loops. </li><li>  Now tie the resulting chain from left to right, then from right to left with double crochets.  You should get 16 columns without lifting loops.  In the last, 17th, loop of the chain, you type 2CCH, a loop, 2CCH and from it go to knitting 17 double crochet stitches on the other side. </li><li>  Next, dial the lifting loop and 16SSN.  Also from the 17th loop you are already knitting 4CCH, a loop, 4CCH, go to knitting 17 columns on the other side. </li><li>  A row fits in the same way, dial 6CCH, loop, 6CCH. </li><li>  Next, knit 8CCH, loop, 8CCH. </li><li>  Now the pattern from the 17th loop is slightly modified.  You type 8CCH, in the loop of the lower row you knit a ‚Äúslingshot‚Äù (two double crochets with one base), a loop, a ‚Äúslingshot‚Äù, 8CCH. </li><li>  Next, knit similarly 10CCN, "slingshot", loop, "slingshot", 10CCN. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet topic for women schemes for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779913.jpg" width="393"></div></li></ul><h2>  Top mix </h2><p>  We continue to crochet a topic for women.  Schemes of the bodice from the 18th column are increased by two similar elements. </p><ul><li>  You dial 12SSN, ‚Äúslingshot‚Äù, loop, ‚Äúslingshot‚Äù, 12SSN. </li><li>  In the next row do 14SSN. </li><li>  Increase the columns to 16SSN. </li><li>  The last row consists of 18SSN. </li></ul><p>  Thus, you can enlarge the cup to the desired size.  Also do the second half of the bodice.  Sew the lining from the inside from the inside.  If necessary, attach the insert cup to the bodice, then the top can be worn without a bra. </p><p>  Connect the halves between each other, start with the crochet columns in a circle to knit the bottom of the top.  From the next row you can go to the openwork pattern.  For example, alternate arches of five loops and half columns.  Next come the arches empty and filled with columns, as described in the previous example. </p><p>  Knit straps from the top of the top.  Skip the braid under the cups.  The bodice is tied with a picot.  If the cups are not completely connected together, then you can use a chain to build a corset weave.  Get an elegant summer top. </p><h2>  T-shirt patterns </h2><p>  Products with 3-4 or more patterns look chic, but their combination requires a lot of work.  Firstly, one pattern can pull together a thing, another make it loose, so you need to constantly calculate the number of loops.  Secondly, many beginners cannot afford such painstaking work of loop counting and knitting with all the patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet topics for women with schemes" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, either select crochet topics for women in magazines with patterns of your size, or tie the model with one pattern.  Such a top can be connected by patterns or whole, making reductions and additions of loops on the product itself.  Even the sleeves can be knitted directly from the topic (this is the advantage of the hook). </p><p>  How to choose patterns for elegant tops? </p><ul><li>  For one rapport, dial 19 loops with three lifting loops. </li><li>  Knit a fan with loops (* loop, CCH * - 4 times in one base).  Next, also knit a loop with a crochet column (9 times), stepping over the loop of the downstream chain.  In the last loop, knit a ‚Äúfan‚Äù with loops (5CCH with five loops). </li><li>  The whole series of half-columns. </li></ul><h2>  Coral pattern </h2><ul><li>  Repeat the pattern with "fans". </li><li>  Again a series of half-columns. </li><li>  Pick up five lifting loops, a ‚Äúfan‚Äù with three columns with 3 crochets and 3 loops in one base.  Next, knit loops with columns with 3 yarn (5 times), stepping over two half-columns of the previous row.  In the last loop, knit a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of 4 columns with 3 crochets and 4 loops. </li><li>  Above the fan of the lower row, alternate a half-column and a loop, and over the columns knit continuous half-columns. </li><li>  Next, repeat the pattern from the first row. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted female topic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779953.jpg" width="361"></div></li></ul><p>  The coral pattern creates a feminine, delicate, romantic look.  It will make elegant blouses, t-shirts, crochet tops. </p><p>  Patterns for women who prefer tops with wide sleeves (like the ‚Äúbat‚Äù model). </p><ul><li>  One rapport needs thirteen loops. </li><li>  Gather one lifting loop and 2 air loops, make a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of 7SSN with one base in the 7th loop of the chain.  End the rapport with two loops and a half-column in the last 13th loop. </li></ul><h2>  Wide-sleeved top pattern </h2><ul><li>  Again, knit three loops, go to the "fan" of the bottom row.  Do 3SSN, loop, 1SSN, loop, 3SSN, finish the picture with two loops and a half-column. </li><li>  Repeat the third row according to the drawing of the second row.  Only in the fan pattern add two loops, and between the rapports there is one loop, 1CCN and a loop. </li><li>  In the fourth row in the correct pattern, three loops are added.  After the pattern of connecting air loops there is no, just knit 1. </li><li>  You collect three air loops and a ‚Äúsheaf‚Äù (3SSN with one top and three bases).  You make two loops, a fan from 7, 2 loops, a ‚Äúsheaf‚Äù from 7 (this element smoothly switches to the second rapport). </li><li>  Rapport ends with half-columns. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's topic crocheted scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/779963.jpg" width="383"></div></li></ul><p>  It turns out an air topic crocheted for women.  Patterns for beginner knitters are represented by a loin, openwork pattern.  You can tie the back of the top with ordinary columns with a crochet, and before decorating with a plot.  That is, take the usual monochrome pattern for cross-stitch.  Knit black crosses with columns, and replace white with a square (CCH, 2 loops, CCH).  Such a top requires patience and perseverance, but you will get a chic result. </p><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Beginners are better at learning from pre-made models.  Find the top one according to your size and follow the instructions of the wizard.  After creating 3-5 works, you can pick up your patterns, create equally beautiful crochet topics, you can modify patterns for women by adding your own drawings. </p>
