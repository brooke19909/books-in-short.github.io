    <p>  Oder originates in the <span>Sudeten Mountains.</span>  Rushing down from them, the river further paves its way along the Central European Plain, whose terraced valley is very wide, sometimes up to 10-20 km. </p><p>  Passing the mouth of the Luzhitsa Nisa, the Oder expands immediately to 250 m and becomes full-flowing.  Many islands form on its way.  The shores are presented in the form of ramparts that protect arable land from flooding.  84 km from the beginning, the Oder River is divided into two branches (navigable - western).  It flows into the Baltic Sea, namely the Gulf of Szczecin (it is called the lagoon). </p><h2>  Cool nature of the river </h2><p>  Throughout the Oder in the spring there is always a flood.  Summer and autumn are characterized by flash floods, winter is characterized by increased water content.  In the most severe frosts, the river freezes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Very often throughout history, severe floods created disastrous situations.  Many times, large areas of agricultural land completely went under water, settlements suffered.  Each nationality living on the banks of this wayward river gave it its name.  For the Germans, this is the Oder, for the Czechs, the Poles, the Oder.  This river is both the Kashubian Vedra and the Luzhichan Vodra.  Latin medieval names - Viadrus and Oder.  The basis of all the names of the word "hadro", that is, "water flow". </p><h2>  River history </h2><p>  Even in the life of the ancient Romans, the Oder played a huge role.  It was a section of the Amber Road, from the shores of the Baltic, amber was delivered to the Mediterranean.  It was an important trade route for the Germanic tribes. </p>

    <p>  In the Middle Ages, the development of trade contributed to the construction of many cities on the banks of the Oder, the river was an important European artery.  Since the 13th century, in order to protect arable land, the first dams have been built on it. </p><p>  Already in the XVII century, the active construction of canals began, and the Oder River connected all the important European arteries.  The largest canal - the Oder-Spree - was built in 1887-1891, its length was almost one hundred kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Already in 1919, after the war, <span>the Treaty of Versailles</span> defined the borders of states and navigation on the Oder. </p><h2>  The Second World War </h2><p>  For the German army, the Oder River in 1939-1945 served as a fortifying, defensive line.  The waterway has become a critical strategic site. </p>

    <p>  In 1945, during the Vistula-Oder operation, Soviet troops forced the Oder River.  It was from here that the thorough offensive against Berlin began.  As a result of a well-coordinated <span>Berlin operation,</span> Hitlerite Germany was defeated. </p><p>  Prior to this, back in 1943, at the Tehran Conference, the borders of European countries after the war were determined by the <span>anti-Hitler coalition</span> .  It was along the Oder that the border between Poland and Germany was designated. </p><h2>  <strong>Oder River in Germany</strong> </h2><p>  One of the important industrial centers of Germany is the city of Eisenh√ºttenstadt.  It is located in the place where the Oder is connected to the German Spree.  The name of the city is translated as "the city of iron factories."  Since ancient times, there are many steel mills. </p><p>  Frankfurt an der Oder is located in East Germany and borders the Polish Slubetsky on the river.  Since the 19th century, the old Prussian Frankfurt an der Oder was of great commercial importance, it was in the middle of the road between Berlin and Poznan.  In World War II, it was very badly damaged by fascist attacks, and after the war it was rebuilt again.  Now it looks more modern. </p><h2>  Fishing in Germany.  Ecology </h2><p>  All rivers flowing through Germany are simply teeming with fish, but fishing here is not easy.  It will not be possible to simply take a fishing rod and go ashore.  Each fisherman must acquire a license, and only one who has completed expensive fishing courses, passed exams and received a certificate can get it.  Everyone should be a member of a club and fish only in certain, specially designated places.  You can go fishing at private ponds for a fee; a license is not required here. </p>

    <p>  <span>The rivers of Germany</span> are considered the cleanest in Europe.  The accuracy and pedantry of the Germans, their self-identity made them so.  The main problems arose during the existence of the GDR, then there was simply not enough money for the construction of treatment facilities.  Now, when environmentalists sound the alarm for any reason, the situation has improved, all the rivers of Germany have become much cleaner.  In the Rhine, which was formerly called the "sewer of Europe", salmon began to enter more and more often, preferring clean fresh water. </p>
