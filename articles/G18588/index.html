    <h2>  What else is there in the hotel? </h2><p>  Daphne <span>Hotel Apartments 4 * is</span> not a resort hotel.  There is little entertainment, which positively affects the cost of living.  Nevertheless, while in a hotel, you can brighten up your leisure time.  For example, swim in the pool, or sunbathe.  If guests come with children, then those while their parents are resting can play in a separate area.  By the way, the hotel also has a beauty salon and a hairdresser. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But, of course, the most important thing is the restaurant.  Daphne Hotel Apartments 4 * offers its guests three food options - breakfast, half board and all inclusive.  As the guests who were here assure, no one will remain hungry.  The choice is not as wide as in fashionable hotels, but everything is fresh, satisfying and tasty.  Everyone can find something to their taste - they serve salads, fruits, meat, fish, seafood, poultry and side dishes.  But drinks are not included in the price of dinner.  Bartenders sell delicious cocktails at moderate prices for Greece (2.5 ‚Ç¨), but if guests come to the restaurant with their own water, no one will drive them away. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  People who have already been vacationing here leave good reviews for Daphne Hotel Apartments.  The apartments, of course, are not new - but the hotel does not position itself as a fashionable complex.  Yes, and extremely low prices for accommodation (which is not something that in Paphos, but in Russian resorts can not be found) brighten up this small minus.  But inside there is everything - starting with sets for making tea and coffee, ending with the oven.  The rooms here are conscientiously cleaned daily, changing towels and linen.  Guests are advised to take only breakfast - they are enough to get enough, and for lunch and dinner you can look into one of the restaurants or cafes, which are numerous in Paphos. </p><p>  In general, to summarize, the hotel will be an ideal option for people who dream of relaxing by the sea for modest money. </p>
