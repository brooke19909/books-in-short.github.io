For example, through third-party specialized programs. </p><p>  To unlock the "apple" device with a forgotten password from the lock screen, a utility called 4uKey is used.  It is easy to learn and stable. </p><p>  To use this application, you must adhere to the following algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Download and initialize 4uKey. </li><li>  Launch the appropriate application, and then connect the iPhone to the computer via the USB cable. </li><li>  Wait for the smartphone to synchronize with the computer. </li><li>  Accept 4uKey‚Äôs offer to install the latest firmware.

How to unlock?  Via ITuns!  This technique is official and reliable. </p><p>  To use iTunes to reset your lock screen password, you must: </p><ol><li>  Launch iTunes and update it. </li><li>  Connect the "apple" device to the computer and wait for the synchronization of devices. </li><li>  Select the connected device in IT. </li><li>  Go to the "General" block. </li><li>  Click on the button that says "Restore ...". </li><li>  Select a smartphone recovery file.  It is advisable to prepare it in advance. </li></ol><p>  After a few minutes, you can enjoy the result.  Immediately after restoring the smartphone, the password for the lock screen will be reset.  Fast, easy and very convenient! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password reset" class="if uuid-3123109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3123109.jpg"></div><h2>  Recovery mode </h2><p>  Forgot password on iPhone 5S?  How to unlock the corresponding device without data loss?  To do this is problematic.  You can reset your smartphone, and then restore information through AppleID. </p><p>  Another way to unlock the "apple" device is to use the recovery mode.  First, the device is connected to PC and iTunes, and then in the appropriate section of the recovery mode, you must select the "Restore" option and wait a bit. </p><p>  To enable recovery mode, you must: </p><ul><li>  hold down the "Home" and "Power" buttons - on iPhone 6 and older versions of devices; </li><li>  simultaneously hold down the "Decrease volume" and "Power" buttons - for new "apple" devices. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in the process.  True, this technique is encountered in practice as an exception.  There are always simpler methods for solving the problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enable recovery mode" class="if uuid-3123106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3123106.jpg"></div><h2>  Data cloud </h2><p>  Did the person forget the password on the iPhone 6?  How to unlock and reset settings on this device?  Let's say using iCloud.  This technique does not always work - it can be used only by those who activated the Find iPhone option on their mobile device in advance. </p><p>  Assume that the corresponding condition is met.  Then, if you need to reset the password for the lock screen, you will need to perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Access icloud.com from any device via an internet browser. </li><li>  Log in to your AppleID. </li><li>  Open the "Find iPhone" section. </li><li>  Click on the inscription ‚ÄúAll devices‚Äù at the top of the window, and then select the smartphone that you want to reset. </li><li>  Click on the control with the signature "Reset". </li><li>  Examine the warning about resetting data and settings, and then confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  In a few minutes, the user will have a reset "apple" smartphone.  You can recover data on it by logging into your AppleID. </p><h2>  Jailbreak and recovery </h2><p>  Forgot password on iPhone 6?  How to unlock a mobile phone in case of jailbreak?  Some argue that this can be done by removing the keychain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset Screen Password" class="if uuid-3123113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3123113.jpg"></div><p>  Users must remove the var / keychains keys or replace the value PasswordProtected with 0 in a document named com.apple.springboard.plist. </p><p>  Important!  This technique has stopped working with the release of iOS 4.0.  With its release, changes to the system files result in the permanent blocking of the mobile phone. </p><h2>  AppleID and password </h2><p>  And what to do if you forget your AppleID password?  Often it is possible to recover the password through the recovery form. </p><p>  This will require: </p><ol><li>  Go to the Apple ID website and click on the "Forgot your password?"  under the authorization log. </li><li>  Indicate the "apple" identifier (email address associated with the account). </li><li>  Choose a method of data recovery.  For example, by e-mail or by answering security questions. </li><li>  Answer the questions or click on the password recovery link.  The latter will come in a letter from Apple tech support to the specified mail. </li><li>  Create and retype a new password. </li></ol><p>  Recovering data from an Apple account through a support service directly requires proof of ownership of the smartphone ‚Äî a check, box of the device, and the device itself.  Without them, the desired result will not work </p>
