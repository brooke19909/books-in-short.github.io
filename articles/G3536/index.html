A universal procedure for their configuration, basic technical parameters and owner reviews will be given.  The basic tariff plans that the operator offers to use in combination with such an access point will also be considered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.shop.megafon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up a 3G modem megaphone" class="if uuid-2351655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351655.jpg"></div><h2>  Device purpose </h2><p>  Any modern “Megaphone 3G” modem is essentially a network gateway.  On the one hand, it wirelessly connects to the cellular network and already with its help sends or receives data and information from the Internet.  On the other hand, using a universal USB connector, it is switched to a personal computer or router. </p><p>  That is, with the help of such a device, you can create a mobile access point to the "global web" without any problems.  Its only significant drawback is the lack of support for the most advanced LTE technology, which, moreover, provides the highest transmission speed at the moment.  Therefore, the cost of this decision is very, very democratic for the reason that it has already managed to partially become outdated. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  This model of “Megaphone 3G” modem comes in a plastic case of white or black color and resembles an ordinary flash drive.  On one of its lateral faces, a special CRC9 socket for switching a remote antenna is displayed, which is indispensable in cases where the nearest cell tower is at a distance of 9-12 km.  On one side of the solution is a universal USB connector.  With its help, this modem is connected to the system unit of a computing system or to a stationary router. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.megafon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modem megaphone 3g speed" class="if uuid-2351657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351657.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery list for this device is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Modem with UMTS technology support. </li><li>  User manual supplemented with a warranty card. </li></ol><p>  The drivers of the “Megaphone 3G” modem together with the diagnostic software are recorded inside the device in a special ROM chip.  Therefore, the operator excluded the CD from the delivery list.  In addition, such media is gradually becoming a thing of the past and now not every computer is equipped with such a drive.  As a result, a similar approach to storing drivers and related software can be attributed to the advantages of such a network access point. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The following main technical specifications are available for the “Megaphone 3G” modem: </p><ul><li>  Speed ​​with appropriate coverage does not exceed 28.8 Mbit / s. </li><li>  Slot for installing a 32 GB memory card. </li><li>  Possibility of switching an external antenna in case of insufficient cellular network signal. </li><li>  Connect to a PC using the universal USB interface. </li><li>  The presence of internal memory in the device makes the setup process as simple as possible. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="toplogos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up a 3g modem megaphone" class="if uuid-2351662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351662.jpg"></div><h2>  PC connection.  Software setting </h2><p>  There are two ways to configure the “Megaphone 3G” modem for a laptop or desktop computer: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Using specialized operator software. </li><li>  By harnessing the capabilities of the operating system. </li></ol><p>  In the first case, the order of switching and parameterizing the device is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We connect the port of the access point to the PC.  Then you need to wait until the process of initializing it. </li><li>  After starting the automatic installation process, follow the instructions of the wizard.  As a result, MegaFonInternet utility and control drivers will be installed. </li><li>  Then run the MegaFonInternet program and set up Internet access. </li></ol><p>  In the case of using system software, the algorithm is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We perform the modem switching in the previously described way.  Using the wizard, we install device drivers, but there is no need to install a proprietary utility from the operator company. </li><li>  Go to the “Start” menu.  Next, select the item “Control Panel” and in it we find “Network Control Center”. </li><li>  Create a new connection. </li><li>  In the next window, select the item “Dial-up connection”. </li><li>  After that we set the dialer number * 99 # and the name of the connection.  The password and login fields are left blank.  We save all the parameters. </li><li>  Next, go to the connection parameters and uncheck the “Request a name ...” flag.  Then go to the “Security” tab and check the box next to the CHAP parameter.  We save all changes. </li><li>  Now click on the connect button and go to the “global web”. </li></ol><p>  Be that as it may, the easiest way to configure is to use the software of the operator company.  Its advantages include the simplest configuration algorithm and the minimum number of actions that a user must perform during the configuration process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="faytan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone modem 3g driver" class="if uuid-2351668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351668.jpg"></div><h2>  Switching with a router </h2><p>  Now we’ll figure out how to configure a Megafon 3G modem in combination with a stationary router.  In this case, the setup procedure is complicated and consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  We install this <span>communication equipment</span> in the router connector. </li><li>  Forcedly reboot the access point to the "global web". </li><li>  After that, the software setting of the latter should be automatically updated and all the necessary software should be automatically installed.  If this does not happen, then you need to go to the control panel of the router and force to create a 3G connection with the following parameters: </li><li>  In the field “Name of access point” we type internet. </li><li>  The dialer is * 99 #. </li><li>  The fields “Username” and “Password” are left without correction. </li><li>  The name of the connection is arbitrary. </li><li>  We save the parameters and exit the setup menu.  The router is then ready for use. </li></ol><h2>  Connection speed </h2><p>  After completing the configuration process, it is necessary to check the operability of the access point to the "global web".  To do this, just launch the browser and open any page on the Internet. </p><p>  As previously noted, the highest Internet speed of the 3G-modem “Megaphone” is 28.8 Mbit / s.  Again, such a value can only be obtained in the 3G / UMTS network next to the communication tower and provided that no one else is connected to it except for one subscriber.  Therefore, in practice, you can count on a speed of no more than 2-3 Mbit / s, and this is quite sufficient not only for receiving text documents, but also for playing video in HD-format. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gasimli.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internet speed megaphone 3g modem" class="if uuid-2351669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351669.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost.  Rate </h2><p>  Now such a device can be purchased at a promotional price for 1 ruble.  Again, a starter pack with a cost of 699 rubles is bundled with it.  That is, the total amount necessary for such a decision is to pay out already 700 rubles.  At the same time, the “Internet 699” tariff plan is activated, which includes 8 GB of data. </p><p>  Be that as it may, such a tariff plan with a promotional price justifies the purchase of such a communication solution.  The key disadvantage of this modem is the lack of support at the hardware level of cellular communications of the 4G / LTE standard and, as a result, lower transmission speed.  But if there is no need for an unlimited amount of traffic, then the purchase of such a 3G modem and a promotional starter pack is quite reasonable and justified. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kulibin.ucoz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3G modem megaphone for laptop" class="if uuid-2351670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351670.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  As previously noted, setting up a Megafon 3G modem is a very, very simple operation.  This is a key advantage of this device, which many people noted in their reviews.  Also its advantages include low cost, acceptable technical specifications, the ability to install an additional drive, and connect an external antenna.  Another advantage of this solution is the internal memory chip with drivers and software recorded on it.  That is, there is no need to use the CD in the process of setting up the access point. </p><p>  But the list of shortcomings of this modem includes the lack of support for the latest generation 4G / LTE cellular networks and strict binding to the coverage of the operator company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kulibin.ucoz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone 3g modem" class="if uuid-2351672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2351672.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The 3G-modem “Megaphone” considered within the framework of this material combines good technical specifications and reasonable cost.  It has a number of significant advantages, but the disadvantages include the lack of support for advanced LTE cellular technology and lower data rates.  But if the previously mentioned disadvantages are not so significant, then the acquisition of such network equipment is technically and economically justified. </p>
