    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The boarding house is located in the village of the same name, on the right coastline of the bay.  This is a quiet place with charming nature, which is ideal for lovers of outdoor activities, and for those who like to just be in silence.  You will have time to explore all the beautiful places, to plunge into the history of your land and country.  The trip from St. Petersburg takes only 30 minutes. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There are other <span>recreation centers</span> in Repino.  It is high time for the Leningrad Region to appropriate the status of the capital of cultural tourism (there are boarding houses "Zarya", "Burevestnik" and many others).  But today we decided to bring to your attention the best option for everyone.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, it is a Repino boarding house.  It offers its guests a rural vacation with comfortable accommodation.  On the territory there is a building with hotel type rooms.  But that is not all.  For businessmen, there is a conference room where you can conduct seminars or trainings.  There is a small cinema and a sports hall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you're bored, then check out Cronwell Park.  He is liked by everyone who visits a holiday home in Repino, Leningrad Region.  There is a chance for everyone to test their agility and walk the distance through the rope park.  The sensations are unforgettable, and there are tracks for adults and small ones.  And after that it‚Äôs so good to dive into a cool pool or to get together for a game of bowling.  But the opportunity to visit the equestrian club and go on horseback riding is especially interesting.  The tour desk offers you several dozen destinations, among which everyone will find the most suitable. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation for tourists </h2><p>  Not all boarding houses in Repino of the Leningrad Region are ready to provide such comfortable conditions.  Free parking will allow you to place your car.  For athletes there is a large modern fitness center.  It features a huge modern sauna and free private parking.  But I would especially like to pay attention to comfortable rooms.  There is a snack bar on site and a stunning garden. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  In total, 135 rooms of various categories are provided.  This greatly simplifies the selection.  You can stay in a single or double room or book a suite.  Full-fledged meals for vacationers are provided at the expense of the dining room, as well as a cafe and bar, which are located on the territory.  Half board provides tourists breakfast and dinner.  If you do not plan long excursions, then it is better to choose another option.  <span>Full board</span> includes breakfast, lunch and dinner, that is, comprehensive meals on a schedule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday house in repino, Leningrad region" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1392889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  Pension Repino offers not only sightseeing and a great vacation.  You can combine business with pleasure - improve your health.  There are a number of possibilities for this on the basis of a boarding house.  By themselves, fresh air and the proximity of the forest zone have a beneficial effect on the human body.  For an additional fee you can use the professional services of a massage therapist and cosmetologist, trainer of exercise therapy.  There are a number of procedures that are prescribed by medical personnel. </p><p>  Sanatorium "Repino" is widely known throughout the region.  The quality of services, medical and after-sales service makes this health resort popular among a wide variety of population groups.  Students and couples with children, as well as business people, have a rest here.  The hotel is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, and beaches are within easy reach.  You can enjoy the beauty of the sea right from the window of your room.  Here you will fall asleep to the sound of waves, and wake up from the warm rays of the sun.  This is a vacation that you have long dreamed of, but did not have enough time.  Now you can safely hit the road.  You do not need passports and visas, you do not expect long flights and queues at the airport.  Just a little time on the road - and the car arrives at the place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in repino of the Leningrad region private sector" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1392887.jpg" width="600"></div>
