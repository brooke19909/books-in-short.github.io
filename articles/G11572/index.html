From her first marriage, she gave birth to 6 children.  The last child, the long-awaited daughter of Eugene, appeared when the duchess was already 42 years old.  Caetana, being a widow, entered into a <span>second marriage</span> with Jesus Aguirre, who headed the music department at the Spanish Ministry of Culture.  The reaction to her marriage in the world was mixed.  Caetana was accused of swagger, and her husband, who was 8 years younger than his wife, for selfish motives.  Despite the hail of criticism, this marriage was happy, but was interrupted by the death of Jesus in 2001, which was a serious blow for the duchess.

    <p>  The marriage with Alfonso, numerous <span>unsuccessful plastic surgeries</span> made the Duchess the heroine of the yellow press.  According to an extraordinary noble person, all this does not prevent her from enjoying her old age.  Rumor has it that the richest aristocrat of Spain can travel the whole country from north to south, without leaving the limits of their possessions. </p><p>  The Duchess of Alba, despite various gossip, is revered <span>in Spain.</span>  About her life, the film La Duquesa was shot by the television company Telecinco, in which Adriana Osores played the main role.  In Puerto Banos (Marbella), a personalized star was laid in honor of the Duchess, a monument was erected on Paseo de Cristina Cayetan during her lifetime, and in Seville one of the squares bears her name. </p>
