  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple's Most Expected Presentation of the Year</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The announcement of the new iPhone model will not take place relatively soon, but forecasts from the most famous analysts are already appearing.  We all remember at what price the previous iPhone models came out, with a binding to the contract, it amounted to $ 199.  However, this year we may not wait for such a gift from the company. </p><p>  A leading analyst at Pacific Crest, a large company, said Apple stocks would exceed $ 600 this year.  This year, their price ranges from $ 540.  Shares will rise in price due to the growing popularity of Apple products and specifically <noindex>  <span>iPhone 6</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  Andy Hargreaves is confident that the company's management will sell the new iPhone for at least $ 299, subject to a contract with the operator for 2 years.  As you can see, the price will increase by 1.5 times compared with $ 199 for the iPhone 5s.  It is logical that phones not attached to the operator will also raise their value, the estimated cost of the device will be 649 dollars.  According to the expert, financially secure iPhone buyers, for whom they are intended, will not especially feel the price increase, therefore sales will be as always lively, as the smartphone will present many new opportunities. </p><p>  Hargreaves believes that increasing the screen diagonal by 0.7 inches will allow the company to raise the cost of the smartphone to a level that will not be particularly noticeable to the consumer, but will bring corporate profit.  The analyst believes that by the end of this year, the value of the company's securities will increase by 20%. </p><p>  The presentation is planned to be held this fall, however, it will not be known in September or October.  Company representatives do not yet reveal all the secrets of the new device, very little is known.  For example, that the model will be a screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches.  About 5.7 inch screen is out of the question. </p><p>  Experts have been trying for a year to guess what the new iPhone 6 will present to us. A large Korean brokerage company KDB Daewoo Securities also provided its version.  They often tell fans of new products what they should expect from a particular device long before their official presentation.  And we want to say their information is fully true. </p><p>  According to the Korean company, Apple will provide two smartphones simultaneously this year.  One will be called the iPhone 6 and its diagonal will really be 4, 7 inches.  The screen resolution of this model will be 1920 * 1080 pixels.  The second model will be a mixture of a tablet with a phone.  The screen size will be 5.5 inches, and the resolution is 2272 * 1280 pixels. </p><p>  Both new products will be presented in various variations, for example, the amount of internal memory will vary from 16 to 64 GB, the RAM will be the same 2 GB, both devices will have an 8-megapixel main and 3.2-megapixel front camera.  iPhone 6 will run on iOS 7.2, but with minor changes. </p>
