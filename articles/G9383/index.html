    <p>  Not so long ago, the general public became aware of the existence of a secret organization of Masons that has been functioning for centuries.  What is this union?  Who are the Masons?  What are their goals?  A lot of questions about this can arise.  We will try to answer the most important of them. </p><p>  <strong>How did freemasonry appear?</strong> </p><p>  This movement, bearing a religious and ethical character, originated in England in the 18th century, and a little later spread to the USA, India and European states.  This teaching united people into a brotherhood through love, mutual assistance and equality.  Freemasonry is considered to be an order, since it is an organized society of people. </p><p>  In 1717, the Great Lodge was created in England - the cradle of the brotherhood.  She leads all organizations of Masonic society located in different countries.  Six years later, James Anderson, a London-based preacher, creates the Book of Charters, which defines the basic rules of conduct for members of an organization.  According to her, a freemason should not be an atheist or a freethinker, he is forbidden to take part in political movements.  He must fully support the current government. </p><p>  <strong>Who are the Masons?</strong> </p><p>  This association gained wide popularity in the circles of the bourgeoisie, often prominent thinkers of that time became its participants.  Over time, Freemasonry acquired an aristocratic character, especially this trend is noticeable in European countries.  Who are the Masons?  These are people who strive for spiritual growth and moral self-improvement within the framework of certain principles and beliefs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ranks of the order included such famous personalities as the Prussian kings Frederick II and III, the Swedish monarch Gustav III, and the English crowned persons.  Among the freemasons there were some US presidents (Washington, Truman, etc.), statesmen (Churchill), famous philosophers, writers and composers (Goethe, Haydn, Voltaire, Mozart). </p><p>  <strong>What goals did the order set itself?</strong> </p><p>  Their goal is to do everything possible to qualitatively improve this world. </p><p>  The organization contrasted itself with the current church.  She strove to create a secret society, whose members, united by religious brotherly ties, live and work in accordance with their intended goals. </p><p>  The Order did not seek to replace religion; it did not publish theological works.  At meetings of the society, discussions on religious subjects were categorically prohibited.  With all this, faith in God is the basis of their principles and teachings. </p><p>  <strong>Brotherhood Activities</strong> </p><p>  Having dealt with the question of who the Masons are, one cannot help but mention the main direction of their activity.  <span>Members of the society</span> take an active part in charity, they are engaged in philanthropy, but do not advertise themselves. </p><p>  <strong>Hierarchy</strong> </p><p>  Members of the organization are united on a territorial basis, forming small lodges of 40-50 people.  Between themselves, they call each other brothers.  All groupings of the order together form the Great Lodge.  Its head and leader is a great master or grandmaster.  Usually the Great Lodge is in every country. </p><p>  The lowest level in the hierarchical ladder of the order is the student.  Then follows the journeyman, then the master, and, finally, the great master. </p><p>  <strong>Russian masons</strong> </p><p>  The founders of the order in Russia are considered to be Tsar Peter and his associates.  In the forties of the 18th century, General John Keith organized several lodges, the first members of which were foreigners.  However, soon the number of Russian bourgeois representing the Order of the Masons increased significantly. </p><p>  In 1822, by decree of Alexander I, the lodges were closed.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the movement of Masons in Russia revived, but under a new name - ‚ÄúThe Great East of France‚Äù and had a pronounced political character.  Since 1917, lodges were completely banned. </p>
