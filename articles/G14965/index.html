Park ‚ÄúKlay‚Äù will show you anything and proudly begin to tell you what is interesting there.  Of course, if you are a well-read person, you will surely be in some perplexity: why is this city park called as one village existing on the map of Tatarstan? </p>

    <p>  And everything is very simple.  The famous poet Gabdulla Tukai, who became the founder of the new Tatar poetry, grew up in this village.  At two years old, the boy remained an orphan.  And if not for the good people, it is not known how his life would have developed.  It was the village of Kirlay that inspired the future poet to create melodic works that glorify the nature of this land.  He wrote beautifully and with soul about every tree, brook, bird. </p><h2>  Repair is not finished </h2><p>  For some time the park did not work fully.  There were only a few rides for the kids.  This is their favorite "Kangaroo", also Merry caterpillar "and" Water world ".  Everything else, including for adult Kazan citizens, did not open because repair was not yet carried out everywhere.  It was planned that the entire complex will be cooked around July. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, before this time, the beloved ‚ÄúKlay‚Äù park came to life.  Its opening took place on June 12, 2015.  That was a joy for everyone!  And again the alleys were filled with crowds of people. </p>

    <h2>  Heavenly kiss </h2><p>  The amusement park in Kazan is located on the Kremlin Dam - this is an engineering and transport structure in the city.  It connects the banks of the Kazanka River, which flows into the Volga.  The dam itself begins right at the Kremlin.  And here is the circus, and nearby - the main stadium and restaurant "Sail". </p><p>  And the park we are talking about is at the end of this transport facility.  This historical part of Kazan.  Directly opposite (on the other side of the river) is the Kazan Kremlin.  The general view of the Kazanka embankment, which approaches the park, is very decorated.  And next to it on the peninsula reclaimed two years ago is the Family Center, or the registry office. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Such an unusual cluster of such important organizations at one point in the city is supplemented by one important thing.  Near the dam, the Central metro line of the capital of Tatarstan was laid. </p><p>  So you yourself understand that getting into the Amusement Park in Kazan is very easy.  Now it‚Äôs clear why the action ‚ÄúKiss in Heaven‚Äù is held here constantly, and not from time to time.  It is not for everyone, but only for the newlyweds and on the day of their marriage.  A gift to them is the opportunity to drive for free (in a specially decorated booth) on a Ferris wheel.  And look at your city from a height of 55 meters with the different eyes of a married couple.  In one hour, this attraction passes up to 3600 visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  One for all </h2><p>  For local residents or those who have come to Kazan for a while, the ‚ÄúKlay‚Äù park is the best solution to the problem of rest.  Judge for yourself.  There are all kinds of entertainments for children and parents, three kinds of attractions: of course, for children, then for couples with and without children and, finally, extreme.  In general, according to the townspeople, this is a very good place.  You can come to it alone or in the company of friends, as well as the whole family.  And please, go to any zone. </p><p>  Children, of course, pull their parents to their playground.  There are cars and swing carousels.  You can ride on a train, which actually looks like a pirate ship.  Wagons swing on the waves.  The Kangaroo is a lot of fun for the kids - a kind of jumping tower, and the Airport carousel is like an airplane.  "Tropicana" is a set of stairs, hills, strong ropes and turnstiles.  Run, spin, fall - they won‚Äôt scold.  There is a special children‚Äôs, that is, a small, Ferris wheel and a traditional race track. </p><p>  Have you forgotten about <span>cotton candy</span> with popcorn?  Moms and dads - maybe.  But the child always remembers this pleasure. </p><p>  For fans of extreme sports, too, something is cooked.  For example, Flying Saucer is the only attraction in Russia.  Here, rocking and rotation is going on simultaneously, that is, extreme in several modes.  If you want to tickle your nerves, to experience feelings that you did not know before, come to Kazan.  Park ‚ÄúKlay‚Äù will not only surprise you with this. </p><p>  Have you heard of the free fall tower?  She is all 18 meters high.  The effect of flying down is something!  Not everyone will decide on this. </p><p>  "Wild Dance" (also an attraction) - these are such cabins for two.  They rotate immediately in three planes.  Also intended for the most daring. </p><p>  Parents and children can have fun together in the Tornado.  In fact, this is a roller coaster, but with rails.  On them, mini-cars rush up and down.  Then they enter very steep turns.  Electronic cars - at the circuit, of course, under the name "Fast and the Furious."  Bumper boats run on the water in the pool.  We don‚Äôt even talk about carousels that spin in chains in the air.  The attraction is old, especially adolescents and adults love it. </p>

    <h2>  Green Island </h2><p>  The glorious capital is Kazan.  Kirlay Park is her pride.  Today it has the status of a green island.  Here you can take a leisurely stroll, relax on the benches, enjoy the view of the river.  And one more plus: in this part of the big and noisy city, parents and children have the opportunity to spend time together.  Indeed, on weekdays such communication is sorely lacking. </p><p>  In addition, excellent location: city center, near the metro.  And with other transport it is easy to get here from any district of the capital. </p><p>  In general, there are other parks in Kazan.  Their addresses are: for example, ‚ÄúWings of the Soviets‚Äù - in Sotsgorod.  Its borders are along the streets of Koshevoy, Kopylov and Dementieva.  Nearby and a sports school football club "Rubin". </p><p>  A Uritsky park is located between the street.  H. Tufan, Queen, also Gagarin and Vasilchenko. </p><p>  Victory Park - where Bondarenko Street meets with H. Yamashev Avenue. </p><p>  In the very center of Kazan, and even in the lowland - "Black Lake".  And the "University Garden" is here.  Zoobotanic - on the street  H. Taktasha, 112. And in it is the children's contact zoo Lukomorye. </p><p>  The address of the park to which our article is devoted is ul.  One-way Mane, 1a. </p><h2>  What is the price? </h2><p>  Of course, apart from the romantic side of the matter, visitors are also interested in the material.  We arrived here to rest in the Park "Kirlay".  What prices are there, interesting? </p><p>  Of all the rides, of course, they are different.  The cheapest are children‚Äôs.  Extreme - the most expensive.  For example, a ticket for a Ferris wheel (for an adult) costs 150 rubles, for a child - 100. A booth for four places - 450. "Big Pirate" - 120, "Tornado" (two circles) - 150, extreme "Centrifuge" - 250. </p><p>  I walked in the freshest air by the river, experienced good emotions - here‚Äôs your appetite.  But you will not stay hungry here.  There is a cafe everywhere.  They feature dishes of meat, as well as vegetables.  Plus a sweet table, ice cream.  Boys and girls are offered a special menu. </p>
