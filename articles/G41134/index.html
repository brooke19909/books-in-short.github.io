Terms of manufacturing a technical passport for a house</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After completion of individual construction, the question arises before the property owner: "How to get a <span>technical passport</span> for a house?"  This document is considered one of the main for any object.  It describes the property in detail, indicates the date of the inventory by a specialized service, and there is always a plan of the object.  In simple words, having studied this document, the specialist receives comprehensive information about the property. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technical passport to the house" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/390146.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Where are the passports made? </h2><p>  Without this document, the house cannot be put into operation, therefore, when preparing all the necessary papers, you need to start with it.  Production of a technical passport is carried out in several stages.  First, a cadastral engineer and surveyor leave for the place.  They carry out all the necessary measurements and make a construction plan.  Based on the data they provided, the passport is prepared at BTI and issued to the owner.  At the same time, it is advisable to get a certificate of ownership of the object and register it with Rosreestr. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="production time of technical passport in bti" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/390158.jpg?1399383978445" width="425"></div></h2><h2>  What documents are needed? </h2><p>  To get a technical passport for your home, you need to collect an impressive package of certificates and permits.  First of all, you will need documents confirming the ownership of the land on which the construction of the object was carried out.  Still need a passport of the owner (original and copy), permission to conduct construction work, project, as well as a statement.  In the case when the documents are submitted to the BTI not by the owner himself, but by his representative, a corresponding power of attorney is also required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In principle, if you build a house in accordance with applicable law and do not violate anything, all the papers should be in the hands of the owner, so that no additional running around is required. </p><h2>  Intermediary Services </h2><p>  If we are talking about <span>unauthorized construction</span> or during the construction process design calculations were violated, the production of a technical passport for real estate can be significantly complicated.  In this case, additional examinations will be required, it may be necessary to get some extra certificates, to get consent from neighbors or local authorities.  To date, there are enough firms offering their services to resolve such issues.  Turning to such an intermediary, the owner gives a power of attorney in the name of the employee of the enterprise and pays for the services.  All other questions will be decided by the contractor. </p>

On the other hand, the services of intermediaries can cost several times more than the cost of the registration certificate itself, so you need to make a decision on contacting them after carefully considering and evaluating the situation.

However, in practice, some citizens wait months for bureaucratic employees to complete the work they have begun. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that in some cases the delay in the procedure is associated with a violation in the construction of the structure or with errors in the submitted documents.  But, unfortunately, situations are not uncommon when a client in BTI is forced to collect unnecessary information. </p><p>  If the owner needs a technical passport very urgently, he can make an emergency order for an additional fee.  In this case, the document will be executed in just a week. </p><h2>  What is its validity period? </h2><p>  The law does not establish such a concept.  That is, the technical passport for a house, apartment or other structure is considered a permanent document.  However, when certain actions are taken with an object, for example, its alienation (sale, donation), transfer to a mortgage, inheritance, notaries, bank representatives or independent experts are entitled to require a second inventory. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="production of a technical passport" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/390157.jpg" width="225"></div></h2><p>  The fact is that if from the moment the technical passport was received, the BTI did not go home for 5 years, the document may be in doubt.  During this time, extensions, redevelopment and other changes that have affected the value of the object are quite likely.  In such a situation, the owner contacts BTI for an inventory, as a result of which the expert puts a mark on the data sheet on the date of the inventory.  If no changes have occurred since the last inspection, you do not need to redo the document. </p><h2>  What information does the data sheet contain? </h2><p>  This document is often confused with the construction plan.  In fact, the technical passport to the house contains a lot of information about the structure.  Firstly, <span>this is the actual address of the</span> object.  It is indicated on the basis of information entered into the Rosreestr, and subsequently duplicated in the certificate of ownership. </p><p>  The technical plan, being part of the passport, clearly shows the layout of the house or apartment.  It reflects information about the height of ceilings, the presence and position of doors, windows, walkways and communications.  The data sheet necessarily contains information about the materials from which the walls and floors of the structure are made.  It indicates the year of construction, <span>inventory value,</span> as well as the date of the overhaul (if any).  An explication of the premises should be attached to the floor plan of the house.  In it, the abbreviations and other designations of the scheme are deciphered, the name of each of the premises and its area are indicated.  The data sheet necessarily reflects the actual dimensions of the object.  They are expressed by such quantities as the total and living area, as well as the size of the land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="obtaining a technical passport at home" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/390155.jpg?1399384185652" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  When submitting documents to the BTI for the manufacture of a technical passport, the owner must have with him a receipt on payment of the state duty.  Its size depends on the urgency of the order.  When making a passport in 2 weeks, it is 900 rubles, an urgent service costs 2500. The details for which the fee must be transferred are usually posted on the BTI information board.  If the registration certificate is ordered through an intermediary, the cost of the service may be an order of magnitude higher.  So, the urgent preparation of a document in a big city ranges from 12,000 rubles and often depends on the price of the object itself. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bti technical passport" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12018/390159.jpg?1399384257421" width="600"></div></h2><p>  A technical passport for a house, apartment or other building is made at the time of its commissioning.  It contains a detailed plan of the object, its characteristics and other information.  Every 5 years it is necessary to carry out the current inventory and mark its results in the data sheet.  This document is prepared at BTI, but you can use the services of intermediaries if you wish.  Sure, it will cost more, but the owner will deprive himself of a number of troubles. </p>
