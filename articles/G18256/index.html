Perhaps its wide distribution is due to the relative simplicity of execution, or also due to the fact that the ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù scheme (a hook is the tool with which the pattern is created) is perfect for beautifully expanding the details of the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pineapple hook pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1211628.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  What is a pattern? </h2><p>  The element, which is called the term "pineapple", is used both in a classic form and in a modified form.  Improvements relate to its shape, density, size, and patterns that are used to form the individual components of the "pineapple". </p><p>  Any ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù scheme (a hook is used to create a product) has several main components: </p><ol><li>  "Leg". </li><li>  Triangular central element. </li><li>  Framing. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pineapple pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1211626.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  The ‚Äúleg‚Äù of the ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù pattern can be short, consisting of one or more rows.  Some modified patterns provide for a rather long "leg", which includes up to 15 rows and gives the finished "pineapple" an elongated shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The openwork triangle located in the center of each element makes the ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù pattern crocheted, recognizable and serves as its main decoration.  In its execution, the fantasy of the craftswomen is not limited to specific rules.  Unless observing the mandatory triangular shape.  The central component can be connected by loin mesh, arches from air loops, lush columns, "bushes" and many other patterns.  To give an additional decorative effect, it is decorated with beads, pico from air loops or using other techniques. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkin pineapple" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1211627.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <p>  The ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù scheme (the hook is selected accordingly yarn) invariably includes a kind of frame that surrounds the element and is connected to it by chains of air loops.  This pattern component is required for all schemes (traditional or developed independently).  Often the frame looks like a column of "bushes", but options are possible: the use of straight stripes or the inclusion of patterns between the frame and the triangle. </p><h2>  "Pineapples" in flat canvases </h2><p>  This is the easiest way to use the pattern.  As a result of knitting, the fabric does not change its shape and dimensions, that is, its width remains unchanged throughout its height. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The specificity of the pineapple pattern is that the paths of its frame form a wave-like pattern.  Therefore, creating an even canvas is not such a simple job.  It is required to constantly monitor that the "pineapple" scheme is observed.  The hook is difficult for craftswomen precisely in that you can imperceptibly cut or expand knitting along the edge. </p><h2>  Pineapple knitted circular fabric </h2><p>  The composition of many schemes with pineapple elements is extremely convenient for expanding paintings.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù pattern, crocheted, is so often used for making wide skirts, dresses, flirts, shawls, berets and other types of clothing.  You can also often see interior items that are connected by a pineapple pattern, for example, pillows, bedspreads, curtains, napkins. </p><p>  As a rule, the expansion of circular canvases occurs with the uniform addition of columns and loops along the width of the entire row.  To develop different schemes, various techniques are used: </p><ol><li>  Increase rapport size. </li><li>  Expansion of intervals between rapporty. </li><li>  The gradual formation of new rapports. </li><li>  Knitting intermediate rows, after which they have a greater number of rapports. </li></ol><p>  For the pineapple pattern, all of these methods are also applicable.  The arc formed by the frame allows you to begin the formation of a new element simultaneously with the completion of the previous one.  This feature is characteristic of almost all schemes, including more than one row of ‚Äúpineapples‚Äù. </p><h2>  Crochet napkin.  "Pineapples" - a recognized classic </h2><p>  This ornament allows you to <span>knit napkins of</span> various sizes and styles.  ‚ÄúPineapples‚Äù are conveniently combined with other patterns, placed in the center or along the edges of the canvas. </p><p>  For this reason, circular patterns of napkins are popular with knitters who plan to make a beret or crochet shawl.  "Pineapples", schemes of which include small cells and details, are suitable for knitting hats.  And shawls, as a rule, are made on the basis of very delicate patterns. </p><h2>  Features of knitting shawls </h2><p>  This accessory has a dual function: decorative and warming.  The pineapple pattern can be used to work with warm or summer yarn.  The photo below shows an example of how the scheme for <span>knitting a shawl</span> was developed on the basis of a round napkin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shawl crochet pineapple pattern" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1211629.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The center consists of the napkin itself, the middle part is connected with a simple openwork pattern in compliance with the principles of expanding the circular canvas, and the elements that go along the edge are the final decor of the shawl crocheted.  "Pineapples" (the schemes for their implementation remain unchanged) are placed in one or several rows.  A shawl can be made by performing half of the scheme, then it will look like a semicircle.  In this case, the craftswoman used a three-quarter napkin scheme. </p><p>  And in fact, and in another embodiment, the products have a very beautiful appearance. </p>
