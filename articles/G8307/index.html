    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a resort hotel, it is worth paying attention not only to positive, but also to negative comments.  You should be prepared for the fact that, despite the high status, there are a number of shortcomings in the White Palace Grecotel Luxury Resort.  Reviews are characterized by the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the cost of living is set in accordance with the five-star status, but the quality of services, unfortunately, does not reach a high level; </li><li>  equipping rooms, especially bathrooms, requires a complete upgrade; </li><li>  wireless internet is very weak; </li><li>  there is very poor water pressure in the shower; </li><li>  water of different temperatures alternately flows from the tap; </li><li>  at breakfast, there are very long lines for food; </li><li>  by 10 am it is impossible to find free sunbeds either on the beach or by the pool; </li><li>  the rooms are equipped with very old TVs with tiny screens that can not boast of decent image quality; </li><li>  the beach of the hotel is very small and represents a narrow strip of strip, and therefore there is not enough space for all guests on it; </li><li>  the hotel is quite far from the city and resort infrastructure of Rethymnon; </li><li>  the hotel territory is very much blown by the wind, and therefore drafts are everywhere, and there is a risk of catching a cold; </li><li>  if you do not arrive at the hotel during the "hot" season, you will find some restaurants and bars closed; </li><li>  almost the same thing is served daily at the buffet; </li><li>  the hotel has a reservation system for sun loungers (with towels), and therefore they can stand idle all day empty while many guests can not find a free place; </li><li>  if the windows of your room overlook the back yard, then be prepared for the fact that from the very early morning you will be awakened by noise from chores; </li><li>  there are no benches and arbors on the territory; </li><li>  very weak and old hair dryers are installed in the bathrooms (unfortunately, many guests only by the end of their stay will find out that they can be replaced at the request); </li><li>  very poor lighting in the rooms, and therefore in the evening you will not be able to read, and cosmetic procedures are also complicated; </li><li>  there are very few outlets in the room; </li><li>  weak animation; </li><li>  the playground as such is absent, with the exception of a couple of swings in the territory; </li><li>  half of the channels that were claimed do not work. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting the increasing popularity of such a holiday option as the Grecotel White Palace Luxury Resort.  Tours in this direction are in great demand.  This is largely due to the unique natural and landscape features of the area in which this hotel is located.  Thanks to the unique design of the territory, you can enjoy incredibly beautiful views from any point.  This is ensured by a huge number of viewing platforms. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, relatively recently, the White Palace El Greco Grecotel Luxury Resort has undergone reconstruction.  However, you are unlikely to be able to notice this.  A relatively new situation in the territory and in the lobby area is nothing compared to the outdated rooms.  Of course, redecorating the apartment is present.  Nevertheless, if you pay attention to furniture, plumbing and other amenities, then with surprise note their antiquity.  In addition, the rooms are absolutely not thought out in terms of ease of use.  What does the number and location of outlets cost? </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the hotel does not quite match the declared five-star status.  Of course, well-trained staff and delicious food in the restaurant are important, but not all that is needed for a good rest.  Perhaps the travelers would not have made such a tough claim to the hotel if the cost of living and related services were slightly lower.  That is why tourists are not recommended in choosing a hotel to be guided only by colorful brochures and positive reviews.  You need to soberly evaluate all the advantages and disadvantages of staying in a hotel so that you will not be disappointed upon arrival.  If you consider yourself to be unpretentious travelers, then you will certainly like it here. </p>
