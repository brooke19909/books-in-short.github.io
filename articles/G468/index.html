    <p>  Old Russian art was mainly formed and further developed after the <span>baptism of Russia.</span>  It was after this important event that dramatic changes took place in the political life of the country, as well as in art. </p><p>  The advent of a new faith - Christianity introduced into the art of the Middle Ages the traditions of a unique and sublime antique Greek culture.  For example, the first stone temples began to be built.  One of these buildings is <span>the Church of the Tithes</span> built in Kiev <span>,</span> which amazes contemporaries with its exquisite forms and magnificent interior decoration.  Frescoes made of smalt, mosaics, amazingly beautiful iconostasis and plot biblical miniatures have been admiring for centuries. </p><p>  Ancient Russian art of the X-XIII centuries was a symbiosis of the East Slavic culture of the Scythians and Sarmatians.  It is also the embodiment of the ancient traditions and architecture of beautiful Byzantium and related Balkan countries. </p><p>  The art of the Middle Ages is also characterized by the fact that it always has a theological theme.  Architects and artists of that time should have followed the guidelines of church canons that met the highest Christian principles.  They explained how to depict certain objects.  Strictness and even some asceticism was traced in architecture at that time.  This is clearly noted, first of all, in the forms of architecture. </p><p>  Old Russian art and its main trends are clearly visible in the <span>frescoes of Sofia of Kiev.</span>  This is a real classical system of <span>painting the temple of the</span> Middle Ages, which has survived to our times.  For example, in the temple, the mosaic depicts Our Lady of Orant, and there are also large murals with a plot from the righteous life of Christ, apostles, martyrs and preachers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less unique is the portrait of Yaroslav the Wise, preserved to this day, his family and episodes of court life, in which ancient Russian art and its characteristic features are most clearly recorded.  <span>The architectural monument,</span> made in mosaic technique, which dates back to 1046, in its original form came to us in the same St. Sophia in Kiev. </p><p>  Russian masters skillfully mastered fresco painting and mosaic.  Few know that the Italian word "fresco" is translated as "raw."  Painting of this style was carried out on a still damp wall with paints and was widely used to decorate temples.  Fine art reached its heights in the Middle Ages. </p><p>  White stone carving has always been characteristic of Russia; it has become a remarkable, special feature of ancient Russian architecture.  She adorned not only the cathedrals, but also the palaces of the nobility.  <span>Carving on stone</span> and wood was very popular, it also belonged to art crafts. </p><p>  Old Russian jewelers were famous for their handwriting and were unsurpassed masters of silver and gold jewelry.  For example, the old salary is known - a masterpiece made of genuine leather, decorated with precious stones - ‚ÄúOstromir Gospel‚Äù. </p><p>  Russia was famous for its school of icon painting.  The word ‚Äúicon‚Äù is literally translated from Greek as ‚Äúimage‚Äù.  Most often they depicted the face of Christ and the Mother of God, as well as saints.  These were usually carefully written, strict faces, with an elongated oval face and straight nose, and, as a rule, with large open eyes.  The archives of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra preserved the name of the famous icon painter of the XII century, the monk Alimpiy.  He belonged to the school of Greek masters, he painted icons in a strictly regulated manner, but they still showed elements of personal skill and talent of an unsurpassed master. </p><p>  The best traditions of the Vladimir-Suzdal school of icon painting are known, which was continued by the followers of the writing of icons.  They became the following workshops: Moscow, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Rostov, Suzdal.  It was here that the icons of amazing beauty came into being, for example, the ‚ÄúAngel of the Golden Vlas‚Äù ‚ÄúDeesis‚Äù from the Moscow Assumption Cathedral, the icon of Dmitry Solunsky, George, the ‚ÄúHoly Savior‚Äù and many others. </p><p>  Fine art is designed to serve people and enable many generations to feel involved in the history and culture of our great Motherland. </p>
