This is a huge port, receiving up to a thousand <span>cargo ships</span> and tankers daily.  Visiting the beaches in these places is considered, as a rule, a pleasant addition to a business trip.  Meanwhile, time does not stand still, and the beach infrastructure of the island is changing, and for the better.  We offer you an overview of the beaches of Singapore with a description and reviews of tourists.  Note that all of them are the property of the state and entry to them is absolutely free. </p><p>  It is believed that the best beaches in the state are those located in the southeastern part of the island of Sentosa.  However, on the main island there is something to pay attention to.  To start your search for a vacation destination is the question of what you really want: a vibrant beach life with parties and entertainment, or privacy and tranquility. </p><h2>  Beach Changi Beach </h2>

    <p>  The beach, stretching for 3.3 kilometers, is located in one of Singapore's oldest coastal parks, called Changi.  The magnificent natural area is only slightly corrected by a person for the convenience of vacationers.  The pristine beach with clean sand is strewn with coconut trees.  There is everything for a comfortable stay: special places for barbecue, park benches, awnings from tropical rain and the scorching sun, bike paths. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The existence of Changi Beach is a direct answer to the question of whether there are beaches in Singapore.  The park is located near the airport and has a fairly low attendance.  This fact, perhaps, can be considered a plus, not a minus.  Tourists are probably confused not with such white sand as on Sentosa.  But here are the most picturesque sunsets and sunrises with aircraft landing and taking off in the sun.  The beach is absolutely safe. </p><h2>  Beach at East Coast Park </h2>

    <p>  Siloso beach is considered the most crowded and popular with everyone who visits Sentosa.  It is not surprising.  Tourists are provided with this place by numerous hotels located near the beach.  Siloso Beach is considered one of the best in terms of infrastructure and cleanliness in Singapore.  There are numerous cafes and bars, restaurants, clubs, souvenir shops, and in the evening it turns into a place for parties and holidays.  Siloso Beach hosts the famous Wings of Time show, which attracts many tourists. </p><p>  Many of Singapore's beachfront reviews have earned the most harmonious, with no exception Siloso Beach.  However, having a conversation about him, tourists notice that although it is considered municipal, and therefore free, it is actually quite expensive.  So, for a lounger you have to pay about $ 20 (about 1200 rubles at the current rate).  Add to this the inflated prices in cafes and restaurants - a phenomenon common for popular tourist destinations. </p><h2>  St. John's Island </h2>

    <p>  Escaping from noisy parties and crowds of people, many tourists go to the beaches of the small island of St. John.  This is a less popular place compared to the previous ones, but more quiet.  The beach infrastructure here is just beginning to develop, so there are not many tourists.  You get a tropical paradise almost in its original form. </p><p>  The island is almost entirely owned by the National Park, and construction is prohibited in any form.  Consequently, in the near future, the beaches of Singapore on the island of St. John will remain the most secluded and calm.  A narrow strip of sand is surrounded on one side by the clear sea, and on the other by a jungle that creates a natural barrier to the sun. </p><h2>  Pulau Seringat and Lazarus Islands </h2>

    <p>  Many tourists who come to Singapore do not even suspect that, having spent only 20-30 minutes on the road, you can get to such unique places as the islands of Lazarus and Pulau Seringat.  Once on artificially created beaches, sand for which was brought from Indonesia, surrounded by the jungle, it is hard to believe that very close is one of the largest megacities in the world. </p><p>  Singapore's secluded beaches are located near St. John, mentioned above.  You can get to the islands by walking along the dam.  Previously, Pulau Seringat and Lazarus were autonomous, but now they are connected by an artificially created strip of sand 800 meters long, planted with palm trees.  In these places, the infrastructure is practically not developed, but this is their charm.  Spending one day on an impromptu tour, you will see the jungle and the life of local residents. </p>
