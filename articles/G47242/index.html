    <h2>  About the manufacturer </h2><p>  The history of the Haier brand begins at the beginning of the twentieth century.  However, then the trademark represented only refrigeration equipment.  The affairs of the company did not go very well, and in the early 80s the bankruptcy process was started.  In 1984, it was decided to transfer the management of Qingdao to another manager.  It was then that the famous Haier brand appeared, which in translation into Russian means ‚Äúsea‚Äù.  The company's activities began to expand gradually.  In addition to refrigerators, telephones, televisions and other household appliances appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Haier washing machines are assembled not only in China, but also in factories located in other countries, such as America, the Philippines, Indonesia, Africa and even Russia.  The plant, which fills the domestic market with high-quality devices from Haier, is located in the city of Naberezhnye Chelny. </p><h2>  The best models </h2><p>  Haier for all its considerable activity has released many different models of washing machines.  Some of them immediately gained popularity and deservedly bear the title of the best. </p><p>  However, there are also such instances that the majority opinion called unsuccessful.  For example, Haier HW60-10266A is considered such a model.  She rinses the powder very poorly, so she constantly has to turn on a repeated cycle, since there is no additional rinse separately.  But if you consider the entire model range, then it is worth noting that there are much more options that deserve attention.  So, let's look at the <span>best</span> Haier <span>washing machines</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine haier reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1532774.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are also comments on Haier products.  Although the manufacturer is trying to correct them, the minuses still remain.  The most important is factory marriage.  Buyers claim that while still under warranty, the Haier washing machine may fail.  The reviews of the owners, who were not lucky enough to encounter such a problem, assured that the service centers quickly enough respond to such calls. </p><p>  Some models upset customers with the inability to choose the spin speed and additional rinse on their own.  Unfortunately, the latter option is not provided in all Haier devices. </p><p>  Many owners have noticed that sometimes the standard washing cycle is not enough for a good rinse.  Also drew attention to the fact that spinning at maximum speed can lead to severe deformation of the fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="haier washing machine errors" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1532784.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <h2>  Haier washing machine: reviews </h2><p>  Trusting the reviews of the owners, we can make an unambiguous conclusion: Haier brand washing machines deserve to be leaders in the domestic market.  They fit perfectly into any interior thanks to the original design.  For high-quality washing, more than 10 automatic programs have been developed that are adapted to certain types of fabric.  During operation, the devices practically do not make unnecessary sounds, are as economical and reliable as possible.  There are, of course, negative reviews on the Web, but they are sporadic.  As a rule, they are written by people who come across devices with factory defects. </p>
