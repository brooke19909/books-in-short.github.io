    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The current village of Orekhovo <span>(Leningrad Region) was</span> formerly part of the Vyborg Province, located in Finland.  Until 1939, it was the village of Raasuli in Rautu parish.  Settlement Raasuli was border.  It was located at the top of the ridge, from where a magnificent panorama of the eastern region of the Karelian Isthmus opened.  From here even the shores of Lake Ladoga and the smoke of steamboats sailing along the lake were visible.  Not far from the modern village of Orekhovo (Leningrad Region) is Kiwi-surya.  This is the highest point on the Karelian Isthmus.  Above sea level, it rises two hundred and five meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The village of Raasuli was not far from the road leading to Kexholm (now it is Priozersk).  A little south was the old border.  There were no other barriers.  Today, at the place where the <span>state border</span> used to pass <span>,</span> there is a sign on the highway - ‚ÄúPriozersky District‚Äù. </p><h2>  Village Life Raasuli </h2><p>  Numerous wagons and carts with various goods intended for trade passed daily from Finland to St. Petersburg near the village of Raasuli.  As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, three hundred meters from the border itself was the M√ºyohy√§nen store.  This outlet was a roomy house where travelers could stay for relaxation.  A place was provided for their horses.  The store was considered the center of the village. </p><p>  Around Raasuli in the woodlands, local pastures were located.  They stretched to the border stream Tungelman-oya (today it is the Smorodinka river), in which local residents caught salmon for fishing.  In gleams among the hills dense thickets of hazel grew.  There were squirrels that were attracted to nuts. </p><h2>  The period of Soviet power </h2><p>  In 1917, a railway was built at the foot of the hill.  The highway connected Petersburg with Finland.  However, this road did not influence the course of the history of the village.  The fact is that the border was closed the next year.  The canvas of the railway was dismantled for several kilometers.  The current station ‚Äú67 km‚Äù (in the past ‚ÄúNuyala‚Äù) has become the end of the line passing from eastern Finland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Barbed wire fences along the border stretched out already in 1920. Border guards lived with the population in the village of Raasuli.  Sometimes clashes with violators arose in this territory.  It was here that a few days before the start of the war with the Finns, the Soviet side attempted to provoke a conflict.  However, an aggressive reaction from opponents did not follow. </p><p>  November 30, 1939 the village of Raasuli was the first to encounter military operations.  As a result of the shelling carried out by Soviet troops, the houses in it lit up.  Fortunately, the civilian population was not affected.  It has already been evacuated.  After a small skirmish, Raasuli occupied parts of the Red Army. </p><p>  09/01/1941 the village was again conquered by Finnish troops.  And in 1944, Soviet power had already settled in Raasuli.  A subsidiary farm belonging to the Leningrad Komsomolka plant was placed on the territory of the village. </p><p>  As a result of the renaming company, which took place in 1947-48, Raasuli became Orekhovo.  Most likely, the authors of this name pay attention to thickets of hazel, which were nearby.  This renaming was secured by a decree of the Presidium of the RSFSR of 01.13.1949. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Orekhovo today </h2><p>  What is this settlement currently?  Today, Orekhovo (Leningrad Region) is a large summer cottage, which gave the same name to the stop located in front of the old state border.  The nature of these places is very picturesque.  Holidays in Orekhovo, Leningrad Region, have been popular with residents of the Northern capital for many years.  Tourists are attracted by transparent lakes, which are surrounded on all sides by pine forests, forest sandy roads and an abundance of mushroom places.
