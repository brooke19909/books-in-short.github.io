    <p>  <span>After the terrible Bartholomew’s night, a new religious war became inevitable.</span>  <span>The Huguenots chose La Rochelle fortress in southern France as a stronghold.</span>  <span>Henry III had to return to military affairs and arrive at the walls of the fortress in February 1573 at the head of the royal army.</span>  <span>Attempts to siege and storm the fortress were futile.</span>  <span>And at the beginning of summer, Henry had to leave from under the walls of La Rochelle to Poland.</span>  <span>Having signed the peace treaty in haste, the man went abroad.</span> </p><h2>  High post </h2><p>  <span>What caused this haste?</span>  <span>The fact is that Henry III was elected <span>king of Poland.</span></span>  <span>Catherine turned this adventure while he fought.</span>  <span>The last king Sigismund II passed away, and he had no heirs.</span>  <span>The choice of a new sovereign fell on the Polish nobles.</span>  <span>The second contender for high office was Archduke Ernest of Habsburg.</span>  <span>Due to recent events, the reputation of the French monarchs in Poland has fallen, because here the bulk of the people tended to Protestantism.</span>  <span>Nevertheless, Catherine de Medici decided that the royal throne would not interfere with Henry.</span>  <span>In order for her son to win the election, she sent Bishop Jean de Montluck to Poland, who worked hard to make Henry the king of Poland.</span> </p><p>  <span>It soon became clear that the Polish nobles, having elected Henry III as their ruler, provided him with only nominal power.</span>  <span>The ambitious monarch and his mother did not like this.</span>  <span>Henry began to doubt the Polish throne and initiated protracted negotiations.</span>  <span>At the end of the summer of 1573, the incumbent king of France began to get sick and was forced to appoint his brother as heir to the crown.</span>  <span>The fact is that the only son of Charles IX was a bastard, and only his daughter gave him an official marriage.</span>  <span>In December of that year, Henry nevertheless took over the Polish throne and slowly left his native country.</span> </p><p>  <span>Only in January 1574 did the new king arrive in Poland, where his magnificent coronation soon took place.</span>  <span>Soon, <span>Henry 3 of Valois</span> faced a number of difficulties.</span>  <span>Firstly, the parliament and the Senate held all power in their hands, which affected the pride of our hero.</span>  <span>And secondly, they wanted to marry him to Princess Anne, the 48-year-old sister of the late ruler.</span>  <span>To reassure his subjects, the newly made king began to live like a real Pole.</span>  <span>This allowed him to gain time.</span>  <span>What could be further, we can only assume, because in the summer of 1754, Charles IX dies, and Henry, four days after receiving a letter from his mother with this news, secretly leaves Poland.</span> </p>

    <h2>  The reform </h2><p>  <span>Having gained power, the newly made French king adopted many promising reforms in the fields of taxation, the army, etiquette, law and ceremonial.</span>  <span>However, due to the tense situation in the state, he had no time to implement them.</span> </p><p>  <span>In 1576, after negotiations with the Huguenots, the king signed an edict implying freedom of religion throughout France.</span>  <span>The document caused a stormy reaction of Catholics.</span>  <span>They created their own League, led by Heinrich Guise.</span>  <span>As a result of this, two subsequent civil wars occurred.</span>  <span>In 1580, the situation stabilized, and the king began to pay much attention to religion.</span>  <span>He used to be a deep believer, but now Henry's religiosity has reached its zenith.</span>  <span>Many enemies believed that in this way he was trying to cover up his vices.</span>  <span>Over time, the king organized two brotherhoods, whose members met once a week, prayed and even engaged in self-torture.</span>  <span>For such an attachment to religion, Henry was called the monk king.</span> </p><h2>  The next coup </h2><p>  <span>Four years after the last civil war, the unexpected happened: Francis, the younger brother of the king, died.</span>  <span>Thus, Henry of Navarre became the heir to the throne (historians nicknamed him Navarre so as not to confuse him with Henry III).</span>  <span>After much hesitation, the king nevertheless recognized Navarre as his successor.</span>  <span>This heir strongly disliked the Catholic League, since he had long been a leader of the Huguenots.</span>  <span>Spain supported the Catholics in this.</span>  <span>Thus, in 1585, King Henry 3 and his mother found themselves in a double threat (external and internal).</span>  <span>They had to sign an edict banning Protestant rites.</span>  <span>Automatically, Navarra lost the opportunity to succeed the throne.</span>  <span>This role was assigned to Cardinal Charles Bourbon.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>Navarra started the war, which was called the war of the three Heinrichs (Valois, Navarra and Giza).</span>  <span>The king was in a difficult situation, which was especially aggravated on October 20, 1587.</span>  <span>On this day, Navarra defeated the Catholics at Cotreux <span>.</span></span>  <span><span><span>King of France</span> Henry 3 of Valois</span> only thanks to his cunning was able to save the Catholics from complete collapse.</span>  <span>He paid the enemy mercenaries to retreat at the crucial moment of the battle.</span>  <span>Therefore, after the defeat at Kotre, the king again had to sign an edict on freedom of faith.</span> </p><p>  <span>Edict caused a wave of protests among the townspeople, who were already not very happy with their ruler.</span>  <span>He was accused of all problems - both state and personal.</span>  <span>Heinrich Guise was more popular among society.</span>  <span>As a result, on May 12, 1588, Guise organized an uprising.</span>  <span>This day will later be called the "day of the barricades."</span>  <span>Catherine once again showed her political talent.</span>  <span>She entered into protracted negotiations with the rebels and thereby won the time for Henry to leave Paris.</span>  <span>Later, she initiated the adoption by the king of his sister's son, who was also the nephew of Gizu.</span>  <span>This would combine the interests of the two Henry.</span> </p><p>  <span>The king had to submit to the League of Catholics and make Giza a lieutenant general.</span>  <span>On this path Gizov to power only gained momentum.</span>  <span>They subjected the king to constant humiliation and openly sent to the monastery.</span>  <span>Despite external humility, <span>Henry 3 of Valois,</span> whose <span>biography</span> was the subject of our conversation today, did not intend to give up.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Counter strike and its results </h2><p>  <span>The right moment for a retaliatory strike presented itself at the end of the summer of 1588.</span>  <span>The invincible armada of Spain failed in the battle with the navy of England and was distracted from the support of the Catholic League.</span>  <span>On the night of August 23-24, Henry 3 ordered the murder of Guise and his brother.</span>  <span>This led to a major rebellion.</span>  <span>The League of Catholics took power in Paris, and the king had to go to an alliance with Navarre.</span>  <span>Two Henry went against the rebellious cities.</span> </p><p>  <span>Relatives of Giza asked for mercy, and Catholic priests called on parishioners to revenge.</span>  <span>The search began for a man who could dare to become the "hand of divine justice."</span>  <span>Finding a challenger among Catholic fanatics was pretty easy.</span>  <span>They became a 22-year-old monk, Jacques Clement.</span> </p><p>  <span>Meanwhile, the Henry army besieged Paris.</span>  <span>The royal camp settled in the town of Saint-Cloud.</span>  <span>Jacques arrived there on August 31.</span>  <span>Calling himself the ambassador of the League of Catholics, he asked for a royal audience.</span>  <span>The king, who always tried to be a diplomat, agreed to accept the monk.</span>  <span>A dagger was hidden in the folds of Clement's cassock.</span>  <span>Meeting the king, Jacques approached him to convey a letter from the League.</span>  <span>At this moment, he struck Heinrich several times with a dagger in the stomach.</span>  <span>Clement's faith in the divinity of his action was so great that he did not even try to escape.</span>  <span>The guard, who came running to the cry of the king, immediately got even with the monk.</span> </p><p>  <span>The assassination of Henry 3 of Valois</span> <span>was left to the amateur, so the king died only the next day.</span>  <span>Before dying, he transferred the throne to Navarre.</span>  <span><span>Henry 3 is the last of Valois</span> , so he had no other choice.</span>  <span>He advised his successor to end religious strife and adopt the Catholic faith.</span>  <span>Navarra followed the advice, but after 4 years.</span> </p>
