  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern man: what is he?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Turning to <span>philosophical anthropology,</span> we note that today many scientists from this field believe that modern man has contradictory features: on the one hand, he is the creator of the great achievements of our time, and on the other, an ordinary consumer who does not think about the need for self-development. </p><p>  Of course, in every culture there are outstanding personalities who contribute to the development of progress, as well as inactive people, but if you imagine a modern person as a collective image, the picture certainly looks contradictory. </p><p>  <strong>Modern man: cult of success and morality</strong> </p><p>  Today, common to representatives of different cultures is the desire to achieve success.  It is interesting that, before, a person considered the manifestation of heroism a success (the period of 50-200 years ago), the creation of strong family ties and the birth of healthy offspring, i.e.  social implementation without taking into account material wealth. </p><p>  Now, the measure of success (in most cases) is money, and the pursuit of them is sometimes aimed at destroying the environment, and sometimes self-destruction. </p><p>  It can be said that <span>material</span> and spiritual <span>values</span> in the understanding of modern man merge into a concept with one meaning, material, while earlier people gave them great differences. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the society still attaches great importance to concepts such as mercy, kindness, sympathy: this is indicated by various organizations created to provide material support to the poor. </p><p>  Therefore, we can say that the <span>value orientation</span> of a modern person is polar: you can find examples of both altruistic behavior and selfish ones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong><span>Modern man</span> and technology</strong> </p><p>  Another distinguishing feature of our time is the increased pace of implementation of new technologies and devices.  And this is what distinguishes the life of a modern young man, it is inextricably linked with technology. </p><p>  Electronic devices have become of great importance to many modern people, they are becoming not only part of everyday life, but even form a <span>way of life.</span>  One has only to imagine a day without a computer and the Internet.  For some, work cannot be organized without them, while others simply won‚Äôt find <span>what to do with themselves,</span> and yet they will turn to other technical devices: telephone, radio, and television.  200 years ago, people existed without these devices, and now life without them would be very complicated. </p><p>  Therefore, we can say that the life of modern people is very closely connected with technology, its quality largely depends on technical capabilities. </p><p>  <strong>Modern man and the problem of freedom</strong> </p><p>  Earlier, the issue of freedom was not as acute as it is now.  A person has learned to assert his rights, value enhanced opportunities and respect other people's freedom.  This is a positive feature of our time: almost everyone is given the maximum possible freedom of development, which allows them to show their talents.  This contributes to the development of progress and testifies to the humanity of the worldview.  Equal rights are important and beneficial to society.  And the fact that they are now implemented is a positive feature of our time. </p><p>  <strong>What should be a modern person</strong> </p><p>  The historian and sociologist Boris Porshnev deduced such a concept as "neoanthropus", by which he understood the type of person of the future, but he pointed out that his representatives can be met at present.  This person has the following features: </p><ul><li>  free, not subject to the suggestion of others (developed self-awareness); </li><li>  abstract thinking, developed will and suggestion ability are used only for creative purposes; </li><li>  striving for the life balance of society (lack of revolutions); </li><li>  kindness. </li></ul><p>  According to the scientist, such people can lead society to prosperity and reduce the number of conflicts that destructively affect all areas of life. </p>
