  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Normal temperature in cats</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During archaeological excavations conducted in Cyprus, a cat and a man were buried in past centuries in one place.  Leftovers and excess food needed to be kept from small rodents, the taming of wild cats allowed to solve this problem.  Our ancestors appreciated their ability to fight rats, mice, and other small rodents. </p><p>  It is believed that cats are one of the most enduring creatures on the planet. It is difficult to answer how true this statement is.  But it is not a secret for anyone that they are less prone to other diseases than other animals, though, like all living things, sometimes they still get sick, including a cold.  The tip of the nose of an animal can tell about an increase in temperature.  In normal condition, it is cool and moist, after sleep it can be warm.  But at high temperature - the nose is dry.  Experts attribute its lowering to a decrease in immunity, and this is dangerous. </p><p>  <span>Normal temperature</span> in cats can fluctuate in the range of 38-39.5 degrees.  In kittens, it may be higher.  <span>The normal temperature for cats</span> without hair is the same as for normal breeds.  Touching the body of such an animal creates a deceptive impression that <span>the body temperature is</span> high, but this is due to the large heat transfer. </p><p>  A possible pathology in the body of a mammal is indicated by an increase of up to 40 degrees.  A sharp increase to 41 degrees is an occasion for urgent treatment measures.  It should be remembered that a cat may have a slightly <span>increased body temperature</span> after physical exertion, stress, in hot weather, or for another similar reason.  A master who knows his pet well can determine with great certainty whether the animal had cause for excitement or whether this increase was due to a more serious reason. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cats are very sensitive animals.  They may have health problems caused by various diseases, including those in which the temperature rises. </p><p>  The normal temperature in cats or not, whether there are deviations in the state of health, can be determined by their behavior.  A sick animal is usually indifferent to food, sedentary, there is a strong shedding of hair, etc. How to find out what is the temperature of cats?  To do this, carefully insert a thermometer (preferably a veterinary) into the rectum of the animal, the end of which is pre-lubricated with paraffin oil or any edible fat, and hold for at least 5 minutes.  If the pet‚Äôs health has worsened, you need to analyze for yourself the probable cause of the disease.  At the same time, one should not forget that in this situation the cat needs peace and warmth.  In this case, it does not need to be picked up or moved somewhere, so as not to cause additional pain. </p><p>  A healthy animal is characterized by mobility, it has a normal appetite, a moist and cool nose, a shiny and smooth coat.  What is the normal temperature in cats can be determined not only with a thermometer, but also by external signs. </p><p>  These animals have the gift to maintain and maintain health, experts have discovered in them an amazing ability to enhance the treatment process in humans.  They are able to help people with mental and heart diseases, circulatory disorders.  It is noted that sick children, communicating with pets, are transformed and quickly recover.  The sudden aggressiveness of a usually calm cat can be explained by the fact that her temperature is elevated due to infection, pain, injury, etc. </p><p>  It is important that temperature is not a disease, but only its indicator.  The cat needs to be treated for the cause of the disease.  You need to remember if there are deviations in the behavior or physical condition of it, you need to consult a veterinarian or contact the nearest clinic. </p>
