    <h2>  Acute political crisis </h2><p>  Forced industrialization in the conditions of the post-war devastation led to the economic crisis and the discontent of the population.  The object of popular hatred was Walter Ulbricht.  The German politician, whose biography totaled many difficult periods, afterwards will say that the July fifty-third days were the most difficult for him in life.  The mass strike turned into an open riot.  Walter had to turn to the Soviet Union for help. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Walter Ulbricht German politician" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1704105.jpg" width="256"></div>  Soviet troops were withdrawn to the streets of many cities, and the Secretary General himself was hiding in the territory of the occupation administration.  During the suppression of the riot, Ulbricht was able to finally destroy the opposition within the party.

    <h2>  Course change </h2><p>  The policy pursued by the Ulbricht government was aimed primarily at restoring infrastructure and production facilities.  The building of socialism was carried out forcedly.  The politician began to criticize not only in the GDR itself, but also in the Kremlin.  Lavrenty Beria repeatedly questioned Walter's decisions and methods.  He believed that many ways of nationalizing and isolating the school only push people away from the government. </p><p>  As a result, Ulbricht was summoned to Moscow and informed about the revision of state policy.  After that, he was "looked after" by the commander of the Soviet grouping of troops in the GDR Semenov.  In the summer of the sixty-first, one of the most significant events in post-war Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Walter Ulbricht German politician biography" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1704106.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Soviet Union officially handed over the rule of the country to Ulbricht.  At the same time, the US military was still in <span>West Berlin.</span>  A serious crisis has begun.  In the center of the German capital a few meters from each other were tanks of the USSR and the USA.  The flow of fugitives to West Germany increased.  In this case, there was only one unclosed border crossing point.  To isolate themselves from Germany, the socialist government has a plan to erect a wall in the center of Berlin.  This decision was made personally by Walter Ulbricht.  A photo of the wall, which they began hastily erecting on August 13, spread around all the world media.

    <h2>  Wall of Ulbricht </h2><p>  After the construction of the wall, a new era began for the political life of the GDR. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Walter Ulbricht German politician biography photo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1704112.jpg" width="600"></div>  In a short time a new economic course was formed.  Many previously nationalized enterprises were united under the same governing bodies.  After the reforms, the political situation in East Germany stabilized.  However, Moscow's confidence in Walter was undermined.  People often joked about him.  Many jokes and nicknames ridiculed his Leipzig accent and Walter's use of parasitic words.

After several personal conversations with the Secretary General, the latter asked for his resignation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="politician walter ulbricht" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1704113.jpg" width="426"></div>  The first of August 1973, Walter Ulbricht died.
