Such uninterrupted work assumes that at the end of the reporting period, there is some residual work in progress in processing.  The correctness of the calculation of the cost of finished products directly depends on how correctly determined the volume of unfinished products.  It is important to be able to evaluate these data correctly, because the size of tax payments and many other indicators depend on them. </p><h2>  What is work in progress </h2>

    <p>  By definition, work in progress <span>is products,</span> goods, or products that have not passed all the necessary processing steps provided for by the technology.  Thus, it may include the following types of products: </p><ul><li>  raw materials and semi-finished products, the processing of which has already been started in order to turn them into finished products; </li><li>  incomplete products; </li><li>  goods that have not passed technical acceptance or the necessary tests; </li><li>  completed works (services) that have not yet been accepted by the customer. </li></ul><p>  In other words, work in progress in accounting is the cost of production costs (materials, resources consumed, depreciation, accrued wages to employees) and other expenses for products whose production has already begun, but has not yet been completed at the reporting date. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This amount of costs collected at the end of the period is not debited to other accounting accounts, but remains on the corresponding production account (for example, 20 or 23).  And even if there was no production in the reporting period, but the costs were incurred, then such costs will be considered as work in progress.  Subsequently, they will be attributed to the value of the finished product.  The concept of "work in progress" is confronted even by those enterprises that engage in trade or the provision of services and do not produce any products.  Costs incurred during the reporting period will be accounted as income tax until the time the goods (services) are sold. </p><h2>  Accounting </h2><p>  The volume of work in progress and its composition are very different for enterprises in various industries.  The duration of the production cycle and the amount of costs can vary greatly depending on the nature of the products and the organization of the industrial process.  Therefore, work in progress in the accounting of different enterprises can be accounted for in different ways from each other. </p>

In trade, these costs are called distribution costs.  In the presence of unsold goods, companies cannot completely write off the distribution costs incurred during the reporting period.  The amount of such expenses should be allocated, while the share attributable to the balance of unsold goods remains on account 44 "Cost of sale". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <strong>Work in progress assessment</strong> </h2><p>  In the Russian legislation several options for assessing the wage arrears are considered.

    <p>  The use of this method assumes that the economists of the enterprise calculate the accounting (planned) price for the unit of wages.  The advantage of the method is that when using accounting prices, the estimation of work in progress as a process is significantly simplified.  The minus can be considered a more time-consuming process of calculating the cost of finished products.  Deviations between accounting prices and the actual cost of the wage must be accounted for in <span>account 20.</span> </p><p>  <em>Settlement using direct cost items</em> </p><p>  The peculiarity of the method is that only the amounts of direct costs directly related to production are sent to the cost of work in progress.  All other costs are transferred to the cost of the finished product.  The list of these expenses is determined by the accounting policy of the enterprise. </p><p>  <em>Calculation of the cost of used raw materials</em> </p><p>  This method is similar to the previous one, with the difference that only the cost of raw materials (including semi-finished products) released into production is included in the prime cost. </p><p>  However, these methods are not available to all organizations.  The choice of evaluation method usually depends on the type of production.  For a company engaged in unit and unit production, only accounting at actual cost is available.  Organizations with mass and serial production have the opportunity to choose any of four accounting methods. </p><h2>  Cost of production </h2>

    <p>  The cost of work in progress is the amount of money spent on the creation of products (work, services), which at the end of the reporting period is still in the process of processing. </p><p>  Costing is an absolutely necessary process.  Data on the cost of work in progress and ready for release products will be required in the preparation of financial statements.  You can not do without them when forming the pricing and assortment policy of the enterprise. </p><p>  To understand how the concepts of costs in work in progress and the cost of finished goods are related, it is worth considering the following formula: </p><ul><li>  GP = WIP (balance at the beginning of the period) + Costs - WIP (balance at the end of the period).  Where: <br><br>  GP - the cost of production in the actual assessment; <br>  Costs - production costs per month (debit revolutions on account 20); <br>  WIP - balances, respectively, at the beginning or end of the month on the account 20. </li></ul><h2>  Calculation of the cost of WIP </h2><p>  <em>Economic elements</em> </p><p>  When managing cost, it is worth remembering the planning and rationing of costs.  This will require the division of costs into various components in order to analyze the structure and control the change in the magnitude of each of them.  In domestic practice, classifications are applied according to various criteria.  In one of them there is a division of costs into economic elements, and in the other into costing items. </p><p>  The composition of economic elements is established by PBU 10/99, it is the same for all commercial organizations: </p><ul><li>  the cost of raw materials; </li><li>  salaries of workers; </li><li>  deductions to social funds; </li><li>  depreciation; </li><li>  other expenses. </li></ul><p>  <em>Costing Articles</em> </p><p>  Of course, usually the costs of work in progress are not limited to this list.  The list of calculation articles is more extensive and is determined by the enterprise independently, depending on the nature of production.  However, the legislation proposed a standard nomenclature, including the following items: </p>

    <p>  Reducing the quantity of work in progress is useful in that it helps to accelerate its turnover, which, in turn, directly affects positively the turnover and profit.  This can be achieved by reducing the duration of one production cycle while optimizing production and labor in the enterprise.  At the same time, stocks in work in progress, their size and composition should be formed so as to ensure maximum uninterrupted operation and rhythm of the industrial process.  The definition of these quantities is called the valuation of work in progress. </p><p>  The standard of work in progress is the minimum amount of working capital, which is able to ensure continuous and uniform operation of the enterprise.  This value should always be available to the company.  For its calculation, the following formula exists: </p><ul><li>  WIP = Volume cf. x x Cycle length x Coeff.  growth, where: <br><br>  The volume sr.sut - the cost of production per day (in monetary terms); <br>  Cycle length - the duration of one production cycle (measured in days); <br>  Coefficient of increase - coefficient of increase in costs. </li></ul><p>  Thus, it is clear that the standard wage rate is directly proportional to the volume of production of the enterprise, the duration of the industrial cycle and the degree of increase in costs. </p><p>  Consider the contents of the formula in more detail. </p><p>  The average daily volume of output is determined by dividing the value of output per year by the number of working days in a year.  Obviously, the schedule of the enterprise directly affects the total amount. </p><p>  By cycle length is meant the time required for raw materials (materials) sent to production to be converted into finished products. </p><p>  The coefficient of increase shows the degree of readiness of products and is calculated using the ratio of the average cost of production to the production cost of GP. </p><ul><li>  Coef.  increase = Cost of production assets average.  : Cost of production </li></ul><p>  This is not all the information that may be required to calculate the necessary reserves in work in progress.  Experienced economists remember that understated volumes can cause the work to "rise", there will be a lack of resources, up to the inability of the enterprise to pay its obligations in a timely manner.  And the excess of stocks can lead to the fact that the funds that could "turn around" and generate income, will come into a state of "freezing".  Hence, losses, a decrease in profitability and an increase in the amount of various taxes paid are possible. </p><h2>  Unfinished production.  Asset or Liability? </h2><p>  NZP meets all the necessary criteria to be considered an asset - it is a resource (property) owned by the enterprise and capable of bringing tangible benefits in the future.  In turn, as we recall, the balance sheet asset is divided into two important parts: long-term (non-current) and short-term (current) funds. </p><p>  Work in progress is often one of the main components of working capital of an enterprise.  At the same time, work in progress is not separately displayed in the balance sheet of the enterprise.  Data on it is contained in the section "Current assets", the line "Inventories" (1210).  This line contains collective information about the following items: </p><ul><li>  inventories; </li><li>  deferred expenses (BPO); </li><li>  shipped goods; </li><li>  unfinished production; </li><li>  finished products; </li><li>  goods for resale; </li><li>  other stocks and costs. </li></ul><p>  For enterprises with a long production cycle, it is possible to display the wage in the section "Non-current assets". </p><p>  Work in progress in the balance sheet can be reflected in a separate line.  This happens if the cost of it is a significant amount.  You will also have to provide more detailed information in the appendix to the balance sheet and form 2 <span>‚ÄúReport on financial results‚Äù.</span> </p><h2>  WIP in the reporting of small businesses </h2><p>  Since 2013, some changes have been adopted regarding the procedure for providing financial statements.  New forms have also been developed.  The basic principles in them remained unchanged, as before, the <span>balance sheet is</span> divided into two halves: Asset and Liabilities, the results of which must coincide.  But for small businesses, a simplified form is now proposed, in which there are no sections, and the number of indicators is less than in the old one.  Such a company can independently decide for itself which reporting option to choose, having previously fixed its decision in the accounting policy. </p><p>  In the new form, as in the previous one, work in progress is an asset of the balance sheet; for it, there is still the line ‚ÄúInventory‚Äù.  Thus, both the name and the line code for small businesses have remained the same. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>      ,        .       , ,  ,       ,         . </p>
