    <p>  What are the causes of the Hundred Years War?  First of all, the dynastic claims of the British kings, closely related to the French Capetian dynasty, on the crown of France.  And secondly, the desire to achieve sovereignty over their continental possessions. </p><p>  How many people know about such an event in history as the <span>Hundred Years War?</span>  Grade 6, for example, dwells not only on the details of the reasons for the confrontation of countries involved in the conflict, but also studies the participants in military events, war heroes.  But after graduation, most people sometimes forget that history is an integral part of the human past, and without knowing it, you will not know the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How the British quarreled with the French </h2><p>  The years of the Hundred Years War between England and France - one thousand three hundred thirty-seventh - one thousand four hundred and fifty-third.  Then the French conquered Bordeaux.  In essence, this was not one continuous war, but several separate campaigns. </p><p>  The main reasons for the Hundred Years War and the irreconcilable contradictions between England and France are that the British kings in France owned significant territories.  Naturally, for the French it was a matter of elementary honor to regain these possessions. </p>

There the knights of England will be engaged not only in war.  They will begin to participate in robber raids, rob abbeys.  Capture captives, for which later you can get large ransoms.  In fact, the first stage of the Anglo-French war will be predatory. </p><p>  At first, active hostilities were not conducted.  And although Edward managed to conclude an alliance with the Flemish and Dutch emperors, they also did not break into battle.  Actually, the British army avoided direct clashes with the superior French army. </p><p>  There were even proposals to end the war in the old knightly way: to make a duel between two opposing monarchs.  The idea was wonderful, but the kings did not agree. </p><h2>  The first major battle of the warring monarchs </h2><p>  In one thousand three hundred and forty-six, the first major battle of this war took place.  Edward, along with his army, was squeezed near the small French town of Crecy.  The strength of the French army was many times greater than the army of Edward the Third.  In this difficult situation, the English ruler promoted his archer knights to the forefront. </p><p>  For a medieval battle strategy, this is a great innovation.  And it played a role.  Powerful bows actually destroyed the best parts of the French army - its cavalry.  This led to a completely phenomenal victory of the British at Crescy.  From that moment, Edward became a hero for his people and a famous commander.  And the French did not dare to go against him in an honest battle. </p><h2>  New participants in the events, or the signing of a peace treaty </h2>

    <p>  This part of the military campaign was interrupted by the plague epidemic that began in England and France, or, as it was called in the Middle Ages, the "black death".  According to recent studies, she "mowed" about one third of the entire population of Europe. </p><p>  In fact, the entire composition of the participants in the confrontation has changed.  English troops will now be led by Edward's son, nicknamed the Black Prince.  At the head of France is the new King John the Second Good. </p><p>  However, the French did not become easier.  Edward the Fourth as a general turned out to be much better than his father.  He inflicted a monstrous defeat on his enemies at Poitiers, in which the whole color of French chivalry almost perished.  Not so much the reasons for the Hundred Years War as its failures led to exacerbations of internal contradictions in France itself. </p><p>  Rebellions flare up.  The most famous of them is Jacquerie.  There, King John was captured, and this forced him to sign a peace with the British.  According to it, the island state received significant increments on the continent.  The ransom for the king was three million golden ecu.  At that time, the amount is absolutely incredible. </p><h2>  Hundred Years War.  Grade 6 meets the famous Orleans maiden </h2>

    <p>  King Charles the Fifth became John's successor.  However, the situation has not changed dramatically.  Suffering from the loss of its many provinces France.  The one hundred year war continues.  The British are still advancing, people are dying. </p><p>  The key moment of the confrontation between the two states was the siege of the opponents of Orleans.  It would seem that France died.  The city will fall, and there will be no one to defend it.  But it was at that moment that what the French today called a miracle happened.  This is the famous Orleans maiden, which many have known since school times.  In the sixth grade, the lessons of world history dwell in detail on her participation in this war. </p><h2>  The victory of a simple peasant girl </h2><p>  Joan of Arc came from an ordinary village family.  But the Hundred Years War, the events of which she became a witness, could not leave her indifferent.  She goes to the French king then to offer him her help. </p><p>  At court, a simple girl was first received with a fair amount of irony.  However, the situation became worse during the confrontation, and she was the only person who was ready to act in those conditions.  The king entrusts the army with a brave and selfless girl.  Something unnatural is happening!  The fine English generals are defeated by a simple peasant woman.  Jeanne D'Arc manages to defeat the army of England near Orleans, and now the French troops are conducting an offensive. </p><p>  When the main danger receded, they began to forget about Jeanne.  She stopped providing military and financial assistance.  And soon she was captured by her worst enemies.  The Orleans maiden was burned, but forever remained for France a hero and a savior. </p>

    <h2>  The end of the confrontation, or the long-awaited release of land </h2><p>  The performance of Jeanne D'Arc was a turning point during the battles.  Despite the death of the leader, the French continued to win.  And soon the war, which began so successfully for the British kingdom, ended for them in complete disaster.  The confrontation between the two states ended with the fact that the British were expelled from the continent. </p><p>  Whatever the reasons for the Hundred Years War, victory meant much more to the French than to the British.  Because they protected their own land.  From now on, England and France went in their development in different ways. </p>
