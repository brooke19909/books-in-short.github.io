Today, there are two positions regarding whether to consider any <span>social action as</span> interaction or not.  It can be assumed that only one of them can be considered an act of interaction that has received a response. </p><p>  This <span>form of communication</span> is very important because it contributes to the development of both an individual person and the whole system.  Alone, a person is not able to satisfy his needs, organize comfortable conditions for himself (not to mention the psychological need for interaction) and realize his intentions. </p><p>  Before starting a detailed review of social interaction, it is necessary to define the concept of interaction: this is a two-way process in which people influence each other. </p><p>  <strong>Forms of social interaction</strong> </p><p>  In modern science, there are three forms of this process: </p><ol><li>  Conflict.  In this case, the parties have opposite positions, and they secretly or openly conflict with each other. </li><li>  Competition.  Here, individuals are fighting among themselves for value or material wealth.  Such interaction does not imply open hostility on the basis of competition. </li><li>  Cooperation.  It is a creative form, which to a greater extent enriches both sides with experience, knowledge and often leads to a positive result.  Here, individuals work together to achieve a common goal. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Social interaction: conditions</strong> </p><p>  P. Sorokin identifies several conditions without which social interaction is impossible: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Possession <span>of the senses</span> and psyche.  Thanks to these means, individuals can understand what the other person feels with the help of verbal and non-verbal signs: gestures, voice intonation, facial expressions, etc. </li><li>  Using one character system.  To understand the thoughts and speech of another person, it is necessary that he set forth them in well-known expressions.  Speakers of different languages, of course, can also communicate, but this will be an inferior interaction, since the perception of each other may be distorted. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Social interaction: areas of implementation</strong> </p><p>  Depending on the sphere in which the elements interact, the experience gained depends.  There are many such areas, and we will single out the most extensive ones. </p><ol><li>  Political.  Here there is a confrontation or cooperation of representatives of the authorities or social movements. </li><li>  Economic.  Almost every person received this experience of social interaction, since here there is a connection between the employer and the employee. </li><li>  Professional.  Here people act primarily as representatives of different professions. </li><li>  Family  The most striking example is the interaction of relatives during the marriage of their children, when one family connects with another and acquaintance with traditions takes place. </li><li>  Religious  Relationship with representatives of different religions or atheists. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Social interaction: types</strong> </p><p>  Three types of social interaction are possible: </p><ol><li>  Ideological exchange.  People provide each other with various kinds of information, including their own thoughts and objective facts. </li><li>  Volitional exchange.  In this case, individuals coordinate their actions in order to achieve a common goal. </li><li>  Exchange of feelings.  Here, the emotional sphere encourages people to interact when they rally or disconnect based on their emotional feelings. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Social interaction: types</strong> </p><p>  The types of contact depend on how it is implemented: </p><ol><li>  Verbal interaction (using words). </li><li>  Nonverbal (using facial expressions and gestures). </li><li>  Physical </li></ol>
