    <h2>  Call center </h2><p>  To return an erroneous payment, it is not necessary to go to the office of the company.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to contact the call center.  Here, of course, they will check it.  To this end, the operator will ask you a few questions.  And to answer these questions intelligibly, you need to save the check. </p><p>  Sometimes they may ask for passport data.  Do not be scared.  After a short period of time, if the operator is satisfied that you are right, the money will go to the desired number.  In the Beeline call-center, they will be guaranteed to be able to help you only if the amount of the erroneous payment does not exceed 200 rubles. </p><p>  When you call the call center, you must wait until all items of the automatic menu are voiced.  After that, you will be connected to an operator who will help in solving this issue.  If the line is currently overloaded, you will have to wait until the operator is free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  By the way, you can call the subscriber service in case of other problems.  The call center number is 0611. It works exclusively for Beeline mobile numbers.  From a landline phone or from the operator‚Äôs number of another network, you can reach the call center by the number given on the official website of the described operator.  You can ask for help in returning an erroneous payment to Beeline even from abroad, while roaming. </p><p>  All calls are free within the network.  The exception is only calls from SIM cards of foreign operators or landlines located in other countries.  In this case, you will have to pay for the call at a rate that is provided by the operator of another country.  During the conversation, recording is made, and in case of inappropriate behavior of an employee of the Beeline call center, you can file a complaint against him. </p><h2>  Auto Service </h2><p>  An erroneous payment in Beeline can be canceled even without contacting the call center operator.  Automatic service will help to return the amount up to 3 000 rubles.  And you can use the service by dialing number 07222. </p><p>  By the way, you can automatically activate the special service ‚ÄúAuto Payment‚Äù from Beeline.  This service is good in that it will save the subscriber from errors in some way.  He will not forget and confuse the numbers, since the required amount will be debited from the card at a certain moment.  This is also a great way to avoid red tape with the return of money sent by mistake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  USSD team </h2><p>  To avoid contacts with Beeline offices and significantly save time, you can use just a special USSD-team to return funds.  This command is * 788 #.  Convenient, fast, simple.  Beeline has such a huge number of such teams.  All of them facilitate cooperation with this company, reducing almost all the necessary queries to a set of characters that you only need to enter and click on the "call". </p><h2>  The official website of Beeline </h2><p>  On the official website of the company, you can also return an erroneous payment to Beeline.  This can be done in a special subsection or easier - by the link provided here.  Also on this site you can find the current numbers of support services and various teams, if already known do not work. </p><p>  Before starting work, you must not forget to indicate the correct region and locality, if there is one in the list, since the site automatically issues only a Moscow page. </p>

    <h2>  Transfer to number </h2><p>  As you can see, everything is simple.  But to transfer money to the desired number, if the payment amount exceeded 3,000 rubles, the ‚Äúnon-contact‚Äù method will not work.  This is the policy of the company.  To transfer to a number in this case, you need to fill out an application, a sample of which can be obtained at any Beeline office.  It is necessary to attach a check to it.  Among other things, the application must include both the correct passport data of the owner of the number and the erroneous number to which the payment was made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Social networks </h2><p>  You can even ask for help in returning money spent to another phone number through social networks.  This is done in official Beeline groups.  Such assistance can be used by every Russian or foreigner owning the number of the named operator, if he is registered on VKontakte, Facebook or Odnoklassniki. </p><h2>  Refund </h2><p>  How to return an erroneous payment with real money?  To do this, it is best to contact the Beeline service center.  The fact is that it is not always possible to return money without leaving home.  Such categories, as already mentioned, include the amount sent erroneously, which exceeds 3,000 rubles, or the number, the code of which begins with 6. </p><p>  Also, it will not work to return the money automatically if the erroneous payment was made by accident not at Beeline.  At the office, employees will give you a sample application.  In the case of bank transfer, full details must be indicated.  Of course, this refers to the card with which the payment was made. </p>

    <p>  The application can be downloaded, filled out and scanned.  The scan along with the scan of the check will need to be sent to the official website of the company in a special section.  After consideration, the transfer of money to the card is the same as for a personal visit to the office.  They will have to go for cash, because no one will bring them home. </p><p>  In general, the return occurs in the same way as the replenishment.  If the replenishment is made in cash, then cash will be returned, if an erroneous payment was made to Beeline from a credit card, electronic money. </p><p>  You can return the money in the same way, only online by writing an email to the company‚Äôs email.  To do this, you need to scan the completed (taken on the Beeline website) application, attaching a scanned receipt to it.  This e-mail address is listed on the official website of the operator. </p><h2>  Return Dates </h2><p>  Keep in mind that immediately at the time of treatment you can not get money back.  The transfer of an erroneous Beeline payment can be expected within 2 weeks from the moment of appeal.  But, as a rule, more than 4 days for this is not required. </p><p>  If, for any reason, a refund has not occurred, you need to seek help from company employees.  To do this, you need to contact the call center and ask to check the status of the payment. </p>

    <h2>  Invalid Recipient </h2><p>  When you receive money on your phone account, it‚Äôs not known from whom and from where, not everyone begins to rejoice and spend it frantically.  In the event of such an incident, it would indeed be correct to wait a while.  Perhaps the person who made a mistake will call and ask for a refund. </p><p>  If there is no financial or any other possibility at the moment, then still try to provide all possible assistance to the person who made the mistake and not to impede the return of the entire amount.  If there is no call for a long time, no office will tell you where the money came from.  Then we can consider these funds as our own and safely use them. </p><p>  Try to be responsible and meet the person.  In this situation, anyone can be, including you and your loved ones.  The return of an erroneous Beeline payment can be made without leaving home.  To replenish the account of other subscribers (both Beeline and other operators) there is a special service called Mobile Payment.  With its help, you can transfer money to mobile phone accounts even abroad, but only to numbers registered in the CIS. </p><p>  Moreover, this service can be used even for other purposes, using the phone balance as real money.  But some people are afraid to send money back from the phone to avoid getting into the scheme of scammers.  If there is such a fear, ask the person to issue an erroneous payment and do not send anything back.  But at the same time, do not spend the amount that "fell" on the SIM card from strangers. </p>

    <h2>  When the money will not be returned </h2><p>  Money will not be returned if there is already no money left on the account of the erroneous recipient.  If part of the money is spent, then the rest will be returned.  There will be no future returns after replenishment of the account of the wrong number by the subscriber himself.  Remember that this is still your mistake. </p><p>  Also, the interest that was taken in case of an erroneous payment to Beeline by Qiwi or another payment system will not be returned.  Only what comes to Beeline will return.  And if you apply later than 2 weeks after the transaction or any other payment, it will be too late, and the funds will not be returned to your pocket either.  Timely handling in such a situation can save your money and nerves. </p><p>  Non-return will be in case of an error a number of more than 2 digits.  Sometimes money back schemes are used by scammers.  For example, the well-known SMS ‚Äúput money to this number‚Äù, indicating that some person is in trouble, often works, although it would seem that everyone knows about this ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù. </p><p>  Thus, fraudsters, collecting a certain amount on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù SIM card, withdraw funds, and the company does not have time to return everything to a bona fide customer.  Therefore, it is necessary to check the numbers when replenishing several times, especially when it comes to large amounts! </p><p>  A hacker attack is never ruled out.  Indeed, in the courtyard is the century of advanced technologies.  In an attack by criminals, it is also impossible to claim back from Beeline.  In this case, you need to contact the competent authorities of the executive branch. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  Often there are negative reviews of Beeline subscribers who cannot return their money.  This is due to the fact that they are poorly acquainted with the refund technology and with the user agreement.  Someone is dissatisfied with the fact that the money did not come back at all, someone - that the funds were partially returned. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the Beeline company is not able to control the mistakes of subscribers, and if the money was sent to numbers with a negative balance, then this is the work of the sender himself.  The return rules are clearly defined, and company employees cannot do anything beyond their competence.  Therefore, you need to carefully replenish the account, trying not to make annoying mistakes. </p><p>  Wrong payment may be asked to pick up dishonest acquaintances.  Therefore, no one needs to give their details.  In such cases, too, unfortunately, people blame Beeline.  But this, again, is a person‚Äôs own mistake. </p><p>  As you can see, most ways to return money do not provide direct contact with Beeline employees.  This greatly saves time and nerves.  Still, making an erroneous payment to Beeline on the Internet or in other ways is an unpleasant situation.  But Beeline is always happy to meet its subscribers in order to solve problems and extend cooperation. </p>
