For children, the hotel has a children's room with toys. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Vigo Panorama 4 * (Bulgaria, Nessebar) has a good infrastructure.  On its territory there are several shops, a currency exchange office, a spa, a fitness room, a nightclub, dry cleaning, laundry, an indoor and outdoor pool.  In addition, the hotel has a business unit consisting of two rooms (halls can accommodate 120 and 20 people).  Such a conference room with all necessary equipment is convenient for seminars and business meetings. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Nessebar is considered to be a true pearl of Bulgaria, since incredible architectural monuments have been preserved in it.  It is located on the peninsula, a little north of Burgas.  Nessebar is one of the most ancient cities in Europe.  It is believed that his story began three millennia ago.  Every year archaeologists make new discoveries of ancient cultures.  Nessebar is even included in the UNESCO list. </p><p>  The old part of the city in general can be considered a miracle.  She went under water a couple of centuries ago, and on land there was only a small part of it, on which all the temples are concentrated.  Until now, the underwater part of the city is clearly visible from the boat in calm weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vigo panorama 4 nessebar bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1511648.jpg" width="600"></div>

Confirmation of this is the ‚ÄúBlue Flag‚Äù, which was awarded the local coast. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  When planning a vacation in Vigo 4 * (Nessebar, Bulgaria) (photos are given in the article), it is worth considering how to get to the hotel.  You can pay for the transfer, the complex provides a similar service.  And you can get it yourself.  The nearest train station or airport is in Burgas (thirty kilometers from Nessebar).  From it to Nessebar can be reached by bus.  The journey takes approximately forty minutes.  In addition, you can take a bus to the famous Sunny Beach, and then transfer to Nessebar.  You can also take a taxi, but it costs more than public transport. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in Nessebar, you should definitely break away from a beach holiday and spend some time sightseeing and just interesting places.  As, we have already mentioned, the city is divided into two parts: the new and the old.  It is the ancient part that is of most interest to tourists.  It is located on a small peninsula and is connected to the land by a small isthmus.  The ancient city has a unique atmosphere created by medieval churches, ramparts, the ancient port, old houses with wooden stairs. </p><p>  It is the churches that are considered the main attractions of the city.  Each of them has its own unique architecture.  The oldest is the Metropolitan Church of St. Stephen.  According to legend, it was built on the ruins of the temple of Apollo.  The church has perfectly preserved frescoes, an iconostasis, a department and the throne of the bishop. </p><p>  One of the most beautiful in Bulgaria is the Church of Christ Pantocrator.  It surprises with its rich forms and inlay.  Currently, there is an art gallery.  Also of interest is the church of St. Paraskeva. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vigo hotel 4 bulgaria nessebar" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1511649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An ancient windmill and a Turkish bath are no less interesting for visitors to the city.  Ethnographic and archaeological museums operate in Nessebar.  In them you can see coins, gold jewelry, black curly ceramics of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. </p><p>  In Nessebar there are also natural attractions, for example, the White Cliffs and natural dunes (their height is 7-8 meters).  The city has not only historical places, but also entertaining ones.  Tourists will certainly enjoy the water parks and Luna Park, they can be reached by free buses.  The city has an incredible number of restaurants and cafes where you can eat. </p><h2>  Historical monuments </h2><p>  In the city you can see the Amphitheater, which is characterized by unusual picturesqueness.  Here you can admire the beautiful sea view from above.  In the evenings, locals often hold concerts here, such as dance and song festivals.  Another important attraction is the Turkish Fountain, built during the era of Turkish rule.  Hamams have also survived.  It cannot be said that these remnants of the past are something incredible, but these are the only buildings that survived after the centuries-old rule of the Turks.  In the city you can see the Byzantine baths built in the sixth century.  Already in those distant times, a real water supply system was laid across Nessebar, through which residents received water.  And in the baths there was a large relaxation room with several pools.  It is believed that this place was once visited by Emperor Constantine IV.  The baths were so arranged that in different rooms it was possible to maintain different temperatures, which made it possible for people to enjoy contrasting baths.  Such ancient buildings are amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Vigo 4 Nessebar Bulgaria" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1511658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We have brought only a few interesting places that active tourists can visit.  In fact, there are many more, so you can always find something new, unknown. </p><h2>  Hotel Vigo Panorama 4 * (Nessebar, Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of guests who have already managed to relax in it.  This will help us form a more reliable opinion about him.  Should I buy a tour to the hotel Vigo 4 * (Nessebar, Bulgaria)?  Reviews of tourists about the complex are a bit contradictory, but in general it can be said that it has a great location, the road to the beach does not take even more than five minutes at a very slow pace.  The hotel is located near a seaside park, and then from its windows you can enjoy a picturesque view of the sea, alleys with benches.  It takes no more than ten minutes to go from the complex to the old city; the same way takes the road to the new city.  The hotel is located between these areas in a quiet and peaceful place.  Nearby are supermarkets and shops.  You can leave the building not only on the promenade near the sea, but also on the opposite side, where the shopping street is located.  Some of the rooms in the complex are private apartments, representing separate apartments.  In Bulgaria, this practice is very common. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vigo panorama 4 bulgaria nessebar" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1511652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Vigo 4 * (Nessebar, Bulgaria) consists of several buildings, the main building is a four-star complex, and the other two have only three stars.  Fundamentally, the differences in the interiors or apartments are not visible.  Check-in at the hotel takes place at two o‚Äôclock, if you arrive earlier, you can just leave things and go for a walk.  The hotel has a nice room background.  The apartments are clean, well maintained.  Maids are cleaned daily, towels are changed every other day, but bed linen is replaced once every three to four days. </p><p>  In front of the hotel there are two beaches, one of them is wild, and the second is ordinary with paid umbrellas and sunbeds.  In season, there are a lot of people on the coast. </p><p>  As for food, not all vacationers are satisfied with it.  Tourists may choose their own acceptable food option (All inclusive, breakfast or half board).  Since the apartments have kitchenettes, you can always cook your own meals.  In addition, there are many cafes near the complex, which deliciously cook seafood and other dishes.  Therefore, there are no problems with nutrition. </p><p>  According to some guests, the hotel buffet is not very diverse, but overall the food is good and of high quality.  Every day tourists are served with fish, meat, fruits, side dishes, salads.  Sometimes queues are formed in the restaurant due to inconveniently organized distribution of food.  To avoid queues, you should arrive early. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vigo 4 nessebar bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1511654.jpg" width="600"></div>
