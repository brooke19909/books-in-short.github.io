This is due not only to the deterioration of the quality of the picture, but also to the large financial costs of repairs.  But not everything is so sad.  Large cracks cannot be removed on their own, but it is quite possible to mask minor scratches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove a scratch from the LCD TV screen" class="if uuid-3125053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125053.jpg"></div><h2>  Causes of Scratches </h2><p>  There may be scratches on the flat screen TV for various reasons.  The most common are: </p><ol><li>  Improper use, especially for small televisions that can be installed near objects that could damage the screen.  Pets can also cause scratches, so it‚Äôs best to install the equipment in places inaccessible to pets. </li><li>  Improper care, in particular the use of coarse sponges, abrasive detergents with powder particles or those that are not suitable for glass surfaces due to their aggressiveness. </li></ol><p>  Regardless of the cause of the damage, you can try to disguise it.  But before you remove the scratches from the TV screen, the device must be de-energized. </p><h2>  Removing scratches with alcohol </h2><p>  A method is suitable for repairing only minor damage.  To work, you need to prepare: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  distilled water (filtered water is also suitable); </li><li>  microfiber fabric; </li><li>  isopropyl alcohol (you can take ethyl alcohol, but in this case you need to use a smaller amount). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="homequicks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove scratches from a plasma TV screen" class="if uuid-3125066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125066.jpg"></div><p>  Before removing scratches from the TV screen, dilute 5 ml of ethanol in 100 ml of water.

For this purpose, you can use only white paste, color gel does not have such an effect.  For this we need: </p><ul><li>  diluted alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl); </li><li>  lint-free fabric, better microfiber; </li><li>  Toothpaste; </li><li>  cotton swab; </li><li>  petroleum jelly. </li></ul><p>  Next, proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Before removing scratches from the TV screen, the surface must be degreased.  Diluted alcohol will do just fine with this task.  Before further processing, wipe the screen dry with a lint-free cloth. </li><li>  Now you can apply toothpaste.  It is better to do this not with your hands, but with a small napkin (not paper, fabric).  You can‚Äôt push on the screen.  The paste needs to be rubbed on a scratch.  After processing, wipe the screen again with a dry cloth, which will remove excess paste. <div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to remove scratches from the TV screen" class="if uuid-3125078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125078.jpg"></div></li><li><p>  Next, you need to fix the result with Vaseline, for which you need a small amount. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  At the end, you can polish the screen with a dry cloth. </p></li></ol><h2>  Is it possible to remove scratches from the TV screen with an eraser? </h2><p>  This method is considered simple, effective, but it requires maximum caution, since it is impossible to press on the LCD screen.  Use only the white eraser.  It should be soft and new.  The advantage of the method lies in the fact that it allows you to remove surface scratches and deeper ones, but only subject to the instructions.  And she is like this: </p><ol><li>  Before removing scratches from the TV screen, it must be cleaned using purified water or a special product. </li><li>  Wait for the screen to dry completely. </li><li>  To polish the screen with an eraser, the movements should be soft, light.  During this periodically it is recommended to remove the remaining gum from the surface of the screen with a rag.  This allows you to evaluate the result. </li><li>  At the end, the screen must be polished with a dry, lint-free cloth. </li></ol><h2>  How to remove a scratch from <span>the LCD TV screen</span> with Vaseline? </h2><p>  Vaseline in this case performs two functions at once: it fills a scratch and polishes the screen.  You can achieve the desired effect using the following tools: </p><ul><li>  distilled water; </li><li>  lint-free tissue (preferably microfiber); </li><li>  petroleum jelly. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from the led tv screen at home" class="if uuid-3125129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125129.jpg"></div><p>  The operation itself should be performed in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  First you need to clean the surface of the screen.  Distilled water is suitable for this. </li><li>  You can proceed to this stage only after the screen has completely dried.  It is necessary to apply petroleum jelly only on a scratch. </li><li>  Leave it to dry for 5-7 minutes, after which the remnants of the product can be removed with a microfiber cloth. </li></ol><p>  Before you remove the scratches from the LCD TV screen at home, you should prepare everything you need.  In addition, you need to remember that the effect will be short-lived.  The thing is that over time, the petroleum jelly is wiped away, which means that it will need to be applied to the damaged place again and again. </p><h2>  Using professional tools </h2><p>  Together with the purchase of a <span>TV with a liquid crystal screen,</span> it is recommended that you immediately purchase special tools that are needed for care and local repair.  The most popular are the following: </p><ol><li>  Novus Plastic Polish.  This paste is intended not only for <span>polishing plastic,</span> but also for removing scratches from the screen of a flat TV.  The composition does not contain abrasive and aggressive chemicals.  In addition to removing scratches, this tool also serves for polishing.  To use it must be applied to a piece of lint-free cloth.  After that, the surface is wiped with a rag in smooth circular movements. </li><li>  Displex Display.  The tool can be used to remove scratches from glossy and glass surfaces.  To apply it to the damaged area, you can use a cotton swab.  You need to rub the screen until the scratch is completely masked (the product does not remove the defect, but visually masks it). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from the LCD TV screen at home" class="if uuid-3125099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125099.jpg"></div><h2>  LCD TV Care </h2><p>  You can prevent defects from appearing on the TV screen by proper care.  This allows you to not think about how to remove scratches from the screen of an LED TV at home for a long time.  First of all, this refers to the used cleansers.  You can do this: </p><ol><li>  Special liquid products that do not include alcohol.  They remove all types of contamination, while not leaving stains and spots, and also have an antistatic effect, which will prevent dust from settling, which means the possibility of scratches; </li><li>  Soft lint-free napkins that can absorb all moisture and dust. </li></ol><p>  Wipe the TV screen with a damp cloth and dry.  In this case, you always need to move from top to bottom, excluding any pressure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD TV care" class="if uuid-3125244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31616/3125244.jpg"></div><p>  A positive effect from the funds used can be obtained only in case of strict adherence to the instructions.  Therefore, it is recommended that before you remove the scratches from the TV screen (plasma or not), try out the method on small surfaces in order to verify its correctness and effectiveness.  In some cases, it is more advisable to contact specialists, especially if the equipment is under warranty. </p>
