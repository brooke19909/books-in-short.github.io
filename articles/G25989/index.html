And a vivid example of this is Beidaihe.  For a long time, China closed this area from foreigners, since it is three hundred kilometers from Beijing, and the communist elite of the country liked to spend their holidays there, and Mao Zedong himself.  But now these places are beginning to be visited by tourists from all over the world, including from Russia. </p><p>  What is Beidaihe famous for?  China as a state owes much to these places.  In addition, there are good and wide sandy beaches with high dunes on the Yellow Sea, where the high season is summer time.  And in winter, the region turns into a ski resort. </p>

    <h2>  How to get tours </h2><p>  The closest major city to the Beidaihe area of ​​China is Qinshihuandao, Hebei Province.  This region is located on the shore of the <span>Gulf of Bohai,</span> stretching along the sea for 11 kilometers.  Independent travelers get here through Beijing or Harbin.  There you can catch a train or bus to Beidaihe. </p><p>  Shuttle buses run from <span>Beijing</span> Capital <span>Airport</span> to the resort.  You can get to Beidaihe in two hours by high-speed train.  But the fact is that the railway station is located 15 kilometers from the center of the sea resort.  Therefore, you will need to go further by taxi or bus.  The organized tour in Beidaihe will cost the average tourist from 6 thousand rubles for 7-8 days of stay at the two stars hotel.  In a three-star hotel it will cost from 10 thousand rubles, and in a four-star hotel - from 15 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and weather Beidaihe </h2><p>  The high summer season, as in many sea resorts, lasts from May to October.  But the climate of the region, which is moderately humid, provides an influx of tourists here all year round. </p><p>  The most comfortable months for sea bathing are July and August.  The weather in Beidaihe then stands just for sunbathing - the air temperature is 30-33 degrees above zero, and the water temperature is 25-27.  It rains, but this is a very rare occurrence for the last two summer months. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The most important historical place in Beidaihe (China) is the sea a few kilometers from the resort.  Here is the beginning of the Great Wall, which in this place goes into the water for 23 meters.  Here you can see the bastions and fortifications of this ancient outpost of China, as well as the home of the defenders of the Wall.  This place is called the Dragon Head.  The fact is that the view of the wall going into the sea causes many people to associate with a tired snake that fell asleep on the shore. </p><p>  And in the city itself, the palace of the famous emperor Qin-shi-huangdi was preserved.  After all, it was during his time that the Great Wall of China was built.  There is also a museum dedicated to him. </p><p>  In addition, in Beidaihe (China) is also one of the largest zoos in the country like “safari” where animals live almost in natural conditions, without aviaries.  On its territory there are many children's attractions, as well as performances by exotic artists from Africa.  The kids like the water park, dolphinarium and oceanarium, where you can watch funny shows, as well as watch the feeding of sharks and moray eels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  Beidaihe (China) is located on the <span>Yellow Sea.</span>  There are beautiful bays and beaches that are surrounded by green trees and grass.  There are three recreation areas at sea: </p><ul><li>  The first is called Central Beach.  This is the most popular coast among tourists.  There are many cafes, restaurants and entertainment. </li><li>  The Central and Western beaches are not far behind, but since good infrastructure appeared here not so long ago, there are still not too many people. </li><li>  The “wildest” coast is the High Mountain region.  It is here that you can see Chinese fishermen engaged in traditional fishing. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  A lot of sanatoriums and hospitals were built in the named area in former times.  But in recent years, the number of hotels has been growing here.  Beidaihe (China) is mainly built up with hotels of three and four stars, and there are almost no huge palaces like in Hainan.  And the infrastructure here is not so developed, due to the fact that the resort is relatively new.  Therefore, prices here are lower, especially at the beginning and end of the high season. </p><p>  Nevertheless, as we have seen, the resort has a water park, attractions for children, and a dolphinarium.  As a rule, the price of hotel accommodation includes breakfast, sometimes quite modest, sometimes characterized by a variety of dishes. </p><p>  The most popular hotels include the Druzhba hotel, which consists of the main building and 40 villas surrounded by a garden, and has its own beach and disco club.  There is a huge park, fresh healing air.  The hotel was built back in the 50s for Soviet specialists, but modernized. </p><p>  The Hotel of Diplomats has a good reputation, located close to both the sea and shopping streets.  It has 13 buildings, many restaurants, a good gym. </p><p>  The Open Hotel is suitable for shoppers, as it is a three-minute walk from shopping centers.  She does not have her own beach, but not far from the city.  Near the sea there are such hotels as Golden Mountain, Golden Sea and Golden Sand.  But the ground floors in these hotels are humid. </p>
