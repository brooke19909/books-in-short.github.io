  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to call Germany</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Federal Republic of Germany is a fairly large state located east of Russia in central Europe.  What connects us with this country and why does the question of how to call Germany very often become relevant? </p><p>  Let's try to answer this question. </p><p>  First of all, the country code Germany is needed when, due to some circumstances, you are forced to maintain contact with someone who is constantly there.  Although, in fact, why are forced?  You may well be united by issues of business, tourism, the presence of relatives, friends or friends who emigrated there in due time. </p><p>  The necessary call can be made in several quite acceptable ways. </p><p>  <strong>Option 1. How to call Germany from a landline phone</strong> </p><p>  To do this is generally very simple.  All that is needed is to know the code of the destination country.  Scrolling through the telephone directory or searching in the virtual space, in a matter of seconds we find out that the international code for the direction we need is 49. </p><p>  Now the dialing order: </p><ol><li>  Well, of course, first we recruit the familiar “8” </li><li>  Now "10".  This set of numbers is used when we need to go international. </li><li>  Code of the country.  As we have already found out, this is "49". </li><li>  City code.  For example, for Berlin it is “30”, “27712” is the Dillenburg code;  “351” - the code of Dresden;  “40” is the Hamburg code;  "511" - the code of Hanover;  “8685” is the Kirkenshoring code.  In general, the number denoting this same code is usually inversely proportional to the size of the city.  Those.  I want to say that the largest cities in Germany are assigned two-digit numbers, but the tiny villages get four-digit numeric codes. </li><li>  And only now you can safely dial the subscriber number.  Those.  if we call, say, the capital of the state, we need to dial the following: 8-10-49-30 - ********, where I marked with the “stars” the number of that person (company, company, organization), with which we need to contact. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Option 2. <span>How to call Germany</span> from a landline phone while in the country</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You have already arrived in the country and now you need to contact relatives or business partners?  This is also not at all difficult to do.  The procedure is almost the same as in the previous case, only instead of the international “10”, after the set “8”, you need to immediately dial the Germany or city code and phone number. </p><p>  I’ll give an example of what the dialing format should look like. </p><p>  Take 8-0-30 - ********, where “30” is the capital code, and with “asterisks” I again indicated the subscriber number. </p><p>  <strong>Option 3. How to call Germany from a mobile phone</strong> </p><p>  In this case, the dialing order does not depend on which country you are in.  The only thing I would like to immediately warn is that the tariffs for such calls are quite expensive.  It depends on the policy of your mobile operator, so before you make such a call or go on a trip abroad, find out how much such communication will cost you. </p><p>  Sometimes it is generally considered more expedient to purchase on-site cards of a local telephone operator. </p><p>  So, in fact, you need to dial a number in the same way as if you were calling from a landline phone while in the Federal Republic. </p><p>  Those.  8-0-30 - ********, where “30” is the capital code, and with “asterisks” I again indicated the subscriber number. </p><p>  <strong>Option 4. How to call Germany using the Internet, skype, social networks</strong> </p><p>  Some social networks, for example, the notorious Odnoklassniki.ru, Vkontakte.ru, Mail.ru offer to make calls to Germany, Canada, the USA or any other country in the world.  If you call on the same computer, but located somewhere else, then the fee is not charged at all. </p><p>  But in terms of calls to mobile or landline it is better to find out about tariffs.  This is generally cheaper. </p><p>  Personally, I prefer to use Skype.  Why?  First of all, of course, due to the relatively low cost of this type of communication. </p><p>  For example, one minute of conversation (to a landline or mobile number, in this case it does not matter) costs me 1.9 cents. </p><p>  In the event that you maintain relations with this country regularly, it is recommended to join a special plan, then 400 minutes of conversation per month will cost only 3.49 dollars, and an unlimited package is even more profitable - 4.99 dollars per month. </p>
