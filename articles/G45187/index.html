But, it turns out, the problem is only that many people simply do not understand the essence of the problem.  In fact, the synchronization process is very simple and straightforward.  The article details how to connect an Apple TV to the TV.  Simple Russian language, without the use of terminology so complex and incomprehensible to most readers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prefix Apple TV" class="if uuid-3220264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220264.jpg"></div><h2>  Apple tv </h2><p>  You will be surprised, but Apple produces very simple and intuitive devices.  Therefore, any user, even the most incompetent in the matter of how to connect an Apple TV to the TV, can easily and immediately figure out what's what. </p><p>  Based on the parameters of universality, Apple produces the most versatile devices in the world, compatible with almost any interface.  And now let's move on to viewing its immediate capabilities: </p><ol><li>  The ability to synchronize various peripheral devices, for example, a player, speakers, CD \ DVD devices, to create a multimedia complex. </li><li>  An application for playing iTunes music files. </li><li>  Ability to view clips / films in very high resolution. </li><li>  View content online. </li><li>  Displaying images from a smartphone, tablet and other gadgets on which operating system the device is located does not matter. </li><li>  Get access to many video games. </li></ol><p>  Apple devices are conditionally divided into 4 generations, there is a line running Mac OS X Tige - these gadgets are called the debut line.  The second generation of devices from the American giant is running iOS.  Early generation smart boxes can only play streaming power.  This is due to the fact that they do not have a hard drive with a large capacity, so storage on the hard drive is completely excluded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A5 and 8 GB are built-in processors that are used for variable storage of information before transmission.  But an advantage follows from this drawback: it allows iTunes to watch any content in the very high resolution that is possible today.  At the same time with a very distinct sound, without the presence of noise and wave interference, with high speed, almost without delay. </p><p>  The latest generation models have in their arsenal 32 and 64 MB of internal RAM.  The new generation has only two lines, the latest release can use all applications from the App Store service to work.  Like all Apple devices, there is a smart, savvy voice assistant Siri.  Even he is able to find you instructions on how to connect your Apple TV to your TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple TV setup menu" class="if uuid-3220263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220263.jpg"></div><p>  After you connect a peripheral device, the useful functionality of your TV will expand significantly, and several times.  To use data and applications from your smartphone and computer, you need to use a special application that allows you to perform such actions.  Then there is a synchronization of two devices, all this is controlled by a special remote control.  Usually it is included in the package upon purchase.  If not, then below you can read how to connect an Apple TV to a TV without a remote control.  You can also use to control any gadget running the operating system iOS 7 or higher by several steps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Apple TV is connected to the TV via HDMI output and via Wi-fi, there is no other way.  It is best to use a wired device: this gives you more opportunities to use the interface and applications that are compatible with the console.  If you use a Wi-fi network, then you will not be able to use iTunes.  Here is a list of the necessary items to connect: </p><ol><li>  TV with HDMI. </li><li>  The HDMI cable itself. </li><li>  Internet access point. </li><li>  Prefix from Apple. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HDMI for connecting Apple TV" class="if uuid-3220270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220270.jpg"></div><p>  In the basic kit there is only a remote control, cable and charger.  The HDMI adapter will have to be purchased separately. </p><h2>  The essence of the process </h2><div class="photo" data-original="simplymac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Setting up Apple TV using the remote" class="if uuid-3220266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220266.jpg"></div><p>  How to connect Apple TV to a TV, Samsung, for example: </p><ol><li>  We connect the HDMI cable to the device, and the other end, respectively, to the console. </li><li>  The power cable is connected to the network, and then we connect the wire to the outlet, and nothing else. </li><li>  Next, pick up the remote control, select the HDMI signal. </li></ol><p>  Maybe your TV does not see the device?  Yes, this can happen, but this is only because one of the cords is in a malfunctioning state.  The second reason is customization.  It can also happen that you simply messed up all the connectors: double-check and repeat the whole procedure again.  It does not take a lot of time. </p><h2>  Customize via iPhone </h2><p>  All smartphones from Apple support the device management function of their brand: there is a special option iBeacon.  So, to configure the console, do the following: </p><ol><li>  We connect all the cables, plug it into the network. </li><li>  Come with the phone to the device, then move about 15-20 centimeters. </li><li>  A prompt appears on your screen to begin setting up the device, click "yes." </li><li>  Enter the login and password for authorization in the network (ID). </li><li>  Next, the screen will display ‚Äúsave setup ID‚Äù and permission to send reports on the operation of the device. </li><li>  We answer all the questions that will appear on our screen. </li><li>  Setup has begun, we are waiting for its completion. </li></ol><p>  This procedure on average takes up to 5 minutes inclusive.  To configure through other devices, they must have iOS 9.1.  The main thing is that the device has Bluetooth and WI-FI networks turned on.  These same wireless networks will tell you how to connect your Apple TV to a TV without HDMI.  And you will easily implement your plan. </p><h2>  Setup, instruction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple TV back" class="if uuid-3220267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220267.jpg"></div><p>  How to connect Apple TV to 4k TV?  We turn on the device and, if before this the connection was successful, then we will see a menu in which you can configure the device for yourself. </p><p>  By clicking on the touch panel we connect the remote control to work. </p><p>  The remote helps us to configure at the very beginning, we need to select the user's language, its region and connect the voice assistant system.  Next, enter the password.  Remember that the inclusion of the voice assistant program can only be in devices of 4 generations, on earlier devices this option is completely absent, so do not have false illusions. </p><p>  After the first connection, you need to activate your accounts on the device.  For example, this could be an iTunes account. </p><h2>  Explanations for connecting with the system remote control </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Watching Apple TV on a 4K TV" class="if uuid-3220268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96119/3220268.jpg"></div><p>  Synchronization starts by clicking on the touch control panel on the remote control itself, in case of a malfunction, press simultaneously the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù and ‚Äúturn up the volume‚Äù, hold it in this state for at least 5 seconds.  A "long distance" will appear on the screen (between the two gadgets, of course), then you just need to put the remote control to the console. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We hope you understand how to connect your Apple TV to your TV.  At this point, the procedure for connecting and setting up can be considered complete.  You get access to files in high resolution.  Everything is simple and convenient.  If there is another technique from this manufacturer, then synchronize other devices together, it takes 5 minutes, do not complicate the very easy procedure. </p><p>  Guided by the above, you can easily customize the device to your needs without resorting to outside help. </p>
