What do people usually do in such cases?  They try to get a loan from a trusted bank.  But this does not always end happily.  In some cases, it is difficult to get approval for a loan.  Some banks do not allow them to those who have not yet reached twenty-one years.  There can be many obstacles, but the main ones are still extremely unfavorable credit conditions that drive borrowers into new debts.  <span>Where can I get a loan</span> without running into problems?  Many people who want to get a loan apply to Post Bank and continue their cooperation with him even after the loan has been paid.  What so attracts customers in obtaining a loan, a card at the Post Bank?  Reviews will help to get an answer to all these questions.  So, what is the bank in question?  How is the early repayment of the loan in the "Post Bank"?  Are most customer reviews positive or negative?  What do borrowers not like in cooperation with the bank in question?  How difficult is it to take a cash loan at the Post Bank?  Customer reviews on this subject will be discussed later in this article.  Be careful. </p>

    <h2>  About the bank </h2><p>  Pochta Bank is a fairly young financial and credit institution, which was founded only in January 2016.  The creators of the bank are VTB Group and FSUE Russian Post.  The services provided by the bank in question are reduced to the following list: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Opening and maintenance of a savings account. </li><li>  Create time deposits. </li><li>  Making payments and transfers. </li><li>  Internet banking. </li><li>  Mobile Bank </li><li>  Opening a retirement account. </li><li>  Payment cards. </li><li>  A variety of service products. </li><li>  Credit cards. </li><li>  Boxed insurance products. </li><li>  A wide variety of loan products. </li></ul><p>  The possibility of obtaining a loan at the Post Bank (reviews often remind of this) attracts many customers.  The bank in question considers its goal to increase the availability of various financial services for citizens of the Russian Federation.  Indeed, today only about half of adult citizens of the state actively use banking services.  For example, in China in this context we are talking about 70% of the population, and in the countries of the Scandinavian region it exceeds 97%. </p><p>  The bank is building large-scale development plans for itself.  So, in the near future it is planned to open about fifteen thousand individual client centers, which will be located in post offices. </p><p>  All this will provide the financial institution under consideration with the opportunity to obtain the status of one of the largest banks in the Russian Federation. </p>

    <h2>  Positive customer reviews </h2><p>  Many have already managed to get a loan at the Post Bank.  Customer reviews gratefully respond to such a service from the financial institution in question.  How comfortable are consumers of a loan product?  What do those who issued a loan at the Post Bank say?  Reviews highlight the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  A large number of branches (you can always find a branch with a suitable location). </li><li>  Free registration of applications. </li><li>  Incredibly fast processing of applications. </li><li>  Friendly and friendly loan experts. </li><li>  Nice and comfortable office. </li><li>  The smallest possible set of necessary documents. </li><li>  Good service. </li><li>  The age limit is eighteen years. </li><li>  Acceptable and pleasant loan conditions. </li></ul><p>  Does what you found out motivate you to try to get a loan at the Post Bank?  Reviews of a positive nature, however, are not the only things customers tell about the bank in question.  So, negative feedback is left no less.  We‚Äôll talk more about this later. </p><h2>  Negative customer reviews </h2><p>  Negative feedback on the loan at Post Bank highlights a number of unpleasant moments that relate to the loan product itself and directly to the servicing of bank employees.  What exactly upsets customers?  So, the following negative points are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Not the most favorable terms of service. </li><li>  High loan rates. </li><li>  Incorrect information on the proposed financial product. </li><li>  Unfair imposition of insurance. </li><li>  In order to become a truly worthy brand, it is still necessary to develop. </li><li>  Sending SMS messages with spam. </li><li>  Incorrect paperwork by bank employees. </li><li>  Ignoring customer requests. </li><li>  Imposing unnecessary services. </li><li>  Illegal threatening calls. </li><li>  Regular causeless calls. </li><li>  The apparent discrepancy between the conditions of the loan application and the actual conditions under which the loan was issued. </li><li>  Huge late fees </li></ul><p>  Reviews of a cash loan in Mail Bank (Novosibirsk) of this nature make it possible to conclude that you should be careful what you are offered in the institution in question.  Be careful!  And if you are substantially worried about what was listed above in this paragraph, it may be worth abandoning the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing the services of the bank in question. </p>

    <h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  The easiest way to contact bank representatives is to make a phone call to the hotline.  Calls to it can be made both from the territory of the Russian Federation, and from abroad.  So, with this phone number you will be taken to an automated menu with which you can block your card (both debit and credit);  find out the amount lacking in order to fully repay the loan;  find out the required amount of payment;  find out the address of the nearest bank branch;  apply for a consumer loan;  find out the current card balance;  Get complete information about all available services and products;  ask for a connection with the operator. </p><p>  If for some reason you do not have the opportunity to call the hotline, it is quite possible to order a call back from the bank to your mobile phone.  For many, this turns out to be an excellent solution, and they manage to resolve all their questions. </p><p>  If your problem cannot be solved with a phone call, it might be right to personally visit a bank branch.  The addresses of the nearest branches can be found on the official website of the company, and the head office is located in Moscow on Preobrazhenskaya Square, building 8. The head office, as well as a number of individual bank divisions (press service, as well as staff recruitment service) can be contacted separately by dedicated telephone line. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Do you need money to buy household appliances or a loan for education?  Reviews of "Post Bank" report that by contacting this financial institution, you will be able to get everything you need in the shortest possible time.  In relations with the bank, most of all I want that the interest on the loan was not burdensome.  According to credit reviews in the Post Bank, the conditions for obtaining a loan in it are more than attractive.          ,      . </p><p>  ,    " ",       .      .        . , ,      ,             .
