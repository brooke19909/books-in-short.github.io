    <h2>  Charming Montenegro </h2><p>  Monte Negro - this is the name of this country in Europe.  This is a literal translation of the real name of an independent state that was once part of Yugoslavia.  "Black Mountain" - so the inhabitants themselves call their country.  As for tourism, the most popular is the <span>Adriatic coast.</span>  It has a Mediterranean climate.  Rafting and hiking enthusiasts are attracted to the eastern part of Montenegro, where the Balkans rise.  And ecological tourists will surely like it in the lowland center of the country.  Weather in the first month of autumn in these three parts of Montenegro is different.  The first breaths of the approaching winter are felt in the mountainous areas.  But on the coast, everything is not so smooth.  Although Montenegro in September is a place where the tourist season is still ongoing.  But compared with August, vacation in Monte Negro in the first month of autumn has a lot of advantages.  Let's look at them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Montenegro in September" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477107.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The Velvet season </h2><p>  Those who rested in Montenegro in the summer, probably wanted to give in to the numerous offers of travel agencies and go on exciting excursions.  But the people were stopped by just dizzying heat.  Even the air-conditioned bus did not prompt tourists to leave the coast covered by the sea breeze and go to see monasteries, castles or nature reserves.  But Montenegro in September is a unique opportunity to combine beach and educational holidays.  Autumn comes to this country a month later than to us.  The beaches, and indeed everything around, still have quite a summer surroundings.  But already stupefying, rolls over +33 degrees in the shade of heat, and the nights cease to be stuffy.  There is very little rain in September in Monte Negro.  It's time to go on excursions.  Even the Constitution of this country says that Montenegro is an environmental power.  Nature reserves, reserves and national parks occupy a tenth of the state.  It is impossible to relax in Montenegro and not to visit the largest canyon of the Tara River in Europe or not to see the stunning beauty of Lake Skadar.  And lovers of conquering the mountain peaks can climb to the highest point of the country - Lovcen - and not die at the same time from sun or heat stroke.  Only raftingists are unlucky in September in Montenegro.  Since rainfall is still very small, low water is observed on mountain rivers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Montenegro in September" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  Montenegro in September is somewhat empty.  This is due to nothing more than the start of a new school year.  School children, as well as their parents, go home sometime after August 25th.  But the celebration of life continues.  If your child is still too small for school, please continue with the summer.  In September, you will not be afraid that the evil southern sun will burn the delicate skin of the baby.  Colds also should not be feared, because the weather on the coast is summer.  The air temperature drops slightly compared to August, but the thermometer column stubbornly keeps at + 24-25 degrees in the shade during the day.  True, the nights become fresh: + 16 C. The sea in Montenegro warmed up in September so much that it equaled the temperature with air.  The Adriatic has the unpleasant feature that a <span>cold current</span> can come to the coast <span>.</span>  Water becomes like liquid nitrogen, even if the air temperature is + 35 ¬∞ C. But when such a flow comes, no one knows.  Vacationers are not insured against it in July. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea in Montenegro in September" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477117.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Montenegro in September: prices </h2><p>  Another advantage of the autumn holiday in Monte Negro is its cheapness.  Since families with children no longer buy tours to the Adriatic, and especially sensitive to cold nature switch to the beaches of Spain, Turkey and even Egypt, the demand for housing and <span>excursions in Montenegro is</span> falling.  And this leads to a general decline in prices.  Tour operators in our country are increasingly starting to ‚Äúthrow out‚Äù last minute packages to the tourism market.  A week on the Monte Negre coast will cost two adult tourists 20-22 thousand rubles, depending on the type of hotel.  But in the country itself, prices are noticeably reduced, becoming "as for their own."  For apartments for 2-3 people ask 25 euros per night.  And this is where five minutes to go to the sea!  The price of food is also reduced: one and a half liter eggplant costs 0.6 euros, a kilogram of meat - 5-6, the famous Negus sausage - 8.5, the route - 15 –Ñ.  Restaurants also lower the bar.  For example, a meze plate costs already 14 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro in September prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/477119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do in Montenegro in the fall </h2><p>  September holiday on the <span>Budva Riviera</span> or resorts of <span>the Bay of Kotor</span> means also a wonderful pastime on the beaches that are unfilled to the fullest.  In Montenegro, many coasts with small pebbles or sand are marked with the Blue Flag for environmental cleanliness, safety and service.  However, vacationers Monte Negro do not live alone.  Weather in Montenegro in September is conducive to travel around the country.  The ancient cities of Kotor and St. Stephen, which are under the protection of UNESCO, are waiting for you.  In addition to <span>the Ostrog monastery</span> and trips to natural attractions, it is worth taking a ride through the resorts of the Ulcinj and Budva Riviera, visiting Tivat and, of course, in the capital of the country - Podgorica.  The hottest weather in September is in the Bay of Kotor (Tivat, Perast, Herceg Novi).  There the average temperature is + 27 C. The most rainy resort is Cetinje.  Up to 190 mm of precipitation falls there.  And the coldest thing in the mountains.  In the ski resorts of Kolasin and Zabljak, the daytime temperature rarely rises above + 20 degrees, and at night it drops to +10. </p><h2>  September in Monte Negro: events </h2><p>  The beginning of autumn does not at all mark the end of the season.  The audience is just changing.  Families with children leave in large numbers and partying young people arrive.  After all, Montenegro in September is the arena of the most interesting events.  This month, the Mojkovacka filmska jesen film festival is taking place in the town of Mojkovac (near Kolasin).  Culture Days are celebrated in Niksic.  As part of this holiday, poetry nights are organized, as well as street theater performances.  The Montenegro Open tennis tournament is also taking place.  But the most original event is held annually in Budva.  It is called the Days of Sirun.  They honor the local fish species, which is found only off the coast of the Adriatic.  Smoked siruna, fried, baked on the grill, prepared from it a transparent ear, and then treat everyone to these dishes. </p>
