Overview of the cultural places of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of Moldova and its largest city - Chisinau - is an amazing architecture, impressive sights and interesting history.  The first mention of it falls on the year 1420, and it was from that time that its continuous gradual growth began.  Today it is a place where many attractions are concentrated, there are museums, as well as catering establishments with delicious traditional dishes, popular among tourists. </p><h2>  Pride of the city </h2><p>  Mazarakievskaya Church, or the Temple of the Nativity of the Mother of God - is one of the cultural and architectural attractions of the capital.  Built in 1757, the church was able to maintain its pristine appearance to this day, even though <span>restoration work</span> was carried out there more than once.  The temple is completely simple, that is, there are no intricate decorative elements.  Next to him, in the yard, is a spring.  By the way, A.S. Pushkin liked to spend time near him. </p><h2>  Cathedral of the Nativity </h2><p>  The cathedral is ranked among the architectural monuments of the 19th century.  It was built in 1830.  The initiator was the Metropolitan of Bessarabia, Gabriel Banulescu-Bodoni.  An architectural project commissioned by Mikhail Vorontsov (Governor General of New Russia) was developed by Avraam Melnikov.  Built in the style of Russian classicism, the temple is massive, majestic, proudly rises on the main street of the city. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chisinau city" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35642/841509.jpg" width="600"></div>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The garden belongs to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova, was founded in 1950.  It covers an area of ​​104 hectares, which is divided into two parts by the Valya Kruchiy brook.  <span>Blue spruce</span> alley <span>,</span> linden alley, local and exotic plants decorate the garden.  The soil is very diverse (24 species), which allows you to grow many varieties of representatives of the plant world.  Today, the botanical garden has more than 10,000 plant varieties and species, which in themselves are sights.  Chisinau is multifaceted and interesting, there are entertainment for every taste. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cathedral of St. Theodora of Sikhla </h2><p>  This cathedral is located in a place like the center of Chisinau.  It was built as a chapel at the female gymnasium, designed by Alexander Bernardazzi in 1895.  The cathedral was built in the pseudo-Byzantine style, and the structure turned out to be very beautiful both outside and inside.  Speaking about it, it is important to highlight the rich decorative decoration, as well as unique arched openings, columns and cornices. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chisinau sights" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35642/841498.jpg" width="600"></div>  National Museum of Ethnography </h2><p>  The Museum of History and Ethnography has an interesting history.  It was the Museum of Agriculture, the Republican Museum of Moldova, and the Regional Museum of Bessarabia, and the Museum of the Study of the Native Land, etc.  The building was built in the 20th century, and today this museum is an important research center.  If you are interested in learning about the culture and nature of Bessarabia, be sure to visit this place when you explore the sights.  Chisinau will pleasantly surprise you with its huge historical heritage. </p><h2>  Arch of Victory, or Holy Gates </h2><p>  The construction was built in the 40s of the 19th century.  The design was done by the famous architect Zaushkevich.  The arch has a height of 13 meters and a cubic shape, the columns are crowned with a beautiful cornice.  Upstairs, under the dome, a bell is placed, which weighs almost 6.5 tons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memorial of military glory </h2><p>  We opened it in the center of Chisinau in 1975.  The memorial is a 25-meter pyramidal structure made of red stone, somewhat reminiscent of a rifle, in the center of which there is the Eternal Flame.  It is dedicated to the soldiers who defended the city from the Nazi invaders.  Marble slabs are fixed here, on each of which the names of the heroes are written.  A little further from the memorial there is an alley with military burials. </p><h2>  Church of St. Panteleimon </h2><p>  This building is hard to miss, studying the streets of Chisinau, it really stands out from the rest of the city buildings.  Founded in 1891, the neo-Byzantine-style church has a beautiful facade cladding.  As for the interior, it is decorated with crosses, stained-glass windows, bas-reliefs and columns. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chisinau center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35642/844770.jpg" width="600"></div>  Church of Constantine and Helena </h2><p>  Just imagine - this Orthodox church was built at the beginning of the 12th century!  Konstantin Ryshkan, being a wealthy landowner, allocated funds for the construction of the church, and by 1177 the monastery was built and received the name of a benefactor.  Built in the old Moldavian style, this church annually receives thousands of tourists who want to move to the past even for a moment. </p><h2>  Central streets of the city </h2><p>  In general, <span>Chisinau</span> gathered all the <span>sights</span> on its central streets.  And, as in any other city, active life boils in the center more than anything else.  Take, for example, Kolumna Street.  Its laying began in 1817, and today it has a length of almost 3.5 km.  Around the same time, the house of Tudor Krupensky was built, one of the few at that time that had as many as two floors.  It is notable for the fact that it was visited by Russian emperors.  By the way, in connection with the laying of the street, at that time called Kaushanskaya, the mansion underwent restructuring and increase.  At that time, the first cinema in Moldova was founded by the owner of the house, and A.S. Pushkin was very fond of spending time in it. </p>
