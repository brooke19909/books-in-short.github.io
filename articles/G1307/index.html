What kind of service is this?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The mobile market for the most part has long been divided between the largest operators.  Therefore, their task is now obvious to entice subscribers to themselves with various interesting and beneficial offers for people, including rewards for loyalty.  One of these services is the “On Full Trust” service operated by the MTS operator.  What is it and what is its meaning - read in this article. </p><h2>  General concept </h2><p>  So, the service is quite simple.  It allows you to receive funds in advance, without first replenishing the account.  Thus, the operator provides the client with something like a loan in which there is no interest. </p><p>  In fact, this is implemented as follows.  Let's say you forgot to fund your account (which happens often enough with each of us), but you urgently need to make an important call.  Under normal circumstances, you would run to the recharge terminal in order to replenish the balance of your SIM card, and thus get the opportunity to fully use mobile communications. </p><p>  With the service “On full trust”, MTS simplified your task.  Now you do not need to run anywhere, because the funds are provided to you in advance.  The amount that was allocated as part of the service is displayed as a negative value of your balance (for example, minus 300 rubles). </p>

    <h2>  Cost of connection and maintenance </h2><p>  Of course, there is a limit within which the operator is ready to provide you with funds for further conversations.  There are also certain rules that apply to such “loans”, on the basis of which the MTS service “On full trust” functions.  What are these restrictions can be found on the operator’s official page. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the minimum amount that a subscriber can receive is 300 rubles.  However, under certain conditions (which we will write about later in the article), this figure may increase.  Moreover, in order to successfully use the service, it is necessary to return the money stipulated by the debt on time.  Also, the age of the package that claims to connect the service should be at least 3 months.  It is also important that during this period a person cannot have delays in paying for other services. </p>

    <h2>  How to connect and disconnect? </h2><p>  Connecting “On Full Trust” to MTS is quite simple.  The subscriber is provided with several options for servicing this offer.  The first is control using the combination * 111 * 32 #.  You need to dial it from your mobile, after which you will see a message asking if you really want to use this service.  The second is working with the service through the web interface of your personal account.  You can enter it on the MTS website. </p><p>  “In full trust” can be disabled through the same mechanisms.  Just send the combination * 111 * 2118 #.

    <h2>  What is the advantage? </h2><p>  The benefits of being able to receive funds in advance are obvious - you do not need to worry about the time periods in which you must pay off all accounts.  Also, the MTS “On Full Trust” service (reviews confirm this) allows customers not to worry about replenishing their accounts for future use.  It turns out that there is no need to worry about the state of your balance if the operator can provide temporary funds to pay for the connection.  The plus also is that the MTS <span>service</span> “On Full Trust” is not <span>imposed on</span> you.  How to disconnect it, you already know, there will be no problems with this, and connecting to it is voluntary.  You don’t feel that they want to “poke” you on another tariff you don't need or something like that. </p>

    <p>  Finally, it simplifies the process of tracking your account.  All information on how much money you “borrowed” from the operator is visible due to that very negative balance.  Then, in order to return the money, you must deposit the amount to reset the account, after which - the funds that are needed for further use of the number. </p><h2>  The increase in "trust" </h2><p>  And in this service there is a place of loyalty.  While you use “On Full Trust”, MTS gradually recounts your limit - the maximum allowable amount that you can talk to without replenishing your account.  As already noted, the minimum is 300 rubles;  whereas with the growth of your communication costs, the operator can recount this figure.  As indicated on the official website, the calculation is carried out according to the simplest formula: the arithmetic average of your communication costs, divided in half - this is the amount that you can get.  Over time, it will continue to grow, making your communication more comfortable and carefree. </p>

    <h2>  Who can use it? </h2><p>  Anyone who meets the above requirements can use the service this article is written about - a number of at least 3 months in advance, constant payment for services, and no debt.  It also should include subscribers who have chosen an unincorporated form of service (which is important), as well as users whose tariff plans are not “Cool”, “MTS Connect”, “Your Country” or “Guest”.  Obviously, the conditions of these packages have some other features in the issue of providing funds to subscribers with a zero account in advance.  However, we will not talk about them, since this is already a topic for other information material. </p>

    <h2>  Subscriber Responsibilities </h2><p>  Although, of course, the user also has the obligation to repay funds issued on credit.  This must be done in a clearly defined period - until the 24th day of each month.  Each time, when the deadline for payment is less than 7 days, the user will be informed by the appropriate SMS. </p><p>  In addition, in order not to get confused in the limit, MTS service “On full trust” has its own short request code.  This is * 132 #.  Having typed this combination, you can see the following information: total amount of funds issued within the limit (for example, 300 rubles);  the amount that you must pay (say, if out of 300 you spent 100, then you need to pay them);  as well as the number to which this needs to be done.  SMS will also come if you spend 75 percent of your limit.  Then, of course, you will be forced to go and replenish your account. </p><h2>  Negative consequences </h2><p>  It is not worth hoping that you will be able to use this service, and in the future not to return funds within the limits of the limit.  There is a clear algorithm for the suppression of such violations, with which the MTS-service “On full trust” works.  It’s not difficult to guess what it is: the company completely blocks the subscriber’s number.  Thus, it becomes simply unprofitable to use the operator’s money.  The thing is that it will simply be unprofitable for the subscriber to do this.  And, if you look, it’s not worth it.  MTS has the “On Full Trust” service not for profit purposes, but rather as help in emergency situations. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  Of course, there is a much simpler alternative move - replenishment in advance.  Just develop a habit, according to which you will send a certain amount of money to your mobile account on a regular basis, and then the MTS service offered by MTS (which we already described in this article) will simply not be needed.  You can do this by various methods - from self-monitoring and constant reminders in the form of a calendar, an alarm clock, and so on, and ending with setting up some kind of banking so that payments for mobile communication services are debited automatically and regularly, without your participation. </p>
