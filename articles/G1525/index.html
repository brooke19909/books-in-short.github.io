    <p>  However, many hope that the Nexus 7 will be at least slightly updated.  The original device caused a stir in the tablet market primarily because of its low price.  And this despite its latest build features and specifications, due to which experts began to suspect that Google subsidizes the release of the gadget so that more people choose Android and purchase more applications, books, music and movies in the respective digital stores. </p><p>  The updated Nexus 7 went on sale in the summer of 2013 and was better in many ways than the original version.  Despite the fact that it costs more, it justifies its price even now, almost two years later. </p><h2>  Nexus 7 - Appearance </h2><p>  The design and assembly of the device of both generations did not change.  The new Nexus 7 looks very similar to the original version, but if you compare both models with each other, within a few seconds after being removed from the box you can say that the differences are obvious.  The new device is thinner and lighter, its thickness is only 8.7 mm and its weight is 290 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Oddly enough, a few millimeters, which have been reduced in width, are much more important.  Thanks to this resizing, the new tablet is much easier to hold in one hand.  The vast majority of competing 7-inch tablets, including TescoHudl, Amazon Kindle and Advent VegaTegra, are noticeably wider when upright.  This is enough to make the gadget uncomfortable when you want to stretch your thumb and grab both sides. </p>

    <p>  Unlike the above devices, the Nexus 7 tablet is higher, and this makes it look more like an oversized smartphone.  In fact, the device is not much larger than the popular Nokia <span>Lumia 1520</span> or Sony Xperia Z Ultra. </p><p>  In addition, Google Nexus 7 has a silver stripe running along the edge of the tablet, the rest of the design is made in black.  Buttons and ports are placed on the device in the same way as on the previous model, but the back of the case has a smooth surface that seems soft to the touch.  This is not very convenient - it can become very dirty after a while, and it is not particularly easy to clean. </p><p>  The two main design changes that immediately catch your eye are the stereo speakers, which are now located on the edges of the tablet to improve sound, and the addition of LED notifications under the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Excellent build quality has been maintained - there are no unwanted gaps in the case or shaky buttons.  The only thing that can be noted as a drawback is the lack of high-quality materials such as aluminum in the body.  However, this is normal for a device in this price category. </p><h2>  Nexus 7 - screen and control </h2><p>  The highlight of the Nexus 7 is its amazing screen.  The 7-inch IPS-display is slightly curved up and has a resolution of 1280x800 to 1920x1200 pixels, which allows to achieve a maximum density of 323 ppi.  Thanks to such characteristics, it can be called the best device with a seven-inch screen, available at present.  For example, the RETINA display in the iPad Mini 2 has more pixels, but they spread over a larger area, so their density is lower. </p><p>  The tablet is equipped with a quad-core Krait processor with a frequency of 1.5 GHz (Snapdragon S4 Pro), and the RAM is doubled and amounts to 2 GB. </p>

    <p>  Users may be disappointed that Android Nexus 7 still has 16 or 32 GB of internal memory and still does not have a microSD card slot (thus, there is no possibility for expanding the memory).  This is one of the few drawbacks of this tablet, but you still get twice as much memory capacity as the first-generation iPad Mini (which is significantly higher in price). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the fact that you will have to pay extra for an additional 16 GB, it‚Äôs worth it, especially if you plan to install many applications, record a lot of photos and videos and store a collection of music and movies on the Nexus 7. </p><p>  Unlike some Android devices, this tablet does not have an infrared port, and you cannot use the Nexus 7 as a remote control for the TV.  However, you get dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 LE (low-power), GPS, NFC and Qi wireless charging (you will need to buy a separate compatible <span>wireless charger for this).</span>  If all the above characteristics suit you, the affordable price on the Nexus 7 - about $ 200 - should not be an obstacle to buying a device. </p><p>  In addition, the gadget is equipped with front and rear cameras - the first is a 1.2-megapixel webcam with autofocus, the second is similar to a 5 megapixel camera.  Also available in Nexus 7 LTE. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Nexus 7 was originally released with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean software, and then received an update to 4.4 KitKat (a few months later).  Many users expected to see Android 5.0 ("lime cake") on this device, but this has not happened at present.  It is possible that Google will make such an update for Nexus 7, even if it will improve Nexus 8 and subsequent models.  At the same time, the KitKat version is a completely modern and perfect OS for the tablet, giving users great opportunities. </p>

    <p>  So, the KitKat distribution brought with it some pretty significant differences - now Nexus 7 does not have a transparent status bar or an opaque background on the application screen. </p><p>  Most of the updates concern Android solutions that make this platform easier to use.  For example, you can now access the settings from <span>the quick launch bar</span> when you swipe down from the upper right corner.  Another addition is the Pay feature, which uses built-in NFC to make purchases. </p><p>  Many of the features of the OS are designed for developers, so the new full-screen mode only works in applications that have been updated.  For example, programs from Google use the entire screen, and Kindle and similar products work the old way.  Therefore, in some cases, a new Nexus 7 firmware may be required. </p><p>  With the advent of Android 4.3, user profiles were introduced.  This extension allows you to have multiple user accounts on the same device.  From each of the user profiles, you can autonomously manage the applications and content that is available in your account.  This innovation will certainly be appreciated by those who allow children to use the tablet, as it will avoid accidental purchases, the use of paid applications or access to content with inappropriate content. </p><p>  As you would expect, in the factory settings you will get all Google applications pre-loaded and activated, including the branded online store. </p><h2>  Image Features </h2><p>  Any data looks great on the Full HD screen.  Since the gadget has an IPS panel, all viewing angles are excellent, the contrast is very clear, and the colors are bright.  The surface of the screen is presented in the form of a Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> coating <span>,</span> which is very durable and reliable, allowing it to withstand prolonged daily use of the device.  As practice shows, the six-month device still looks like new. </p>

    <p>  <span>The touch screen is</span> very easy to operate and responsive.  There are no delays when clicking on buttons or links.  In addition, the response to clicking is very accurate - you can click on the links in the list without increasing them.  The screen is also ideal for watching videos due to its wide aspect ratio. </p><h2>  Dynamics and sound quality </h2><p>  The quad-core processor combined with the latest version of Android means that the Nexus 7 tablet is very fast and accurate.  It loads faster than most similar devices in about 30 seconds. </p><p>  Web browsing is very fast and without delay.  Any content from the Internet downloads very quickly, even if several windows are open.  In addition, by default, the Chrome browser installed on the device usually loads the second page in the background (if you open the contents of several websites at the same time).  Thus, when switching from one window to another, you do not need to spend time waiting for the download, everything happens synchronously. </p><h2>  Battery and Duration </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the Nexus 7 version has a smaller battery than its predecessor - 3.950 mAh compared to 4.326 mAh (and 15 Wh versus 16 Wh, respectively).  Nevertheless, Google claims an additional hour of "active use", that is, it is assumed that the tablet works for more than nine hours without recharging.  As testing shows, the Nexus 7 (device charging) runs smoothly for 8 hours 47 minutes on a single charge while watching a locally stored high-definition video.  This is a good result, especially compared to other 7-inch devices. </p><p>  Like most tablets, this gadget charges very fast, even if you use it while charging.  When turned off, the time for a full charge is just over 3.5 hours (from a fully discharged battery to 100 percent charge). </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the Nexus 7 has one significant drawback regarding battery power - if you leave it in standby mode for several days, it discharges quite quickly.  This will happen even if the device only receives emails and other notifications via Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Nexus 7 - camera and photo specifications </h2><p>  Standard equipment <span>"Nexus 7"</span> now has two cameras, and not just one.  The front camera has a capacity of 1.2 megapixels (as in the previous version of the device), the newly introduced rear camera with a capacity of 5 megapixels is equipped with autofocus, but does not have a flash.  Despite the fact that tablets, in principle, are not very convenient to use as a camera, the small size of the Nexus 7 makes it easy to take photos and videos. </p><p>  However, the quality of the photos will be far from ideal.  It is possible to successfully photograph in the open air and in good light - the resulting images will be of high enough quality for sharing on the Internet.  However, creating high-quality collages is unlikely to succeed.  When you try to process photos in Photoshop, the images will contain a lot of interference.  For example, in a landscape photo, the blue sky will be clearly visible, and at the same time, the shadow areas will have many color defects and blackouts. </p><p>  Autofocus and white balance do not always work at 100%, especially with regard to moving objects (for example, children) - such images almost always turn out blurry.  In addition, the camera is not equipped with the HDR option. </p><h2>  Video quality and features </h2><p>  You can shoot videos with a frequency of up to 1080p resolution - the videos will turn out to be clear and high-quality, especially if you keep the Nexus 7 firm and stable during shooting.  However, panning the shots can create the effect of unwanted ‚Äújerks‚Äù in the image.  Settings for brightness and sharpness levels are quite acceptable if you hold the tablet in a comfortable position and do not change it during shooting.  In addition, you can simultaneously create photos while shooting movies by tapping the screen. </p>

    <p>  The tablet has two additional functions - "Panorama" and "Photosphere".  The first allows you to capture a panoramic image if you slowly rotate the tablet, and the second allows you to capture a full 360-degree picture that you can scroll (including up and down) in the saved video.  However, to use these functions, you must hold the device in one position without tilting or shifting it in your hands, and the distance to the subject should be at least a meter (in order to obtain acceptable results). </p><h2>  Conclusion and Summary </h2><p>  Even though the Nexus 7 was released a long time ago, it remains a very popular device.  Of course, there are users who are not happy with the use of this device and its functions.  But it is worth noting that all the basic and additional functions that the gadget is equipped with, work at full strength and give extensive opportunities. </p><p>  The tablet has an excellent screen, a long battery life (with the proviso that if you leave it in standby mode, it will work for 2-3 days), excellent performance and high build quality. </p><p>  This is not the cheapest device, but you fully get what you pay for.  If you want to save money, you will become the owner of a device with much fewer functions and capabilities.  Compared to the Nexus 7, whose price in Russia does not exceed $ 200, Chinese fakes can be cheaper devices. </p><p>  The tablet is ideal for reading books and working with applications in the new full-screen mode.  This means that the status bar will not distract you from playing, working or reading.  In addition, the device‚Äôs screen is ideal for watching videos and TV programs, both online and stored files.  In addition, stereo speakers produce decent sound quality. </p><p>  Since the mass of the device is 290 grams, you can freely hold it in your hand for a couple of hours without feeling tired.  Also, the tablet has a very modest dimensions, allowing it to fit in the pocket of a backpack or small bag.  Since the device is compact, you can easily pick up a stylish Nexus 7 case. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The disadvantage of the device is the lack of a microSD slot for adding memory and storing large amounts of content.  However, the microUSB port, which is used for charging, can be used in conjunction with a USB cable.  This means that you can attach a flash drive with the content you need (for example, high-quality films).  This method may not seem very convenient, but this is the only way to use bulk data.  In the same way, you can purchase a compatible cable to provide HDMI output, which also solves the problem of connecting additional drives. </p><p>  Another point of frustration with the Nexus 7 is its camera capabilities.  It produces acceptable photos and videos, but is no different and will not allow to achieve excellent quality photos.  Another circumstance that needs to be remembered: repairing a Nexus 7 can be difficult, especially if you live in a small city, since this model is not widely used in Russia.  For this reason, specialists may not have information about the gadget‚Äôs device and may not have accessories for replacement. </p>
