    <h2></h2><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  At all times, the <span>"bat"</span> dress was fashionable <span>,</span> making it yourself is not so difficult.  You must have minimal skills with a sewing machine, as well as a huge desire.  The style itself is good in that it can be suitable for any event in the life of a lady.  Such dresses can be worn for work, dressed at parties and meetings with friends.  The peculiarity of the product is that it does not fit the woman‚Äôs hand, the sleeve is loose and in a straight form resembles a bat‚Äôs wing.  This name came from here. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  To sew a <span>dress "bat",</span> it is necessary to begin work with preparation of a pattern.  It is worth noting that it will be quite simple, because in this option we will talk about how to make a tunic dress.  We can say that sewing this type of clothing is somewhat similar to sewing a baby's undershirt, because it is done practically the same way, without separately cutting and sewing on the sleeves.  The pattern itself will be a rectangle, on top of which it is necessary to make a cutout for the neck, and also cut the sleeve adjacent to the product.  The length of the dress itself will be selected depending on what exactly the person needs.  The tunic can be both short and long, both wide and very tight-fitting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a bat dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342278.jpg?1393245629877" width="494"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  The next stage of sewing is the selection of fabric.  The dress "bat" can be created from any material, everything will depend on the time of year when the product will be worn, as well as on the desire of a woman.  However, it must be said that it is not necessary to take too thick fabrics, because they are unlikely to be beautifully draped, and this is important, because the sleeve will freely fall down. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  So how to sew a bat dress?  To do this, you need to carve out two parts of the product - ‚Äúin front‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù.  There will be no stitching or stitching on the front and on the back; in this version, this is not necessary.  It is also worth noting that if a woman plans to make a cutout with a ‚Äúboat‚Äù, the details of the front and backs will be identical, if the ‚Äúlittle head‚Äù is different, because the neckline of the front is always slightly larger than the back.  The product is stitched on the sides, starting with the shoulder line.  Next, the bottom is sewn into a sleeve.  That‚Äôs all, almost everything has been done.  You must also remember to overlay the edges, otherwise the threads may begin to fall out and the dress will soon crumble. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bat dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342280.jpg?1393245656365" width="365"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Hemming </h2><p>  It is also important not to forget and to hem the bottom of the dress.  You can do this in the usual way - bend and give a line.  However, you can also hem the dress with a hidden seam so that the stitch is not visible from the outside.  According to the same principle, the edges of the sleeves are processed.  It remains only to <span>process the neck.</span>  This can be done by turning.  The dress is ready to wear! </p><h2></h2><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  If you sew a dress "bat" of plain material, you can wear it with almost any jewelry.  Various appliqu√©s or embroideries also look good, they decorate the outfit.  Well, the "bat" dress will also look more sophisticated if it is not worn freely but under the belt, especially wide.  So a woman will be able to emphasize the features of her figure, hiding various undesirable nuances. </p>
