Olympic coins 25 rubles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not only manufacturers of souvenir products are actively preparing for large-scale sporting events.  Usually, at such moments, even the central bank of the country in which the competition takes place is activated.  As an example, take the Olympic Games held in Sochi.  A few years before the start of the competition, the first Olympic coins began to appear.  Gradually, the series replenished with new copies.  Understanding all their diversity is now extremely difficult. </p><h2>  Total number of coins </h2><p>  The issue of Olympic coins dedicated to Sochi started in 2011.  By that time, sketches of this product were approved, so it was possible to proceed to its coinage.  The issue of such coins continued for three years, right up to the first months of 2014.  During this period, the Central Bank distributed about 40 varieties of different denominations throughout the country.  If you carefully read them, you can understand that the sketches were prepared by different artists.  <span>Coin</span> production methods also differed <span>.</span>  <span>The most expensive</span> of them were minted using new technologies, which previously had only to be dreamed of.  This is especially true of gilded specimens.  Previously, they were not distinguished by beauty.  But now the methods of applying gilding have changed, so that the pattern on the reverse is visible very well. </p><h2>  Images on coins </h2>

As a result, copies of base metals began to popularize the mascots of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, as well as subsequent Paralympic ones.  The very first Olympic coins (25 rubles) turned out to be as simple as possible.  They were painted with a snow-capped mountain and the logo of the upcoming competitions.  But this simplicity is fascinating.  Many collectors admit that of the entire series it is this instance that they like most.

These or other sports were not always portrayed.  Sometimes such products of the Central Bank were called upon to promote the cultural heritage of our country.  And the best places of the <span>Krasnodar Territory,</span> in which the 2014 Olympic Games were held, were displayed on coins. </p><h2>  Commemorative coins </h2>

But this is a profound error.  Three types of coins were issued for the Olympic Games in Sochi.  Memorable had a 25-ruble denomination.  They have a fairly large diameter.  On the obverse is the face value, year of manufacture and a <span>two-headed eagle is</span> depicted <span>.</span>  Such coins were made of base alloys, and therefore their circulation was the largest.

    <p>  Not everyone knows how many Olympic coins (their types) of 25-ruble denomination were issued.  If we take into account only copies without gilding and color drawings, then there are four of them.  The first depicts a mountain with the emblem of the Olympics, the other two - game mascots, the last - a torch against the background of our country.  Coins with talismans were minted in 2012 and 2013.  But by the beginning of 2014 there was their re-release.  These coins differ from the original ones only by the year indicated on the obverse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Precious metal coins </h2>

But there are other coins with <span>Olympic symbols,</span> which are of the investment type.  It is easy to guess that such products of the Central Bank are the most expensive.  Soon, even experienced collectors will not be able to say how much Olympic coins of this type cost.  The fact is that initially they were sold by Sberbank at the cost of the metal from which they are made.  Silver coins were cheaper than gold.  But in a few years, the price of such products will increase significantly.  It will be affected by the minimum circulation of some coins and the increase in the value of precious metal.  You do not think that the price of gold will fall?

    <p>  Sberbank sold such Olympic coins until the start of the games themselves.  Their cost ranged from one to ten thousand rubles.  However, now you can safely forget about such prices.  The circulation of each coin was sold in a very short time.  Now Olympic investment coins can only be purchased from lucky collectors.  Is it worth it - a very big question. </p><h2>  A coin is not a token </h2><p>  Some popular resources list a huge amount of investment coins issued for the Sochi Olympics.  But it should be remembered that the administration of such sites is not always well versed in this topic.  Sometimes resources confuse coins with tokens.  The latter can also be minted in gold or silver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It must be understood that the face value must be indicated on the coin.  And it‚Äôs completely unimportant that the real value of an investment coin is equal to the current price of the material from which it is cast.  Silver items received a 3-ruble denomination.  Gold coins have a face value of 50 and 100 rubles.  Tokens do not have a face value, like medals.  Not to mention the fact that only the Central Bank has the right to mint coins.  They can be used as payment throughout the country.  Theoretically, any store should accept an investment coin at its face value. </p><h2>  Commemorative coins of precious metals </h2>

The Russian government understood that they would be sold at the cost of gold and silver.  Only a few years later the collectible value of such products can arise.  Another thing is precious commemorative coins.  The best Russian artists worked on them with special zeal.  As a result, Olympic coins from precious metals turned out to be incredibly beautiful.  Already because of this, they can be sold at a great price.

    <p>  The nominal value of such products of the central bank may be 3, 50, 100, and even 1000 rubles.  But their real value is always much higher.  The price is affected by the quality and beauty of the image on the reverse, as well as the size of the print run. </p><p>  Circulation is a very interesting topic.  Gold and silver are expensive metals; not many of them are contained in the bowels of our planet (to put it mildly).  Therefore, the circulation of such coins tends to a minimum value.  Usually it is only 1000 copies.  Imagine the value of such a rare coin in decades.  And this is not a record.  There is a silver 200-ruble Olympic coin.  It is released in a circulation of 500 copies.  And Sberbank is selling a gold coin with a face value of 25 thousand rubles.  They minted a total of 100 pieces. </p><p>  Commemorative precious coins are taxed.  Therefore, buyers need to pay not only their cost indicated by the bank, but also include VAT.  As for the drawings depicted on such coins, they are divided into two themes.  The first series includes Olympic coins with the image of winter sports.  In the second category are products with views of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  Custom coins </h2>

If you are very lucky, then you can find a similar coin in the change.  But there are non-standard products of the Central Bank.  Such Olympic coins of 25 rubles cost only nominally.  In fact, the cost of each of them is at least <span>500 rubles.</span>

    <p>  We are talking about coins on which there is a color image.  This is a new technology for the Russian Central Bank, previously only Western countries used it.  There are four colored coins.  These are all the same talismans, a mountain and a torch.  Such coins are sold in special blisters, sometimes a booklet is supplied with them. </p><h2>  Cost of olympic coins </h2>

Their release has long been discontinued, and the minimum number is in circulation.  That is why the <span>cost of</span> Olympic <span>coins is</span> constantly growing.

    <p>  Another thing is how much Olympic coins from <span>precious metals</span> cost <span>.</span>  The circulation of such products was minimal.  Almost all coins are sold out in a short time.  Due to this, the price of them increases at times. </p><p>  25-ruble coins with a color pattern in the price will also grow.  But this process will be longer.  Such products are not minted in the largest circulation.  But not many people know about such products of the Central Bank.  Therefore, over the year, the price of colored coins practically did not increase.  She will not grow in another year.  And only from the end of 2015 it will begin to increase significantly.  However, all these are only forecasts, and the market for collectible products lends itself to them the least. </p><h2>  How to buy Olympic coins </h2><p>  If everything is clear with the prices, the question remains about the methods of buying commemorative Olympic coins.  It is easiest to use auctions for these purposes.  So, you can try to purchase products of the Central Bank for relatively little money.  However, it should be remembered that delivery will be by registered mail.  If it is found out in the mail that the letter contains coins, then they can be impudently stolen.  Also, such a transfer does not comply with the rules of the Russian post.  Letters and parcels should contain only printed materials.  The problem of sending the parcel is solved.  But for this, the seller will require additional payment from you. </p><p>  There is still the opportunity to purchase Olympic coins in various online stores.  Products are sold both individually and in whole sets.  Prices are slightly higher than at auctions.  But then the cost is fixed, and also you do not have to wait for the end of bidding due to their absence.  The purchase is delivered in a package, it reaches the buyer in integrity and safety.  In some cases, delivery by courier is possible. </p><h2>  Related Products </h2>

Usually, special albums are used for this.  A variety of albums were released for the Sochi Olympics, designed for both ordinary 25-ruble coins and color ones.  Precious metal products are stored in blisters.  Separate albums were not released for them.
