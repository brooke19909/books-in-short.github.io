    <h2>  Negative opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Hotel Metropol 4 * (Spain), according to tourists, has some disadvantages that can spoil the vacation.  Guests note the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Noisy environment.  At night, young people walk under the windows, the city hall clocks beat, and in the morning bells ring in the church nearby.  Sleeping with open windows is impossible. </li><li>  No double beds.  They are replaced by two single spaced together, which are constantly moving apart. </li><li>  Toiletries are not replenished.  The bathroom is cleaned extremely poorly.  Do not wash the bathroom and sink, but only take out the trash. </li><li>  Drinks are not included in the price, so at dinner you will have to buy even ordinary mineral water. </li><li>  Unfried fish and moldy pastries were found in the restaurant. </li><li>  The rooms have high humidity.  Even swimwear cannot dry in a day. </li></ul>
