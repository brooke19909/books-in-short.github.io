  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silver clay: application, properties, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it possible to make jewelry at home?  From polymer clay, white or transparent products are obtained, which then have to be painted.  But with the help of a special composition called silver clay, you can feel like a real jeweler. </p><p>  This composition is the smallest particles of real silver (or gold, copper, bronze), which are connected by a water-soluble polymer.  The mass is like plasticine, from it you can dazzle anything.  In the process of sculpting, water evaporates, the clay hardens.  The final imprinting of the mold occurs at high temperature. </p><h2>  Introducing New Material </h2><p>  Hearing an unusual name, people think: ‚ÄúWhat is this - silver clay?‚Äù  In 1991, Japan invented a valuable material based on nanotechnology: the smallest dust particles of precious metals with a size of 20 microns were mixed with an aqueous suspension of plasticizer.  The resulting dough could be modified at will.  After firing in a jewelry furnace, impurities turned into scale, and the output was pure precious metal - gold or silver. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quiltworksnw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PMC bracelet" class="if uuid-3126602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126602.jpg"></div><p>  The first sample of material required firing at very high temperatures and gave strong shrinkage.  Therefore, he did not find practical application.  Two other samples were created - with a lower firing temperature and less shrinkage.  The product is called "silver clay." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then came gold clay, platinum, copper, brass, iron - only about ten colors after baking.  In addition to Japanese materials, there are American and Polish metal clays on the market. </p><h2>  Composition and properties, advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  When Masaki Morikawa received his first sample, which still had no name, after firing it turned into 99.96% silver.  But some of the technical characteristics of the new items did not allow its wide use.  Over time, silver polymer clay appeared with a lower percentage of precious metal.  And these products have gained popularity all over the world. </p><p>  The advantages of working with metal clay are obvious: it opens up almost limitless possibilities.  You can sculpt, cut, work in stacks, dry, reduce, add, assemble the product from many parts - and without waste.  To the skill of a jeweler, accustomed to casting, the skills of a sculptor were added. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.romadesignerjewelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional silverware" class="if uuid-3126593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126593.jpg"></div><p>  But the mass transition of jewelers to silver clay did not happen.  Nevertheless, porous products are closer to ceramics than to metal.  They have a lower threshold for responding to chemical and mechanical influences.  Therefore, clay is used for decoration, connecting with a silver ring made in the traditional way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Silver clay: a set for creativity </h2><p>  Arranging a small jewelry workshop at home is now easy.  There are sets that include the original Japanese clay PMC.  This set is called STARTER KIT.  In addition to clay, it contains a firing burner, tools for forming patterns, original silver fittings and materials for the master class with instructions.  The box size is small, it can be ordered by mail: only 12 x 20 x 16 cm. </p><p>  The cost of the set ranges from six to eight thousand rubles and depends on the weight of silver clay.  The set can be selected by the amount of material (it is more profitable to buy the most expensive one - it contains a clay volume of more than two cheaper ones, and only a third more expensive than them).  Burners are painted in different colors, can be matched to the interior. </p><h2>  Brands &amp; Brands </h2><p>  Silver clay is produced either in powder, which is diluted with water, or already ready for use.  For the convenience of the craftsmen, quick-drying, medium-drying and slow-drying compositions are produced.  For simple forms, they acquire clays that begin to harden already in the process of working with them.  To perform delicate work, complex drawings, for example, flowers and leaves with veins, it is better to choose compounds that are more plastic and obedient. </p><p>  The Japanese Mitsubishi brand launches a product under the PMC brand.  There are several varieties of this clay.  This is the most famous brand, the discoverer of metal clay.  Technologists of the company are constantly trying new additives, plasticizers, and mix formulations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homemade pendant" class="if uuid-3126597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126597.jpg"></div><p>  The name Sterling is carried by several products.  American company Metal Adventures Inc.  produces the composition FS999, already prepared for work.  Polish brand Goldie Clay produces powder formulations of ten items, including gold.  ART Clay is another recognized brand recognized by masters of arts and crafts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  PMC brand: specifications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ceramicastore.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="silver clay pmc" class="if uuid-3127041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/3127041.jpg"></div><p>  The name of the brand comes from the abbreviation Precious Metal Clay, which means "clay of precious metal."  From one sample, the products of this brand have grown to several advanced formulations used for a variety of tasks. </p><p>  Silver clay PMC is now available in the following versions: </p><ol><li>  The composition of PMC3, which is characterized by increased strength after processing with high temperature.  Suitable for creating rings.  Firing time - 10 minutes, this is an accelerated option.  Dries out quickly after being removed from the film.  It‚Äôs better not to experiment in order to bring the idea to life.  You can think in advance about what operations the wizard will perform.  Suitable for setting stones, porcelain and other jewelry. </li><li>  The composition of the PMC +, which has a firing time of 20 minutes.  Almost all the characteristics of it coincide with PMC3, except for durability.  For this reason, rings are not made of it. </li><li>  Composition PMC Flex, ideal for beginners.  He has a very long working time.  Thanks to this, you can finish the job, even if you have to redo something. </li><li>  The composition of PMC Sterling is three times stronger than the rest, has a long solidification time, it is suitable for the use of drills and shape correction. </li><li>  The composition of the PMC One Fire Sterling is very durable.  It is suitable for the manufacture of accessories, openwork patterns.  The firing time is one hour.  Shrinkage is greater than the rest. </li><li>  The PMC mass is easily formed by plastic stamps designed for cookies.  Masters use household items to create a suitable texture. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="jacksclub.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ring drum" class="if uuid-3126595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126595.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to these compounds, there are also silver paper from which origami can be folded, liquid paste for copying natural textures, liquid gold and silver in a syringe. </p><h2>  Workshop: silver clay ring </h2><p>  To work with metal clay, you will need to think in advance how to prepare the workplace: the time for work will be reduced due to the search for the desired stack or suitable stamp.  The working surface should be perfectly smooth, clay should not stick to it.  Glass or ceramic tile is suitable.  Masters work on a special rug for sculpting from polymer clay. </p><p>  Nearby put a spray bottle with water and a glass with a brush.  During operation, the product is moistened.  Well, if you manage to work with thin gloves, they prevent fingerprints.  For rolling, you will need rolling pins, which can be made from a piece of polyethylene pipe, a round pencil, a brush cover.  Stacks can be toothpicks and manicure sticks.  You will also need round and flat files and emery paper, which, after firing, grind silver clay.  A master class for making a simple original ringlet is presented in the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="VOqaA5v263o" data-url="https://youtu.be/VOqaA5v263o" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/2/6/4/15264.jpg"></div><p>  The texture that the master puts on the plate can be done not only with synthetic lace.  Any natural material that has a fairly expressive texture will do.  The prints of leaves, acorns, walnuts, patterns on the crystal look interesting. </p><h2>  Professional use of silver clay </h2><p>  Jewelers have all the tools to create a work of art.  Silver clay jewelry can cover heavy candle holders, air pendants, weightless rings.  For products that are constantly experiencing friction, pressure, which is often removed and put on, in general, for those exposed to mechanical stress, the jeweler will take the usual 925 sterling silver. </p><p>  And the point is not only that its price is lower.  The strength of a solid cast ring is much higher than that made of powder metal.  But to decorate the latter with a pattern, molding, complex ornament is easier and simpler than in the traditional way.  Pastes, compositions in syringes are indispensable helpers for fixing stones or repairing products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shungitequeen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Author's work" class="if uuid-3126601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126601.jpg"></div><h2>  Works of art </h2><p>  A separate area was the manufacture of figurines.  Now you can create clear drawings of faces, simulate various surfaces.  This has expanded the possibilities of jewelry art.  Since silver clay cannot be used to create volumetric structures, the base is made of cast silver.  And already on it they attach small ones with the help of silver paste. </p><h2>  Tips for Beginners </h2><p>  Not everyone has a special kiln.  Some have adapted to use a domestic gas stove: they put the product on a special grid and put it on the burner.  But this method is quite tedious - during all the time you need to control the process of firing silver clay. </p><p>  How to make firing using a gas burner is described below: </p><ol><li>  Prepare refractory brick, burner and long tweezers. </li><li>  Place the product on a brick. </li><li>  Light the burner and warm the product evenly, turning it over with tweezers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="willowandme.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Newbie job" class="if uuid-3126600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3126600.jpg"></div><p>  The kit for beginners includes a ceramic stove that allows you to burn small items.  There is also a microwave oven - it allows you to burn products in 800WT conditions.  It is convenient to use a muffle furnace in which ceramics can also be burned. </p><h2>  Reviews of professionals </h2><p>  Having tested several brands, artists prefer PMC3 material.  This silver clay, reviews of which are only positive, has a lot of advantages.  It does not stick to the skin; it forms quickly and easily.  Long preserves the working texture. </p><p>  For comparison: the Art Clay Silver 650 brand begins to dry as soon as it is freed from the film.  Taking photographs of the stages of work is very problematic - you may not have time to complete the planned operations.  With PMC3, it‚Äôs a completely different matter: you can wash your hands, calmly photograph a fragment and continue to work. </p><h2>  Beginner Reviews </h2><p>  Not everyone succeeds the first time to make an even and beautiful ring.  This is understandable - for such work special skills are needed.  But it turns out that making a simple record is not so easy either.  Reviews of silver clay for beginners warn against premature removal of the stamp - it can "lead" the plate, and it will become uneven.  Using a plastic stamp, you have to press on it harder than a metal one, and this leads to too much thinning of the plate. </p><p>  When firing at some customers, the Mitsubishi stove bends the net onto which the product is placed.  True, after it can be straightened, but with the help of a vice.  After firing, dross is obtained, which is removed with needles or knitting needles.  Here, too, there is a delicate moment: for some, the product breaks due to too hard work with a needle or sandpaper. </p><p>  Many regret that from the very beginning they did not acquire clay for long drying, and they had to dilute hardened pieces with water.  After dilution several times, the material no longer formed, as stated according to the instructions - apparently, could not withstand such an execution. </p><p>  In general, everyone is happy with the experience they have gained and are advised to try making a pendant for themselves, which no one has. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It's always nice to have a thing made with love at home.  If you quickly get tired of crafts from cones and paper, then the noble shine of a precious metal will become a highlight of your home, a unique decoration and a wonderful gift.  Finally, you can make yourself a family jewel by decorating it with stones! </p><p>  Everyone who has tried to fashion a metal jewelry, they say that they will not stop there.  Working with silver clay is a fascinating process.  More and more new compositions are appearing, the technology for making jewelry from them is being modernized.  Maybe this is your calling? </p>
