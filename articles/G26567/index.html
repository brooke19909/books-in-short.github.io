Tokai wines</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tokaj is a city in northern Hungary.  It is located in the Borsod-Abauj-Zempl√©n County.  It is one of the world centers of winemaking.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Tokaj is very beautiful and rich in attractions, but its main advantage is the wine, which has an exquisite and unique taste. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tokaj is located in northern Hungary at the foot of the hills at the confluence of two rivers: Tysy and Bodrog.  This is a small cozy old town with narrow streets.  It is located 54 kilometers from the administrative center of , the city of Hungary, Miskolc. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.1172148" data-lng="21.408901499999956" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/8/3/9/10839.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Tokaj is located at a distance of about 230 kilometers from Budapest.  The most convenient way to overcome this path is by taxi on the M3 highway.  In this case, the journey will take 2.5 hours.  Please note that some sections of the road are paid.  You can also use public transport. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  On the hillsides near the city are vineyards, beyond which you can see the river.  In the center of the village is Kossuth Square.  Next to it is Tokaya's main attraction - the stone porch of Rakoczi's 600-year-old wine cellars. </p><p>  The city is clean and tidy, and its buildings resemble fabulous scenery.  Almost every house has wine cellars.  The town has a lot of greenery, ornamental plants are planted in pots and arranged along the roads.  The fences and walls of buildings are buried in flowers.  There are many statues, sculptures and decorative lanterns on the streets.  In Tokai, a quiet and peaceful environment, devoid of fuss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecotour.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tokai city" class="if uuid-2928088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2928088.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting the friendliness and friendliness of the locals.  They call their city "multi-story."  But the floors do not go up, as is customary, but down.  These are adits that began to break through about 500 years ago.  Basements reach more than forty kilometers and form two to three floors.  They are moldy.  In these rooms the noble drink is stored. </p><p>  The population of Tokai city as of 2017 amounted to 4,155 people.  Despite its small size, the village is known all over the world.  Due to the unique climate, excellent grapes grow in its vicinity, from which delicious wine is made.  The name of the city is even mentioned in the national anthem, which is a great honor for a modest village. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The first information about the city appeared in the chronicles of the 11th century.  It is known that a fortress was built in its place, which was destroyed as a result of the Mongol-Tatar invasion.  Later it was again erected in stone form and more reliably strengthened.  The ruins of the fortress have survived to this day. </p><p>  The town has long been an important transportation hub.  On this territory two significant roads connected.  There was also a ferry across Tisu. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="m.geodruid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tisa in Tokai" class="if uuid-2928105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2928105.jpg"></div><p>  Since ancient times, winemaking has been developing in the city of Tokai in Hungary.  According to legend, the Romans for the first time brought to this earth a vine, which bore fruit the very next day. </p><p>  In the course of history, Tokai managed to visit a colony of several countries and survive many attacks, but the town survived and the grapes survived.  Thanks to the world famous drink, it is rich and known far beyond the borders of the state.  The city‚Äôs funds also increased due to the quarries discovered here. </p><p>  Hard times for Tokai came with the outbreak of World War I.  And in 1929, winter was marked by severe frosts, almost all grapes died.  Then followed the Second World War.  Things got better only after its completion. </p><p>  Today Tokaj in Hungary is one of the world centers of winemaking. </p><h2>  Tokay </h2><p>  The ancient city is full of legends.  One of them was mentioned earlier.  According to another legend, Tokayans guessed to harvest after the grapes turn into raisins.  During one of the invasions, local residents were forced to leave the city.  Upon their return, they found raisins instead of ripe fruits.  There was no other way out but to collect what was. </p><p>  After tasting the wine, the inhabitants of the city were surprised by its impeccable taste.  Polish merchants delivered the drink to Europe.  He competed with refined French wines and was appreciated by many rulers.  Peter the Great became one of the fans of Tokai wines.  In Russia, a special commission was created to supply the best varieties of the drink from Hungary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is some truth in the legend.  The main secret of Tokai wines lies in a unique microclimate.  In the autumn, rains and fogs often occur in this region, so the grapes become moldy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whichwinery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue grapes" class="if uuid-2928087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2928087.jpg"></div><p>  With the onset of the sunny period, the berries do not rot, but turn into raisins directly on the vine.  A drink from such raw materials acquires a unique taste.  Moldy cellars, where it "languishes," also play a role in the preparation of high-quality wine.  According to local traditions, only women pick grapes, and only men can make a drink. </p><h2>  Wine Region Tokaj Hedaglia </h2><p>  The center of the area is Tokai.  White wine is produced here.  Most of the region is located in Hungary, the rest - in Slovakia.  7,000 hectares of grapes are concentrated in the region, which grows in 28 villages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sktour.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tokaya vineyards" class="if uuid-2928091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2928091.jpg"></div><p>  The boundaries of the Tokai wine production area were documented in 1908.  At this time, Hungary and Slovakia were part of the Austro-Hungarian state.  After the division of the possessions of Slovakia, only seven villages passed.  In the middle of the 20th century, Hungary showed a trick by buying up all the Tokai wine of its neighbors and pouring it into its bottles.  After the Communists came to power, many technologies were disrupted, only in the 90s winemakers returned to old recipes. </p><p>  In 1989, a trial between the two countries began, which continues to the present.  The fact is that Slovakia has released its own cheap Tokay wine of high quality.  Hungarians continue to prove their trademark rights. </p><h2>  Tokaj city sights in Hungary and entertainment </h2><p>  During a trip to the ancient city, you should definitely visit the Rakotsi cellars.  This is truly a masterpiece of architecture.  Cellars built in the 15th century.  In 1526, Janos Zapolyai was crowned here, as a result of the reign of which the state collapsed.  Tourists, having gone down to the basement, have the opportunity to taste six varieties of wines and plunge into the atmosphere of history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whichwinery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wine Vault" class="if uuid-2928084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2928084.jpg"></div><p>  Right on the streets of the town you can see the ruins of a medieval castle.
