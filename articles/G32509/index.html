Reviews about this institution contain many positive comments and vivid impressions, among which it is worth noting: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is very clean and comfortable - the atmosphere is as pleasant as at home; </li><li>  pleased with the location in the city center, as well as the proximity to a huge park; </li><li>  the breakfast included in the price is delicious and satisfying; </li><li>  The important point is that you can stay with your pets at the hotel (here they provide all the necessary conditions); </li><li>  the hotel has a very quiet and peaceful environment, which is very important for those who want to fully relax after work or excursions; </li><li>  a good cosmetic kit that also includes toothbrushes; </li><li>  on each floor in the corridor there is a cooler with drinking water; </li><li>  the staff at the reception works very quickly, and therefore the registration procedure will not take you much time; </li><li>  Hotel staff are very polite, friendly and attentive; </li><li>  if you leave early in the morning, then, upon prior request, they will prepare breakfast for you at the right time for you; </li><li>  large comfortable beds with orthopedic mattresses, which are very comfortable to sleep on; </li><li>  a large assortment of dishes is presented at breakfast; </li><li>  the price for accommodation and other services is fully consistent with the quality; </li><li>  happy with the availability of free parking; </li><li>  the hotel windows have a very beautiful view (especially those rooms that overlook the temple side); </li><li>  if you forgot to charge from the phone or any other gadget, the reception staff will provide it to you; </li><li>  if you want to use the late check-out service, you will not have to pay an extra day, but only for the number of hours that you stayed in the room; </li><li>  wireless internet works great; </li><li>  the hotel has a business center with a huge selection of computer equipment; </li><li>  Each room has a reliable code safe; </li><li>  thanks to the huge windows, the rooms have a lot of light (due to this they visually seem even more spacious). </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects of living in this hotel, the following can be distinguished, which are the most significant: </p><ul><li>  plumbing is leaking in the bathroom, despite the fact that it is fairly new; </li><li>  as in many hotels, the bathroom provides bath and toiletries for only one guest (but after a call to the reception they quickly fix the situation); </li><li>  the blanket is very small, which is why it gets confused in the duvet cover, and it is also impossible for them to hide normally; </li><li>  on weekends, breakfast starts an hour later than usual, but the restaurant staff do not consider it necessary to warn about this; </li><li>  there are no closets in the rooms (the exception is deluxe - a two-room suite has enough space for this); </li><li>  due to the improper condition of the pipes, the tap water does not have a very pleasant smell;  in the minibar too modest set of drinks; </li><li>  the hotel is hard enough to find for the person who is first time in the city, and there are no corresponding signs in the vicinity; </li><li>  there is no special dryer for towels and linen; </li><li>  it would not hurt to hang signs on the doors that would suggest in which direction to open them; </li><li>  you will not be accepted by credit card if it is not registered on you personally. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel <span>"Green Park"</span> got its name due to its location near a huge green city park.  It is worth noting that the location of the hotel is one of its main advantages.  This is the central part of the city, and therefore you will have access to numerous infrastructure facilities and cultural attractions.  Very close is the famous temple of Alexander Nevsky.  But many guests are confused by the loud ringing of bells in the morning, and therefore specify where your room windows will go. </p><p>  It is worth noting that all hotel rooms, regardless of category and cost, are characterized by a high level of comfort.  Separately, I want to note the modern comfortable furniture of the Italian brand, known for its high quality standards.  All rooms are decorated in a pleasant red and white color scheme that looks very stylish and concise.  If we talk about executive apartments, then the classic style prevails in their interior.  Nevertheless, there were some unpleasant moments.  So, the plumbing in the bathroom is not very high quality, and therefore leaks strongly.  In addition, there are no conditions for drying clothes and towels. </p><p>  Special attention deserves the work of the restaurant.  The breakfast buffet includes dishes from the so-called European menu.  Here are several types of cereals, cheeses, meat, as well as confectionery and much more.  The dishes from the menu are also of high quality.  Nevertheless, there are some subtleties associated with the delivery of the order in the room.  So, regardless of whether you order a full dinner or just a cup of tea, you have to pay a fixed amount, which is not always beneficial.  Nevertheless, it is safe to say that the cost of dishes is fully consistent with their taste. </p>
