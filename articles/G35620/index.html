Maybe yes, but most likely not all, so read the article carefully.  A planetarium is an <span>optical device that</span> is necessary for the projection of images of stars, planets, the sun and other celestial bodies.  In this case, the brightness, position and <span>trajectory are</span> observed <span>.</span>  He can reproduce a picture of the sky, observed from anywhere in the Earth, both in the past and the future.  Such is the mini time machine.  This device is necessary for astronomers to conduct research, but also it is very loved by simple townsfolk who are interested in the mysteries of the universe.  Speaking about what a planetarium is, people often mean the very room with a hemispherical dome, where this device is installed and works, or the whole building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a planetarium" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643270.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  It dates back to the ancient world, the first instruments for studying the star galaxy date back to about the 6th century BC.  People then did not yet know what a planetarium was, but they were already trying to create a model of the Universe and track the laws that operate in it.  For example, the philosopher Anaximander, who lived even before Socrates, invented the celestial globe, where images of celestial bodies were applied to its surface.  Later, this device was repeatedly improved by various scientists, but they were united by one drawback - they represented the sky viewed from the outside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was tried to correct by German scientists under the leadership of <span>A. Olearia,</span> in 1650.  They proposed a model of the huge Gottorp globe, inside of which several people at once could observe the location of celestial bodies.  In parallel, there was an equally rapid development of devices that calculated their movement.  Finally, in 1855, the scientific world learned what a planetarium is.  O. Miller suggested using the inner surface of the sphere to project images of celestial bodies onto it.  The size, brightness and position of the stars were similar to what could be seen without the use of optics (which had not yet been) in the sky.  The picture was presented in dynamics, that is, it demonstrated daily movement. </p><h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  Today a lot has changed.  Powerful telescopes and satellites are available to us, which can constantly broadcast shooting of the starry sky in the immediate vicinity.  It is these data that are recorded and then transmitted to the dome.  This creates a powerful illusion of being in the open.  In addition, modern technology allows you to complement the impression of musical and speaker recordings, as well as special effects.  So the planetariums turned into real theaters, which not only teach, but also give the opportunity to experience an extraordinary adventure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home planetarium" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643272.jpg" width="500"></div>

It is the oldest in our country and is known throughout the world due to its enormous size.  His work has always been highly regarded by scientists.  He makes a great contribution to the training of specialists and makes it possible to conduct a variety of studies. </p><p>  The planetarium in Moscow deserves close attention not only among people associated with science.  Ordinary visitors come here much more often, because nowhere else will you see stars so close.  Today, a whole cycle of entertaining and educational excursions has been created that will be of interest to both adults and children.  The Big Star Hall, the University of Urania, and the interactive Lunarium work here.  In addition, there are two observatory towers, a 4D cinema and the Small Star Hall.  This is enough to enjoy the mysterious flickering of distant stars and gain new knowledge about our galaxy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="planetarium in Moscow" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum of Urania </h2><p>  This museum will be more interesting for adults.  In fact, these are chronicles of the development of astronomy.  <span>Models of ships</span> are located under the ceiling <span>,</span> and vehicles that previously lit the artificial sky in these walls are displayed along the walls.  It will be interesting to look at the first devices with which they used to make films about space.  You can see the globe of the constellations and the layout of Venus.  On the walls are photographs of the moon, nebulae, constellations.  There is also a stand of cosmic stones, where you can see a variety of meteorites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="observatory of the Moscow planetarium" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/643359.jpg" width="500"></div>

Going inside, you see a huge dome (diameter 25 meters) and a lot of seats.  In the center is the apparatus itself, the real pride of the local astronomers, the latest generation projector.  It is thanks to him that you will be able to fly to unknown worlds.  Next, visitors are asked to move the chairs to a horizontal position, and stars begin to light up under the dome.  The program consists of two parts, the first introduces the starry sky, the main constellations, nebulae, comets.  The second is an exciting journey into another world, one of the full-dome films: ‚ÄúSpace Clash‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack Holes‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmazing Telescope‚Äù, ‚ÄúJourney to the Stars‚Äù.  The image under the dome is complemented by special effects and sound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="planetarium observatory" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643275.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <h2>  Moscow Planetarium Observatory </h2><p>  Usually they get here after visiting the Great Star Hall.  To do this, you will have to go down to the second level of the museum and go straight to Sky Park.  This is also a kind of museum, the exhibits of which relate to the following sections: classical and ancient astronomy.  At the site, you can see Stonehenge, an earth globe of stunning proportions and several models of almost forgotten sundials. </p><p>  Next, your path will lie in one of the two towers.  This is a large and small observatory of the Moscow planetarium.  They are located on the territory of the astro site, among the copies of Stonehenge, pyramids and sundials.  These are two-story single-domed buildings.  On the second floor, in a spacious building, is a 300 mm telescope.  It is a sight pipe on a thick leg.  For his work, the dome opens in the right direction.  The design allows it to open at any desired degree, so it is very convenient to conduct observations.  Be sure to go here if you decide to visit the planetarium.  The observatory leaves the brightest impressions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a planetarium for children" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643276.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <h2>  The Last Hall - Lunarium </h2><p>  More precisely, these are two halls.  They clearly demonstrate what a planetarium is for children.  Here are devices familiar to us from the lessons of physics, they help to visually see various natural phenomena.  Everything can be touched, twisted, pumped.  For example, you can pump out air from a flask, create a vacuum and see how a ball flies in it.  Several guides work here at once, who explain the operation of devices and phenomena, and also talk about the features of our solar system.  There are devices showing plasma or the journey of <span>dry ice.</span>  And the main attraction is the simulator, on which you can practice the skills of connecting the ship with the space station.  In the lower hall you will find a huge number of interesting devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile planetarium" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643277.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <h2>  We study the starry sky at home </h2><p>  To do this, today there are a variety of devices called the "home planetarium."  They are different in size, power and functional loads.  But they have one principle - this is a projector that transmits the image of the starry sky to the ceiling.  The simplest models are more like nightlights, but the projection of a star image is an additional function.  The more expensive the model, the more images it can reproduce.  Imagine how wonderful it is to lie with your child in the evening and imagine that you are going on a trip, for example, to <span>the Andromeda nebula.</span>  Books with fairy tales will not be required for a long time, because you can compose your own each time, and a home planetarium will help you. </p><h2>  A true planetarium in your city </h2><p>  Not everyone was lucky to live in a city where there is such a wonderful facility.  Therefore, a mobile planetarium was created.  This wonderful invention will revive the boring lessons of astronomy, make them visual and colorful.  It is an inflatable dome, which is easy to install in the assembly hall.  Inside him on the mats are the children, and the magic begins.  On the inner surface you will see the projection of celestial bodies.  Films are shown using visual and audio effects.  The information is presented in an accessible form, there are ribbons adapted for children from 3 to 18 years.  Such classes are very different from a regular school lesson or reading material from textbooks.  This is an opportunity to live a space flight as if alive. </p>
