Coastal - a quiet village lying on the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãcoast</span> - is also quite popular.  Curiously, in the Crimea there are as many as three Coastal.  One in the western part of the peninsula, about 8 km from the village.  Nikolaevka, the second in the southern part, 9 km from the famous Foros, and the third in the eastern region, 8 km from Feodosia.  Here about this third village is our story. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Immediately two seas, Black and Azov, washed the glorious peninsula of Crimea.  Beregovoe - a small village lying in its eastern side - extends to the coast of the Black Sea.  From Yalta it is about 170 km, from Simferopol 125 km from the railway.  station and 135 km from the airport or 1.5-2.2 hours by taxi, and from Feodosia - only 8 km, which can be covered by bus in 20 minutes.  Its eastern border is the small salt lake Kuchuk-Adzhigol (Aschigol).  It does not have therapeutic mud, therefore it is not of great interest to vacationers.  It is separated from the Black Sea by a narrow Ak-Monai Isthmus, along which the Kerch highway is laid, crossing the village.  About a kilometer from the first lake lies the second, called Adzhigol.  It is slightly larger in size, also salty and also not medicinal.  Directly adjacent to this lake is the village of Primorsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea Coastal" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/959370.jpg" width="548"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there by public transport </h2><p>  Most people arrive by train or plane to Crimea.  The coastal area near Feodosia is relatively close to the capital of the Simferopol Peninsula and connected to it by the Theodosian P23 highway.  Get from the railway  Station or airport can be a direct "flight" by taking a taxi.  The trip will cost about 5000 rubles from the airport and about 3000 rubles from the station.  The official cost of a taxi (if ordered through a dispatcher) is 22 rubles / km.  You can get cheaper, but with transfers.  If you arrived in Simferopol by plane, you need to get to the central railway line by buses No. 49, 49a, minibuses No. 115, 98, 100 or trolleybuses No. 9, 55, 54  train station.  Ticket price - from 9 to 15 rubles.  From the station, walk on foot to the Spa Station, located 30-50 meters away.  From there, in the summer, literally every 10-12 minutes, direct or passing buses leave for Feodosia.  Ticket price from 350 rubles per person.  The journey takes about 2 hours.  In Feodosia you will have to change to a bus (minibus) No. 106 to Beregovoy.  In the afternoon they ‚Äúrun‚Äù every 7-10 minutes, and in the evening, that is, after 20-00, every 25-30 minutes.  The ticket costs 12 rubles. </p><h2>  How to get there by car </h2><p>  <span>By car to the Crimea</span> (Beregovoye, as we have already mentioned, is located here), you need to go along the Simferopol highway (M18) to Dzhankoy.  On this route there will be a <span>border crossing with Ukraine</span> and customs.  Faster this is done in the middle of the week at night. </p><p>  There is a second way to Beregovoye (Crimea) by car - already without customs, but with a ferry crossing.  On <span>the M4 highway,</span> you need to go to the ring, on which turn onto the road to the village of Kislyakovskaya (Krasnodar Territory), drive it and then follow through the Leningradskaya station to Staroderevyankovskaya, then to Kanevskaya, go onto the P268 highway leading to the famous Krasnaya Polyana on Timashevsk.  From this town you can get to Krasnodar, and then on the P251 highway to Temryuk.  Or drive along the road through Kalinin, Poltava to Slavyansk-on-Kuban and there already go to P251.  Follow this route to Temryuk, the port of ‚ÄúKavkaz‚Äù, there take the ferry to Kerch, and after that only 100 km will remain on the highway to Feodosia.  This path, of course, is more difficult, but, following them on vacation in Beregovoye, you can at the same time take a tour of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastal Crimea" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/959342.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure of the village </h2><p>  The village of Beregovoye (Crimea) is stretched along the coast.  Here, almost all infrastructure facilities are somehow related to tourism.  These are numerous <span>cafes, canteens, restaurants</span> (most work only in season), there is a local market, a lot of stalls along the village, where all sorts of necessary and not very small things are sold.  In Beregovoi there is one pharmacy (there are few drugs), a chain of shops, a specialized store selling Crimean wines, but there are no large supermarkets.  There is a small park ‚ÄúField of Miracles‚Äù here, where you can ride various attractions, discos, and tour agencies.  For living here there are pensions, hotels, estates, a very large selection of comfortable housing in the private sector. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The coast of Theodosia Bay, where the village of Beregovoye (Crimea) is located, is famous for its entire Golden Peninsula throughout the peninsula.  This name was given to him for a reason.  The coating here is really the color of gold, namely the yellow sand mixed with crushed shell.  On such a ground it is extremely pleasant to walk bare feet, as if you were getting a light massage.  Lying on such "gold" is also very pleasant, although sunbeds are always available throughout the entire beach (from 150 rubles per day).  The length of the Golden Beach is about 15 km, the width is about 90-100 meters, so there are no crowds of people here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beregovoe Crimea" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/959366.jpg" width="528"></div>  And in the morning, even in summer, the beach in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Beregovoye (Crimea) seems deserted.  The photo confirms this perfectly.  In addition to its impressive size, the beach has excellent equipment, including sun loungers, awnings, <span>sunshades,</span> cafes, kiosks selling drinks and snacks, water activities.  The entire long golden beach is divided into individual beaches, each of which has its own name.  For example, ‚ÄúScarlet Sails‚Äù, ‚Äú17th km‚Äù, ‚ÄúHomeland of the World‚Äù and others.  They differ only in their location relative to the village and minibus stops, which are as many as 4 pieces in the village of Beregovoye (Crimea).  Reviews about the beach are enthusiastic.  The only thing that annoys holidaymakers a bit is the boulders when entering the sea.  But these stones are placed there specifically for the delay of algae, sometimes brought by waves and storms.  If not for these stones, the sea in Beregovoy would have been much dirtier.
