    <h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  First of all, you need to properly assess your financial capabilities.  This question is very important, even if a person looking for housing is well off.  The price of an apartment is reflected even in the cost of notary services, in the amount of tax that will have to be paid in the future. </p><p>  Factors affecting the price: </p><ul><li>  location of the building; </li><li>  the material from which the house is built (for example, panel objects are less valuable than brick objects); </li><li>  availability of infrastructure; </li><li>  the footage and layout of housing, although if we are talking about a new building, this question, as a rule, does not arise; </li><li>  the presence of repair; </li><li>  number of storeys of the whole house and the floor on which housing is sold; </li><li>  type of heating.  In conditions of high tariffs, this factor has become of great importance. </li></ul><p>  There are still tips when buying an apartment that allows you not to get into trouble.  Be sure to analyze the supply and demand for similar real estate.  It is no secret that within the boundaries of a big city, the price of housing is many times higher than its cost.  Therefore, there is a certain ‚Äúrun-up‚Äù in prices, and if they offer too cheap housing, then there are probably any problems with it.  This may be a large debt for utility bills, poor condition of house communications or problems with documents of title.  If it is not possible to determine the reason, then you can contact an independent expert and evaluate the housing you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Construction may drag on for years, so if housing is urgently needed, you will have to stop at the secondary real estate market. </p><p>  Resellers - this is real estate that has already been and is someone else owns.  When purchasing such residential square meters, you should carefully analyze the documents of title so that in the future you do not encounter the problem of the appearance of any relatives or children of the former owner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Selection of options </h2><p>  Fortunately, when the Internet appeared, there were more opportunities to search for any products.

    <h2>  View </h2><p>  Make arrangements for viewing in the daytime, even if it will be a day off.  You should not go to this event alone.  First of all, information is perceived more objectively if someone is nearby.  When a person, he is more emotional and can make a hasty and wrong decision. </p><p>  Be sure to evaluate not only the apartment inside, but also the staircase.  The house itself should not have cracks.  Talk to your neighbors if possible.  Walk around the area, see how close the school or preschool institution is, how much time you will have to spend to get to the transport. </p><p>  When you come to view a secondary housing apartment, never take money with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you are inspecting an apartment on the top floor, then pay attention to whether there are streaks on the ceiling and walls.  A large number of carpets, especially on the walls, should lead to certain thoughts.  The same goes for corner apartments.  It is desirable that the house was completely insulated, in extreme cases, only the apartment that is being purchased.  The apartment on the ground floor should not have a smell from the basement. </p><p>  Inspect the utility rooms, the pipes should be in good condition, and the water pressure should be strong.  Ideally, the house should not be more than 10 years old. </p>

    <h2>  Deposit </h2><p>  The deposit and advance are taken into account when calculating the apartment.  The size is set by agreement of the parties, depending on the cost of housing.  But at the time of transfer of the deposit between the parties an agreement should already be reached on what price there will be an alienation.  You can get a receipt from the seller, conclude a deposit agreement or a preliminary <span>sale contract</span> , in which you can fix the time of transfer of money and the full value of the transaction. </p><p>  It is better to conclude a deposit agreement when purchasing secondary apartments with full compliance with all requirements of the civil code, namely, to provide for: </p><ul><li>  if the seller, after receiving the money, continues to try to sell the housing, then he undertakes to return the deposit in half; </li><li>  If the buyer refuses the transaction, the deposit is not refundable. </li></ul><p>  An appeal to a notary will not be superfluous to confirm the seriousness of the intentions of the parties.  In a notary's office, you can assure a preliminary contract or <span>an agreement on a deposit,</span> or you can both. </p><h2>  Preparing for a deal </h2><p>  <span>How to buy an apartment without a realtor?</span>  <span>In the step-by-step instruction, the</span> <span>next step is to resolve the issue with payment: when will it be carried out, before registration of transfer of ownership or after.</span>  It‚Äôs more profitable for the buyer to pay after registering housing rights in Rosreestr;  It eliminates the risks of losing money.  The seller wants to receive funds before contacting the registration service, so as not to lose money and housing at the same time.  To solve this problem is quite simple - the conclusion of an agreement with a bank for the rental of a <span>bank cell.</span>  Naturally, the service is paid, but each side has an additional guarantee, and the costs can be divided in half. </p>

    <h2>  Registration of the transaction and transfer of rights </h2><p>  To date, the notarial completion of such transactions is optional.  The transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer should be registered in the register of rights to real estate.  Nevertheless, it is recommended to use the services of a notary's office, especially if the buyer has not previously had such experience.  Compared with real estate prices, the cost of notary services does not seem high.  This specialist has a law degree and relevant experience.  He will be able to correctly draw up an agreement, foresee the risks, if necessary, confirm the fact of the transfer of funds and the legal capacity of individuals - participants in the transaction. </p><p>  Making an apartment purchase is not limited to the conclusion of an agreement.  Now you have to go to the registration service.  Both parties are required to register ownership.  The following documents must be submitted: </p><ul><li>  documents confirming the identity of both parties to the transaction; </li><li>  contract of sale; </li><li>  cadastral passport for housing; </li><li>  if the seller has children, then a document from the guardianship authorities will be required; </li><li>  if the seller and the buyer have spouses, then a notarized consent to the sale from him will be required, respectively, to the acquisition, if the housing is not acquired in common ownership; </li><li>  receipt of state duty. </li></ul><p>  Before going to the registration department, it is better to clarify the full list of documents for buying an apartment. </p><h2>  Real estate transfer and full settlement </h2><p>  As soon as the transfer of ownership is completed, the seller receives all the money from the bank cell. </p><p>  The final stage is the transfer of the apartment to the new owner.  By the way, the conditions for the transfer of the apartment and the terms must be specified in the contract.  Often, the contract itself indicates the list of transferred property, it may be furniture, built-in appliances.  If the list is long, then an act is compiled.  This document is important to both the buyer and seller.  The buyer clearly understands that he will be handed over to him along with the walls, and the seller - that they will no longer require anything from him, especially since it is useless.  The main thing is not to forget to add that the parties have no complaints against each other. </p>

    <h2>  Registration </h2><p>  In secondary housing (apartment or house), you can register at the place of arrival immediately after obtaining ownership. </p><h2>  What to watch out for </h2><p>  Due to the high cost of real estate in this market, a huge number of fraudsters and unscrupulous sellers who illegally obtain housing documents, forge them and try to sell square meters as quickly as possible.  Therefore, all documents, both establishing the right and confirming the identity, must be carefully checked.  Do not rush to a too low price, even -10% of the average market value should alert.  Perhaps this is not an urgent sale due to travel outside the country, but the seller is simply hiding some facts that could affect the transaction. </p><p>  More nuances and features of buying an apartment: </p><ul><li>  In order to prevent the loss of the deposit, conclude a preliminary contract with the seller that does not allow him to look for new buyers after receiving the advance payment. </li><li>  Refuse the transaction if an authorized person acts instead of the owner, even if the power of attorney is drawn up in accordance with all the rules.  It may turn out that the person issuing the power of attorney has already ‚Äúleft this light‚Äù, then the transaction can be easily recognized as invalid. </li><li>  Remember that a person who is in prison has the right to a share in the apartment, so you need to carefully study the house book and interview your neighbors so that after a few years you will not meet a recidivist who has left the prison and has nowhere to live on the threshold of his apartment. </li></ul><p>  In principle, the answer to the question of <span>how to buy an apartment</span> on your <span>own</span> should not arise.  Most realtors themselves do not know what to do in some situations.  You can learn this craft only in practice, but you don‚Äôt want to be an ‚Äúexperimental rabbit,‚Äù and even pay money for it.  Therefore, if something is not clear, it is better to consult with a lawyer.  You yourself need to be vigilant and careful when checking documents and making decisions. </p>
