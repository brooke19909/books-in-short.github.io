    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  <span>"Micromax Q380"</span> turned out to have a very attractive appearance <span>, the reviews</span> confirm this.  The coating is pleasant to the touch and does not slip, so there is no need to constantly fear that the gadget will fall out of hand.  It was noted that the paint from the frame imitating the metal frame peels off over time, in this regard, the aesthetic side of the Micromax Q380 suffers. </p><p>  The battery cannot be replaced, and this aspect has caused both negative and approval reactions from the public.  The fact that the old battery cannot be replaced with a new one outrages many.  Other users, on the contrary, believe that in this way the developers managed to achieve a smaller thickness, which is why the gadget has become more convenient to use. </p><p>  Although the battery is mounted, the back cover is still disconnected, as there are connectors for all kinds of cards inside.  The presence of two SIM cards is always a plus, especially when they have slots separate from the memory cards, which allows for simultaneous work with two SIM cards at once and an increase in memory for storing data via a flash drive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen Views </h2><p>  Bright and attractive display "Micromax Q380" with good viewing angles caused a storm of positive emotions among the owners of the device.  The information is perfectly distinguishable even on a bright sunny day, and <span>viewing the image</span> from different angles does not cause any problems.  Owners are pleased with the bright color palette, thanks to which it is a pleasure to watch pictures or photos on the device. </p><p>  All the negative reviews regarding the display are mainly directed towards the low resolution, which does not reach 720 r, while the competitors of the device from the same budget category are quite able to please their owners with an HD image.  This drawback is the most significant in the entire "Micromax Q380".  The reviews say that in a static position the picture looks attractive and clear, but during games or watching videos, pixels begin to appear on the screen, the video is blurred and loses its attractiveness, which makes it completely uninteresting to watch movies on the smartphone or use it as a game console </p>

    <h2>  Conflicting opinions about hardware </h2><p>  Although the Mikromax Q380 phone has acquired an advanced platform, many criticize it, as well as the work of the technical component of the device as a whole.  There are frequent freezes, glitches and a long wait when loading: for some users, applications open for 5 seconds.  Rebooting for some time corrected the situation, but then the problem arose again - the smartphone eventually went to the service for repair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the processor, the reviews were divided: four cores are enough to solve their problems, while others believe that the phone must work with more resource-intensive software, and such an architecture is completely insufficient.  Owners complain that 1 GB of RAM is too little RAM.  It is believed that it is the shortage of RAM that is the cause of the incorrect operation of the system and failures during the use of multitasking in "Micromax Q380".  The reviews of other consumers all refer to the fact that the smartphone belongs to the budget category, and you should not expect any miracles from it in terms of performance. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the opinions of the owners turned out to be so contradictory due to the varying degrees of evaluation of the device.  Those who are satisfied with the stuffing of the model, apparently, do not need complex applications and advanced games, and for simple software and the Internet there is enough a quad-core processor.  Critics expected the gadget to be more productive with the ability to run demanding programs and games.  Their requests require a smartphone from a more advanced segment. </p><p>  As for the long downloads and interruptions in the system, this problem can be called objective, since almost everyone to one degree or another complained about the phone freezing, the long opening of files and other problems with functioning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smartphone "Micromax Q380": camera reviews </h2><p>  The main camera was recognized as one of the most significant advantages of the smartphone.  8 megapixels with autofocus do their job well, allowing you to achieve pictures of very decent quality for a phone of this segment.  Macro shooting works great, because of which the <span>image stabilizer</span> easily switches between distant and near objects.  It is also worth noting the clarity of photographs of text documents: letters and numbers are perfectly read in pictures, there is no blur.  Of course, all this applies to shooting in good light or in the daytime.  Optics behaves somewhat worse at night and with a deficit of light. </p>

    <h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  The selfie camera has only 2 megapixels, so you can‚Äôt call it a quality one.  But the owners are already satisfied with the fact that it is present, and this is not a simple 0.3 megapixel optics installed for a tick, but a full-fledged camera that allows you to take a selfie picture if necessary and use it, for example, as an avatar on social networks. </p><h2>  Video camera </h2><p>  A video camera was also adopted, which allows you to receive videos with a resolution of 720 r.  Users are somewhat confused that the optics only shoots at a frequency of 15 frames / s, not 30, but still the videos come out pretty good.  The image slows down a little, but for viewing on small screens it is quite suitable. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  No one had any problems with sound and conversational speakers: high-quality and loud sound was noted above the average level.  Troubles begin with a headset.  <span>Vacuum headphones are</span> supplied <span>,</span> but users note that they are of very poor quality and you will need to purchase a more advanced headset to listen to music.  But even expensive headphones do not allow you to truly enjoy the music player in the "Micromax Q380": reviews mention a quiet sound, unacceptable quality and almost complete lack of bass.  There are some playback settings, but they don‚Äôt really change the picture.  In this aspect, the device failed. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Many praise the autonomous operation of the device, claiming that even with the active use of the gadget, the charge lasts for a sufficiently long period of time.  Other owners of 2000 mAh are not enough, so they complain about the low battery performance, and if you take into account that you can‚Äôt change it, the battery is instantly recorded in minuses. </p><p>  A large percentage of buyers claim that the device charges for a very long time: for some it takes about 3 hours.  There were also cases when the gadget did not react at all to the charger, and it had to be taken to the service. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, having examined the Mikromax Q380 phone, customer reviews and its cost of about 5,390-6,990 rubles, you can understand that the opinions of users are ambiguous on most of the device‚Äôs parameters.  Some understand: the <span>device is budgetary</span> and you should not expect much from it, so the screen, battery and technical specifications are quite worth the money.  Others want too much from a gadget of such a plan.  Naturally, in such a smartphone it is not so easy to shove an acceptable camera, a good processor and a lot of memory at the same time.  To please users, for example, with a decent quality camera, on which it would not be embarrassing to take pictures, developers will have to neglect something else, say, the same audio player.  True, there are some unequivocal advantages and disadvantages, but for the most part everyone has a subjective opinion. </p>

    <h2>  Clear pros and cons </h2><p>  Phone "Micromax Q380" reviews, although it is different, but still has objective advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  Pros - IPS-matrix and screen brightness, the main camera with a large set of functions, HD-video shooting, compact size, attractive design, good build, loud speaker. </p><p>  Cons - low screen resolution, long recharging battery, system instability, freezes, long file opening, weak multitouch, designed for only two touches. </p><p>  On all other parameters, opinions were divided approximately equally, so here everyone must decide for himself.  Perhaps, if the developers had lowered the price of the device by at least 1000 rubles or simply added a high resolution, the smartphone received a more cordial welcome from users. </p>
