Yes, life here is actually calmer and more measured.  Many residents work, study or spend their free time in Moscow.  There are those who, by all means, one day seek to move there. </p><p>  Recently, however, a very interesting trend has been observed - tired of the commotion, traffic jams and the everlasting flow of people, Muscovites are moving to a permanent residence in the province.  For example, in Krasnogorsk, Schelkovo or the same Chekhov (Moscow region).  The map can show the mass of such satellite towns willingly accepting elderly people, retired military men and young families with small children. </p>

    <p>  As mentioned above, the town was founded 60 years ago on the site of the village of Lopasnya, and it was named after the famous Russian writer A.P. Chekhov, who lived for almost seven years near the city, in the Melikhov estate.  It was here that his best works were written. </p><p>  Chekhov also houses the Lopasnya-Zachatievskoye estate, where relatives and descendants of A.S. Pushkin lived.  Many of them are buried in the family crypt of the Pushkins, located on this estate.  Here the widow of A.S. Pushkin liked to spend time with children.  The manor in Lopasne belonged to the sisters of Peter Lansky, who was married to Natalia Goncharova after the death of Pushkin in a duel. </p><p>  As we see, many great people of the country were attracted by these places, including the city of Chekhov.  The Moscow region has long been famous for its unique nature, forests, lakes and rivers.  So, there is nothing surprising in this attraction for creative people.  That was as it should be. </p><h2>  Section 4. City Life Today </h2>

    <p>  In fact, the city of Chekhov (Moscow region) is amazing and unique, the sights of which often come to see not only from the capital, but also from near and far abroad. </p><p>  It is known that the famous Russian writer, after whom the settlement was named, paid great attention to the life of the peasants, it was thanks to him that schools and paramedic centers appeared in the district, and a post office was built near the station in Lopasna.  The writer sent and received all his correspondence through this post office.  The post office has been preserved to this day.  It restored the interior of that time and opened a museum of Chekhov letters. </p><p>  The appearance of the provincial town has changed with the help of attracting foreign investment.  The young city is constantly being built up; modern residential areas and hotels are appearing.  Recently, a new bus station, the Ice Palace and the huge Sports Palace have been built.  This is precisely the architectural wealth and pride of Chekhov near Moscow. </p><h2>  Section 7. Monasteries and Temples </h2><p>  Not far from the Lopasni River is the former Sadki estate, which belonged to the Eropkin family until the middle of the 19th century.  Here is a small temple of the Beheading of the Head I. Baptist, built in 1771 in memory of Peter Eropkin.  Architect Eropkin was the creator of the master plan of St. Petersburg and the translator of Palladio into Russian.  In 1740 he was accused of conspiracy against the favorite of the Empress Anna Ioannovna - Biron - and executed.  After the revolution, the house burned down.  Recently it was restored, but only from brick. </p><p>  On the other side of the river, the buildings of the Zachatievskoye estate were preserved - the five-domed church of the Conception of Anna (late 17th century) with an empire bell tower and a restored one-story house (1770).  The lands belonged to the Vasilchikovs.  Now the Pushkin Nest Museum is open in the house.  The descendants of the poet loved to visit this estate, since the second husband of Pushkin‚Äôs widow, Peter Lanskoy, was a close relative of the estate owners.  The son, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of A. S. Pushkin are buried in the cemetery of the estate. </p><h2>  Section 8. Tourist note </h2>
