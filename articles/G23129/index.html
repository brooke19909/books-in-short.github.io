In this list, Sberbank in terms of mortgage secondary housing takes first place.  This is due to the fact that this institution has a huge number of programs for individuals and private entrepreneurs.  As a rule, customers prefer to issue loans for the purchase of living space.  Apartments that can be purchased under construction or newly built houses are very popular.  However, many people still prefer to buy real estate in the secondary housing market. </p>

    <h2>  Standard conditions for loans of this type </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the registration of a mortgage for secondary housing in Sberbank or finding suitable housing for ownership, it is better to find out the conditions that a credit institution offers.  First of all, it is necessary to consider that such loans are targeted.  Accordingly, the funds will be issued exclusively for the acquisition of real estate.  Spending money on something else the client has no right. </p><p>  In addition, there is a minimum amount that a client can receive.  Under the terms of the mortgage secondary housing in Sberbank, it is 300 thousand rubles.  There are also certain restrictions on loan terms.  Today, this period is 30 years at Sberbank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the duration of the consideration of applications from borrowers, then, as a rule, it all depends on what documents the citizen provided when drawing up the corresponding loan.  As a rule, in order to take a mortgage for secondary housing in Sberbank, you must confirm the presence of a permanent place of work and salary.  In some situations, the bank may go towards the client and consider the application without these documents.  As a rule, such a loyal attitude is in favor of holders of salary or pension cards. </p>

    <p>  <span>The percentage of mortgages for secondary housing</span> in Sberbank directly depends on how long the loan was received, its amount and many other parameters.  In addition, today there is a special program for young families.  According to its conditions, the interest rate will be lowered.  In addition, spouses have the right to receive additional subsidies and benefits from local authorities at the place of registration. </p><h2>  Features of Bank Loans </h2><p>  If we compare the acquisition of real estate in a <span>new building or secondary</span> housing market, the difference is small.  Of course, the first difference is the percentage of overpayments.  If real estate is purchased in an old house, then, as a rule, the interest <span>rate of Sberbank</span> on a mortgage for secondary housing will be 10.5% per annum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When it comes to new buildings, you will have to pay a little more - 11.5%.  However, again, it all depends on the specific situation.  In addition to bonuses for young families, there are also preferential conditions for Sberbank customers who have been holding credit, debit or pension cards for a long time. </p><p>  Based on this, an interest rate increase may also occur.  For example, it will be increased by 0.5% if the client does not have a card to which the salary is transferred.  Before the accommodation is registered by the client, he will also have to pay another extra percentage.  Overpayment increases by 1% if the borrower refuses to take out life and health insurance.  Also, an increase is provided if the borrower did not provide a certificate confirming the information on income.  Based on this, the difference in overpayment can be about 4%, depending on specific conditions. </p><h2>  Sberbank: mortgage for secondary housing, interest rate and down payment </h2><p>  If we talk about the size of the 1st payment, it directly depends on the payment term.  If the client, as a usual contribution, is ready to make 50% of the total cost of housing, then if paid before the expiration of 30 years, the interest rate will be 13%. </p>

    <p>  If under the same conditions the mortgage is paid in the period up to 20 years, then the overpayment will be reduced to 12.75%.  If the client cannot provide such an impressive down payment, he can pay from 30 to 50% of the price of the apartment.  In this case, for a period of up to 30 years, he will be able to pay off the debt with an overpayment of 13.25%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If payments are made within 10 years, this figure will drop to 12.75%.  The largest <span>mortgage rate for</span> secondary housing in Sberbank will be waiting for those who make a down payment from 20 to 30% of the total cost of housing.  In this case, with a maximum loan term of up to 30 years, the overpayment will be 13.5%. </p><p>  Based on this, it becomes obvious that the longer the payment and the lower the first payment, the greater the interest per annum.  Therefore, before applying for a mortgage of secondary housing in Sberbank, it is worth several times to weigh your options and think.  It may be much more profitable to wait a few years, but to make a down payment more and ultimately lose a lot less money on commissions.  Over 30 years, the savings will be impressive. </p><h2>  How to get a mortgage? </h2><p>  This program was created for those customers who want to buy an apartment house or any other living object about which it is located in the real estate market. </p><p>  In order to receive money, first of all, you need to fill out the form, which can be found on the official website of the credit institution.  By the way, right there customers can calculate a mortgage for secondary housing in Sberbank. </p><p>  This document is scary for some, as it consists of 6 sheets.  However, the more accurately the client fills in all the data, the greater the likelihood that he will receive money. </p>

    <p>  The application must contain the personal data of the applicant and his contact information.  Also in the application it is necessary to write the purpose of the loan.  After filling out all the necessary papers, it is enough to visit the bank branch.  You must have a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation with you and additional documents to confirm your identity.  And besides this, it is necessary to provide a certificate in the form of 2 personal income tax. </p><h2>  Mortgage in Sberbank for secondary housing in 2017 </h2><p>  To date, according to the bank‚Äôs program, the minimum loan amount should be from 300 thousand rubles.  There is also the smallest interest rate on loans, which is 10.25%.  This minimum is provided exclusively for Sberbank's ‚ÄúMortgage to a Young Family‚Äù program for secondary housing. </p><p>  In order to obtain this status, it is necessary that the spouses have at least 3 children.  In all other cases, the interest rate may vary depending on the specific loan amount, customer income, down payment and loan term. </p><h2>  The process of registration of mortgages for secondary housing </h2><p>  After filling out the questionnaire and providing all the necessary documents, the bank operator must wait for a positive decision from the head office.  Next, a selection of certain secondary housing is made.  When everything is ready, the client is provided with a loan agreement, which he must study and sign in detail.  After this, the registration of rights to residential real estate in Rosreestr is made.  At the final stage, the client receives the desired mortgage of secondary housing in Sberbank. </p><h2>  Can I get a loan without down payment? </h2><p>  Many are interested in the possibility of receiving funds without obligatory making primary payments.  It is worth saying that today there is no such service or program in Sberbank. </p>

    <p>  The only way to avoid the initial cash deposit is to use maternity capital instead, if the borrower really has the right to do so.  In all other cases, customers must pay at least 20% of the total value of the property. </p><h2>  Loan amount and down payment </h2><p>  If the client plans to purchase real estate located in St. Petersburg or the capital of the Russian Federation, then the maximum loan amount under the basic program can be up to 15 million rubles.  If we are talking about the region or other regions of the Russian Federation, then the limit does not exceed 8 million. </p><p>  At the same time, the minimum threshold for receiving funds has been reduced for residents of small settlements.  Today it is 45 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If a serviceman plans to get a mortgage for secondary housing in Sberbank, then the maximum loan amount will be calculated based on NIS deductions. </p><h2>  Additional terms </h2><p>  Mortgages are always considered individually.  First of all, bank employees pay attention to the borrower's income level, and the period of time that he works in one place. </p>

    <p>  If the client does not meet the requirements of the organization, then he can attract co-borrowers.  They can be represented by family members.  In this case, the total income of the entire family will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Property Requirements </h2><p>  Sberbank puts forward yet another demand for its borrowers.  The housing they want to purchase must meet the indicator of stable liquidity.  Accordingly, the state of the building in which the apartment is located and the fact how worn it is will be considered.  If the house is too old and, according to experts, its depreciation is more than 60%, then there is a high probability of refusing to receive funds. </p><p>  The building should not belong to a variety of dilapidated structures.  Houses that are being demolished or in need of major repairs are also undesirable.  The apartment must have central water supply, heating, cold and hot water. </p><h2>  Features of the preparation of documents </h2><p>  After the borrower has received a positive response to his application, he is given 60 days to collect an additional set of documents for the acquired property. </p><p>  It is also worth considering the program under which a citizen receives a loan.  If he chose a standard mortgage for two documents, then only they and the completed application form are required of him.  When it comes to military personnel, in addition to the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, they must provide a certificate of participation in the NIS. </p><p>  If maternity capital is used as the initial payment, you must attach the necessary certificate and paper from the PF. </p><h2>  The nuances of mortgage clearance </h2><p>  As in any other credit institution, Sberbank prefers an individual approach to a specific client.  Thanks to this, at any stage of processing or collecting documents, a citizen of the Russian Federation has the full right to contact employees by telephone or in person with questions. </p><p>  After all the documents are collected and the paper relating to real estate is submitted, a loan agreement is signed and insurance is issued.  At the same time, you should definitely carefully study the contract and do not hesitate to ask the operator an extra question.  The fact is that in some cases, the contract provides for additional paid options, for example, SMS alerts on a mobile phone.  They can be disabled at the request of the client. </p><h2>  Resale Mortgage Reviews </h2><p>  Since Sberbank is reliable and stable, it is very popular among customers.  However, some note that interest in this case is not the most attractive. </p>

    <p>  In addition, many drew attention to the large package of documents that must be provided for the application.  Among other things, mortgage lending involves several stages.  Accordingly, the client is forced to spend additional time on visiting the department once again. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering the main positive side of Sberbank - the reliability of the credit institution. </p><h2>  Mortgage for secondary housing in other banks </h2><p>  If we say that Sberbank has too high interest rates, then you should pay attention to the same programs in other credit organizations. </p><p>  For example, in VTB24 the overpayment will be at least 13-14%.  If the customer contacts Gazprombank, the commission will be at least 12%.  In the "Agricultural Bank" you can get loans with an overpayment of 11.5-15.5%.  At Alfa Bank, the minimum interest rate will be 11%. </p><p>  In addition, most credit organizations do not have as many bonus and preferential programs as in Sberbank.  Therefore, before obtaining a loan it is worth several times to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages. </p>
