  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Science as a form of social consciousness, forming relationships at the level of each community member.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern society, science is a rather significant and important component of modern culture.  Scientific thought involves the development and knowledge of very important social issues related to culture, social problems and so on.  Science as a form of social consciousness, enters into a relationship with people.  With the help of various fields of science, <span>modern man</span> comprehends the world around him, recognizes the processes occurring in him.  Each person comprehends some specific knowledge that contributes to his further development and interaction with other people who surround him.  Science as a form of social consciousness began to form in the 17th century, which at that time contributed to significant changes in people's thinking and the change in their way of life, which occurred with the development of science. </p><p><br>  Since that time, people's thinking began to change, it was increasingly based not on conjecture and speculation, but on the laws of nature that appeared and some facts.  Modern science has also not stopped in development, it is constantly evolving, introducing ever newer changes in the consciousness of modern man.  Nowadays, the development is taking place at a very fast pace in the field of technology and the latest technologies that directly affect a person.  Science as a <span>form of social consciousness</span> is more and more manifested in the life of modern man, capturing his mind with his own foundations.  The bulk of people shape their thoughts regarding <span>scientific facts</span> and laws; now there are very few who think abstractly and do not compare their thoughts with scientific discoveries.  It is difficult to say who is really right, those who hold science or those who do not hold, perhaps after some time humanity will comprehend all aspects and directions of modern science and then it will be possible to draw a conclusion. <br>  In human life, there are two types of <span>knowledge, scientific</span> and empirical; according to empirical knowledge, many believe that a person can do well without science, as it has been for many centuries.  The main difference between science and empirical knowledge is that science penetrates the main essence of objects and ongoing processes, and empirical knowledge covers only general features, of some objects or actions.  Science as a form of social consciousness is almost completely formed in modern man and now it will be very difficult for her to leave him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><br>  At the moment, there are many very important areas of science that closely interact with the life of every person.  One of the fairly young and very important sciences of mankind is psychology, it forms the main features of human behavior.  <span>Psychology as a science</span> of consciousness was formed in the 19th century and has been developing intensively since then.  While it is still at the initial stage of its development, people have learned a lot of things related to human behavior and thinking, but still, this is only the beginning.  Psychology as a science of consciousness allows us to understand human thoughts, to predict its future actions, feelings and things that move it in a certain direction. In other words, it helps to identify the main motives that move a person when committing certain actions. If the motives are defined correctly, then if necessary, they can be quite effectively corrected. This is the main value of research methods in psychology. <br>  We should not forget that each person has his rights and obligations to the surrounding society, which are summarized in certain laws.  Modern <span>legal science</span> formulates legal awareness, including these laws, forming a kind of scientific basis from them. Ideally, legal awareness, that is, recognition and observance of laws, is the basis on which a modern person carries out the process of life and interacts with people around him. </p>
