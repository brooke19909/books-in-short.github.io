All conditions for a comfortable stay are created for them here.  The hotel does not accept tourists with animals, even with prior arrangement.  A 24-hour fitness center with the latest cardio equipment is available for guests. </p><p>  Many tourists wonder if there is a pool at the Hilton Hotel (Kazan).  Unfortunately, the institution cannot boast of an artificial reservoir. </p><h2>  Rules of residence and registration </h2><p>  Guests at the hotel are accepted with identification documents.  Check-in is at 14.00, and check-out is at 12.00.  If necessary, you can use the early booking service.  Hotel reservations must be made in advance, as there may not be rooms available upon arrival. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  The Hilton Hotel is located in Kazan, at Chernyshevsky 21., and to be precise, at the intersection of Bauman and Chernyshevsky.  Such a convenient location in the city center makes it attractive for all categories of tourists.  It is convenient to stop for people who have come to Kazan on business.  And for ordinary travelers who want to see city sights, settling in the center is incredibly convenient.  The fact is that in the immediate vicinity are all the most interesting objects.  Hilton Hotel (Kazan) is located just a five-minute walk from the National Museum, the Kazan Kremlin and the Drama Theater.  If you came to the city for its beauties, it is most convenient to stay in the historical center so as not to waste time on long trips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reservation.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Interiors" class="if uuid-2963651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2963651.jpg"></div><p>  Metro and train stations are within walking distance of the Double Three Bay Hilton Hotel (Kazan).  From the Kazan airport to the hotel can be reached in 25 minutes.  The hotel will certainly appeal to all fans of the Hilton chain.  Many experienced travelers prefer hotels only on this chain. </p><p>  The convenient location of the Hilton Hotel in Kazan plays a significant role in its popularity.  Not every institution can boast such a convenient place.  Even if you arrived in the city by public transport, you can quickly get to the right place by bus and metro. </p><p>  The Hilton Hotel in Kazan (we specified the address of the institution earlier) is the first network complex in Tatarstan.  Beautiful interiors are designed in the best traditions of European architecture with oriental elements.  The hotel is housed in a nineteenth-century mansion decorated with antique pilasters.  But at the same time, the latest technology was used to equip the building.  In the hotel complex, the past and the present are wonderfully connected.  A similar mix is ‚Äã‚Äãtypical for the whole of Kazan.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is 5.5 thousand square meters, in which there are 93 rooms. </p><p>  A real symbol of the establishment is a warm chocolate chip cookie, which can be considered a compliment. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is able to meet the needs of the most demanding guests.  Since the institution opened not so long ago, its apartments and interiors invariably delight guests.  The windows of the rooms have a good view of the city.  All are well equipped with the latest technology.  And yet, despite the status of the hotel, tourists note the presence of certain shortcomings.  During large arrivals maids do not always cope with cleaning.  Although in general the quality of their work is at their best. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reservation.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton Hotel in Kazan" class="if uuid-2963656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2963656.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has air conditioning and heating, thanks to which the optimum temperature is maintained.  But even here sometimes malfunctions occur.  In the cold season, you have to wait until the apartment heats up.  A serious drawback of the institution is the walled-up windows in the rooms.  The lack of natural ventilation does not allow the access of clean air. </p><p>  The hotel provides daily cleaning and replacement of towels, as well as replenishment of drinks and detergents.  If you want to have a more presentable view from the window, then book rooms facing the street, not the courtyard.  This nuance must be specified in advance, otherwise upon arrival it is not always possible to replace the apartment.  The rest of the rooms are worthy of all praise. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  When booking rooms, you should pay attention to the fact that you need breakfast.  You can choose accommodation without meals and with him.  In the restaurant of the Hilton Hotel (Kazan) buffet breakfast.  According to guests, a morning meal will allow you to have a good meal.  At the buffet there is a sufficient selection of dishes: yogurts, cereals, chicken, pastries, fresh vegetables and fruits, cheeses, salads, sausages.  In general, you definitely will not leave hungry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Food establishment" class="if uuid-2963679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2963679.jpg"></div><p>  You can have a great time and have dinner at the Kedr restaurant, which presents Tatar and Russian dishes.  Beautiful interiors and delicious food will make the evening unforgettable. </p><p>  Room service and food are available at the hotel.  Fast service leaves the most pleasant impression on guests.  If you do not want to eat at the hotel, you can always visit one of the establishments, which are very numerous nearby.  Convenient location gives a large selection of guests. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to travelers, the hotel has attentive and nice staff.  Settlement and registration is very fast.  But at the same time, some tourists say that the hotel is confused with the reservation, if it was made through the "Booking" or through other Internet resources.  Such unpleasant moments are solved, but the desired apartments are not always provided to the guests.  Tourists recommend pre-contacting the reception to clarify all the nuances of the reservation. </p><p>  Regular customers of the institution note that recently the professional level of hotel employees is gradually growing.  Despite the fact that the institution is very young and belongs to a well-known network, there is still something to work on.  Most likely, shortcomings in service will be eliminated, and the Hilton Hotel in Kazan will comply with all standards.  Although now the four-star complex, according to tourists, is one of the best institutions in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tui.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel decoration" class="if uuid-2963668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2963668.jpg"></div><p>  Another disadvantage of the institution is the lack of a fitness center.  In fact, it is available, but it is not in the hotel building.  According to tourists, it is necessary to walk to it for 5-7 minutes on foot.  This is not entirely convenient.  In addition, guests note an uncomfortable schedule of the hall.  It is closed at weekends. </p><h2>  Organization of events </h2><p>  The Hilton Hotel is very popular in Kazan as a venue for business events.  And the matter is not only in its convenient location.  The building has several rooms for seminars and meetings at various levels.  On their basis, business meetings are very often organized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conference room" class="if uuid-2963688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2963688.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel rooms are equipped with everything necessary for holding seminars.  In addition, the hotel can accommodate all participants in the meeting. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The Hilton Hotel is relatively young, but has already proved itself to be the best among city guests.  The most noteworthy are the comfortable modern rooms of the hotel complex.  Equally attractive for tourists is the convenient location of the hotel, so you can not waste time traveling.  If in the near future you plan to visit Kazan, the Hilton hotel complex may well become a place to stay. </p>
