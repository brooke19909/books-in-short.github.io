Knowing about them, we can eliminate the likelihood of a misunderstanding when receiving payments.  Maternal financial compensation for pregnancy and childbirth, and at the same time for childcare, relies on the law for absolutely every woman. </p><p>  Many people wonder how much time they pay maternity.  Payments from work, their final size depend largely on the availability of the total working experience of the insured citizen.  For these reasons, pregnant women want to know the amount and duration of the period.  For women who plan to soon go on vacation, a logical question arises about how much they pay maternity leave from work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mujerfertil.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much maternity pay from work" class="if uuid-3136692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136692.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Points </h2><p>  Everyone heard that sooner or later future mothers go on maternity leave.  But some pregnant women do not clearly understand what it is.  They just know that it‚Äôs kind of like before and after childbirth that you don‚Äôt have to work for a while, plus you have to pay something else.  In fact, the term ‚Äúmaternity leave‚Äù is absent in the legislation.  So the people call two varieties of rest, namely, pregnancy and care for the baby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to existing legislation, you can go on leave for pregnancy seventy days before the onset of labor and have as much rest after them (that is, only one hundred and forty days).  Also, they can add on to it (and later necessarily pay) for another sixteen days if the birth of the baby was difficult and difficult.  If future mothers expect twins or triplets, then the vacation will increase to eighty-four days before birth and up to one hundred and ten after it. </p><p>  How many years have been paid maternity leave from work - the issue today is relevant. </p><h2>  Payment terms </h2><p>  When paying maternity from work, we will analyze in detail.  Speaking about the period of monetary accrual, it should be noted that the payment is due after the completion of the sick-list within ten working days.  In cases of ignoring the norms of the law, when the employer has not justified the delay arising, there is a need to re-form the corresponding request. </p><p>  If the calculation of money is ignored even after that, then you should write a statement of claim with a view to submitting it to the judicial authorities.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that in such a case, as the long-term judicial practice demonstrates, the judge most often takes the side of the plaintiff, and in ninety percent of situations forces the employer to enforce the law.  So, let's find out how maternity pay from work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.seek.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many years pay maternity from work" class="if uuid-3136697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136697.jpg"></div><h2>  How many years does a woman need to work to get paid? </h2><p>  Every pregnant lady has the right to a maternity allowance.  An exception is only leave in connection with gestation and childbirth.  Funds are credited for the period before and after childbirth lasting one hundred and forty calendar days, and when complications occur, this period automatically increases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The right to receive this type of monetary compensation is reserved only for officially employed women during pregnancy, as well as those who independently signed an agreement with the social service regarding voluntary insurance. </p><p>  And yet, how much should maternity pay at work?  The calculation procedure, including the monthly allowance for caring for a child under the age of one and a half years, is completely identical to the sick-list.  For these purposes, wages for the last two years that preceded pregnancy are taken into account.  The calculation base includes the average amount of earnings. </p><p>  In order to obtain the maximum amount of compensation, it is enough to officially work out the last two years before the woman's pregnancy.  At the same time, all officially employed women, without exception, whose length of service may affect the total amount, have the right to count on receiving payments. </p><h2>  What is the monthly payment amount up to one and a half years? </h2><p>  How much do maternity pay from work monthly?  If a woman completes maternity leave, they calculate the leave to care for the baby with the right to make monthly payments until they reach one and a half year olds in the amount of 40% of the calculated average earnings, but not less than the minimum value, for example: </p><ul><li>  In the case of the first baby - forty percent of the average wage, but not less than three thousand eight hundred rubles. </li><li>  When applying for the care of the second child and the subsequent, six thousand two hundred rubles. </li></ul><p>  How much do maternity pay from work with twins? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.canadianbusiness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much maternity should pay at work" class="if uuid-3136694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136694.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that in the case of the birth of several children at the same time, the above payments are payable on each.  The main criterion for obtaining is considered to be the provision to the employer of birth certificates for babies, which is issued by the registry office.  Additionally, it is required to take a certificate of non-receipt of payment by the second parent from his immediate employer. </p><h2>  The size </h2><p>  The initial amount of the maternity and pregnancy benefit for employed women is 43,615 rubles.  It is calculated based on the minimum wage.  This amount is used if the average earnings of the expectant mother are less than the minimum wage established in the current year or when the woman's insurance experience is less than six months.  If a pregnant woman carries out her activity on a part-time basis, then the average wage will be calculated in proportion to the duration of her entire working time. </p><h2>  Conditions for obtaining </h2><p>  In order to draw up the statutory maternity payment, you must first draw up a sick leave.  He is issued as part of an appeal to a antenatal clinic after an examination by a qualified gynecologist.  The hospital may be issued by institutions that have the appropriate medical license. </p><p>  From this, as a rule, it follows that it is possible to go not only to the state, but also to a commercial clinic.  At the next stage, there is a need for a certificate from a direct employer regarding the size of wages.  To do this, submit a request to the accounting department at the place of work. </p><p>  The certificate will be used in the future for the purposes of calculating and calculating maternity payments.  In the absence of such a document, the minimum wage indicator will be used in the calculations.  At the final stage, it is necessary to draw up a statement.  It can be written in any form, reflecting the need to accrue maternity funds to a woman. </p><p>  It is extremely important to draw up a heading of the document, indicating the name along with the full initials and the position of the applicant, the date of execution and signature.  In order to exclude the likelihood of receiving a refusal, it is recommended to download a sample of this statement on the Internet.  How much time do maternity pay from work? </p><div class="photo" data-original="thehill.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much they pay from work on maternity leave" class="if uuid-3136693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136693.jpg"></div><h2>  Duration of maternity leave </h2><p>  The amount of benefits is calculated taking into account the number of days spent on maternity leave.  On the basis of an order issued by the Ministry of Health and Social Development, paid leave is: </p><ul><li>  In the case of a single pregnancy, one hundred and forty days. </li><li>  In the presence of complicated one-year pregnancy - up to one hundred fifty-six days. </li><li>  Against the background of preterm birth (from the twenty second to the thirty week) - one hundred fifty six days. </li><li>  With the adoption of a baby up to three months - one hundred and ten days. </li><li>  In the case of multiple bearing - one hundred ninety-four days. </li></ul><p>  The basis for accrual is a disability certificate, which can be taken at the antenatal clinic, starting from the thirtieth week of pregnancy (from the twenty-eighth - with a multiple form).  His woman needs to be included in the accounting department of the enterprise no later than six months after the end of maternity leave.  Typically, a sick leave certificate is handed over to the employer along with the application for maternity leave.  Within ten calendar days, the payment must be transferred to the recipient. </p><h2>  Charges or how much they pay to a woman on maternity leave? </h2><p>  How much maternity pay from work is paid monthly, it is important to find out in advance.  The amount of maternity funds is calculated based on the average salary for the past two years.  Wages are summarized, and then divided by the total number of days.  The period of incapacity for work is deducted from them within the framework of paid annual leave and maternity leave with other children.  As a result, they calculate the average daily earnings, which are multiplied by the days of rest. </p><p>  In order to calculate the amount of benefits yourself, you need to use the following formula: SDZ (average daily earnings) is multiplied by the days of the decree.  The total earnings for two worked years are divided into seven hundred and thirty days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.philstar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much time do maternity pay from work" class="if uuid-3136696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136696.jpg"></div><h2>  Example </h2><p>  It is worth giving an example.  An employee will go on vacation in March 2019. In 2018, she received a total of four hundred thirty thousand rubles.  Annual leave lasted thirty-one days.  For 2019, four hundred thousand rubles and thirty days of vacation leave.  The total income is 830,000. The average daily earnings amount to 1,200 rubles.  Thus, a woman in one hundred and forty days of the decree will receive 173,000. </p><p>  If the lady was previously on leave provided for the care of a child, then only the time worked after the fact is taken into account.  Also, at the request of the expectant mother, two years may be taken into account, not preceding the decree, but previously worked, if this affects the amount of benefits.  How much they pay from work on maternity leave, now you know. </p><h2>  How much maternity pay unemployed? </h2><p>  Maternity allowance is paid only to certain categories of unemployed women: </p><ul><li>  Ladies who were fired due to the termination of the institution.  In this case, 628 rubles per month are provided.  It is necessary to apply for their receipt to the district department of social protection. </li><li>  Students who are studying full-time, while the amount of the allowance is equal to the size of the scholarship.  Make it out in an educational institution. </li><li>  Entrepreneurs, lawyers and private notaries are paid subject to the deduction of their insurance premium for the previous year.  Documents are provided to the FSS. </li><li>  Contracted servicemen in the amount of the cash allowance received.  For payment and appointment, you must contact the duty station. </li></ul><h2>  Other categories </h2><p>  The remaining categories of pregnant unemployed citizens who are not subject to compulsory social insurance are not eligible to pay them the appropriate allowance.  For them, only benefits are provided that are paid by the territorial USZN after the birth of the child.  How to pay maternity leave from work after going on vacation? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themandarin.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay maternity from work after leaving" class="if uuid-3136698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136698.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation in connection with the care of the baby: where to go? </h2><p>  It is necessary to apply for such payments: for women I will give to the employer, and for students - directly to my educational institution.  As for unemployed women, they need to go to the social security authorities.  When a newly-minted mother decides to go to her work, then she naturally will not be paid this vacation, but any family member (for example, dad, grandfather or grandmother) who will look after the baby and sit with him at home. </p><p>  In order for a woman to arrange such a vacation up to one and a half years in a standard situation, she needs to write a statement, as well as carry out a number of the following actions: </p><ul><li>  Provide a baby's birth certificate. </li><li>  Present certificates from the father's place of work that they are not receiving this type of allowance. </li><li>  Sometimes you may need a certificate of income from a previous place of work. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.vwlawyers.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much time do maternity benefits pay from work" class="if uuid-3136699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3136699.jpg"></div><h2>  When do I need to get a vacation? </h2><p>  An important point is that you need to take a vacation in connection with caring for the baby within six months after delivery.  It is worth noting that working, and at the same time well-earning ladies get a lot more money for the decree, and this is absolutely true.  But non-working women also rely on some payments. </p><p>  In addition, there are other types of benefits in the form of a one-time financial compensation at the birth of the baby (it is paid to absolutely all women who have given birth).  In addition, regional payments are provided, for example, if the company was liquidated.  All such subtleties should be found in the social insurance fund or in public service centers.  Now you know how much maternity pay from work. </p>
