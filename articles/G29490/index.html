    <h2>  Hotel Interior </h2><p>  In the main hall is a breathtaking fountain with elephants.  From their trunks raised to the ceiling, jets of water beat.  Around the fountain are dozens of flower pots with beautiful varied plants.  Here in the lobby there is a common sitting area with soft sofas.  And in its opposite part is a restaurant.  By various holidays, the lobby flickers beautifully with garland lights, and on New Year's holidays, guests of Universal Resort 5 * (Yalunvan) are greeted by snowmen and Santa Claus. </p><p>  The rooms are designed in African style: carpets and furniture with atmospheric print and dressers and tables made of dark wood.

    <h2>  Should I stop at the Universal Resort with kids? </h2><p>  Definitely worth it!  Universal Resort is a great option for families with children.  Firstly, because the Yalongwan Bay, near which it is located, is the cleanest in Sanya and you can safely let the kids go swimming. </p><p>  There is also a children's pool and a playground directly on site.  And if parents need to leave somewhere, they can contact the hotel administrator and they will be given a nanny for the duration of their absence. </p><p>  Tourists who came to the Universal Resort Yalong Bay 5 * with children noted that it was very comfortable and interesting for young guests to relax in the hotel.  What are the elephants alone meeting the baby at the entrance to the territory! </p><h2>  Travel desk at the hotel </h2><p>  For convenience, the Universal Resort has a tour desk.  Without leaving the building, you can compose yourself an extensive cultural program.  The guide will tell you <span>how to organize your time</span> in such a way as to see as many sights of Hainan Island as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Hainan Attractions </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the hotel is the Wax Museum.  This is a rather interesting object, not like the <span>Madame Tussauds.</span>  Here and there scenes from the life of China are recreated: a young couple is having fun talking on something on the club’s cozy couch, a beautiful Chinese woman in a national dress looks at the visitor from the stage, the respectable man and woman are engaged in a tea ceremony ... These are historical figures important to China, pop stars and movies, athletes and political figures.  A visit to the museum will be equally interesting for both adults and children. </p><p>  16 kilometers from the hotel there is a beautiful park with the poetic name "Deer turned his head."  The territory of the park lies at the highest point in the city of Sanya - on Mount Luheytou.  It offers fantastic city views.  The park itself is small, but worth a look.  It has a station for observing a comet, a pavilion for contemplating the water surface from a bird's eye view, beautiful landscape views, a pavilion overlooking the island of Lovers, at the foot of the mountain there is a nursery where deer are bred, and next to it is a curious restaurant entirely made of bamboo . </p><p>  You can also get from the hotel to the monkey island, to the safari zoo, to the Nantian thermal springs. </p><p>  Boat trips are also provided, which are sure to appeal to children.  This is a cognitive program with a tour of the underwater world of the bay on a boat with a transparent bottom. </p><p>  Directly next to the hotel are the Shell and Pearl Museum and Butterfly Park. </p><p>  It is also worth a visit to the <span>Nanshan Buddhism Center.</span>  It is the largest in all of Asia.  The Center has a large beautiful park, a restored Buddhist temple.  It houses the world's largest statue of gold and jewelry.  She weighs 140 kg!  Cast in honor of the goddess Guanyin.  It is one of the most important Buddhist shrines, because it contains a part of the relics of Buddha. </p><p>  You should also pay attention to the tea factory, because Sanya is famous for its teas. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Security </h2><p>  To ensure that guests are not only comfortable but also safe, lifeguards are always on duty on the hotel's beach as a precaution.  If necessary, they will not only save a person from the water, but will also follow the things left by tourists.  The safety of the sea is carefully monitored if the waves are large, a red flag is hung on the beach - swimming is prohibited.  On such rainy days, it is better to stay by the pool on site or go for a walk. </p><p>  The hotel itself always has a doctor and insurance.  If necessary, they will always provide first aid or be taken to a hospital.  This information will be most relevant for travelers with children, because a fragile child’s body is very sensitive to climate and food changes. </p><p>  Summing up, I want to say that the Universal Resort 5 * hotel is suitable for a quiet passive vacation.  It is separated from the main city bustle and is located in the distance of the central areas, where they are accustomed to nightlife.  Hotel service is unobtrusive and of high quality.  Room cleaning is followed.  The guests' requests are immediately fulfilled and they try to help everyone they can in case of force majeure.  All hotel staff are interested in the maximum comfort of each of the guests.  After all, the reputation of the hotel depends on it.  Many of the former guests are ready to come to the hotel again.  And this is the highest praise for the hotel. </p><p>  The proximity to the beach makes the hotel a wonderful place for lovers to simply swim and sunbathe on vacation.  The beach is always clean, there are always enough sun loungers for everyone. </p><p>  The quiet, peaceful atmosphere prevailing at the Universal Resort will help you to completely relax, take a break from everyday routine and recharge your batteries for new achievements.  However, visit the hotel in person and see the quality of the services provided.  Have a nice rest! </p>
