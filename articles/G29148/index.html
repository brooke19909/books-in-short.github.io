There are those where the attractions are ancient cities and their architecture.  And there are unique ones where the earth is considered sacred, and the worship of life, its manifestations and the enjoyment of its gifts is the highest human happiness. </p><p>  Rest on Arshan is an opportunity to restore health in the stunningly beautiful country of Buryatia, which has over 300 healing springs. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the thermal springs of Buryatia </h2><p>  This republic covers an area of ​​only 351,000 km2, but at the same time there would be enough natural monuments in it for several large countries: </p><ul><li>  firstly, these are many kilometers of mountain ranges - the Big Sayans with the peak of Munku-Sardyk, Hamar-Dabar and others; </li><li>  secondly, the sacred lake Baikal, which is recognized by UNESCO as the natural heritage of mankind; </li><li>  thirdly, therapeutic sources of various categories - from carbon dioxide to methane. </li></ul><p>  Baikal is rightfully recognized as the cleanest source of fresh water on the planet.  When checking for transparency, a white disk up to 30 cm in diameter was used, lowered to the bottom.  It was clearly visible at a depth of 43 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on arshan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1354334.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Rest on Arshan, as all sources call here, which means “healing water”, also implies respect for other people's traditions.  All these places are recognized as sacred by the local population and are revered in the same way as Buddhist temples and other religious shrines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In many of them, traditions require a ritual.  For example, visiting a source of Suburgyn Arshan, on which the lamas built a suburgan of stone, the traveler must initially conduct a rite of purification.  To do this, the arsa grass is burned, which shamans use in their rituals of liberation from evil spirits. </p><p>  In the <span>Tunkinsky valley,</span> on the healing springs there are sanatoriums “Arshan”, “Pearls” and numerous recreation centers. </p><h2>  Resort "Arshan" </h2><p>  This complex includes two hospitals at once - the sanatorium "Sayany" and "Edelweiss" (children's year-round recreation camp).  Arshan Resort is located in a beautiful area - at the foot of <span>the Sayan Mountains,</span> on the banks of the Kyngarga River with its twelve waterfalls.  In spring, you can climb up to the alpine lawns covered with poppies and herbs, admire the flowering of rosemary in summer, and the surrounding snow-capped peaks in winter. </p>

In the three-story wooden building there are only 8 rooms, two of which are for couples with children with extra bed and 6 are for two people with an improved layout. </p><p>  It offers an equipped kitchen, a picnic area, a dining room and a bathhouse.  Just 2 km from the hotel is the source of Arshan and the Buddhist datsan.  This place is suitable for family vacations and health prevention. </p><p>  Hotel Maryina Roshcha is a whole complex, which, according to tourists, delights both children and their parents.  The 30 rooms have everything for a comfortable stay, and the decoration of each of the three buildings with wooden carvings gives it the look of a fabulous town. </p>
