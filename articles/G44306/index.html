    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Almost all guests were satisfied with the apartments of the Nha-Trang Palace Hotel.  So, according to them, since the hotel is new, the rooms here are freshly renovated.  All of them are stylishly decorated, comfortable and quite spacious.  Our compatriots note comfortable beds and armchairs.  But the safes in the apartments did not appeal to everyone.  The fact is that they are not electronic here, but are locked with a small key, which can be easily lost.  However, if this happens, then you should not worry about the safety of things in the safe.  At the reception you will be given a new key, but for the loss of the old you will have to pay a fine. </p><p>  Also, not all guests were satisfied with the balconies in the apartments.  According to them, in almost all rooms they are quite small.  There is nowhere to put furniture on them.  You can only go out and enjoy the surroundings.  By the way, our compatriots advise, if possible, to settle on the upper floors.  These rooms will provide you with excellent views of the sea and the city. </p><p>  As for the indisputable advantages, tourists note free Wi-Fi, which ‚Äúcatches‚Äù both throughout the hotel and in the rooms.  Moreover, the connection speed is quite high.  Guests also liked that the bathrooms have a full bath, and not just a shower.  Interruptions in water, according to travelers, do not happen here.  In addition, many guests mention in their comments about very high-quality, new snow-white bedding, which can not be found even in all five-star hotels, not to mention the ‚Äúfours‚Äù, which include Nha-Trang Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nha trang palace hotel 4 vietnam reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1074947.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Our compatriots did not express any complaints about the work of the maids of the Nha Trang Palace Hotel 4 *, the reviews we are reviewing.  So, according to them, housekeeping is carried out every day and is quite thorough.  Maids regularly change towels, linen and replenish sets of personal hygiene products (shaving accessories, toothbrushes and pastes, shower gel, soap, shampoo, cotton buds, toilet paper, etc.).  In addition, tea and coffee bags and bottled drinking water will be brought to your room every day.  By the way, according to the reviews of our compatriots, maids will visit your apartment twice a day.  So, the first time they will carry out cleaning.  And the second time they drop by in the evening.  If you are not in the room, the maids will shut the curtains and prepare your beds.  If you are in the apartment, then you will be offered to drink tea or coffee and leave drinking water. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Many travelers staying at Nha-Trang Palace really liked the fact that in the vast majority of cases, newly arrived guests are resettled immediately, without condemning them to wait for the checkout time.  So even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you can literally get the keys to your room within 10-15 minutes.  This will allow you not to lose precious minutes of vacation. </p><p>  As for leaving the hotel, the occupied apartments should be vacated before noon.  Please note that the vacated room is checked by the hotel staff.  And if they find a shortage of towels or broken dishes, then you will be asked to pay for the damage.  Many guests were surprised by this fact, since, according to them, in many cases some items of dishes already had chips.  Therefore, experienced tourists recommend inspecting all items in the room immediately upon check-in, and in case of any defects immediately inform the receptionist about this. </p>
