It is known that our army surrendered the capital of Russia without a fight.  At the same time, the city authorities were not able to remove from the city all the huge amount of valuables that were stored in the Orthodox churches of the Kremlin and government buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zed.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon is looking at Moscow" class="if uuid-3037055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3037055.jpg"></div><p>  Seekers began to search for Moscow trophies and other valuables stolen by Napoleon‚Äôs troops almost immediately after the end of hostilities in 1812. They continue to this day. </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  More than two hundred years ago, on October 16, 1812, a convoy with a retreating French army left burning Moscow.  Those treasures that Bonaparte removed from the Mother See didn‚Äôt reach Paris like that.  Apparently, they were hidden on the road. </p><p>  The search for Napoleon‚Äôs treasure took up during his lifetime.  It was then that some items were discovered, taken out by the conqueror from Moscow.  However, the bulk of the treasures, in the list of which were jewelry and jewelry from the Armory, as well as a cross that previously towered on the bell tower of Ivan the Great, were not found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon in burning Moscow" class="if uuid-3037012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3037012.jpg"></div><p>  Napoleon did not rob the Kremlin until he still had hope that the Russian emperor Alexander I would make peace with him.  Moreover, the French guards saved him from the famous Moscow fire.  However, after Napoleon realized that his hopes for peace were in vain, he immediately ordered the army to prepare for a retreat, removing all the valuables from the Kremlin churches and the Armory.  Bonaparte planned to use some of them as evidence of the conquest of the capital of Russia.  These are the so-called Moscow trophies.  These included items considered sacred to Orthodox Christianity, which were stored in the Arkhangelsk and Assumption churches, as well as relics of historical and cultural purpose, which were in the funds of the Armory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nonfiction.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon on a white horse" class="if uuid-3036992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3036992.jpg"></div><p>  Among the Moscow trophies there are also ingots of silver and gold, into which the details of the clothes of the clergy embroidered with these precious metals were melted, as well as various items.  In the Kremlin, on one of the walls of the Assumption Cathedral, near the place where the horns stood, after the withdrawal of the enemy army, an inscription made in chalk in French was discovered.  It spoke of 325 pounds of silver and 18 pounds of gold. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to Moscow trophies, Napoleon‚Äôs treasure includes military relics and army values.  These are her banners, treasury, objects that were in the imperial train, and also the personal booty of the French soldiers.  In general, the fate of Napoleon‚Äôs treasure is the most exciting mind of the people of the secret Patriotic War of 1812. </p><h2>  Crossing the Dnieper </h2><p>  Where is the treasure of Napoleon?  One of the most plausible versions of his burial is the ‚ÄúBelarusian trace‚Äù.  Modern researchers with confidence can tell about several main addresses of the possible location of treasures.  First of all, they relate to a place located near one of the crossings over the Dnieper River.  It was here that the French army first encountered the complete threat of defeat with the capture of the emperor himself.  Carts with good in such a situation became a heavy and very dangerous burden.  There is a version claiming that during the crossing of the Dnieper River near Orsha, Napoleon personally engaged in the selection of the most valuable wagons.  The rest on his orders were destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="behindtheberezina.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="river with ice" class="if uuid-3037069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3037069.jpg"></div><p>  However, most historians believe that such actions were demonstrative.  Moscow trophies after crossing the Dnieper calmly proceeded further to the west. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Stagnant Lake </h2><p>  While in Tolochin, Napoleon received the news that the Russian army had captured Borisov and crossed the Berezina.  The French were in the ring of environment.  In order to break out of it, the Napoleonic army should be as mobile as possible.  That is why the crossing of convoys in such a situation could not be considered. </p><p>  There is a version that Napoleon‚Äôs treasure is located in Stoyachy Lake near the village of Beaver.  It was there that most of the wagons were flooded.  Confirmation of this is the fact of the survey of the bottom of the lake in the summer of 1942 by German sappers.  They carried out work for two days. </p><p>  The eyes of Stoyachie were also looked at by modern treasure hunters.  In the 1980s, a hydrochemical survey was carried out here, indicating an increased content of metals in water.  However, a thick layer of silt, reaching 2 m, prevented the bottom from exploring. Attempts were made to search for treasures using powerful motor pumps.  However, all efforts were in vain. </p><h2>  Crossing on Berezina </h2><p>  There are a great many versions about where to look for Napoleon‚Äôs treasure.  The most famous of them, associated with Belarus, is one that indicates a crossing on the Berezina River near Borisov, through which the retreating troops passed from November 26 to 28, 1812. </p><div class="photo" data-original="behindtheberezina.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="french soldiers at convoys" class="if uuid-3037072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3037072.jpg"></div><p>  Information indicating that it was here, as well as in the vicinity of Borisov and Studenka, that the French army threw and buried a large number of treasures that appeared almost immediately.  The search for Moscow trophies by order of Alexander I began in February 1813. It was then that the emperor sent military adviser Zavorotkov to Studenka.  His task was to verify the reliability of reports that Napoleon‚Äôs treasure is located on the Berezina. </p><p>  Arriving in Studenka, the military adviser first of all engaged in a survey of the crossing.  Based on the preserved information, the upper bridge at that time was completely burned, but the lower one turned out to be intact.  From February 3 to 10, ice holes were cut down by peasants on the Berezina, and the bottom of the river was examined by poles.  It was sandy and clearly visible due to its shallow depth. </p><p>  In the river, a large number of corpses of people who died horses, sabers and guns, hatchets and pistols, bayonets and many small items were found.  Two small fragments of figurative silver salaries were found.  However, the seekers could not find Napoleon's treasure. </p><p>  Zavorotkov was interviewed by local residents.  From them, he tried to get some additional information about Napoleon‚Äôs treasure near Borisov.  In Studenka, a military adviser managed to find Sazon Hoof.  This peasant said that he saw a cart with three horses being dropped from the bridge.  At the spot indicated by Sazon Hoof several holes were cut down.  However, no traces of the wagon were found. </p><p>  The fact that by the personal order of the Russian emperor in Studenka a search for Napoleon‚Äôs treasure is being conducted has become known in all the surrounding villages.  02/08/1813 the nobleman Radevich, whose estate was in these places, filed a report in the name of Zavorotkov.  In it, he told that when he was in Vilna during the retreat of the French troops, he heard from the Austrian officer the story that a barrel containing silver coins was flooded at the crossing point on the Berezina river.  These readings were immediately checked, but at the indicated location at the bottom of the river they found only a blacksmith's tool.  More detailed studies of Berezina Zavorotkov failed to conduct.  The fact is that the thaw has begun.  The ice on the river began to melt.  Further work was life threatening to seekers. </p><p>  Only in 1896 did the Ministry of Railways of Russia decide on the need to clear the shallows of the Berezina River, which were also located at the French crossing point.  It is possible that the purpose of these works was the discovery of Napoleon's treasure at Borisov. </p><p>  In late summer 1896, when the water level in the river dropped, work began using an excavator.  After some time, the surrounding peasants began to spread rumors about the treasures found in the form of gold and silver coins, valuable items, as well as about banners and weapons raised from the bottom.  However, in reality, among the finds were only those things that were of museum interest only.  This is a pair of pistols, a gold seal, a sword and copper buttons. </p><p>  The opinion that treasures can be found on Berezina also arose because it became known: at the crossing point, Napoleon‚Äôs treasure was sought by the French, veterans of the Great Army.  However, most likely, they were trying to discover not Moscow trophies at all.  Former Bonaparte soldiers came to Berezina to find personal prey hidden during the retreat in November 1812. </p><h2>  Oshmyany district </h2><p>  Where is Napoleon's treasure hidden?  It is possible that in the Oshmyany district of Belarus.  Indeed, in these places until now, local residents tell a lot of stories about the treasures hidden by the French.  Sometimes such stories even give an exact indication of the place where Napoleon‚Äôs treasure was hidden.  The French tried to search for these treasures in 1927-1928.  However, local authorities refused to do so. </p><div class="photo" data-original="napoleonbonaparte.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="French in winter" class="if uuid-3037027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3037027.jpg"></div><p>  How real are the legends in Oshmyanyshchyna?  Without a doubt, the Napoleonic army began to retreat, accompanied by convoys with treasures looted in Moscow.  Judging by the available data, it was at least ten thousand overloaded carts.  At the same time, the French were not only taken away, but also carried away, dragging nodes that contained everything that, in their opinion, was of any value.  However, every day it became increasingly clear that it would not be possible to take away these riches.  Carts loaded with good turned into a deadly and heavy burden. </p><p>  It is believed that off the banks of the Berezina River, the French decided to hide the loot in hiding places.  They still had the hope that they would return to Russia with a stronger new army. </p><p>  So where can Napoleon‚Äôs treasure be today?  According to experts, the most valuable was buried by the French in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir retreat, which stretched from Berezina to Vilna.  Already on the left bank of the river they hid 4 million gold francs and the Order of the Legion of Honor. </p><p>  After passing Smorgon, the Napoleonic troops split.  They began to retreat in two directions.  The Bavarian army corps headed along the "black road" in the direction of Smorgon - Sola and further to the metro station Gudogai and to Losha.  The bulk of the troops went along the Oshmyany tract.  This direction is Smorgon - Zhuprany, and then to Oshmyany and Medniki.  It was along this road that the convoy with trophies also moved. </p><p>  According to researchers, some of the wagons loaded with treasures reached Oshmyany.  Further their trace is lost.  The report of one of the French generals says that he could not find out if the convoy had left Oshmyany or not.  It is possible that valuable cargo is still located in the area. </p><h2>  Lake Semlevskoe </h2><p>  There is a version that Moscow trophies did not even fall into the territory of present Belarus.  According to some researchers, Napoleon ordered to flood most of the valuables in Lake Semlevsky, among which was the cross from the bell tower of Ivan the Great.  This pond is located in the Smolensk region near Vyazma.  Such a decision was made by Napoleon in connection with the low speed of retreat, which was significantly slowed down by a train with jewels.  The Russian army, which did not get involved in the general battle, constantly went parallel to the French, threatening to surround the enemy. </p><p>  A little later, the seekers tried to find Napoleon‚Äôs treasure on Lake Semlevsky.  However, all their attempts were unsuccessful. </p><p>  In the 1970s, searchers supporting the hypothesis of a trace of Napoleon‚Äôs treasure in Smolensk conducted a chemical analysis of the lake‚Äôs water.  As it turned out, it contains a high content of copper, silver and gold, which is ten times higher than the norm.  Sonar was recorded at the bottom of the reservoir several fairly large objects.  Nevertheless, the treasure was never found.  A fifteen-meter layer of silt interfered with his searches.  For 150 years, the lake has become shallow and turned into a real swamp. </p><p>  Researchers have continued the search for 20 years.  However, scientists could not find any Bonaparte trophies. </p><h2>  The story of Cyrus Bulychev </h2><p>  Some writers became interested in the subject of treasures in Semlevsky Lake.  One of them is Kir Bulychev.  ‚ÄúNapoleon's Treasure‚Äù - that‚Äôs what his fantastic story is called, which introduces us to the story of the girl Alice.  This literary work is composed in the form of an excerpt from the diary of a young heroine.  In it, the girl describes her trip with her father to Lake Semlevsky, which is located in the Smolensk region.  During her stay there, she sat on the shore and tried to imagine how these places would look in fabulous times.  Drawing in her imagination the goblin and the mermaids, she was not at all surprised that a treasure might be here. </p><h2>  The territory between Smolensk, Kaluga and Yelnya </h2><p>  Where to look for treasures of Napoleon in Russia?  There are other versions of the fact that the wagon train with looted goods did not enter the territory of modern Belarus at all.  According to one version, the treasures are buried 300 km from Moscow in the area between Smolensk, Kaluga and Yelnya.  Now a dense impassable forest is growing here, and earlier there was a field instead.  According to researchers, the French dug a pit, the diameter of which was 40 m, and buried about 80 tons of gold in it. </p><p>  If so, then we can say that the treasure of Napoleon was found.  However, the authors of the "discovery" have not yet advertised the exact coordinates of the location of the treasures.  They fear competitors.  These searchers promise to call reporters to conduct excavations.  They will start them after they collect the volunteers, get the necessary permissions and acquire the equipment. </p><h2>  Ponar Mountain </h2><p>  There is another version of the finding of Napoleon‚Äôs treasure, according to which the French army nevertheless took the convoy out of the borders of present Belarus.  At the same time, a place near Vilna is mentioned.  This is the current Vilnius.  It was there that the Ponar Mountain appeared on the way of the French.  In itself, this hill was small.  However, the mountain was so icy that it was not possible to overcome its French army.  Bonaparte‚Äôs soldiers simply didn‚Äôt guess around, because in a panic they escaped from the persecution of the Russians.  The French tried to climb the mountain, while throwing their guns and luggage.  Probably, here they left what they plundered in Moscow. </p><p>  There is a version that the Russian troops who approached the abandoned convoy began to rob it themselves.  However, the French did not want to part with the good either.  There is evidence of eyewitnesses, according to which the soldiers of both armies, while forgetting about the war, robbed one box together.  Thus, the values ‚Äã‚Äãexported from the Kremlin could simply have been stolen from the Ponar Mountain. </p><h2>  Dead lake </h2><p>  There is also a Polish trace of Napoleon‚Äôs treasure.  According to historians, the convoy with the values ‚Äã‚Äãstolen in Moscow on December 8, 1812, stopped near the village of Gozhi.  Scouts were sent to Grodno, which at that time was on Polish territory.  They brought the Napoleonic army the unpleasant news that the Austrians had surrendered the city to the Russians without a fight.  Another report that was received from the rearguard completely perplexed the French.  They received the news that only a few hours away from them a large detachment of Russians, headed by Davydov, stopped at night's halt, and Cossack patrols carried out their advance along the banks of the Neman. </p><p>  There was only one way out.  The convoy should have been drowned and moved on light.  On the morning of December 9, the wagons were sent towards Dead Lake.  However, steep slopes did not allow access to its shores.  The French arranged a 300-meter live chain, passing from hand to hand ingots of gold and silver.  They delivered the precious metal to the ice hole cut through the ice.  Everything that was in the train went to the bottom. </p><p>  After the events of 1812, Lake Dead was renamed Chertovo.  The story of the Moscow trophies was included in the category of state secrets.  Perhaps that is why the Russian emperors did not actively search for the Kremlin treasures that were conducted within the borders of the old Smolensk road? </p><p>  However, searchers should keep in mind that Dead Lake keeps its secrets more reliable than any bank.  The fact is that its depth reaches 60 m, and it‚Äôs dangerous even for the most experienced divers to go down to its bottom.  Anyone who wants to find treasures here will have to stock up on special equipment and carefully consider an action plan. </p><h2>  Is there a treasure? </h2><p>  According to some researchers, the French specifically threw misinformation, which allowed to divert attention from the real place of burial of treasures.  A similar version is confirmed by the story of Orest Petrovich Nikitin.              . </p><div class="photo" data-original="artoftherussias.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if uuid-3036998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3036998.jpg"></div><p> According to Nikitin, near the village of Ascension, on the banks of the Ugra River, which is 40 km from Semlev, there is a cemetery called Kurganniki.  In different years, those French guards who remained in Russia after the end of the war of 1812 were buried here. One of them was married to a peasant woman from Ascension.  A few years after the wedding, he died and was buried in the Kurgan.  As a monument, his wife put a large stone on his grave.  He stayed there for quite some time, right up to the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  The wife of this Frenchman lived a long life, having managed to cross his 100-year milestone.  Before her death, she told her fellow villagers the story that it was her husband who asked him to be buried in this place.  Not far from it are hidden treasures.  However, the villagers did not believe the woman, deciding that at her age she simply survived from the mind. </p><p>  However, just before the war, the German Moser appeared in these places, who introduced himself as an entire employee of the Singer company.  It later turned out that this man was an Abwehr spy.  In the process of collecting various information, Moser, apparently, accidentally learned from someone a legend about the treasures hidden in Ascension. </p><p>  In 1942, he reappeared in these places, being at the head of the Gestapo detachment.  It was then that the German, taking a team of sappers, began to search for the values ‚Äã‚Äãstolen by Napoleon. </p><p>  Nikitin recalls that one day Moser visited the house in which he lived, and boasted that a few meters from the stone installed on the grave of the French guard, he had found Napoleon's treasure.  Orest Petrovich claimed that he personally saw gold coins in four leather bags, as well as dishes, bowls and goblets of precious metals and church utensils, among which a large place was occupied by a large golden cross.  It is possible that the Germans seized only part of the values, hiding everything else in another place. </p><p>  That is why, according to Nikitin, since 1942 no secret of the Napoleonic treasure has existed.  True or not, it‚Äôs hard to say.  But, apparently, the treasures exported by the French from Moscow will remain the subject of a search for more than one generation of seekers, because this is how a person works. </p>
