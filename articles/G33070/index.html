Especially when you consider that many of them repeat each other either in appearance or in the internal component.  ZTE Blade AF 3, reviews of which will be described below, compares favorably with its competitors, despite the fact that the manufacturer is still not very well known in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade af 3 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053259.jpg" width="204"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the company </h2><p>  Not so long ago, in the commercials on the same federal entertainment channel, ZTE became the sponsor of the show.  And there are several reasons for this.  Firstly, the company is manufacturing budget smartphones with very high performance indicators.  That is, it is really a worthy competitor in the modern market to such companies as Lenovo or Philips.  Of course, the company can not yet compete with such a giant as Samsung, but it is possible that in the future it will surpass the top flagship models.  Secondly, ZTE is a hybrid product manufactured by a Russian-Chinese company.  Yes, the company is both Chinese and Russian at the same time.  This is what marked its growing popularity in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone zte blade af 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053260.jpg"></div>

Many parents choose this model as the first gadget for their child.  And the point is not only that the smartphone looks very presentable and stylish, but also that its price is very affordable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone zte blade af 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053258.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price category </h2><p>  She is really budgetary.  Mobile phone ZTE Blade AF 3 (reviews in details below) can be purchased for just 3000-4000 rubles.  And it is really a low price!  Moreover, the "filling" of the smartphone is not the worst.  And for his money, in general, it‚Äôs very, very not bad.  Many people buy a gadget only because its cost, with the declared characteristics, remains perhaps one of the lowest.  And the quality of work is significantly different from the ones in the price category of Alcatel or Explay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte blade af 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053257.jpg" width="586"></div>

Nevertheless, the quad-core Cortex-A7 on the Spreadtrum SC7731 chipset is fully working out its funds.  Even though especially heavy games run at minimal settings, they still work.  And even more simple and less demanding in terms of parameters toys fly with a bang.  That is why parents choose for their children, albeit an inexpensive, but quite decent device.  With such a processor, you can not only use standard applications, but also download games, useful programs and save all the necessary files to your ZTE Blade AF 3. Your feedback on its operation and the truth is mostly positive thanks largely to the processor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade af 3 black reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053255.jpg" width="252"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras: external and frontal </h2><p>  Of course, the ZTE Blade AF 3 smartphone is not intended for shooting at all. Reviews about the quality of shooting are not the most encouraging.  Firstly, the matrix used by the manufacturer for an external camera is not the best, even among budget ones.  However, pictures taken in good lighting are reasonably acceptable.  The camera received a resolution of 5 megapixels, which, of course, today is not enough.  By the way, photo effects can slightly correct the situation, since they really help improve image quality.  Secondly, what confuses many owners is the very mediocre and weak <span>front camera.</span>  The claimed 2 megapixels are not felt here, the photos are very weak and ugly.  There is a dignity in both cameras, which the owners note, is the color rendition.  ZTE Blade AF 3, whose photo reviews are not the most rainbow-colored, realistically conveys colors without distorting them.  And for a budget smartphone this is a very worthy result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade af 3 specifications reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1053256.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Screen diagonal </h2><p>  By today's standards, 4 inches seems already inadequate.  But for a child or girl, this is enough.  And the ZTE Blade AF 3 mobile phone conveniently lies in the hand. Reviews of the screen are the most common - the diagonal is acceptable, although the matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãTFT, but of very decent quality, the colors are bright and juicy, but do not ‚Äútear your eyes out‚Äù, not acid.  Therefore, many people like the smartphone - it looks stylish and expensive, while remaining really good in its properties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade af 3 t221 reviews" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1059082.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Of course, updates on Android do not come as often as on iOs, for example, but still they do.  And each new version is many times better than the previous one, noticeably better.  ZTE Blade AF 3, the reviews of the owners of which for the most part are still positive, received the operating system version 4.4 KitKat.  Not the freshest today (the 5th will be newer), but still productive.  If desired, the operating system can be updated, the hardware will be pulled, as well as the internal and RAM memory.  Firmware versions are often published on the official website.  In addition, an update application is built into the smartphone.  However, as many owners note, the program does not carry any payload - the latest versions are either "invisible" to the application, or are not installed.  Here in this ZTE Blade AF 3, reviews about which are generally positive, still not too good.  Later versions of the smartphones of this company became ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù, updates to them get up without any problems, without requiring a flashing of the device. </p><h2>  RAM and internal memory </h2><p>  ZTE Blade AF 3 (t221), reviews of which say that the smartphone is really worth the money, works quite well even with a relatively small amount of memory.  Although, if desired, it can be increased.  So, the smartphone got 512 MB of RAM, which is enough for the most popular applications.  And the internal is only 4 GB, which is also enough to store the most necessary information.  Naturally, a micro-SD memory card can increase this space.  It supports up to 32 GB, which is enough for storing photos and applications.  As the owners note, there are no problems with transferring applications to the memory card, but the cache has to be cleaned often enough so as not to overload the RAM with unnecessary data. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And this is perhaps the weakest link in the <span>ZTE Blade AF 3. Features,</span> reviews and customer opinions are exactly what they say.  For a modern smartphone, a 1400 mAh battery is clearly not enough.  Especially when you consider that applications and a bright screen require a sufficient amount of battery power.  With increased use of the phone (Internet surfing, games, music, applications and talking), the battery lasts only 5-6 hours.  Therefore, to purchase an additional battery to replace or a source for recharging (powerbank) will be out of place.  This is noted by most of the owners of the ZTE Blade AF 3 phone. Black (reviews on the color scheme and appearance will be lower) matte plastic gives the smartphone a presentable look, and a bright powerbank can be a great accessory.  Moreover, there are many mobile recharges for every taste and color. </p><h2>  Smartphone Appearance </h2><p>  It is common enough for the ZTE Blade series.  Matte black plastic, which does not leave fingerprints, durable glass on the screen.  By the way, it requires a protective film, which is not included.  The thing is that ugly prints remain on the screen, even if you use your smartphone with clean hands.  And this is also noted by many owners.  The external camera protrudes slightly above the body, so without a protective case there is a risk of scratching the eye on a table or cloth.  External film for the housing is not provided.  That is why it is strongly recommended to purchase either a cover or an additional back panel.  For example, with a fashionable and stylish pattern.  If desired, the back panel can be changed to any bright color, since enterprising Chinese manufacturers have created many accessories for this model of smartphone. </p><h2>  Is it worth taking? </h2><p>  Definitely worth his money.  Many buyers recommend a model for purchase, since 3000 rubles is a relatively small fee for a smartphone with two SIM cards and a good "stuffing".  But you shouldn‚Äôt have too high hopes, the phone is really good, but it is still budgetary in many respects. </p>
