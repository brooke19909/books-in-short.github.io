Its construction lasted one year and four months.  These deadlines are considered truly record breaking.  The construction was carried out with the active support of <span>Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev,</span> who at that time held the post of first secretary of the <span>CPSU Central Committee.</span> </p>

It was supposed to be a place corresponding to the socio-political purpose of this monumental structure.  That is why it was decided to erect the Kremlin State Palace on the territory of the Kremlin - an important place for any Russian person.

    <p>  According to the results of a closed competition for the creation of a construction project, the winner and leader of the construction process was Mikhail Posokhin.  He led a team of architects who were engaged in the development of individual elements of the Palace. </p><p>  It was originally planned to make a conference room for four thousand seats.  However, later the size of the room was adjusted.  The reason for this was the example of foreign colleagues: Chinese architects who were developing the plan of the Palace of Congresses in Beijing, created a project for ten thousand seats with a huge hall for banquets.  Khrushchev, who visited this magnificent building, was simply amazed.  It was decided to increase the conference hall being built in the Palace to six thousand seats.  For the most successful implementation of the plan, a group of Soviet architects traveled to the United States and Germany to familiarize themselves with the experience of erecting such buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Facade development has also become a difficult process.  A great variety of architectural solutions were submitted for consideration.  In the course of creative searches, the now well-known facade of the Palace was formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="State Kremlin Palace Moscow" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/306915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the summer of 1961, the Kremlin State Palace outside was completely finished with white Ural marble, glass and golden <span>anodized aluminum.</span>  To decorate the interiors, materials such as red patterned Baku tufa, carbakhtinsky granite, and Koelga marble were used.  Walls and floors are finished using oak, beech, ash, hornbeam and Pacific walnut. </p><p>  On October 17, 1961, the State Kremlin Palace was inaugurated.  The official website reports that on that day a gala concert was held, the program of which included a fragment of the notorious ballet called Swan Lake.  Also, the audience was pleased with the performances of honored artists. </p><p>  The Central Theater and Concert Hall of the whole country has become the State Kremlin <span>Palace.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> began to attract even more tourists, as the long-awaited premieres of the Academic Bolshoi Theater were held on the stage of this building, and legendary dance and singing groups performed. </p><p>  The Kremlin State Palace for two decades has become the venue for congresses of the CPSU. </p>

Currently, the Palace is on the same level as the Royal Shakespeare Theater (Stratford), Carnegie Hall (New York) and Shrine Auditorium (Los Angeles).
