They are made such to protect investors' savings from inflation.  Therefore, they can generate income, even if you use only one banking instrument - a deposit, which, although simple, is effective.  A deposit is called bank deposits.  The best in Belarusian rubles will be listed in this article.  Of course, they cannot bring a large income, but they are always pleased with their stability.  It must be remembered that interest rates on deposits in rubles, if we approach the matter wisely, can bring good income, but a deposit in foreign currency and from any devaluation will be protected. </p>

    <h2>  First knowledge </h2><p>  Before you start choosing a product, you need to find out which deposits in Belarusian rubles are the best.  Listen to the opinions of experts who do not recommend putting impressive savings in one deposit and even in one bank.  Everyone remembers the parable about how all the eggs were put in one basket.  You need to choose the best deposits in Belarusian rubles and differentiate your risks using different tools in the banking arsenal.  This applies, of course, to owners of large savings.  Especially for such lucky ones, there are websites on the Internet where every self-respecting bank has calculators for deposits in Belarusian rubles.  With their help, you can easily calculate, comparing <span>bank deposits,</span> which are suitable for each particular depositor, we can say perfectly.  And there are special bases where you can find information about any deposits offered by all banks of the Republic of Belarus, where deposits in Belarusian rubles can be made even online. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are such filters that allow you to consider the conditions of deposits only in the capital of Belarus - Minsk.  Or, for example, find the best deposits in Belarusian rubles in Grodno.  In principle, in any city in Belarus where at least one bank exists.  In addition, not a single product offered by banks is ignored in this calculator, and information is updated not just often, but around the clock, immediately as changes and additions appear.  The program itself can pick up information on given parameters, for example, the best deposits in Belarusian rubles in Gomel.  You just need to enter your conditions in a special window: the amount of the deposit, the currency in which it will be saved, the period that the depositor has to save his money, and that‚Äôs all, already on the monitor all the best deposits in Belarusian rubles are listed in Grodno.  Or in Gomel?  It doesn‚Äôt matter, you can choose the city that you need - any. </p>

    <h2>  About Information </h2><p>  In addition to calculators, articles are published on each banking site in which experts consider a variety of topics, often concerning the best interest on deposits in Belarusian rubles.  And if you constantly monitor these materials, you can always be up to date with the latest forecasts and trends that experts give, which also helps in making decisions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Databases are constantly kept up to date, where information is diligently updated.  For example, about rates - on a weekly basis, and since it is impossible to keep track of their changes in real time, before visiting a bank, it is recommended to check the information of a product in a bank call center. </p><h2>  What do Belarusian experts say </h2><p>  Experts say that Russian investors were drawn to Belarus.  Analysts noted a very sharp increase in the number of open deposits in banks of a friendly country, which our compatriots in every way trust.  As if during the crisis period an amazing island of well-being was found.  This is no accident.  The best deposits in Belarusian rubles in Minsk and other cities of Belarus really attracted many new investors from Russia. </p><p>  For 2017, this is almost two thousand new deposits.  Of course, it‚Äôs too early to call this a boom, but one cannot ignore this increase either.  In the Belarusian Alfa Bank, they said that their deposit growth from Russia amounted to as much as seventeen percent, while in 2015 there were only nine, and in 2016 a little more.  Moreover, the best deposits in Belarusian rubles in Polotsk, Grodno or Gomel - geography does not interfere with the number of deposits at all - the Russians preferred not for the last money.  These people are quite wealthy, and their contributions are mostly more than one hundred thousand dollars in terms of rubles.  The average deposit from Russia has grown by thirteen percent, according to the press service of this bank. </p>

    <h2>  Why it happens </h2><p>  As Belarusian bankers explain, the growth of interest in such deposits on the part of Russian depositors is due to a rather high yield, because in the Republic of Belarus on foreign currency deposits the rates are one and a half, or even two times higher than in the Russian Federation, even if we take into account the expected contributions.  Such as, for example, income tax on interest income.  And another crucial point to consider when comparing two banking systems.  Russian depositors are attracted by mechanisms for the reimbursement of their deposits, which the state guarantees in any case.  If force majeure occurs, deposits to Russians will be returned in full, payments are not limited to the amount of 1,400,000 rubles, as is done in the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is one more very pleasant moment.  It can be said a bonus.  In the event of force majeure, the Russians will receive their contribution in the same currency in which it was saved.  And this is important.  In the Russian Federation, such a rule does not exist, with us all currency investments are compensated only in rubles and only at the Central Bank rate.  However, on the websites of banks there is evidence that the tax situation has changed, but experts do not connect the recent activity of depositors from Russia with this in particular.  The fact is that since April, the yield on deposits has slightly decreased.  In the Republic of Belarus, a thirteen percent income tax on short-term foreign currency deposits is now levied.  However, according to the National Bank of Belarus, the tax will not be levied on deposits that were opened more than two years ago. </p>

    <h2>  Benefit </h2><p>  In any case, the situation with deposits in Belarus looks attractive for investors, and therefore, residents of Russia are willing to use banking services in this neighboring country.  At least the closest neighbors - Muscovites and St. Petersburgers - are definitely coming here to make their contribution.  And there the number of wealthy people is much higher than in the rest of the country.  Of course, some overhead awaits them, but they can be easily covered. </p><p>  For example, an account is opened for five thousand dollars (in rubles this is about sixty for one).  Five percent of the yield is already a benefit of twenty thousand per annum.  Transport will completely fit into this framework, because once you need to personally come to <span>open a contribution.</span>  Then you can use the services of a mobile bank.  It is equally beneficial for car owners who will travel from Moscow to get the best deposits in Belarusian rubles to Vitebsk, for example, and for the "horseless" who buy a train or plane ticket. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The most interesting thing is that citizens of the nearest and not too close European countries also saw a benefit in Belarusian deposits.  More and more people come here from Poland, Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, from all three Baltic countries, because the conditions are actually very attractive.  Many European banks can offer customers not only zero, but even negative returns on their deposits. </p><p>  The advantages of the Belarusian financial system are not needed here.  There are twenty-six banks in the Republic of Belarus, and the National Bank regulates their work.  From there, they closely monitor the situation, and therefore the revocation of a license or even suspension of activity is considered a mega-event.  The last time this happened a long time ago with the Ukrainian branch of Delta Credit.  Moreover, absolutely all payments were made, none of the depositors were injured, and therefore a negative precedent did not occur. </p>

    <h2>  What Russian experts say </h2><p>  Russian experts are not so sure that the situation in the banking services market of Belarus is cloudless.  For example, <span>Oleg Ivanov</span> , vice president of the Association of Banks in Russian Regions, is sure that it is not necessary to open deposits in Belarusian banks without special need.  Moreover, he claims that risks still exist, and considerable.  And therefore, it makes sense to the investor to think many times before making this business tour. </p><p>  Firstly, if suddenly a force majeure event happens in Belarus, where will the authorities and banks of the republic start borrowing money to give to investors?  But such a need always happens all of a sudden, and not a single country is safe from this.  Experts correctly fear.  To protect depositors, no state will be able to pay all the amounts on deposits in a currency that this state does not issue.  In this case, you can only rely on Belarusian rubles. </p><h2>  Fears </h2><p>  Let the representatives of the Russian banking community a little exacerbate the danger, because not one of our bankers will like the mass trip of wealthy investors to a neighboring country, and they will start to dissuade them from this step with all their might.  But this position is also supported by independent experts who recall that the economy of the Republic of Belarus is not too strong and not too strong, and in many respects (and in banking too) it depends on Russia. </p><p>  And now in Russia there is a crisis.  It‚Äôs strange if in Belarus people hope to hide from him.  In addition, purely political risks are high.  At the moment, Belarus is in great need of an inflow of currency, and therefore declares the above conditions.  But tomorrow the situation may change, others will arise.  And as always - suddenly and instantly.  Not the fact that the currency Belarus has is enough for everyone.  That is why Russian experts do not recommend playing such games.  However, mass exodus has not yet been observed, there is only a certain tendency. </p>
