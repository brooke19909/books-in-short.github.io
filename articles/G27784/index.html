His political achievements are still praised by compatriots.  He was the founder of the Republic of Turkey and the first president.  Someone is proud of the activities of a politician, someone finds cons.  And we will try to understand the <span>life path of</span> Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and learn about his achievements. </p><h2>  The beginning of life </h2><p>  In 1881, in the city of The Ottoman Empire, Thessaloniki (now Greece), the future leader of the Turks was born.  Interestingly, the exact date of birth of the politician is still unknown.  This is due to the fact that two brothers Mustafa died at birth, and parents, not believing in the future of their third son, did not even remember his birthday. </p><p>  The history of the Ataturk clan lasted more than one century.  The father of the great leader was from the Kojajik tribe.  Successes in military affairs, the father could not boast.  Despite the fact that he was able to curry favor with the rank of senior officer, he ended his life as a market trader.  The mother of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was an ordinary peasant woman.  Although, according to historians, Zubeide-hanym and her relatives were known in their social stratum due to religious teachings. </p>

    <h2>  Training a little dictator </h2><p>  Apparently therefore, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, whose biography is known to many of his compatriots, went to a religious school.  For his mother, this was very important, therefore, despite the obstinacy of character, the future leader endured strict orders and established boundaries of what was permitted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not known how the fate of the boy would have developed later if it had not been for his transfer to the economic sphere.  Then my father returned from service in Europe.  He was impressed by the newfangled desire of young people to study finance, and he decided that such an approach to the education of his son would be most suitable. </p><p>  Of course, the translation for Mustafa was a huge joy.  But after some time Ataturk began to burden monotonous everyday life in the school of economists.  And he began to spend a lot of time with his father.  Naturally, military affairs and what papa did were fascinating for him.  In his free time, he began to study strategy and tactics. </p><p>  But in 1888 the father of the future Turkish leader died.  Then Ataturk Mustafa Kemal decided to continue his studies at a military school.  Now the garrison life was necessary for the guy.  He went all the way to training as a senior officer with inspiration and thoughts about the future.  In 1899, after receiving secondary education, he entered the Istanbul Military School. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mustafa Kemal Ataturk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157040.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It was here that he received his middle name ‚ÄúKemal‚Äù from a local math teacher.  From Turkish, it meant ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, which, according to teachers, characterized the young leader.  He graduated from college with the rank of lieutenant and went on to study further at the Military Academy.  At the end of her, he became headquarters captain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  World War I influenced by Ataturk </h2><p>  The biography of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is still striking in its brightness and success.  The ruler first encountered real victories and defeats in the <span>First World War.</span>  He proved to the Entente that his training was not in vain and that <span>the Dardanelles</span> would not be so easy for the enemies.  A month later, Ataturk Mustafa Kemal again rebuffed the forces of the Entente on the Gellipoli Peninsula.  These achievements allowed the Turk to get closer to his cherished goal: he received the rank of colonel. </p><p>  In August 1915, Kemal justified his title - under his command, the Turks won the battle of Anafartal, Kireptep and again Anafartal.  The very next year, Mustafa was again promoted and he became lieutenant general.  After many victories, Atat√ºrk returned to Istanbul and after a while left for Germany, on the front line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mustafa Kemal Ataturk biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157042.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite a serious illness, Mustafa tried to return to the ranks of his army as soon as possible.  After becoming commander, he conducted a brilliant defensive operation.  At the end of 1918, the army was disbanded, and the future president returned to Istanbul and began working in the Ministry of Defense. </p><p>  From that moment, many reforms were carried out, thanks to which the salvation of the homeland became real.  Ataturk Ankara met with all honors.  The Turkish Republic did not exist yet, but the first step was already taken - Atat√ºrk Mustafa Kemal was elected as head of government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Turkish-Armenian war</span> with the help of the RSFSR </h2><p>  The war of the Turks with the Armenians took place in three periods.  Ataturk became the real leader of his country at that time.  He was helped by the Bolsheviks, both financially and militarily.  Moreover, the RSFSR supported the Turks for all two years (from 1920 to 1922).  At the beginning of the war, Kemal wrote to Lenin and asked for military support, after which 6,000 rifles, ammunition, shells, and even gold bullion arrived at the disposal of the Turks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mustafa Kemal Ataturk short biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157038.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In March 1921, an agreement was concluded on "friendship and brotherhood" in Moscow.  Then was offered <span>free financial assistance</span> and the supply of weapons.  The result of the war was the signing of a peace treaty in which the borders of the warring countries were determined. </p><h2>  Greco-Turkish war with numerous losses </h2><p>  The exact date the war began is unknown.  Nevertheless, the Turks decided to consider May 15, 1919 the beginning of the confrontation with the Greeks.  Then the Greeks landed in Izmir, and the Turks fired their first shots at the enemies.  Over the entire period of the battle, there were many key battles that most often ended with the victory of the Turks. </p><p>  Just after one of them, the battle of Sakarya, Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk received the title ‚ÄúGazi‚Äù and the new honorary title of Marshal from the Turkish Grand National Assembly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157044.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In August 1922, Atat√ºrk decided to make a final offensive, which was supposed to decide the outcome of the war.  In fact, this happened - in terms of tactics.  The Greek forces were destroyed, but during the retreat there was not enough fleet for all the soldiers and only a third were able to escape from the ambush.  The rest were captured. </p><p>  However, regardless of tactics, both sides lost in this war.  Both the Greeks and the Turks conducted brutal actions against the civilian population, and a huge number of people were left without housing. </p><h2>  Achievements of a great ruler </h2><p>  When the name Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is mentioned, a brief biography should also contain the achievements of the leader.  Naturally, the most impressive reforms took place after his appointment as president.  Immediately, in 1923, the country switched to a new form of government - a parliament and a constitution appeared. </p><p>  The new <span>capital of Turkey</span> was appointed the city of Ankara.  The reforms that followed were built not on a ‚Äúcosmetic repair‚Äù of the country, but specifically on a full-fledged internal restructuring.  Kemal was sure that for fundamental changes it is necessary to fundamentally change everything in society, culture and economics. </p><p>  The impetus for change was the belief in "civilization."  This word sounded in every speech of the president, the global idea was to impose Western European traditions and customs on Turkish society.  During his reign, Kemal eliminated not only the sultanate, but also the caliphate.  However, many religious schools and colleges were closed. </p><h2>  The magnificent mausoleum in honor of the Turkish president </h2><p>  Anitkabir (or Ataturk Mausoleum) is the burial place of Mustafa Kemal in Ankara.  An incredible and grandiose building is a popular attraction for tourists.  The construction was conceived in 1938 after the death of the Turkish president.  The architects tried to create such a cultural monument that for many centuries it designated the grandeur of this politician and became a manifestation of the grief of the entire Turkish people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ataturk is the burial of Mustafa Kemal" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157041.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The construction of the mausoleum began only in 1944, and the construction was opened after 9 years.  Now the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire complex occupies more than 750 thousand square meters.  Inside, there are also many sculptures that remind locals and tourists from all over the world about the greatness of the departed ruler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk about the war" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1157039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Opinion about the ruler </h2><p>  Public opinion about the Turkish president is twofold.  Of course, people still revere him, because it is not in vain that Ataturk is considered the "father of the Turks."  Many politicians also once praised Kemal‚Äôs rule.  Hitler, for example, considered himself the second student of Ataturk, the first was considered Mussolini. </p><p>  Many considered the leader a brilliant ruler and, undoubtedly, an impeccable military leader, since Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk knew about the war ‚Äúmore and more‚Äù.  Some nevertheless believed that his reforms were undemocratic, and the desire to rebuild the country led to a tough dictatorship. </p>
