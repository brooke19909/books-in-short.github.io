    <p>  <span>The highest score</span> (4.54) was received by the Thap Ba mud source, where therapeutic mineral mud and water were combined.  By visiting the source, you will not only improve your health, but also rest your soul.  Tropical greens, delicate aromas of plants and flowering trees will not leave you indifferent. </p><p>  One of the favorite places for visitors to Nha Trang is the Grill House with a rating of 4.5.  The institution is unique, because it provides the opportunity to independently prepare dishes from fresh seafood, of course, under the supervision and guidance of waiters.  You will be delighted with the excellent interior and enjoy the taste of the freshest seafood. </p><p>  The unique beauty of nature, clean sandy beaches, warm coastal water and the sky-blue sea made Nha Trang Bay popular with tourists, which received 4.47 points.  This place will not leave indifferent even the most evil critics.  Pure clear water makes it possible to see the local underwater world. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  About Golden Lotus Hotel 2 * <span>(Vietnam),</span> visitors <span>reviews are</span> mixed.  Guests note from the advantages of the hotel beautiful views from the windows (but this applies only to those who stayed in deluxe rooms and on higher floors), the location near the sea, excellent service and excellent staff, as well as the hotel's location on the first coastline.  But placement on the first line is also a definite drawback, because the hotel is very noisy, especially on the lower floors.  Therefore, in Golden Lotus Hotel 2 * it is best to book rooms on the upper floors, a little overpay, but enjoy a first-class vacation. </p>

The hotel has good service - at a high level, friendly staff, always smiling girls at the reception, daily high-quality cleaning. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The biggest minus Golden Lotus Hotel 2 * reviews of guests are called the restaurant of the hotel.  Most visitors do not even try to eat here, because the prices and quality are not satisfied with most tourists.  But it‚Äôs impossible to stay hungry in the town, because when you leave the hotel you will see a million different cafes where the prices are not as high as in the center or in the hotel. </p><p>  The standard room received the worst reviews, it is recommended not to spare money to book a more expensive, but comfortable room with all amenities. </p><p>  Based on reviews from the TripAdvisor community, where there are 46 comments, the ratings of tourists are determined, 19% of which are ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, 40% are ‚Äúvery good‚Äù, 20% are ‚Äúgood‚Äù and the remaining 21% are ‚Äúbad and terrible‚Äù. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  Despite the disadvantages of Golden Lotus Hotel 2 *, Nha Trang will not disappoint tourists, and nothing will ruin your vacation in such a beautiful sunny city. </p>
