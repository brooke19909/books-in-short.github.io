    <h2>  What is included? </h2><p>  Everything necessary for work is in the boxed version of Huawei Honor 6. A review of the specifications for its delivery indicates the presence of such components and accessories: </p><ul><li>  A smart phone with a diagonal of 5 inches and an integrated battery capacity of 3100 mA / h. </li><li>  Brand stereo headset. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Two protective films. </li><li>  MicroUSB / YUSB adapter wire. </li><li>  Gadget manual and warranty card. </li><li>  Device for installing SIM cards.  The case itself is one-piece, it is impossible to disassemble it without special devices. </li></ul><h2>  Appearance and usability of the device </h2><p>  The diagonal of the display is 5 inches from the smart phone Huawei Honor 6. Overview <strong> </strong>  it should start with an appearance that clearly indicates that it is a premium device.  Side ribs made of sheet metal.  The front panel of the device is made of tempered glass "Corning GorillaGlaz" 3rd generation.  The back cover is made of a special composite material, on which a special special protective coating is applied.  In general, in the appearance of this gadget there is a certain degree of similarity with the previous generation iPhone, but only the dimensions of this device are much larger.  As noted earlier, the display diagonal of this smart smartphone is an impressive 5 inches.  Therefore, it will be quite difficult to control it with one hand, but with two it will not be difficult.  The physical buttons for powering up and volume control are displayed on the left edge of the smartphone, and the other three touch buttons, as expected, are harmoniously located under the screen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The central processor is the <span>strength of the</span> Huawei Honor 6. In this case, we are talking about the Kirin 920. This is Huawei‚Äôs own development.  This chip consists of 8 cores, but only 4 of them can be in operation.  That is, this processor runs on BigLittle technology.  Its essence lies in the fact that, depending on the computing needs of the device, either high-performance cores or energy-efficient modules are involved.  In the first case, we are talking about 4 cores based on the A15 architecture, which operate in maximum load mode at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  And in the second use of the Kirin 920, the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù 4 A7 modules are included in the work, which provide a high level of energy efficiency of the device.  Now about the practical experience of using this unit.  The computational capabilities of this CPU are enough to output 4K video - it‚Äôs without problems the most demanding 3D toys of the latest generation, for example, Asphalt 8.  All other tasks are much simpler; coping with them is not difficult for this processor. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics </h2><p>  The Huawei Honor 6 phone is equipped with a high-performance graphics adapter called the Mali-T628 MP4.  The latter will cope with any task today.  The diagonal of the display of this device is 5 inches, and its resolution is 1920 x 1080. The matrix of the screen is made using one of the most advanced technologies to date - IPS.  Another plus of this smart phone is that it can handle up to 10 touches to its surface, including gloves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Photos and videos </h2><p>  As expected, there are two cameras at once in this smart phone.  The one that is displayed on the back of the device is based on a 13 megapixel sensor element.  The developers did not forget to expand the capabilities of this camera using autofocus, digital zoom and dual LED backlight.  In general, it is impossible to find fault with the quality of images obtained with its help: they are impeccable.  Also, with its help, you can record in HD format.  The quality of the videos in this case is also excellent.  There is also a <span>front camera</span> for Huawei Honor 6. Photos taken with it will be much worse: it has a sensor of only 5 megapixels.  But the main <span>task of this</span> camera is to make video calls, and for this its technical specifications are quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Not bad things are with the memory subsystem for a more advanced modification of this smart phone - Huawei Honor 6 32GB.  A review of its technical specifications points to 2 GB of installed RAM.  This is enough for comfortable and smooth operation of most applications.  And the capacity of the built-in drive, as you might guess, is ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù 32 GB.  Also, the developers did not forget to equip this device with a slot for installing an external drive, the maximum capacity of which can be 64 GB.  There is also a basic modification of this smartphone.  It differs from the advanced model of this gadget in the reduced capacity of the built-in drive, which in this case is only 16 GB.  As a result, the cost of such a smartphone is significantly less than that of the improved version. </p><h2>  Battery features </h2><p>  One of the main disadvantages of this device is the built-in battery, which in case of breakage can only be replaced in a specialized service center.  On the other hand, such a constructive solution provides impeccable build quality of the housing.  The capacity of the complete battery is 3100 mA / h.  One charge is enough for 2-3 days of battery life with an average level of use of Huawei Honor 6. Reviews of some owners suggest that with maximum battery life savings, this value can be increased to 4-5 days.  But at maximum load of this device, one charge lasts a maximum of 8-12 hours.  That is, every evening this smartphone will have to be put on a charge at a similar intensity. </p>

    <h2>  System software and application software </h2><p>  Currently, Huawei Honor 6 is running the most popular Android mobile operating system version 4.4.2.  Given the fact that its modification 5.0 was relatively recently introduced, it is quite possible to expect in the foreseeable future system software updates of this gadget to this version.  As expected for the Huawei Honor series of devices, the firmware of this device is supplemented by the proprietary shell Emotion UI version 2.3, which is literally crammed with a number of useful utilities.  There is also a set of basic applications and standard programs from Google on the device.  Chinese programmers did not forget about international social services, among which Facebook, Twiter, Instagram and Linkenid can be distinguished.  But there aren‚Äôt the same Odnoklassniki or My World, they will have to be installed separately from the application store. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Impressive opportunities for data exchange in Huawei Honor 6. Reviews of satisfied owners on this issue once again confirm this.  In this case, we are talking about the following communication modules: </p><ul><li>  The main way to connect to the global web is through Wi-Fi.  In this case, the peak <span>data transfer rate</span> can reach a fantastic 150 Mbps.  That allows you to download and upload files of any size.  The only drawback of this wireless standard is its small range, which in the best case can be 10 meters. </li><li>  This smartphone model can be equipped with one or two slots for installing SIM cards.  The first slot allows the device to work in all mobile networks: GSM, 3G and LTE.  As a result, if there is a 4th generation connection, the speed can reach the same 150 Mbps.  But the second slot (if any) allows the gadget to function only in networks of the 2nd generation. </li><li>  The developers have not forgotten about bluetooth - this is an ideal solution for the exchange of a small amount of information between mobile devices. </li><li>  For navigation, a universal ZhPS module is installed in this device, which allows this smart phone to exchange information not only with GPS, but also with the domestic GLONASS. </li><li>  To connect to a computer and to charge the battery, the most popular port today is used - microUSB. </li><li>  For external acoustics, it is best to use a 3.5 mm port.  It is brought to the top edge of the smartphone. </li></ul><h2>  <strong>Opinion from</strong> </h2><p>  The opinion of experts and experts agrees that Huawei engineers have done very serious work on the bugs.  There are no problems with stability and reliability that the devices of this brand had before.  A striking example of this statement is Huawei Honor 6. A review of the reviews by the owners of this gadget only convinces of this.  This smartphone model has practically no drawbacks.  The only thing that causes at least some complaints is a one-piece case.  On the other hand, its build quality is impeccable, and the battery is quite capacious, therefore, when using the device, there should be no problems with it.  But the advantages of this device are more than enough.  This is the processor, this is a large and high-quality screen, and a large amount of memory, and reliability. </p>
