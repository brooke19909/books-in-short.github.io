  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nai Yang Beach, Phuket: description, tourist infrastructure, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you decide to spend your vacation in an exotic resort and prefer the island of Phuket, then the first question that arises before you arrive here will be: ‚ÄúWhat beach in Phuket should I choose?‚Äù  And you will be right, because there are many beaches here, and each of them has its own advantages. </p><p>  One of the best places on the island for sunbathing is Nai Yang Beach (Phuket).  Reviews left by numerous tourists describe him as one of the least populated and calm.  Here you will get the opportunity to enjoy wildlife while being alone with yourself.  You can choose to live in a comfortable hotel or set up a tent on the shores of Nai Yang Bay and be completely alone with nature.  The choice is yours! </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="deserted beach" class="if uuid-3214435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214435.jpg"></div><h2>  When is the best time to relax? </h2><p>  Nai Yang Beach (Phuket) welcomes tourists from all over the world all year round.  Someone comes here for outdoor activities, others just to sunbathe.  In any case, no matter what your goal is, it‚Äôs better to focus on the seasons, as there is a time for each type of vacation. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that there are two seasons in Phuket: high (dry) and low (rainy).  The first, in turn, is conditionally divided into two periods - dry and hot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The high season begins in November and lasts until March.  It is called the holiday season.  At this time, the average air temperature during the day is around +30 ... + 33 ¬∞ C.  It rains infrequently, mostly at night.  At this time, the island has the largest influx of tourists.  They come here from all over the world, and most of all Russians come here, because at this time of the year they have a harsh winter with severe frosts at home.  Here they are waiting for a great vacation on the beach. </p><p>  The second part of the high season falls on three spring months - from March to May.  At this time, it gets much hotter here, the air warms up to +40 ¬∞ C, while the temperature of sea water rarely drops below +30 ¬∞ C.  According to numerous tourists, this period is the most suitable for a budget holiday. </p><p>  The weather in Phuket in March, especially in the first two weeks, will be pleasant enough to take sun baths and swim in the sea.  Tropical rains have not yet begun, although the humidity has increased significantly, which at a very moderate temperature gives a feeling of heat.  But during this period, prices for everything are reduced, vacationers become much less, and you can comfortably spend your vacation here. </p><h2>  Where is? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the plane is landing" class="if uuid-3214436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214436.jpg"></div><p>  The question of how to get to Nai Yang Beach arises from every traveler as soon as he arrives at the international airport on the island of Phuket.  You can get here using the services of taxi drivers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nai Yang Beach in Phuket is just a few kilometers from the airport.  A taxi ride costs about 200 baht, and it is quite inexpensive.  Another type of transport does not go here, although if you take a bus that goes from the old bus station to the airport, you can get off at the signpost to Nai Yang Beach, wait for a taxi and get to the coast. </p><h2>  Where to settle </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to the island "for the sun" and chooses Nai Yang (Phuket) beach for this, agree that there is a great selection of hotels for every taste, from the most budgetary to luxury five-star hotels.  Due to the fact that the beach itself does not occupy top positions due to the tourism infrastructure that has not yet been developed, hotels have the best value for money. </p><p>  On the first line of the sea, as a rule, there are 4 * and 5 * hotels, among which are such well-known as: </p><ul><li>  The State 5 * - located on the shores of the Andaman Sea, surrounded by the unspoiled beauty of tropical nature.  It offers elegantly decorated rooms with beach views, a pool for families with children, two pools and an adult spa.  Each apartment has air conditioning and furniture from local manufacturers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Spa hotel" class="if uuid-3214441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214441.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Nai Yang Beach Resort and Spa 4 * - here you will find beautiful rooms decorated in a modern style, with air conditioning, cable TV and a private balcony.  The windows offer a magnificent view of the bay and the coast, overgrown with pristine rainforests.  The hotel has a spa, swimming pool and parking for transport guests. </li></ul><p>  On the second line, away from the sea, anyone can find more budget hotels for themselves.  The cheapest of them are located at a distance of up to 500 meters or more from the water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Description of the beach: Northern part </h2><p>  If you have a desire to get away from civilization and take a break from its hustle and bustle, then the best place for this is Nai Yang Beach.  Its description should begin with the territory of the National Park in which it is located.  Here is one of the most environmentally friendly places on the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Northern part" class="if uuid-3214449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214449.jpg"></div><p>  Nai Yang Beach consists of three parts: North, Central and South.  The first is not often visited by tourists, but there are a lot of local residents who come here to relax with their families.  There are no sun loungers and sunbeds on the beach, since it is not very wide in this place, only about 10 meters.  So getting from the water to the grass and wallowing in the shade of the trees will not be difficult. </p><p>  Tourism infrastructure is underdeveloped here.  There are only a few small hotels standing a hundred meters from the coast. </p><h2>  central part </h2><p>  The most populated and "densely populated" part of the beach is its center.  All the most expensive hotels are located here, there are restaurants and minibars.  You can also find small bazaars where Thais sell handmade souvenirs, as well as many exotic fruits and other dishes. </p><p>  In addition, from the central part of Nai Yang Beach, where there are many tour agencies, you can, using their services, get to the main attractions of the island. </p><h2>  southern part </h2><p>  The most deserted area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coast is its southern side.  There is not a single asphalt road, not a single, even the most "seedy" hotel.  In some ways, this side of Nai Yang Beach (Phuket) resembles its northern part, but unlike it, here you will not meet day or night people resting on the seashore or just strolling along the water's edge. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Offers: </p><ul><li>  Sirinat National Park.  Located on the east side of Nai Yang Beach.  Many who have visited it speak with enthusiasm of its fabulously beautiful, untouched civilization virgin forests, where you can meet rare plants and animals.  If you have a desire to explore the park with a guide, you can order a paid tour.  If you like to take your time to inspect everything yourself, special tourist paths with signs have been laid here for this. </li></ul><p>  Here, while walking through the forest, you can observe in nature a lot of birds and animals, such as snakes, monitor lizards, and sometimes even turtles. </p><ul><li>  Wat Nai Young.  This Buddhist temple is located in the central part of Nai Yang Beach (Phuket).  Previously, this shrine played a very large role in the spiritual life of all Buddhists in this part of the island.  Many tourists who visited it, strongly recommend that everyone who visits here not to miss the opportunity to get acquainted with the temple. </li><li>  Big Buddha - although this is the youngest of the Buddhist shrines in Phuket, but this statue is by far the largest of all sculptures in Thailand.  Its height is 45 meters, width - 25.5 meters, respectively.  You can visit this attraction on the island by ordering an excursion in one of the travel agencies in the central part of Nai Yang Beach. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket101.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="big buddha" class="if uuid-3214454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214454.jpg"></div><ul><li>  On the island of Phuket, in addition to Buddhist shrines, in 2011, the Orthodox Temple was opened, bearing the name of the Holy Life-giving Trinity.  It was built in three years.  It is the largest among all Orthodox churches in the country.  Its height is more than 25 meters.  It is located in a very beautiful place, surrounded on all sides by a dense tropical forest. </li></ul><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the entire tourist infrastructure of Nai Yang Beach is located in its central part.  Here you will find everything that is not available in other places of the beach: small shops, cafes, bars, restaurants.  There is a market several times a week where you can buy groceries and essentials for a pleasant and comfortable stay. </p><p>  Local cafes and restaurants offer Thai and European dishes.  In a restaurant you have lunch or dinner, of course, will cost more than in a cafe.  But the menu here is more diverse, you can taste the popular seafood dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel restaurant" class="if uuid-3214460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214460.jpg"></div><p>  There are almost no entertainment establishments in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach, so if you wish, you can go somewhere closer to the airport, where you can find anything you want. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  What can you have fun on Nai Yang Beach, except for sunbathing and swimming in the azure waters of the tropical sea?  There are a lot of options. </p><p>  Since part of the beach is part of the National Reserve, some restrictions are introduced here.  Especially they relate to the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reserve, where it is forbidden to ride jet skis, boats and even yachts, so as not to harm animals living among coral reefs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sea-bees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral reefs" class="if uuid-3214466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3214466.jpg"></div><p>  But no one will forbid you to engage in water sports such as surfing or kite boarding.  There are even special training centers where you could get the appropriate skills and rent the right equipment. </p><p>  You can visit the picturesque coral reefs and get acquainted with its inhabitants by going to the northern part of the beach.  They are located just one kilometer from the coast, and at low tide they can be easily forded.  Such walks do not pose any danger, so it is advisable to take children with you. </p><p>  There is another interesting place in the vicinity of Nai Yang Beach, which, according to numerous reviews by guests of the island, is definitely worth a visit.  This is Splash Jungle Waterpark.  The whole family should come here, as there is entertainment for fans of extreme sports, as well as for those who prefer to spend time swimming in the calm waters of the pools, and then sit over a cup of coffee in a cozy cafe.  You can get here by ordering a transfer, or by taxi. </p>
