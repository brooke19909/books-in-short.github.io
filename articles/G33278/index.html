Cordoba is recognized as a famous tourist center, harmoniously combining the heritage of various cultures.  The sunny city, which is the capital of the province of the same name, will appeal to everyone who leads an active lifestyle, and the breath of breath comes from the beauty of historical monuments. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The name of the ancient settlement of Kart-Oba was given by the Phoenicians, and later the Persians captured the territory, which marked the rule of Carthage.  During the Roman Empire, the city of Korduba was considered one of the largest and most cultured, but the beginning of the rise is still considered the X century, when Muslims came to power, who opened free schools for rich and poor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather cordoba spain" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1374373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The benefits of civilization appeared - water supply, street lighting and sewage.  The construction of luxurious palaces with fountains and spacious houses with wide streets began, and the capital of the emirate was one of the richest cities in the world. </p><p>  Three hundred years after joining the <span>Kingdom of Spain,</span> the population falls due to epidemics and hunger, and only at the beginning of the 20th century does a new revival and prosperity of the country's cultural capital begin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hospitable city </h2><p>  Every year millions of tourists take sunny and welcoming Spain.  Cordoba is no exception.  The city, offering to actively relax and have fun, is rich in attractions that cannot be told about.  There are a large number of architectural monuments of interest to foreigners in the tourist center, and we will try to talk about the most interesting of them.  Historic buildings of various eras have fancifully woven into a single ensemble. </p><p>  The first buildings appeared after the capture of the territory by the Romans, and now the eyes of the guests of the country appear ruins of majestic structures, the beauty of which you can only guess. </p><h2>  The ruins of the Roman temple </h2><p>  The oldest attraction is the Roman Temple, which is a valuable cultural heritage site that Spain is proud of.  Cordoba, the prosperous capital of the Roman province, needed a temple dedicated to the emperor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cordoba city Spain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1374372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such a sanctuary appeared in the 1st century and became the main religious building of the ancient city.  Destroyed over time, Templo Romano was discovered relatively recently - in 1950.  The ruins of an ancient temple, which are restored marble columns, an altar, a podium from carved blocks, can be seen by any tourist, and some of the fragments are stored in the city museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a model of a valuable building, and city guests have a unique opportunity to get acquainted with what the temple supposedly looked like during the reign of the Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Oldest bridge </h2><p>  Another important historical monument, which is famous for the beautiful city of Cordoba (Spain), is the Roman bridge, which appeared during the reign of Emperor Augustus.  For several centuries, this powerful structure was the only trade route across the Guadalquivir River. </p><p>  The structure consisting of 16 arches did not survive to this day and was destroyed to the ground during numerous wars.  Gradually, the bridge was rebuilt on the old foundation.  Since 2004, the passage of vehicles has been banned from the oldest building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cordoba spain photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1374370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Located on the bridge, the sculpture of the patron saint of the city - the <span>archangel Raphael,</span> is of great interest to tourists.  Candles always burn near the statue and there are flowers that residents daily bring to their protector. </p><h2>  Shawl Street </h2><p>  The testimonies of past eras will amaze in the heart of visiting guests and share interesting stories that Spain is rich in.  Cordoba is famous all over the world for Callejita del Pa√±uelo - the most famous street of the city leading to a dead end.  The amusing place gained fame thanks to its width equal to the diagonal of a man‚Äôs scarf - not more than 50 centimeters. </p><p>  Nobody already remembers the real name of the attraction, and tourists enthusiastically squeeze through the narrow passage, making memorable photos. </p><h2>  Flower street </h2><p>  You can not pass by another street, drowning in a huge number of flowers.  Located in the Arab quarter, Calle de Flores is not in vain considered a symbol of the historical center of the country. </p><p>  Cordoba (Spain), whose sights are very diverse, has always been considered the most picturesque city, filled with warmth and light.
