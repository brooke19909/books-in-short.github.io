It is best to do this in markets where you not only see the taste preferences of the inhabitants, but also understand the nature of the people.  Georgians have always been distinguished by cordiality and a benevolent attitude towards the guests of their country. </p><p>  In the markets of the capital of Georgia, the wonderful city of Tbilisi, you understand this like nowhere else.  Sellers do their best to lure the buyer, offering to try goodies and praising their goods.  Smiles do not leave the faces of merry merchants, and it is simply impossible to refuse a purchase and leave the market empty-handed.  At least something, but be sure to buy it.  Consider what are the most famous markets in Tbilisi and where they are located. </p><h2>  Most famous market </h2><p>  There are countless large and small spontaneous markets in Tbilisi.  However, the most famous and oldest is the Deserter.  This market arose in the Soviet era in the area of ​​the railway station.  Sellers offered their goods to tourists.  The place was very successful and lively.  Since then, the Deserter Market of Tbilisi has only grown and developed. </p>

    <p>  Now it occupies a vast territory both on the surface of the earth, and in numerous underground passages.  Under the ground are rows of merchants of clothes and shoes, various souvenirs and household goods.  And in the fresh air you can buy products.  Merchants vying to entice buyers, painting their goods in every way.  In Georgia, it is customary to bargain, this is one of the characteristics of the culture of the people.  Locals love bazaars more than supermarkets, only because of the opportunity to chat, bargain, try and argue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Deserter Market in Tbilisi got its historical name after the disbandment of military units, when they actively traded in uniforms, which were taken from warehouses by enterprising soldiers.  The second name at the bazaar is Borjomi.  There is a bazaar at the address: 186 Mikhail Tsinamgrishvili Street (near the railway station).  It works from 7 am to 5 pm.  One day a week is a day off on Mondays.  Getting to it is easy.  Walk on foot from Station Square (Vokzalnaya) metro station or from the Tsinamgrishvili bus stop (routes 15, 21, 33, 26, 84 and 86). </p><h2>  Georgia goods </h2><p>  In the markets of Tbilisi, in addition to the products that tourists buy for food, I also want to bring home goods that are produced only here.  First of all, this applies to home-made cheeses, which are made by manufacturers in a large assortment.  This was beloved by the locals, they had kweli or <span>Imereti cheese,</span> tenili, chogi, suluguni, kalti, and nadug, not to mention the numerous varieties of cheese.  There are soft, layered cheeses, and there are hard ones, like rubber, which can be stored for a long time.  Shepherds used it in long mountain passes of sheep through passes. </p>

    <p>  Often seasoning lovers buy adjika and tkemali as souvenirs in Tbilisi markets.  These are spicy and very delicious Georgian national sauces.  According to visitors, such seasonings are very different in taste from those bought, for example, in Russia.  Although the name is the same, but the taste is much better. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sweet Churchkhela </h2><p>  Arriving on vacation in this wonderful country, be sure to try the local sweet home-made.  This is the famous churchkhela made from grape juice and nuts.  Such a delicacy cannot be compared with any artificial candy.  Buy the child more nuts. </p>

    <p>  Attract the markets of Tbilisi and their shops with spices.  Places to trade these products can be found by flavor, you do not even need to ask where they are in the market.  You won’t find such a quantity of spices anywhere else.  According to experienced tourists, they only saw such rows in Turkey. </p><h2>  Georgian pastries </h2><p>  Do not miss the shops selling real pastries, traditional Georgian cakes with crispy crust.  These mini-bakeries are usually held by family dynasties, transmitting recipes from father to son.  In traditional "tone" ovens, ruddy nazuki, lush maduri, pita bread and shoti are baked.  On the Deserter, such a bakery can be seen from afar.  At the entrance to the store is always the turn of buyers.  According to tourists, this is a very tasty and healthy bread, they sell it hot, right from the oven. </p><h2>  Flea market in Tbilisi </h2><p>  In every major city there is always a bazaar where they sell all sorts of things, necessary and completely useless.  Such markets are commonly called fleas.  In Tbilisi, such a bazaar also has another name - the Dry Bridge.  This is due to its location.  Previously, at this place was a bridge over the rapid river flow <span>of the Kura River.</span>  It was built by Italian architect Giovani Scudieri in 1881.  When the river became shallow and eventually dried up, the bridge was called Dry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  It is interesting to wander around the market.  Among the huge number of old things you can find a real treasure, antique items that can decorate any room.  These are traditional Georgian daggers, rare flasks, antique dishes, natural carpets, phonograph records. </p><p>  Separately located rows with military-themed goods.  This uniform, and binoculars, flasks, belts, bowlers, orders, etc. There are even medical supplies: scalpels, tweezers, boiling boxes, a variety of surgical instruments. </p><p>  From various radio products, my eyes run up.  For collectors, such a market is a godsend.  You can find <span>coins from different countries</span> and times, antique telephones, cameras, typewriters, gramophones and records for them, dishes made of copper and brass, cauldrons and pans.  Total not to list. </p><p>  Separately arranged rows on the market with new copyrighted works.  These are homemade souvenirs and toys, paintings with views of Georgia.  If you purchased a thing in such a market, you need to take care of the export of this product abroad.  They may not miss a valuable thing at customs, so you need to think ahead and take the seller’s export permit so that there are no unforeseen problems. </p><p>  You can find the market at: Dry Bridge (near DedaEna Park).  From the metro station “Freedom Square”, from Rustaveli Avenue or from the Sukhoi Bridge bus stop (routes 20, 23, 95), you can walk to the bazaar.  It works from 9.00 to 17.00, every day.  According to tourists, in rainy weather sellers diverge, so it makes no sense to visit the market in the rain. </p><h2>  Manufactured goods market </h2><p>  It is best to head for the new clothes to the huge Lilo wholesale market in Tbilisi.  It is located far from the center, at the exit from the city limits along the Kakheti highway.  Getting there is easy.  From the railway station and from Didube bus, there are frequent shuttles to the industrial market. </p>

    <p>  Trade occurs wholesale and retail.  Both simple buyers and owners of city shops are selling.  Wholesalers from other cities of Georgia come for goods.  The prices there are loyal, so it makes sense to walk around the retail space.  Of course, the bulk of the goods were brought from China, as in all other CIS markets, but Turkish things can also be found. </p>
