    <h2>  The young heir to the old noble name </h2><p>  On November 25, 1717, in Moscow, a son was born to the ensign Pyotr Sumarokov, who was named Alexander.  Like many children from old noble families, the Sumarokovs belonged to the family, the boy received his initial training and education at home under the guidance of teachers and tutors employed by his parents. </p><p>  In those years, many young nobles preferred a military career.  Alexander Sumarokov was no exception.  The biography of his independent life begins when, at the age of fifteen, he enters the Ground <span>Gentry Corps,</span> opened in St. Petersburg at the behest of Empress Anna Ioannovna.  Within his walls, he spends eight years and here for the first time begins to engage in literature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cadet Corps and upcoming career </h2><p>  During his studies in the cadet corps, the novice writer writes poems and lyrics, taking as a model the works of French authors and his compatriot <span>V. Trediakovsky.</span>  His first poetic experiments were the poetic arrangements of the psalms.  In addition, he fulfills the orders of his comrades - he writes on their behalf congratulatory odes to the Empress Anna Ivanovna who reigned in those years, which was in great fashion. </p>

    <p>  In 1740, Alexander Sumarokov was among the young officers graduating from the corps.  Biography says that his life in those years evolved perfectly.  At twenty-three, he enrolled in the office of Count Minich, and soon became the personal secretary of the first Count Golovin, and then the all-powerful Alexei Razumovsky.  But, despite the career that opened before him, he devoted himself entirely to literature.  His idol of those years is Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov, whose famous odes became for Sumarokov a model of harmony and a guide in the search for a creative path. </p><h2>  First deserved fame </h2><p>  However, no real artist can be satisfied only by imitating what was created by someone else, he is always looking for his own style.  That is what Sumarokov did.  The biography of his creative life really begins when the salons of the educated Petersburg aristocracy in many appear lists of his love songs.  This genre was not chosen by the author by chance.  It was he who, to the greatest extent, allowed the spiritual state of Alexander to be revealed - a young brilliant officer, full of romantic experiences inherent in his age. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the real glory was brought to him by the production of his poetic drama "Horev", which took place at the court in 1747.  Then she went out of print, becoming the property of the general public, which made his name popularly known.  After that, also at the court, several plays were performed, the author of which was Sumarokov.  The biography of his work goes from this time to a new level - he becomes a professional writer. </p><h2>  The rich creative life of Sumarokov </h2><p>  In 1752, a significant event took place.  Empress <span>Elizaveta Petrovna,</span> with her decree, called from Yaroslavl the outstanding theater figure of those years F.G. Volkov and entrusted him with organizing the first permanent theater in Russia, with Sumarokov as director. </p><p>  A brief biography of him only in general terms can give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe invaluable contribution that this person made to the formation of Russian stage life, but in the memory of future generations he has been preserved as the ‚Äúfather of the Russian theater,‚Äù which, you see, is more eloquent than any words. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Sumarokov photo" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/1027524.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  His creative heritage is unusually wide.  It is enough to recall the eight tragedies that came out from under his pen, twenty comedies and three opera libretto.  In addition, Sumarokov left a significant mark in other literary fields.  His works are published on the pages of the academic journal "Monthly Works", and in 1759 he begins to publish his own journal, "Hardworking Bee."  In subsequent years, numerous collections of his poems and fables went out of print. </p><h2>  The end of the poet's life and the memory of posterity </h2><p>  The management of the Sumarokov Theater was carried out until 1761.  After that, he still lives in the capital for some time, and then in 1769 he moved to Moscow.  Here he has a serious conflict with Commander-in-Chief P. Saltykov, whose side the Empress takes.  This causes emotional trauma to the poet and entails serious material problems.  But, despite adversity, in the seventies he, according to researchers, wrote his best works, such as Dmitry the Pretender, The Nonsense, and many others.  He died on October 12, 1777 and was buried at the <span>Don cemetery in Moscow.</span> </p>

    <p>  Descendants fully appreciated the merits of this man to the Fatherland.  Among the outstanding historical figures of the state, Alexander Sumarokov is represented at the famous monument ‚ÄúMillennium of Russia‚Äù (the reader can see the photo of this object on the page).  Entire generations of poets grew up on his works, making up the glory and pride of our culture, and his theatrical compositions became a textbook for future playwrights. </p>
