    <p>  Prince <span>Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn,</span> who fell out of favor with Empress Anna Ioannovna, was expelled to Moscow and lived in Arkhangelsk before being arrested in 1736.  In 1741, the estate was returned to the son of the prince, Alexei Dmitrievich, and after that the estate was transferred to Nikolai Alekseevich Golitsyn.  It was he who laid the foundation for the construction of a large palace and park ensemble.  The architects of the buildings were Frenchman S. Guern, Italians Giacomo Trombaro and Giovanni Petondi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the projects of these architects were built: </p><ul><li>  terraces with marble balustrades, decorated with flower beds, sculptures and busts of ancient heroes; </li><li>  ensemble of buildings "Caprice" with a library, playpen and garden. </li></ul><p>  In 1810, the Arkhangelskoye museum-estate was acquired by the famous collector N. B. Yusupov.  The prince bought it to store his exhibits, but the war with Napoleon forced him to transfer everything to Astrakhan.  Arkhangelsk itself was subsequently plundered. </p><p>  After the fire in 1820, the estate was restored again, for which the best architects from Moscow I. Zhukov, E. Tyurin, O. Beauvais and Giuseppe Artari were invited.  After the appearance of the new park, the estate was called "Versailles near Moscow". </p><p>  Not only famous figures of Russian culture loved to come here, but also members of the tsarist dynasty.  It was precisely at this time that the Arkhangelskoye estate began to be popular, and visitors rushed en masse there. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XX century, the estate was renovated by the architect P.V. Kharko.  Also in 1910, the painter I. I. Nivinsky restored the murals and grisailles of the main house.  And in 1919 the estate received the status of a historical and art museum.  In the period from 1934 to 1937, the buildings of the military sanatorium "Arkhangelskoye" were built here. </p><p>  For 35 years (1945-1980), the sports club CSKA was located on the estate. </p><h2>  Manor Arkhangelskoye - how to get to your destination? </h2>
