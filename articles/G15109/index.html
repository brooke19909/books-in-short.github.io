If we consider the region of the Russian Federation, then it is located in the Krasnodar Territory.  Its height is about 860 m above sea level.  The territory on which this mountain is located is called the Black Sea Reserve.  It is located at a distance of 40 km from such a settlement as the city of Tuapse.  The mountain is formed as a result of a volcanic eruption.  It is mostly rocky, therefore it is widely popular among mountaineering enthusiasts.  They come to Mount Turkey most often from April to June and from September to the end of October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turkey mountain" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mountain name </h2><p>  Turkey is a mountain that, as many have long noticed, has a funny name for the well-known poultry.  It is possible that this is why the name arose.  The fact is that visually the configuration of the mountain in the past resembled the head of a turkey, but after many years, under the influence of natural processes, the shape changed, but the name remained.  This is one of the versions.  There is also one that is associated with the Adyghe phrase "mountain of Hindus."  And according to another version, the name translates as "Sind mountain." </p><h2>  Interesting information about the mountain </h2><p>  As it was written above, ascents are often made on Mount Turkey.  This is a snap even for beginners.  And it's not about climbing with all the necessary equipment.  The fact is that a convenient path leads to the summit, which is laid through the Black Sea reserve. </p><p>  During World War II, long battles took place in this area.  And therefore, those who are interested in visiting such places and looking for trophies are currently coming here.  Many have already managed to find a lot of interesting things. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Local territories have long been carefully cleared of probable mines and other shells, and also erected monuments to heroically fallen in battle.  Grateful descendants today bring fresh flowers to these monuments and obelisks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain turkey Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376673.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Based on all of the above, it becomes clear that Mount Turkey (Krasnodar Territory) in Tuapse district is very popular.  And what routes lead here? </p><p>  You can get there in various ways, for example, by train.  To get to the mountain with this type of railway transport, you need to get up at the station "Turkey".  Then walk to the nearest village, cross the paved bridge, turn left and head into the forest.  From there you can see a marked path that leads to the mountain, however, along a steep climb.  However, at the end of the journey he becomes more gentle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Sea reserve" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The way by personal transport </h2><p>  It is possible to get to these places by private car or hire a taxi.  You can start the journey not only from such a settlement as the city of Tuapse, but also from Krasnodar.  At the station "Turkey" the vehicle will have to be left in the parking lot near the village itself.  Then you need to go the same way as when traveling by train. </p><p>  And you can get to Mount Turkey from the other end.  You need to get to the village of Gorny, turn along the dirt road to the left and, having passed quite a bit, you can see wonderful mountain landscapes.  On an SUV, you can really get almost close to the rocks.  However, the path leads up and it is difficult to climb on it, so few people prefer to use this path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="route to mount turkey" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, many paths and roads lead to the top.  But it is advisable to pre-study those that are more popular than others.  In general, the route to Mount Turkey is very interesting and beautiful, due to the surrounding nature.  Many tourists stay overnight, setting up tents.  The most suitable places for this are at the cliffs and in the valley of rivers and waterfalls, which are located near the top. </p><p>  Few will regret the perfect journey.  It is worth noting that there are always quite a lot of tourists here, so no one will be left alone for sure.  Food, personal hygiene products, clothing - all this must be taken with you, since it is quite difficult to purchase such things in this area.  This can be explained by the lack of stores. </p>
