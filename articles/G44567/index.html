By studying signs, a person expands his consciousness and can take a fresh look at the world. </p><h2>  Alpha </h2><p>  Alpha is a symbol of birth in the Greek alphabet.  In Syrian, Cretan and Sinai, the letter was turned upside down and looked like a horned head of a bull in the shape of a triangle.  In various Aramaic, Palestinian and Attic versions, she leans to the side and, in the end, comes to our "A". </p><h2>  Greek alphabet </h2><p>  Currently, the Greek alphabet is used by the Greek diasporas in the Black Sea region of Russia, southern Italy and southern Albania, as well as by some Arumans and meglenorumins, gypsies, Slavs, and Muslim groups in northern Greece. </p>

    <p>  It is also widely used in science.  For example, in chemistry, when designating organic compounds, in physics - many constants, quantities, and more, in astronomy - angles, shapes, and planes, the alpha symbol is used.  In mathematics, they denote, for example, the sine of an angle. </p><h2>  Letters of the greek alphabet </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In ancient times, all letters had a sacred meaning. </p><p>  So, the symbols <span>alpha, beta, gamma</span> and other letters of the Greek alphabet have different meanings.  Let's consider some of them. </p><p>  Alpha originally denoted a bull and meant cattle care, augmentation and proper use of wealth. </p><p>  Beta meant a violation of unity and even possessed demonic properties.  In some religions, it is identified with a challenge to God. </p><p>  Alpha and beta characters are the first letters of the Greek alphabet.  In total, it has twenty-four letters.  Only two of them are considered in detail in the article. </p><p>  Omega means abundance and wealth, apotheosis, successful completion of the case.  In its numerical equivalent, it means "faith" and "lord."  Thus, this symbol means <span>faith in God</span> , regardless of the type of religion. </p><p>  The roundness of omega is sometimes interpreted as a hell that has opened.  Omega is a circle, alpha is a symbol that represents the compass, this circle draws. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the compass and the circle are present both in Freemasonry and in Taoism. </p><h2>  Why did Christ use the Greek letters of the alphabet in the expression "I am Alpha and Omega ..."? </h2><p>  It is interesting that in the Greek alphabet there is no letter corresponding to "B".  Only ipsilon (Y) resembles it somewhat in sound, but does not fully correspond. </p><p>  Curiously, the Aramaic and Greek alphabets are similar.  Apparently, they have a certain uniform proto-language.  However, letters corresponding to each other before and after that are absent in the position with "B", that is, the Aramaic "Vav" has no analogue in the <span>Greek language</span> in the same position.  Omega is only in last place, and in the Hebrew (Aramaic) alphabet - in the sixth.  I recall that Jesus, speaking Aramaic, for some reason used “Alpha and Omega” in his speech. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fact is that the Hellenic worldview consisted of the paramount veneration of the spiritual.  It is “El” (spirit) that is the main one.  Therefore, the most spiritual letter “Alpha”, symbolizing the spirit, stood in the first place, and the most carnal letter “Omega”, perhaps, gradually moved to the end of the alphabet in the language. </p><p>  Then it becomes clear why Christ used the <span>Greek letters.</span>  After all, if he said in Aramaic, the first letter "Aleph" would mean a bull, that is, what he said would mean "I am a bull."  Involuntarily comes an association with the veneration of the "golden calf." </p>

    <h2>  Alpha and omega in banknotes </h2><p>  If you look closely at the notation of banknotes, it becomes clear that they are some kind of symbols.  What do these signs mean?  Indeed, inventing a currency, the authors probably wanted its prosperity in the future. </p><p>  Alpha and omega as a symbol are often found in many banknotes.  In addition to them, you can find traces of yin and yang, the number Pi and more. </p><p>  The clear alpha is the <span>British pound</span> . </p><p>  The yin and yang lines are drawn in the American dollar and Israeli shekel, and the number Pi in Chinese currency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Maybe a country with its own currency symbol in the outline of Omega has a special role to play? </p><h2>  Omega - a symbol in magic </h2><p>  Mages believe that magic appeared when a person learned to interrupt infinity. </p><p>  The space initially consists of threads and their filler, which are constantly in vibration.  They can be heard, act on them, changing the sound. </p><p>  Each item has its own range.  If you change it for something, the object may disappear or turn into another.  But this can only be done by those who have freed their Spirit from the challenge that carries the symbol of Omega. </p><p>  Those who study magic with the help of symbols, signs, sounds feel vibrations in themselves and thus have some possibility of influencing the universe. </p><p>  The Omega symbol is the most complex.  It is the only one that contains the full matrix of the decimal code.  Other symbols are intended to destroy the power of this. </p><p>  Each person should strive to destroy it or possess it. </p><p>  Omega consists of "O", meaning the one Spirit and Soul and "Mega" - a call.  That is, together, the symbol denotes the challenge that the Spirit received.  Its modern meaning may sound like an evolution of personality. </p><p>  The symbol is the end for everything.  Having known it, a person must transform the form - make ends and create a ring. </p><p>  It is always used along with other characters. </p><h2>  Alpha is a symbol in magic. </h2>

    <p>  Mages believe that the expression "I am Alpha and Omega" can be said in one word "Alpha", since Alpha is a symbol of Omega in motion. </p><p>  Acquiring its direction, the upper part of Omega is stretched and sharpened.  However, the stable O symbol prevents Omega from shrinking at the bottom.  The dividing line caused by internal stress gives impetus to the appearance of Alpha.  Only the effort of man’s will is able to create him. </p><p>  As long as the magician is striving for something, and his actions are subordinate to this goal, he can control Alpha, and his possibilities become limitless. </p><p>  "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last ..." - this is the oath of magicians, which they give to themselves and get the opportunity to use magic, which can be used both for constructive and destructive purposes. </p><p>  Mages believe that in cases where the Alpha symbol is placed next to Omega, they, contrary to each other, cannot be useful and can even do harm. </p><h2>  Alpha and Omega - the mystery of the symbol </h2>

    <p>  The famous saying of God can be deciphered with the help of Pimander - the main opus of the hermetic vault brought by the monk to Florence from Macedonia in the fifteenth century. </p><p>  It reveals the deep secrets of the mind and light. </p><p>  Some postulates are taken as the basis that God is light that is in an environment that is not perceived by our ordinary consciousness, therefore it is called “Nothing” or “External Darkness”.  She surrounds God, with no beginning or end.  God-light, on the contrary, contains all the principles and has a beginning and an end. </p><p>  God-light has a boundary, a circle that is filled with light and at the same time does not belong to him or to the Darkness-external.  In this ring lies the secret of the origin of the number with the beginning and the end, and from it comes the Omega. </p><p>  God the light, making a loop in the Darkness-outer loop, opens the circle below.  There the word of God is born. </p>

    <p>  External darkness penetrates the loop, and two darks arise - internal and external.  In this case, the inner darkness is divine and subject to God.  The secret of baptism is revealed here.  John cleansed people, being himself in the water.  So God, being in the Darkness-external, purified himself and baptized.  The essence of the cross is that it divides and advances towards God, and any evil spirits are afraid of it, since when it is cleansed it will disappear. </p><p>  Two rings, approaching in the Darkness of the outer, transform it from the infinite to the ultimate, and then, touching and partially intersecting when the rotational and translational principles are combined, create a new one - a rectilinear motion or the principle of trinity.  In Omega, it opens in a spiral. </p><p>  In the material world, the Omega node is clearly visible in black holes in the universe.  Matter is sucked into them in a spiral, forming <span>dark matter</span> or inner Darkness. </p><p>  Inside Omega, humid nature forms where innumerable forms and species are born.  Then energies are formed in chaos (hell), after which there is equilibrium, constancy - the energies oscillate steadily, leading to the nucleation of sound.  And finally, the dead comes to life. </p><p>  New living forms from living sounds appear.  Further, no form appears anymore, but the remnants of darkness, uniting with the father, give rise to the Holy Spirit. </p><p>  After the Divine light filled the upper space, forming a triangle, he can only illuminate the rest of the space with rays.  The figures in the sign, formed during the separation of the living from the dead - Alpha, are symbols of the Divine light. </p>
