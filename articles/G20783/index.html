Even those under the age of 18, with the assistance of their parents, can get their own score.  This allows you to save, and sometimes even increase the available funds.  The interest rate, as a rule, is not very large, but more or less protects against inflation.  There are a large number of different deposits, we‚Äôll talk about one of the most ancient representatives of this family - about a savings deposit.

    <h2>  What is he like? </h2><p>  A savings deposit is a popular way to save your money.  As a rule, it is the representatives of this family that can offer the highest percentages.  But, alas, according to the terms of the contract, it will be possible to get all the accrued interest only after the deposit term has ended.  Also, they can not be replenished.  Interest rates on them fluctuate within a significant range.  It is quite possible to meet a situation where one bank will offer 6%, and the institution next door - 12%.  But do not rush to make a choice in favor of the second.  It may be that he has problems with liquidity.  And if the bank bursts, then the maximum that you can get back is the main deposit amount.  This type of investment attracts many people with its accessibility and simplicity.  If you are interested in the possibility of withdrawal at any convenient time, then we need not savings, but term deposits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About capitalization </h2>

A savings deposit in this case is no exception.  Therefore, attention should be paid to such an attractive moment as capitalization.  What is she like?  The essence of capitalization is that after interest is accrued once a month, they begin to accrue not only on the principal amount, but also on money already earned.  Let's look at a small example.  Let's say we have ten thousand rubles.  We go to the bank and put them for a year at 12%.  It turns out that in a month we will be charged at the amount of one percent.  In this case, it is 100 rubles.  In the end, a person will take 11.2 thousand rubles.  But what about capitalization?  So, under the same conditions, we earn 100 rubles for the first month.  Add to the original amount.  And we already have 10.1 thousand.  And now they already accrue 12% per annum.  In the first case, we would have received 100 rubles in the second month.  And with capitalization it will be already 101. And gradually the amount of interest will increase, the longer - the more.  Is there a catch, or is it necessary to choose the option with capitalization without a doubt?  Alas, there is a negative point.  So, in cases with capitalization, banks offer lower interest rates.  Suppose, not 12, but 11 or even 10. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the benefits of each individual option, and only having accurate and reliable data, make decisions.  Otherwise, in pursuit of ghostly benefits, in reality you can lose.

So, if the bank is balancing on the verge of bankruptcy, investing in it is not recommended.  You should also pay attention exclusively to those institutions that have a banking license and that are members of a deposit guarantee fund.  In addition, it is desirable that the size of the deposit does not exceed the amount of 1.4 million rubles.  Why?  The fact is that this is the limit of the guaranteed amount of compensation.  Anything higher than this amount is not guaranteed, so getting money in the event of bankruptcy will not work.  Fraud on the part of bank employees should not be ruled out, so you should always require a contract that needs to be carefully studied.

Sberbank, for example, offers 2.3 percent per annum.  Agree, not a lot.  Why is that?  This indicates low inflation expectations and a low level of demand for credit money.  Therefore, this option is suitable for those who are interested in conservation.  In this case, a <span>savings deposit is</span> suitable <span>.</span>  <span>Sberbank, by the</span> way, even about a year ago, offered its customers about 6% per annum.  As you can see, the interest rate is constantly falling.  But let's make a comparison.  And consider deposits in Belarusbank.  Here the situation is much better.  For example, the maximum interest rate is 10.2 per annum, which is almost double the average level of charges on other deposits.  Deposits in Belarusbank allow us to consider the classic scheme of work of savings investments.  True, it should be noted that the period for which the deposit is made is of great importance.  So, the minimum bid is three times less than the maximum.

Their services are often turned to accumulate money for a major purchase.  Gaining popularity and a savings contribution to adulthood.  It is considered as a tool for help and support at the beginning of an independent life.  In general, there are quite a few different specific contributions.  There are special offers for senior citizens, and for a number of other categories.  To say that they are fundamentally different in something is impossible.  But certain bonuses may be provided that are pleasant for these categories of the population.

    <h2>  Modifications and Improvements </h2><p>  Initially, savings deposits meant only depositing money and receiving it at the end of the term.  But gradually, the proposals expanded and improved.  So, often term and savings deposits in some banks do not differ at all.  Offers relief from financial institutions in matters of replenishment and withdrawal.  But, alas, the price of this is a gradual decrease in rates.  So, for example, the well-known Sberbank offers deposits of this direction in a very favorable direction in terms of providing services.  But, as already mentioned above, the maximum amount of funds received with this is a small 2.3%.  And if you choose between, say, 6% and 2.3%, but with a service, many would choose the first option.  Indeed, although inflation is slowing down, still such a small percentage is not enough to cover it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

Although there are many different individual aspects.  So, in the world taxation of the profit of a deposit is quite popular.  In order not to annoy customers, banks offer a formally higher rate, but talk about a lower one, which already takes into account fees in favor of the state.  Also, the approach is gaining popularity when the percentage increases along with the amount that was deposited into the account.  So, <span>Sberbank on savings deposits</span> first offers only 1.5%.  And only as the amount deposited increases, the rate will increase to 2.3%.  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully read the contract concluded, especially what is written in small print.  Even if you are in a hurry, you don‚Äôt need to rush anywhere, because to get acquainted with all the documentation is the right of everyone.
