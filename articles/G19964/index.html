Using multi-colored remains of yarn, you can create a unique, bright and causing delight among the surrounding plaid.  If you want it to be plain or a calmer color, you can choose the right shades of yarn in the store.  Of course, a lot of yarn will be needed, but it's worth it, since a rug, knitted with your own hands, will be stronger to warm, and it will surprise you with its individuality.  The easiest way to create beautiful stylish things for your home is to crochet your plaids.  From motifs you can get a real work of art.  Knit such a blanket for yourself or as a gift.  In the first case, you will enjoy the work done, and in the second, you will probably hear many grateful words addressed to you. </p><h2>  <span>Crochet a plaid</span> from motifs.  General recommendations </h2><p>  Any <span>plaid knitted</span> in a technique involving a combination of motives is performed in compliance with general rules.  Here is some of them. </p><p>  The simplest option, suitable for crocheting plaids from motifs, is the manufacture of square-shaped elements. </p>

Types of tying can be different - from openwork, made with a wide strip, to dense and narrow, for example, using the "step step" technique.  Crocheted blankets of motifs knitted from the remains of yarn, pleasing with their beauty and brightness, although they resemble a "rustic" style.  But if you choose other shades and in a small amount, a <span>knitted blanket</span> will look very stylish.

If you possess these qualities, then you will surely cope with such a task.  This version of the bedspreads looks more original and stylish than the previous one.  Yes, and knit such a blanket is much more interesting, since there is no monotonous work on knitting the same motifs.  Almost all the elements of this bedspread are not only different in size, but also differ in pattern and color.  All crocheted rugs from motifs are knitted quite simply, the main thing in this matter is accuracy.

    <h2>  Size and other nuances </h2><p>  Now for the size of the bedspread.  Naturally, the larger the size of the plaid, the more time-consuming work process awaits you.  But it‚Äôs not necessary to make it huge.  Small rugs with which you can hide to the waist or cover your shoulders are also very relevant.  Knitting these is much faster and easier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The connection of motives </h2><p>  Crocheted blanket of <span>square motifs</span> will be of high quality, provided that all elements are skillfully fastened together.  To combine motifs into a single canvas, there are several ways.  Consider a few of them.  One of the most difficult is the option of joining during knitting motifs.  Knocking out the last row of one motive, you need to perform its fastening to another.  For beginner needlewomen, this is a rather complicated way.  In addition, it requires special calculation and use of the connection diagram.  And it‚Äôs not suitable for any form of motive.  Therefore, we turn to the consideration of simpler methods. </p><p>  One of them is needle connection.  For this, the motifs are folded with their faces to each other and sewn with the same thread that was used to knit them.  Please note that the seam should be very neat and as invisible as possible.  Since, unlike clothes made of motifs, a plaid is a two-way product. </p><h2>  Crochet Method </h2><p>  Another way is to use a hook.  As in the previous method, the motives are added face in relation to each other.  Next, using a hook and yarn, they are secured with <span>connecting posts.</span>  These columns resemble single crochet, but differ in that, having dragged the thread through the edges of the motifs, it is immediately pulled through the existing one on the hook, without capturing the working thread.  Such a seam will be neat and will not be evident. </p><p>  And finally, the last way.  You will also need a hook to use it.  The connection of motives occurs by knitting the net between them.  It is done like this.  A thread is attached to the edge of one of the motifs, and two air loops are knitted, then they are attached to another motif using a single crochet.  Then again two air loops and joining the first motive.  As a result of such bonding, an openwork mesh is obtained.  The size of the cells is controlled by the distance between the mounts.  Such a connection, made with a contrasting thread, looks very beautiful. </p><h2>  Baby blankets.  Stylish ideas </h2>

But what is the difference between a blanket for a baby and an adult option?  Of course, the way of decoration.  Any baby will like a plaid, decorated, for example, with the faces of animals.  In the photo above, these are cubs.  This children's plaid is made in the same technique as adults.  And the applique is made of crocheted elements.  It is not difficult to do this, since it is quite simple to connect the circles with columns with a crochet, this will be the muzzle.  And the nose, eyes and mouth can simply be embroidered with a needle.

    <h2>  Original <strong>children's motif plaid</strong> </h2><p>  Not many people decide to crochet a <span>baby blanket</span> , since they believe that it will be tougher than that made with knitting needles.  But some options are striking in their beauty.  And you can get rid of stiffness using thinner threads and a hook, the size of which is slightly larger than necessary for the selected yarn.  Here is an example of such a plaid designed for little princesses.  Even novice craftswomen will be able to cope with its implementation.  The main thing when knitting this blanket is the selection of yarn.  With a harmonious combination of colors, your plaid will look in a special way, like a real veil in the royal chambers. </p>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

What form they will be up to you.  You can make them square or rectangular, large or small.  The highlight of this model in color combination and exquisite shuttlecocks along the perimeter of each motive. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  So, having connected the necessary number of motifs in two shades, you can start assembling the plaid.  To do this, use one of the connection methods above.  This is either a connection with a needle or using a hook. </p><p>  After the plaid has acquired the shape you need, we proceed to decorate it.  To do this, we knit the single crochet around the perimeter of each element in the same color as the motive.  In order to get a kind of flounce, you need to knit several columns in one loop.  The more they will be located in one place, the more magnificent the shuttle will be. </p>
