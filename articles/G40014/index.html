Many of them come up with schemes for such jewelry on their own.  Beginning needlewomen have to look for simple options that they could easily handle. </p><h2>  Varieties of roses </h2><p>  Before you carefully consider crocheting roses with patterns, first we‚Äôll figure out what they are.  The simplest are ordinary flat flowers, which often serve as the basis for round or square motifs.  These products are often used as applications or elements of Irish lace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet roses patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Volume roses with several layers of petals are much more popular.  The first time to figure out how to knit them is not easy.  But, having mastered the main principles, you can begin to improvise and create your own ‚Äúvarieties‚Äù of these colors. </p><p>  More roses are used as patterns.  This is most typical for fillet knitting.  This technique has the most scope to recreate complex and detailed drawings.  Crocheting <span>roses, the</span> scheme and description of which are in the collections of many craftswomen, can be mastered in a couple of hours. </p><h2>  Snow-white volumetric rose </h2><p>  Based on the simplest flower, you can knit a beautiful three-dimensional decorative detail.  It consists of several layers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet roses pattern" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965440.jpg" width="297"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first stage of work - we knit a simple flower.  We knit a self-tightening ring from 2 columns without a crochet.  In the second row we make 6 arches from air loops.  Their number can be arbitrary, but do not do more than 5 so as not to stretch the flower much. </p><p>  On the arches we form the petals themselves from <span>columns with a crochet</span> and without.  Sample pattern: 1 single crochet, 2 with 1 double crochet, 1 <span>with two double crochets, 2</span> with 1 double crochet, 1 single crochet.  As you noticed, the petal is symmetrical.  You can experiment with the number of posts and crochets yourself.  But the more you place them on one arch, the larger the petal will turn out.  This is the initial <span>knitting pattern.</span>  <span>Crocheted a</span> rose <span>flower</span> will turn out in the following steps. </p><p>  When the first row of petals is ready, we do not break the thread, and from the wrong side we make 6 more arches of air loops so that they reach approximately the middle of the front row.  We form petals according to the same principle, but we make columns a little more, since the number of air loops has increased.  In this way, you can make up to 5 tiers.  More will not be very beautiful. </p><h2>  Square motif </h2><p>  In this way, not only flowers for application are created, but also grounds for different motives.  This is the joy that crocheting roses gives.  Schemes of such motives were used by our grandmothers when <span>knitted blankets.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern rose flower" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965441.jpg" width="600"></div>

For this, simple arches from air loops are used.  Simulations of leaves are made on the four sides of the flower using lush columns or columns with a common top.  The next row is desirable to make yarn of the third color, which will become the background.  In this row, crochet posts are made.  In the corners where the leaves are, the canvas expands due to the arch of air loops. </p><p>  A great base for a plaid or scarf is such voluminous crocheted roses.  Patterns, knitting and assembly of the finished product do not require special skills from the craftswoman. </p><h2>  Another version of the square motive </h2><p>  In square motifs, crocheting roses is often used as the basis.  The scheme of work in them is always approximately the same.  First, a finished flower is made, and then the leaves and the main background are attached to it, which turns into a square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet rose pattern crochet" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965442.jpg" width="252"></div>

    <p>  In the embodiment presented here, the transition to a square shape is carried out using a simple mesh of air loops.  This technique helps to maintain a square shape: in the corners of the workpiece, they are not knitted in one arch, but in two, as if twisting the hook twice under one base. </p><p>  The leaves in this pattern are made separately, and then sewn.  An example of a leaf can be as follows: we knit a chain of air loops and form 3 loops from it.  Then we tie them with a single crochet in such a way as to capture the far edge of the loop and hide the hole that has formed. </p><h2>  Rose from ribbon </h2><p>  Consider another option that offers crochet roses.  Schemes of petals and leaves are extremely simple and understandable.  It fits in one row.  The essence of this whole method is that in the end we get a ribbon that folds and forms the flower itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet roses with patterns" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965443.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  We collect an arbitrary number of air loops.  We knit the first petal from two double crochet and two chains of air loops at the edges.  Then we make one half-column and again we collect a chain of 3 v / p.  We make 2 more double crochets. </p><p>  The third petal should be larger.  Therefore, we increase the number of yarn and the columns themselves.  Consequently, the number of air loops in the chain will also increase. </p><p>  According to this algorithm, we knit an arbitrary number of petals.  But it is worth remembering that too few of them will not give a beautiful bud, and too many will not fit well into a finished flower. </p><h2>  Twist the rose </h2><p>  When all the petals in the ribbon are ready, the first stage, representing crocheting roses, is completed.  We will consider leaf patterns at the last stage.  And now we are starting to form a flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric crochet roses crochet patterns" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965444.jpg" width="237"></div>

    <p>  To do this, we begin to twist the tape from a smaller petal to a larger one.  At the same time, try not just to twist into a tube, but to form a bud.  So that the ‚Äúroll‚Äù does not fall apart, periodically flash the bottom of the petals. </p><p>  When the rose is gathered, we sew the lower part thoroughly using the same yarn from which the flower is made. </p><p>  Now you can proceed to the leaves.  They knit very simply: at the base and at the tip we make single crochet, in the middle we add a few double crochet, but not much so that the inflated barrel does not turn out.  Ready-made leaves are either sewn to the rose or first sewed to the product, and at the top we fasten the flower. </p><h2>  Roses in cells </h2><p>  The richest in patterns and pictures is fillet crochet.  Rose patterns in this technique are the most common. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet roses patterns" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/965446.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can write more than one article about how to knit sirloin flowers.  Therefore, we recall only the main principles of technology.  The patterns in it are built on the basis of "painting over" empty cells, as if drawing in a notebook. </p><p>  The basis of the patterns is a double crochet, two air loops and a double crochet for empty cells and four double crochets for filled ones. </p><p>  Rose patterns are made very simple: they can be copied from the finished product into the same notebook in the box.  The example presented in the photo is a classic version of such a pattern. </p>
