The beauty and unusual atmosphere of the ancient city attracts them here.  The description of St. Petersburg attracts every connoisseur with its extraordinary architecture, bewitching history, and the opportunity to feel the spirit of the tsarist era. </p><h2>  Description of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  St. Petersburg recently was called Leningrad, older generations remember this very well.  The hero city, the <span>cultural capital of Russia,</span> our Venice - all these epithets are borne by the city.  Peter simply fascinates visitors with its beauty and grandeur.  Everyone who has been here wants to return.  And no wonder. </p><p>  The weather in St. Petersburg is often cloudy, but there are also sunny days.  The climate here is special.  Many come specially to this place to enjoy the white nights that St. Petersburg is famous for.  Photos and descriptions of these moments allow you to create entire albums.  This time can be found from the end of May to July.  The opening of bridges in white nights is a fabulous sight.  Everyone should see it with their own eyes.  Ah, how many offers of hands and hearts have these bridges heard in their history! </p><p>  The architectural description of the sights of St. Petersburg emphasizes the richness of styles, the beauty of buildings, churches, squares, bridges and avenues.  You feel the story in every brick.  Standing on a vast square, you feel like a participant in historical events.  It seems that now the carriage will approach, and the king and the family will leave it or a lady in elegant dresses with a lace umbrella in her hand will walk by.  The riches of the city include gardens and parks - in St. Petersburg there are enough of them, and they are all large-scale.  In the Summer Garden you can walk all day, it is rich in greenery, there are benches all around.  You can sit, relax, dream about something of your own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The suburbs of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Sights of St. Petersburg, a brief description and photos of which can be found in any tourist guide, are present outside the city.  Parks, gardens, palaces in Peterhof, Gatchina, Tsarskoye Selo, beautiful fountains - it is impossible not to pay attention to this.  What is striking is the skill with which all this was built hundreds of years ago, as they say "for centuries."  The beautiful fountain ensemble in Peterhof fascinates with beauty and brilliance.  The suburbs are famous for their palaces.  In each one is traced wealth, luxury, antiquity.  The palace halls are kept in perfect condition, it pleases the fact that half of this is a direct merit of tourists who are careful about history.  I would like to pay special attention to the famous Amber Room in Tsarskoye Selo.  This is a unique historical monument.  It has special requirements.  Only in this room is video and photography completely prohibited to prevent damage to amber.  This masterpiece does not leave anyone indifferent, but history is an occasion for creating many amazing books and films.  Every corner of the palace, every room is ready to tell their innermost story about what happened here many years ago.  When visiting country palaces, it is best to use the services of a guide.  His stories will be very informative and interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  <span>The architecture of St. Petersburg in</span> its description resembles Italian Venice.  This was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsovereign Peter - to turn the Northern capital into the likeness of Amsterdam and Venice.  It was planned that the city would cross a network of canals instead of streets.  The architects of that time managed to create a settlement with a unique look, a quivering heart, a Russian soul.  The craftsmen embodied their ideas in beautiful architectural ensembles, which to this day delight citizens and guests.  All tourists seek to explore the main attractions of St. Petersburg, photos and descriptions of which confirm the uniqueness of architectural styles.  An interesting fact is that, according to the decree of the tsar, all buildings were erected exclusively from stone, while throughout Russia it was forbidden to use it as building material.  A distinctive feature of that time was ‚Äúavenues‚Äù - perpendicular streets.  The author of these creations was the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Leblond.  The first architect of the city was Trezzini, he designed the central ensemble of St. Petersburg.  The great masters created such architectural masterpieces as the Arch of the General Staff Building, Palace Square, the Winter Palace, the Alexander Column, the Bronze Horseman, Decembrists Square, Smolny Cathedral, St. Isaac's Cathedral, Peter and Paul Fortress and many other structures and monuments, parks that have been admired for hundreds of years and surprise guests of the Northern capital. </p><h2>  Museums in St. Petersburg: description </h2><p>  Every tourist who comes on an excursion to St. Petersburg must visit museums.  There are a lot of them in the city, even more than in Moscow, and it is simply impossible to visit all at once.  And to describe them in one article at once is unlikely to succeed.  Description of the sights of St. Petersburg necessarily includes all museums, and specially created catalogs will help to get acquainted with each of them.  In them you can learn about the history of each museum, curious facts, about the exhibits that are presented there.  In addition, how to get to a particular institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It was in St. Petersburg that the history of the very first museums in Russia began.  Prior to that, such a concept did not exist in the country.  Today, both the most popular institutions and small cultural objects with their narrow specifics are open to visitors.  About some of them do not even know the residents themselves.  All museum attractions deserve to be open to everyone, to talk about various events, legendary personalities. </p><p>  Visitors, having come to one or another museum, acquire exactly the knowledge that they planned to receive.  Visiting themed rooms, you can find many answers to questions about what happened in the city during the Blockade, how the politician of 1917 influenced the city, what secrets the dolls keep in themselves or what the stars will tell about. </p><p>  Everyone who comes to St. Petersburg must visit the Hermitage.  Entering there, it is no longer possible to exit the same person.  It is impossible to get around the museum in one day.  The collection has been replenished since the middle of the 18th century, from the moment of its creation, and it continues to this day. </p><p>  You must visit the State Russian Museum.  Only here you can ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù with history, see the oldest rare books. </p><h2>  Hermitage </h2>

    <p>  The Hermitage will be included in any description of the sights of St. Petersburg.  The State Museum is considered one of the most historically ancient institutions in the world, a cultural object of Russia.  His story began under Queen Catherine II.  She acquired a picturesque collection from the Berlin merchant Ernst Gotskovsky.  Cloths of the greatest and most talented masters were here.  The tsarina bought them as a gift to the Prussian king Frederick II.  However, because of the seven-year war, the king was unable to accept this gift.  At that time, the development of the museum began.  Now the day of its foundation is considered December 7 - the day of St. Catherine.  At first it was a small outbuilding - the Small Hermitage, but gradually it grew up in the Bolshoi and began to bear a proud name - the Imperial. </p><p>  It will be interesting to visit St. Petersburg for children.  Sights, photos and descriptions of which can be found in advance, will tell a lot of informative and interesting.  Visual lessons of history will be received at the Hermitage.  Today it is a museum complex, which has five buildings.  They stretched along the Neva, led by the majestic Winter Palace.  The museum's collection has approximately three million exhibits - these are cultural monuments, works of art. </p><p>  After Catherine, the museum was successfully transformed by Alexander I, who was the grandson of the queen.  In 1810, the Malmaison Gallery was purchased.  Coosevelt's painting in 1814 complemented the unique palace collection.  In 1815, having entered the army with Paris, Alexander acquired the sculpture collection of Beauharnais. </p><p>  Under Tsar Nicholas, the Hermitage was also replenished with cultural masterpieces.  Portraits of the heroes of the war of 1812 appeared in the military gallery.  In the 19th century, the museum developed in different directions.  Under Soviet rule, cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãwere preserved and enhanced.  In 1956, the museum became a three-story building.  The compositions of the Hermitage demonstrate the development of civilizations from the Stone Age to the present day. </p><h2>  Saint Isaac's Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  Making a description of St. Petersburg, each storyteller will surely remember a unique cathedral.  St. Isaac's Cathedral is not only one of the <span>main attractions of St. Petersburg,</span> but also the pearl of all of Russia.  The largest domed building in Europe is second to none.  The history of the temple began under Peter I, it was rebuilt several times.  Under Alexander I, a competition for the best project was announced.  The temple was built according to the brilliant project of the Frenchman Montferrand for a long forty years.  The result was worth the wait.  Everyone was struck and amazed at the majesty of architecture, the richness of the mosaic, the internal painting, the scale of the structure.  St. Isaac's Cathedral is the most powerful building today.  The cathedral is decorated with one hundred and twelve columns.  The huge gilded dome is unique; it has retained its strength until now.  Numerous decorative details are made with splendor in different traditions of the masters of Russian architecture.  The best Russian craftsmen who came to St. Petersburg from different parts of the country took part in the creation.  The works collected in the temple are the only ones that are unique. </p><p>  Currently, St. Isaac‚Äôs Church in St. Petersburg is also a working museum, although services are regularly held there.  The issue of transferring the cathedral to the Russian Orthodox Church is being resolved.  As one of the great ones said, temples are built not to show architecture, but to be the house of God. </p><h2>  Peterhof </h2>

    <p>  Have you decided to visit St. Petersburg?  Sights, photos and descriptions of the fountains of the Palace and Park Ensemble will certainly bring every tourist to Peterhof.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTsar Peter was to create a royal residence of such beauty that would surpass the French Versailles.  Everyone was surprised at how quickly this idea came to fruition.  Already in 1723, Peterhof opened in a festive atmosphere, fountains, the Sea Canal, several palaces began to work, and the layout of the Lower Park was drawn up. </p><p>  The territory was chosen wisely, everywhere there were ponds that fed on keys.  In the 1920s, gateways and a canal were built, and fountains were erected.  The lower park is arranged in a special way.  In the Upper - from a height of sixteen meters, the water from the pools falls through pipes, and its entire mass soars upward in the Lower Park, forming a huge number of jets. </p><p>  During the reign of Peter II, the development of the Palace Park stopped.  And only thanks to Anna Ivanovna began the restoration and further development, which was facilitated by the architect Zemtsov. </p><p>  Unfortunately, World War II destroyed many of the rarest buildings of Peterhof.  The palaces were plundered by the Germans; the Grand Palace was destroyed.  A few years after the war, the restoration of the ensemble began.  Only in the middle of the twentieth century was the Samson statue returned to its place. </p><p>  In the description of St. Petersburg <em> </em>  certainly includes a unique creation of the XVIII century - Peterhof.  From the sea, beautiful views of the Grand Palace and the Grand Cascade, clad in gold, open next to it.  Majestically before them stands Samson.  The sea channel leads directly to the sea, it divides the Lower Park into two parts: Western and Eastern. </p><h2>  Savior on Spilled Blood </h2>

    <p>  Decided to see the main <span>attractions of St. Petersburg?</span>  A brief description of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood should definitely attract your attention.  Nobody succeeds in passing indifferently by this cathedral.  Each tourist stops and looks at all the details that cause only admiring responses.  Church of the Savior on Blood - a diamond of architecture of past centuries.  Beauty, aesthetics, ideal silhouettes are the main inherent features. </p><p>  But what was on this place at the end of the 19th century?  The area between the stations - Warsaw and Baltic - was notorious.  Factory buildings, dull landscape of sleeping areas, workers pouring sorrows in taverns, and not a single parish church.  The Society for Moral and Religious Education came to the rescue, they were able to find a common language with the authorities, to receive land for the construction of the temple. </p><p>  The cathedral was founded in 1984 along with the celebration of the royal wedding.  Later, a community was organized at the church, which helped to cope with alcohol addiction.  The temple helped all the parishioners in need and acted for many years until the Soviets came to power.  The persecution of believers at that time took on enormous proportions, the temple was almost destroyed, and ministers were shot. </p><p>  Only in 1990 the cathedral began to be restored, on the occasion of Easter, a service was held here, the building now belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><h2>  Palace Bridge </h2>

The palace bridge in the photo looks unusually beautiful in diluted form, in the background is the mysterious Peter and Paul Fortress, which keeps the secrets of palace coups. </p><p>  The history of the creation of the Palace Bridge goes back to the end of the XIX century.  The government received many requests to replace the obsolete bridge, which was located at this place, the plokshouts completely drowned in the river.  A competition was announced for the project of the most magnificent and strong construction.  Pshenitsky won it.  Only in 1912, construction began.  The bridge was inaugurated in 1916.  Two years later, he received the name of the Republican.  At first, the bridge had wooden fencing, after twenty years they were replaced by cast-iron.  In the 70s, lights and railings were updated.  Only in 1997 the bridge acquired a chic decorated illumination.  Quite huge in size, it has five spans, gets divorced in the middle.  Its length is 250 meters and its width is 28. </p><h2>  Palace Square </h2>

    <p>  The sights of St. Petersburg with the names and descriptions of each tourist seem to be transferred to the past, at the time of kings and courtiers.  It seems that you are becoming a part of history, you are plunging into the long-standing events of the city.  Palace parks, Palace bridges and, of course, Palace Square.  The most significant, the main square of St. Petersburg.  The events that took place here are known throughout the world.  Not only the famous achievements that took place here, the square is famous.  The architectural appearance, grandiose sizes enthrall all tourists. </p><p>  Once upon a time there was the Admiralty meadow, overgrown with grass.  Festivals and large-scale fairs were organized here.  Today, looking at <span>granite slabs,</span> it is difficult to imagine it.  The glorification of the Russian people after the victory of 1812 became the motive for the transformation of the square.  The architect Rossi in 1819 developed a grandiose construction project.  Some old houses here were demolished, some were included in the project.  The most significant element of the square is the Alexandrian column.  The author of the monument is Montferrand.  The height of the column is 47 meters, weight - 600 tons.  The construction is recognized as the highest triumphal column.  It was dedicated to the victory over Napoleon.  The column was supplemented by a golden angel at the top, he holds a cross in his hands.  Bas-reliefs on a pedestal became a symbol of glorification of Russian weapons.  There is a myth that instead of an angel with a cross, the Bolsheviks wanted to establish a sculpture of Lenin, but for unknown reasons they did not succeed. </p>
