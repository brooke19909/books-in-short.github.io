However, fashionistas do not purchase products in the store, but prefer to contact professional knitters for a unique option.  Of course, they pay much more for such work.  But the result fully justifies the money spent.  In this article, we will tell the reader how to <span>crochet a</span> stylish <span>sweater</span> yourself <span>.</span>  After all, to do this is much easier than it might seem.  In addition, the money will be spent exclusively on materials and tools, so the product will cost much cheaper.  And the knitting process itself, thanks to step-by-step instructions, will bring a lot of pleasure. </p><h2>  Choose a tool </h2><p>  Knitwear can be done in many different ways.  In the material presented below, we will study the technology of working with a hook, so special attention should be paid to this tool.  Professional knitters note that the perfect tool should lie well in the hand, be comfortable and sharpened.  It is also recommended to choose an iron hook.  It will not cling to the thread and will provide faster and better work.  We determine its size, focusing on yarn.  Ideally, the tool should be no more than one and a half times wider than the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="altannetenna4.blogg.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet" class="if uuid-2877986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2877986.jpg"></div><h2>  We buy material </h2><p>  There are no strict recommendations regarding yarn.  The only thing that is important is to consider the season in which the crocheted jacket will be worn.  Perhaps the product will be conceived at all as a warm alternative to a jacket?  And if it will be worn on a naked body, you should choose a material that is pleasant to the touch.  Spiky woolen threads should also be left for knitting outerwear.  For children, professional knitters are advised to choose a special yarn.  It is designed specifically for babies and will not cause allergies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  There are a lot of styles of sweaters, and getting lost in them is not difficult at all.  However, when performing such a product for the first time, one should not immediately swipe at a too complicated option.  Professional knitters are advised to practice the simplest, and already having understood the technology, move on to real masterpieces.  Nevertheless, for any type of sweatshirt crochet or knitting it is important to take measurements correctly.  This must be done as follows: </p><ol><li>  Consider in advance how long the product will be. </li><li>  Measure the distance from the proposed lower edge of the product to the middle of the shoulder at the base of the neck - A. </li><li>  Identify the widest section of the upper torso - the hips or the waist.  Measure its circumference - B. </li><li>  Measure the neck width - B. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt" class="if uuid-2877996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2877996.jpg"></div><p>  All parameters must be fixed.  After all, it is on them that we will crochet a spectacular sweater.  And when the main part of the product will be connected and sewn, we define a few more: </p><ol><li>  We‚Äôll consider how long the sleeves of the jacket will be. </li><li>  We measure the distance from the proposed lower edge of the sleeve to the tip of the shoulder - D, and to the armpit - E. </li><li>  Measure the girth of the arm in the forearm - G. </li></ol><p>  However, the data obtained does not facilitate the process of crocheting sweatshirts for everyone.  For women who do not know how to translate centimeters into loops and rows, we offer useful information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We loop </h2><p>  Even beginner knitters know how to crochet a simple chain.  But only professional craftswomen can figure out how long it should be for a particular product.  However, we will reveal the secret of finding the right answer in the current paragraph.  But first, we ask the reader to link a fragment of the selected pattern using a hook and thread.  Too much should not be done.  It will be enough to prepare a sample measuring 10 x 10 cm. Then we consider the number of loops in the chain and divide the resulting value by the length of the fragment in centimeters.  So we find out how many loops are in 1 cm. Now we multiply their number by parameter B (we defined it in the previous paragraph) if crocheting sweaters will be carried out in a circle.  If the reader plans to knit the back and before separately, the found value should be divided into two.  The resulting number indicates the number of loops to dial, regardless of the counting method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet step by step" class="if uuid-2878014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878014.jpg"></div><h2>  Determine the number of rows </h2><p>  The length of the crocheted sweatshirts (summer or winter) can be determined by eye or by constantly applying the back or in front of yourself.  But what if the product fits in with a person who cannot be constantly around?  That is why we took measurements earlier.  After all, knowing the estimated length of the sweatshirt, it is easy to calculate how many rows you will need to tie to complete it.  And this is not difficult to do: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  We again turn to the prepared fragment. </li><li>  We count the number of rows. </li><li>  And divide them by the length in centimeters. </li><li>  As a result, we determine the number of rows in one centimeter. </li><li>  After that we multiply the received value by parameter A. </li><li>  And we find out how many rows fit in the conceived jacket. </li></ol><h2>  We knit the main part </h2><p>  The preparatory phase is completed, now we move on to crocheting sweaters.  To do this, we collect the required number of loops and proceed to the creative stage.  The product under study is noteworthy in that it does not require adding or decreasing loops for tying the waist and armhole.  Therefore, we simply knit an even fabric over as many rows as previously calculated.  The only difficulty can arise with knitting seamless sweaters.  In this case, you will have to make holes for the hands or knit two parts of the product separately.  You will also have to tinker with the execution of the gate.  Although crocheted sweatshirts for girls and women look very unusual in which it is not pronounced.  For such a thing, the reader will need to connect two rectangles, and then sew them together, leaving slots for the hands and head. </p><p>  If you still want to design a gate, you will have to calculate the number of extra loops.  To do this, multiply the number of loops in one centimeter (we found it earlier) by parameter B. So we find out how many loops will need to be closed to knit the gate.  However, if you close them immediately, the cutout will be square.  And to make a round, it is necessary to be guided by the scheme presented below for crocheted sweaters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet scheme" class="if uuid-2878048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878048.jpg"></div><h2>  Knit sleeves </h2><p>  When the back and front are finished, we sew them together.  The main thing is not to forget to leave slots for the hands and head.  In a seamless jacket, we make out the gates and sew the ‚Äúshoulder straps‚Äù - shoulder seams.  After that we try on the main part on the model.  We take measurements for knitting sleeves.  We studied them earlier.  The results obtained must be recorded on a piece of paper.  Next, we calculate the number of loops for the set.  The technology can be found in the previous paragraphs describing crocheted sweaters.  But just in case, we will tell you a calculation method: multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by the parameter J. </p><p>  We knit a chain and proceed to the pattern.  We knit the required number of rows to the armpit.  In this place we need to gradually reduce the loop.  How to do this, we will tell further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet ideas" class="if uuid-2878024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878024.jpg"></div><h2>  How to tie the upper part of the sleeve </h2><p>  To knit a beautiful sleeve, you will have to perform simple mathematical calculations again: </p><ol><li>  We call parameter Z the number of rows in one centimeter. </li><li>  Multiply the parameters D and Z. </li><li>  Subtract the multiplied parameters E and Z from the resulting number. We get the parameter I. </li><li>  Now subtract 6 from the current number of loops. </li><li>  As a result, we will have an extra number of loops.  They must be divided into parameter I. </li><li>  Thus, no scheme for sweaters is needed.  After all, we have already figured out how many loops we need to reduce in each row. </li><li>  When at the end there are six loops, they should be closed. </li></ol><h2>  Fashionable patterns for sweaters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2878072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878072.jpg"></div><p>  Professional knitters can come up with different patterns on their own.  And all because they have extensive experience and can match loops and rows.  For beginning masters such a talent will come over time.  First, you have to practice on the finished patterns.  We propose to consider the most popular and relevant in the current paragraph. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket crocheted girl" class="if uuid-2878075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878075.jpg"></div><p>  I would like to note that crocheting a sweater for a woman is better than openwork and at the same time plain.  Such products have long won the hearts of fashionistas.  For children, it is wiser to consider a more closed option.  But for its implementation, choose bright yarn. </p><p>  Restrained things, practically ‚Äúdeaf‚Äù, cold shades (blue, violet, brown, black) will do for men at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet how to make" class="if uuid-2878099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2878099.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, <span>crocheting a sweater for a girl</span> or boy, girl or guy, man or woman, grandparents is very simple.  It would be a desire!  We hope that the presented instruction will help the reader not only to spend time with interest and benefit, but also to please himself or relatives with the original thing. </p>
