However, over time, the receipt of cash for certain needs gradually receded into the background.  This is due to the fact that today in almost any financial institution, you can easily issue a credit card.  With its help, you can pay in stores for certain services, use products via the Internet and much more. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is possible to use only a certain part of the debt limit and not overpay additional interest.  Alfa-Bank is one of the leaders among credit organizations of the Russian Federation.  Therefore, more and more customers are using the services of this financial institution. </p><p>  Before <span>getting</span> an Alfa-Bank <span>credit</span> card, it‚Äôs worth clarifying a few important nuances.  Of course, no one wants to overpay the extra commission. </p><h2>  What to do to ensure that QC really benefits? </h2><p>  First of all, before <span>getting</span> an Alfa-Bank <span>credit</span> card, you should pay attention to your financial capabilities.  The fact is that in most programs there is a certain <span>grace period of</span> time during which the client can return the loan back without overpaying any commission.  This is very beneficial if you really have time to return the money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, before signing the contract, it must be carefully read.  Perhaps, an annual card service is provided, which is also paid.  In this case, the cost of the credit card will immediately be added to the debt.  Do not be afraid to contact the bank manager with questions of interest.  It is better to immediately find out all the incomprehensible moments, than then puzzle over how such a huge amount of extra interest was calculated. </p>

    <p>  The most competent option is to use the services of a lawyer who will help analyze the contract and the conditions for obtaining a specific QC. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  In addition to the question of <span>where to get</span> Alfa-Bank‚Äôs <span>credit</span> card, it is recommended to pay attention to whether the borrower meets the conditions of a financial institution.  He must be a citizen of the Russian Federation.  At the same time, credit cards are not issued to individuals whose age has not reached 21 years. </p><p>  Also, the applicant must provide documents confirming that his monthly income is more than 9 thousand rubles.  In addition, QC can only be obtained by someone who has been working in the same place for more than 3 months.  This means that the question of how to get an Alfa-Bank credit card for the unemployed can be automatically excluded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, a citizen must provide permanent residence in the same populated region in which the branch of the financial organization is located.  Among other things, bank employees must check the borrower's previous credit history.  If before that he had experience of untimely payment or if lawsuits from creditors were revealed at all, then most likely he would be refused a credit card. </p>

    <h2>  How to get a credit card at Alfa Bank: conditions </h2><p>  To get the coveted credit card, you need to prepare not only an internal passport, but also a document by which you travel abroad or a driver‚Äôs license.  It is also desirable to have a medical policy. </p><p>  It is best to immediately make photocopies of all these documents.  In order to reduce the interest rate for using the card after the grace period, it is recommended to provide a certificate in the form of personal income tax form 2. </p><p>  If we talk about the possibility of obtaining a credit card without information from Alfa Bank, then it exists only for regular customers. </p><p>  You can apply for QC in one of several available ways. </p><h2>  To a branch of a financial organization </h2><p>  This is a classic way to get an Alfa Bank credit card.  In this case, the applicant must prepare all the necessary documents and additionally make copies of them.  After that, it remains to choose the bank branch that is closest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Employees of a credit institution will advise on existing programs, as well as carry out verification of documents.  After receiving approval, the bank will need some time to prepare the plastic carrier.  At the next stage, the applicant will only have to come to the bank and pick up the QC. </p><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><p>  In any self-respecting bank, you can use online services when applying for loans.  To do this, just go to the registered website of a financial institution.  For existing customers, everything is much simpler.  It is enough for them to go into your personal account and choose the most suitable QC. </p><p>  For new customers, just go to the "Cards" section and apply.  There you will need to enter your personal data, work information, contact phone number and more.  After that, the request from the borrower is processed.  After some time, an SMS is sent to the client or the operator calls to inform about the decision.  As a rule, before filing an application online, you need to visit the bank office and show the employee of the financial organization the original documents.  In this case, you will need to visit the bank only once. </p>

    <p>  How to get Alfa-Bank credit card in this case?  After approval of the loan, after 5 working days it will be possible to get a ready-made QC.  For this, it is not necessary to go to the bank office, since delivery can be ordered. </p><h2>  Amount of credit </h2><p>  Of course, all potential Alfa-Bank customers are primarily interested in the QC limit. </p><p>  If a resident of Moscow applies to the bank and at the same time wants to get a loan in rubles, then the minimum amount that he can count on will be 10,800 rubles, and the maximum possible amount will be 150 thousand rubles. </p><p>  However, it all depends on the payment system to which the card will be linked. </p><p>  If you choose the most expensive service cards, then the maximum loan amount can be from 300 to 750 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  "Twins" </h2><p>  The name of this credit card speaks for itself.  In this case, the product is a bilateral QC.  Thanks to this, the client can use both a credit and a debit account. </p>

    <p>  This modern function is very convenient, since in this case the plastic rectangle will not take up too much space in the wallet.  This is very important for those people who store in their purses a huge number of business cards, discount coupons and much more. </p><p>  It is also very convenient when the cash has run out on the debit side of the card.  In this case, it is enough to flip the plastic and pay for the necessary purchases from credit funds.  Once you managed to get a credit card, Alfa-Bank ATMs will also be available to the client. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering that for the year you will have to pay 2490 rubles for services. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNo cost‚Äù </h2><p>  This credit card belongs to the "Platinum" category.  How is this beneficial to customers?  First of all, it is necessary to clarify that in this case the one-year card service will be free.  The limit on the amount of credit funds is 300 thousand rubles.  In this case, the client has the right not to pay any interest on the amount of money for 60 days. </p><p>  For some, this period is small and the limit is not very happy. </p><p>  However, given that its maintenance does not require any financial costs, then in this case the client does not lose anything, receiving a rather impressive amount of money for almost 2 months.  However, he will not spend a single ruble from his own pocket.  The main thing is to pay off the debt in a timely manner.  Otherwise, you will have to overpay, and then the offer will not be so profitable. </p><h2>  100 days </h2><p>  From the name of this card, it becomes obvious for how long you can freely use funds without worrying about overpaying.  At the same time, the countdown of free days starts from the moment when a debt has formed on the QC limit.  However, before getting an Alfa Bank credit card for 100 days, it is worth considering that such an interest-free period will only be valid if a monthly payment of 5% of the total debt is paid to the account.  The minimum threshold is 320 rubles. </p>

    <p>  After the grace period of 100 days, the interest rate is 23.99%.  The cost of servicing this QC depends on each individual situation.  If the client has provided the entire package of documents, then the minimum payment will be 1190 rubles.  In special cases, maintenance can reach up to 7000 rubles per year. </p><p>  Regardless of the selected QC, it is worthwhile to carefully study the loan conditions, which change quite often. </p>
