So, here is: </p><ul><li>  <em>Mopeds and scooters for rent.</em>  Near the hotel you can rent a vehicle and go for a walk in the picturesque surroundings. </li><li>  <em>Golf course.</em>  A golf course is available within walking distance.  The cost of renting equipment can be found there. </li></ul><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Many tourists choose Thailand to travel with children.  Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 * (Patong, Phuket) is great for this.  The hotel administration tried to create the most comfortable conditions for families with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Phuket Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4" class="if uuid-2254286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2254286.jpg"></div><p>  The apartments can accommodate an extra bed upon request.

Violators pay a heavy fine. </p><p>  Check-in is from 14.00 to 0.00. </p><p>  Check-out is noon. </p><p>  Before check-in, guests should make a deposit using their credit card. </p><p>  At the reception, guests present a passport or other official identification card with a photo. </p><p>  The age from which you can independently register for a hotel stay is 18 years old. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  For those who are planning a beach holiday in Thailand, both Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 * and Patong in Phuket are ideal.  Accommodation in this hotel allows you to live very close to the coast and at the same time save on a room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 Phuket" class="if uuid-2254287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2254287.jpg"></div><p>  The beach is 300 meters from the hotel, and therefore it is attributed to the third coastline.  It will take very little time on the road - no more than 10 minutes.  The hotel does not have its own beach, but tourists can always go to the city beach.  The sand in Patong is shallow, the entrance to the water is gentle.  A married couple with young children can relax here. </p><p>  The beach is well equipped for relaxation: there are changing cabins, there are sun umbrellas and sunbeds, however, you will need to pay for the rent.  There is a bar on the beach where guests are offered mineral water, carbonated drinks and juice.  If you wish, you can also have a little junk food here. </p><p>  A little further down the coast there are "wild" beaches.  There are almost no vacationers here, so they are perfect for those who do not like the noisy crowds of tourists.  True, these beaches have one big drawback - they are not at all equipped for recreation.  There are no changing cabins, deck chairs, umbrellas and other amenities.  In addition, getting there is better by car. </p><h2>  Beach activities </h2><p>  Many guests go in search of adventure immediately after arrival at the Phuket Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 *.  There are many activities for such fidgets on the beach: </p><ul><li>  riding on yachts or small boats; </li><li>  water skiing; </li><li>  diving (all the necessary equipment for diving is offered for rent here); </li><li>  Beach volleyball. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, in between active activities, you can completely relax on a sun lounger and get a bronze tan. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  Patong Resort is not only suitable for swimming in the azure waters and sipping a refreshing cocktail.  There are many attractions in the vicinity.  To see at least a couple of them for their entire stay in Phuket is simply necessary: </p><ul><li>  <em>Ton Sai Waterfall.</em>  It is the second largest among the <span>waterfalls of Phuket.</span>  In the hot season, this is just a large stream, however, with the onset of the rainy season, Ton Sai turns into a real bubbling stream.  In the shady places arbors are equipped here, so you can enjoy the natural splendor without haste. </li><li>  <em>Big Buddha.</em>  This attraction is one of those that is certainly worth seeing with your own eyes.  Buddha statue measuring 40 m in height and 25.5 m in width is equipped with viewing platforms. </li><li>  <em>Sirinat</em> is a national park.  The area reaches 8000 ha.  There are tropical jungles, a water park, a temple, a cafe, three sandy beaches and bungalows for tourists. </li><li>  <em>Oceanarium.</em>  This entertainment will appeal to adults and children.  Behind thick glass you can see a huge number of sea inhabitants - from very small to huge sharks. </li><li>  <em>Museum of sea shells.</em>  The exhibits here are hundreds of different sea shells collected around the world.  The most valuable of them are 380 million years old fossils, a left-handed shell and a giant specimen weighing 250 kg. </li><li>  <em>The show "Fantasy".</em>  This amazing performance was first presented in 1998.  Since then, it has received several awards and immense love of the audience.  The show is attended by 400 people and 40 elephants.  A visit to this place will turn into a real holiday, which will leave an impression in the soul of Phuket guests for a long time. </li></ul><p>  All of the above is only a small part of what tourists can see in the hot hospitable Thailand.  Entertainment is for absolutely everyone: for connoisseurs of excursion programs, couples with children and lovers just wander through the streets of a foreign country and feel the color of these places. </p><h2>  Reviews about Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  This hotel is in fairly high demand.  Quite often, you can meet Russian-speaking travelers there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 at Patong Beach in Phuket" class="if uuid-2254299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2254299.jpg"></div><p>  After reading reviews of the Phuket Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 * hotel, many will probably have a desire to go on vacation there.  Among the features that tourists liked are the following: </p><ul><li>  original design - many travelers emphasize that this has not been seen in any hotel, in addition, all these drawings and installations in the rooms perfectly cheer up; </li><li>  the sea - sandy beaches are some of the best in Phuket, they are well equipped, have a gentle easy access to the water; </li><li>  excellent location - immediately at the exit from the hotel there are many cafes and restaurants, so there are never any problems with food; </li><li>  clean rooms - apartments are cleaned daily; towels are also often changed; </li><li>  staff - hotel employees are always smiling and trying to help guests; </li><li>  a huge number of attractions - this is important for those tourists who prefer an excursion vacation; </li><li>  calm area - since the hotel is located away from the beach, it is quite quiet; </li><li>  cost of living - many tourists talk about relatively cheap, but comfortable rooms. </li></ul><p>  It was not possible to manage without disadvantages, but there are not so many of them and they are fully compensated by the advantages.  Meanwhile, it is better to know about them before the trip: </p><ul><li>  lack of a swimming pool - those who prefer a lazy rest by the water with animation will have to find another hotel; </li><li>  too busy beach - the absence of the hotel's own beach makes vacationers go to the city, by the way, not the cleanest. </li></ul><p>  As you can guess from the description and photo of the Pimnara Boutique Hotel 4 * in Phuket (Thailand), the hotel does not even have its own private territory - the building is located in the center of the shopping complex.  However, this does not spoil the institution at all, because it has already managed to find its army of fans.  Moreover, the cost and quality of living here are in excellent proportion. </p>
