    <h2>  Material preparation </h2><p>  The decor of cones always looks unusual and beautiful.  The main thing is to know how to properly prepare material for crafts.  Cones that have fallen from the tree still closed gradually open up over time.  In this case, pine outwardly resemble small Christmas trees, and spruce - a tousled hedgehog.  Of course, initially the decor of the cones looks unusual.  However, over time, crafts begin to deform.  To avoid this, you should adhere to certain rules when processing materials: </p><ol><li>  To avoid cones opening even with temperature differences in the room, they should be lowered for 30 seconds in <span>carpentry glue.</span> </li><li>  To cones, on the contrary, quickly opened, it is recommended to boil them for half an hour, and then dry on a battery.  Also, the material can be fried in an oven at 250 ¬∞ C for 2 hours.  These methods can not only achieve the desired result, but also kill all bacteria.  The material after processing will be safe and clean. </li><li>  To make the decor from the cones beautiful, you can adjust the shape of the material.  It is enough to soak the raw materials for crafts in water, and then dress them in the right place with a rope and dry them. </li><li>  To make the material brighter, you can bleach it.  To do this, it is recommended to soak the cones in a container with bleach for 5 hours.  In this case, it is worth observing the proportions.  One part of water requires one part of bleach.  In conclusion, the cones must be thoroughly washed and dried. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Getting to work </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to make the basis of the future wreath.  If there is no time, then you can buy a ready-made one in a specialized store.  If this is not possible, then the basis for the wreath should be made independently.  It will cost much less.  The newspaper must be twisted into a long tube, and then rolled up as a bagel.  The edges of the material can be stapled with a stapler.  It is recommended to additionally wrap such a blank with a cut newspaper, and then with adhesive tape.  This will not allow the finished product to deform. </p><p>  To hide the base material, you should cover the workpiece with a uniform layer of paint.  After the coating has completely dried, you can glue the bumps, filling them with the entire space.  In conclusion, the wreath should be beautifully decorated using satin ribbons, beads and twigs.  It is recommended to varnish the finished wreath in order to preserve it for a long time. </p><h2>  Star of cones </h2><p>  This Christmas cone decor can be a great decoration for spruce.  The manufacturing process of such a star is quite simple.  To work, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Ribbons. </li><li>  Metal skewers or sturdy wire. </li><li>  Fir cones of various sizes. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decor from cones for the new year" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/1615447.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to do </h2><p>  From the wire it is necessary to make 5 skewers of equal length.  They should be connected, bending in the center.  This will be the basis for the five-pointed star.  It is necessary to string the cones on the wire, collecting the original composition.  One of the twigs should be bent and tied with a satin ribbon.  This will allow you to hang the finished crafts near the fireplace, on the wall or on the doors.  Such a star can be fixed on top of the Christmas tree. </p><h2>  Christmas decorations </h2><p>  If you wish, you can make an original decor of cones with your own hands for the Christmas tree.  Products are quite simple to manufacture, durable and beautiful.  How to turn a simple bump into a work of art? </p><p>  The easiest option is to use old small soft toys.  First, paint the prepared bump in the appropriate color, and then attach the toy head to it.  You can also add tail, paws and wings.  The result is an original Christmas tree toy. </p><p>  There is an even simpler way of making such crafts.  To begin with, it is worth painting the cones in the desired color or covering them with sparkles.  In conclusion, a neat bow from a satin ribbon or several pine branches, as well as a rope, must be attached to the toy.  Craft is ready to hang it on the Christmas tree. </p>

    <p>  With the help of felt and felt, you can create original fairy-tale characters from ordinary cones.  Most importantly, glue all the parts together.  Otherwise, the toy will begin to crumble over time. </p><p>  For the manufacture of Christmas tree decorations, you can use not only cones, but also their scales.  Before starting work, they should be carefully separated from the base.  To make a toy, you need a blank.  It can be made in the form of an animal figure.  In this case, foam rubber and papier-m√¢ch√© can be used to make the blank.  To the surface of such a base, carefully glue the flakes of cones, and then decorate everything with sparkles, creating the effect of snow. </p><h2>  We are engaged with children </h2><p>  Cones are an excellent natural material that can be used for activities with children.  However, it is not worthwhile to use glue for fastening parts in this case.  Usually, plasticine is used for classes.  It is worth noting that the process of making figures is very popular with children.  In addition, the creation of crafts allows you to develop hand motility, as well as affect the mental development of the child.  Before starting classes, you should familiarize yourself with several rules: </p><ol><li>  Cones must be well dried out. </li><li>  A variety of sizes and shapes of the material allows you to develop the imagination of the child. </li><li>  Small parts of figures can be made of plasticine and other materials suitable for this. </li><li>  If the child is no more than 3 years old, then crafts can only be done from one cone.  For older children, you can come up with several compositions. </li></ol><h2>  Fox from cones </h2><p>  To make a chanterelle with children, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Plasticine white, orange and black. </li><li>  Cones of various shapes and sizes. </li></ol><p>  To begin with, it is worth choosing material that will be suitable for the manufacture of the body, tail and head.  Cones should be connected together using plasticine or good glue.  The workpiece is ready.  It remains to decorate it.  To do this, clay, legs, ears, eyes, nose and face of the animal should be molded from plasticine. </p><h2>  Nimble hedgehog </h2><p>  This animal can be made from one beautiful and big cone, which has already fully opened.  It remains to decorate with individual parts made of plasticine.  To complete, you need to blind 4 paws, ears, nose, eyes and face of the animal. </p>
