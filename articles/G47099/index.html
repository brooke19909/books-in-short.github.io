    <p>  For her you will need small leaves.  Walking in the autumn in the yard, in the park, in the forest, collect a few leaves of mountain ash, alder, linden, aspen, oak.  Pay attention to fancifully painted ones.  So that on the road they do not deform and do not lose shape, put them between the pages of the magazine, in the folder that you took with you specifically for this case. </p><p>  Arriving home, put the leaves between two layers of thin cloth, iron.  Then they will have the desired shape.  If the leaves have not completely dried out the first time, repeat this procedure. </p><p>  Now take a photo frame, lay out patterns of tree leaves between the glass and cardboard surfaces along its edge, place the photo in the center, and the original thing is ready. </p><h2>  A hammer to help </h2>

In this case, the fabric should be horizontal.  Wait for the glue to dry.  On the wrong side, lay a dense colored fabric, sew the edges of both fabrics. </p><h2>  Panel </h2><p>  You can make a panel of leaves "Autumn Pattern" in a slightly different way.  The finished product will be more durable, it can be washed. </p><p>  When you sew a braid on a white cloth, attach each leaf to a fabric that is similar in color, for example, an <span>oak leaf</span> to yellow, outline, cut out in shape.  Thus, lay out the prototypes of the leaves of the trees on a brown, green cloth.  After that, place each blank in its cell trimmed with braid.  Sew in with an overlock or overcast.

    <p>  The next work looks very stylish.  You will need thick black cardboard, scarlet paint <span>for fabric, glue</span> and maple leaves.  Let them be of different sizes.  To find these, you can collect them not only underfoot, but also tear them from the trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After ironing these natural materials, lay them on waste paper, cover with red paint and let dry completely.  Smearing the back of the sheet with glue, put it on cardboard.  At the same time, try to keep the size.  Place small leaves next to each other on one side.  Large can border the top and bottom of the panel.  It will also tell you how to make such patterns from <span>autumn leaves, a</span> photo from our review. </p><p>  You can arrange the work in a slightly different way, taking instead of black white thick paper, replace maple leaves with rowan leaves, cover them with green, brown colors.  It all depends on your preferences.  Then you will get your favorite leaf pattern. </p><h2>  Hedgehog and owl applique </h2><p>  This type of work evokes imagination in children and adults.  After you bring the leaves home, look, maybe one of them looks like a prickly hedgehog, and the other should only be slightly trimmed as it turns into an owl. </p><p>  Draw on the light paper the snub-nosed face of the hedgehog, draw with a pencil the place where his body will be.  Start gluing maple leaves with sharp edges up, starting from the back of the animal.  Place the next sheet a little lower, then another, until you reach the abdomen of a hedgehog.  You got a funny animal with original spines.  Their role can be played by leaves of other trees, the main thing is to place them with their point up. </p><p>  Before you make an owl, also outline the contours of its head and body on paper.  Stick small leaves on them to symbolize feathers.  If the leaves are large, cut them with scissors.  Glue the eyes out of colored paper, and the pattern of autumn leaves in the <span>form of an owl</span> can be considered complete. </p><h2>  Other types of applications </h2>

    <p>  The pattern of leaves in a strip has a strictly defined shape.  To do this, take a sheet of paper, unfold horizontally.  Now it is necessary to draw two parallel segments along the entire length of the canvas.  The distance between these lines is such that the largest leaf, for example, maple, fits inside the strip. </p><p>  Now you need to see how to beautifully arrange the natural material.  You can alternate large with small leaves, or act differently, placing large first, and put small ones between them.  As the latter, oak, alder, rowan leaves can act.  When all fragments of the panel are laid out, turn each inside out, spread with glue and apply in its place. </p><p>  You can arrange application fragments in strict geometric order.  To do this, cut out squares, rectangles from them with scissors, glue them between two drawn segments.  A specific pattern can be posted in a strip.  Cut a circle from the yellow <span>leaf</span> , glue it, and place the <span>rowan leaves</span> around <span>,</span> you will get a colorful daisy.  You can make several of these colors.  A pattern of leaves in a strip made in the form of snowmen will look beautiful.  To do this, cut out three circles of different sizes and stick them on top of each other. </p><p>  Interesting look of the work, designed in the form of several bands.  Then the whole canvas will be covered with intricate patterns. </p><h2>  Turning mountain ash, acacia into sakura </h2>

    <p>  There are other tricks with which you can lay out a pattern of fallen leaves.  A photo will help you figure out how to do a similar job.  Gather small fallen leaves of acacia and mountain ash.  Arriving home, put them between the pages of the magazine or ironed.  When they dry, you can begin to work. </p><p>  On black paper, draw a sakura branch, let it dry.  Put some PVA glue in an unnecessary container, add red gouache to it, mix.  You should get a pink paste.  Now you need tweezers: carefully take the first leaf of mountain ash or acacia, dip it into the sticky mass.  Then attach to the drawn sakura branch.  Next to this, place 3 more impromptu flowers, as a result, each of them should consist of four petals.  Let the work dry. </p><h2>  Pattern of leaves, applique on fabric, window, paper. </h2>
