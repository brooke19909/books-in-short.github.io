    <p>  Life does not stand still, and we are constantly changing.  Fluctuations in weight of 2-3 kilograms per month by doctors are considered normal.  But what if you lost weight and all the clothes became great?  How to put on jeans, skirts and trousers so as not to spoil the thing and enjoy wearing it for several more seasons?  The main recommendations for remaking things from the wardrobe will depend on the original model and the number of extra centimeters that you need to get rid of. </p><p>  How to sew jeans from the bottom </p><p>  Adjusting the width of the trousers is suitable if you decide to change the style of the existing model.  With it, you can turn a flare into a straight cut model.  <span>How to take in jeans?</span>  Very simple.  Turn them inside out and put them on you.  Ask a relative or friend to help you and stab both legs evenly on both sides of the knee to the bottom.  Sew both of them along the intended lines.  After that, stepping back one centimeter from the line, cut off the excess fabric.  Process allowances with an overlock. </p><p>  How to sew jeans at the waist </p><p>  If your trousers fit perfectly on your hips, and protrude a few centimeters at the waist, then you need to reduce the size.  Alteration options will depend on the amount of excess volume.  If the difference is only a couple of centimeters, then you can simply insert a wide elastic band into the belt.  It will evenly distribute the excess volume over the entire length.  To do this, make an incision on each side of the wrong side of the belt.  Insert the elastic tape of the desired size and sew at the cut points.  Sew on the belt after that. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to make jeans 5-7 centimeters?  In this case, you have to work hard.  To begin, support the belt on the rear halves between the side seams.  Put on jeans inside out and zip up.  Your assistant should use two needles to stab two tucks, placing them at the same distance from the middle seam.  Take off your jeans and sew the marked parts.  Bend them to the middle, iron and thread the appropriate color, lay the finishing line, fixing the tuck from the outside.  Open the middle loops and cut the belt in half.  Pin it to the sutured jeans and, having measured the excess fabric, cut it off.  Sew the two parts of the belt and iron the seam allowances.  Sew on a belt.  Close the seam with belt loops. </p><p>  What if you need to reduce the trousers by 3-4 sizes?  How to sew jeans on your own?  In this case, you will have to tear the belt along almost the entire length, leaving 10 centimeters from the button and buttonhole intact.  To remove such a volume in each leg, there are two ways to use it. </p><ul><li>  It will be necessary to expand the side and step seams, without touching the middle seams of the front and rear.  Using a pattern of a suitable size, we draw on the jeans the new contours of the side sections and adjust the step seam.  Cut off the excess fabric and sew them again.  The allowances are processed using an overlock.  On the sides we lay the finishing line with threads of a suitable color.  Cut the belt in half.  We remove the extra centimeters and sew it again.  Ironing allowances.  Sew the finished belt to the jeans. </li><li>  This method is perfect if embroidery or other decorative trim is made along the side seam.  To get started, we unfasten the belt, leaving 5-7 centimeters from the beginning.  To reduce each leg by 10 centimeters, we will make decorative seams in front and back along the entire length.  We put on jeans turned on the wrong side.  Visually divide the front of the leg in half and, measuring 2.5 centimeters on each side of the middle, fix with needles.  We do the same procedure with the back.  Carefully remove the jeans.  Lay the line along the intended line and remove the needles.  Cut off 1.5 centimeters of fabric, leaving an allowance of 1 centimeter wide.  We process the edge with the help of an overlock.  We twist the jeans to the front side.  The allowances are bent to the step seam and on the front side we are laying the finishing line.  After that, we reduce the belt by the required number of centimeters, cutting an unnecessary piece from the middle.  Sew the belt.  Iron the seam and sew it on the jeans.  We hide the seam behind the middle loops. </li></ul>
