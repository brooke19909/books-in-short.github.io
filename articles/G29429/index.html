Crimea knows how to surprise</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most beautiful pearls of the Black Sea coast is rightfully considered the village of Rybachye (Crimea).  Every year he hospitably receives a large number of tourists, many of whom come every holiday season.  The local population is very welcoming to vacationers: everyone will receive a warm welcome. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Rybachye (Crimea) is located 30 kilometers from Alushta, on the very coast of the south of the peninsula.  It is slightly stretched along the coastal line.  Almost through the whole village there is a large central street, on which, starting from lunch, you can watch a lot of different merchants of various goods.  Everything is sold here, from swimsuits to barbecue. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is very easy to get to the Rybachye village from Simferopol.  Every 10-15 minutes from the stop "Resort", which is located at the railway station of the <span>capital of Crimea,</span> shuttle buses leave.  They go along the same highway that leads to Alushta, however, without reaching a bit, turn left. </p><p>  The road to Rybachye captures with its beauty.  From the window you can observe very beautiful mountain landscapes that extend to the horizon. </p><p>  Almost all the time after turning from the highway on the right side, you can see the sparkling sea and the winding coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Fishing Crimea" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30288/690504.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From Alushta, Yalta and Feodosia to Rybachy can easily be reached by bus and boat.  Tickets are sold at ticket offices of train stations in these cities. </p><h2>  Climate and nature </h2><p>  Holidays in Rybachy (Crimea) are also very good because the climate there is simply magnificent.  In summer, in this wonderful place there is practically no rain.  <span>The average temperature</span> in July is about 26 degrees. </p><p>  The village is perfectly closed from all winds by mountain ranges.  This unique position allows almost always to avoid the occurrence of storms and keeps the sea calm during the entire holiday season. </p><p>  The village of Rybachye (Crimea) proudly boasts a very beautiful and picturesque nature.  It is located in a mountainous area, and tourists can admire the magnificent landscape. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  All tourists who have chosen the village of Rybachye (Crimea) as their vacation destination, the prices pleasantly surprise.  Goods and services have a fairly democratic value. </p><p>  As for places to stay, here the range of offers and <span>pricing are</span> quite wide and varied.  Like the whole <span>resort Crimea,</span> Rybachye (private sector and pensions) has economy, luxury and middle-class housing.  You can come here without any trips, reservation and find yourself an affordable home in five minutes. </p><p>  Prices for housing in the private sector start at 100 rubles per person per day.  This price includes only accommodation in a residential building designed for several people.  Convenience will be on the street, and you will have to eat yourself.  The distance to the sea from such housing is about a kilometer.  Depending on the conditions, prices can reach several thousand per day.  This amount is already requested not per person, but for cottages and villas located on the seashore, fully furnished with good furniture and equipped with expensive appliances and alarms.  Often the owners of such houses themselves offer their cleaning services and cooking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This contrast is very surprising for tourists who first get to the village of Rybachye (Crimea).  Resort boarding houses often offer living conditions far not better than in the private sector, but much more expensive.  Sometimes the difference is 200 and 300 percent.  Prices for accommodation in boarding houses start at around 190 rubles.  This includes the cost of one person per night in a multi-bed room without amenities, but with a balcony, washbasin, TV and fridge.  Accommodation for one person in a double room with all amenities will cost <span>500 rubles</span> per day.  Meals are not included in this price.  In the dining rooms, breakfast, lunch and dinner in the complex costs about 400 rubles a day. </p><p>  In the center of the village is a boarding house "Wave".  It has a fairly well-groomed territory and comfortable rooms of various classes. </p><p>  Pension "Mountain" is located 400 m from the sea.  He does not have his own dining room, but his guests are provided with meals in a neighboring holiday home. </p><p>  Pension "Rybachye" is a more modern recreation facility.  It is housed in a four-story building and has a very beautiful area, planted with various plants. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2>
