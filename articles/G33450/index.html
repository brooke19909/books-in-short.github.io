    <h2>  Place for inspiration </h2><p>  At the time of exile and the life of the greatest Russian poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, the Trigorskoye estate - the museum-reserve - became his second home.  It was in this place, filled with friendly warmth, homeliness, that he drew ideas for his new creative works.  In these amazing places, the poet wrote many lines that were dedicated to the locals of the Trigorskoye estate.  The museum-reserve appeared after the death of the great poet, but every corner of this land sacredly keeps the memory of Pushkin’s endless conversations with friends, that amazing era. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pages of history </h2><p>  The landscapes that the great poet describes in the work "Eugene Onegin" resemble "Trigorskoe".  The Museum-Reserve is open to all connoisseurs of Russian classical literature, fans of Pushkin.  You can get here as part of the excursion group. </p><p>  Manor "Trigorskoye" - a museum-reserve (see photo in the article) - strikes with its versatility of colors, harmony with nature, regular and even lines. </p><p>  In 1762, Catherine II of the land of the Yegoryevskaya Bay, which included the Trigorskoye, granted Maxim Dmitrievich Vyndomsky - second major of the Life Guards of the <span>Semenovsky Regiment.</span>  He left the estate as a legacy to his son Alexander, and it was from this time (1780) that Trigorskoye underwent positive transformations.  New service and utility buildings appear here, the territory of the park is designed in the English style.  Pushkin became friends with the Vyndomsky family.  Since 1820, the poet often communicated with the Osipov-Wulf family.  <span>This estate</span> inspired Pushkin's image of Tatyana Larina in the poem "Eugene Onegin." </p>

    <h2>  "Pushkin Alleys" </h2><p>  Namely alleys appeared a bit later, adorning the Trigorskoye estate (museum-reserve).  Reviews of the guests of the park who managed to sit on the “Onegin bench”, see the “secluded oak”, are filled with positive emotions.  Schoolchildren prefer the "Tatyana Avenue", here they seem to fall on the pages of the amazing novel "Eugene Onegin."  In the evening, by the light of the rising moon, the park “comes to life”.  It seems that behind each tree lurks one of the many Pushkin heroes.  It is impossible to convey the feelings experienced by the guests of the park.  In order to understand the whole atmosphere of this amazing place, you definitely need to come here at least for a couple of days. </p>

    <h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  In 1859 the estate was owned by A.N. Wulf, then M.I. Palmov acted as a tenant.  He tries to maintain the estate in the form in which Pushkin liked to be in it.  But in 1918, the barbarians looted and burned the estate, causing irreparable damage to it.  For a long time these places were in an abandoned and deplorable state.  Only in 1962, an amazing cultural monument was restored.  This was possible after historians and writers carried out colossal work on a detailed study of archives, proved the need to restore the Trigorskoye estate (museum reserve).  The reviews of visitors coming here from different countries confirm the timeliness and correctness of the decision to restore this amazing architectural and cultural ensemble. </p>

    <h2>  Manor Attractions </h2><p>  One of the most fun sights available in the reserve is considered to be a sundial.  The peculiarity of their device is that the shadow falls from the gnomon to the dial, which is composed of oaks.  The midday path leads to the "secluded oak", which is part of this amazing clock scheme. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  What is so famous for the Trigorskoye estate (museum reserve)?  How to get to these unique places?  These are common questions of those who dream of visiting Pushkin’s places.  Among the several ways of arriving at the Pushkin Nature Reserve, the most common are tourist routes from Pskov and St. Petersburg.  It was here that Pushkin met Anna Kern, the niece of Praskovya Alexandrovna Osipova.  Alexander Sergeyevich dedicated the poem to this woman, which is familiar to every Russian person: "I remember a wonderful moment." </p><p>  Pushkin has always been a welcome and long-awaited guest on this estate.  The family of <span>Anna Kern</span> lived in those days in an outwardly not very comfortable house, there used to be a linen factory.  The master's three-story house was located in the park.  For a long time they tried to repair it, but the Osipov-Wulf family did not move into it, having remained to live in the building of the old factory.  Contemporaries, this estate was rated as a Pushkin protected place. </p><p>  After the death of Alexander Sergeyevich Praskovya Aleksandrovna Osipova, the mistress of the house, made a small museum.  In it, she collected things that were directly related to the great Russian poet: books, initiations, letters, souvenirs and gifts.  It was here, in Trigorsky, that the first Pushkin Museum in Russia appeared.  After it was looted in 1918, 40 years passed before the estate was restored to its proper form.  On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the poet’s birthday, restoration work in the manor’s house was completed at the estate, as well as a full-fledged repair of the park territory. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Currently, there are three main objects as part of the State Memorial Historical, Cultural and Natural Landscape Museum-Reserve of Pushkin "Mikhailovsky".  One of the most visited is the Trigorskoye estate.  Thousands of Russians and foreign tourists come here annually in order to get to know more closely the places where the great Russian poet loved to be. </p><p>  Museum staff developed interesting thematic excursions for the younger generation of Russia.  The estate hosts literary Pushkin readings.  Young talents from all over our country aspire here to Trigorskoye, not only to share interesting information that they could find about the life and work of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, but also in the hope that it is here that they can find new ideas for your creativity. </p><p>  Every corner of this land keeps a memory of those distant times when a Russian poet walked along the alleys, accompanied by the beautiful Anna Kern.  Many events have passed since that far time, society has changed, the attitude towards books and literature has changed.  But until the doors of the Trigorskoye estate are open for visitors, the memory of an amazing man, poet, writer Alexander Pushkin will not disappear. </p>
