When and under what conditions did the hierarchy arise?  What determines the necessity of subordinating people to each other? </p><h2>  Genetic Features </h2><p>  The desire to dominate can clearly be seen in primates.  It is biology that is capable of giving the simplest explanation for the dominance of one individual over the others.  This is established by scientific experiments and numerous observations of animals living in groups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="islamobile.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Primacy society" class="if uuid-2511769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511769.jpg"></div><p>  The hierarchy is built on the desire to have the best - female or food.  The suppression of the weak in animals is based on the manifestation of strength.  Is this really so different from the life attitudes of a civilized society? </p><h2>  Primordial Origin </h2><p>  The need for a ‚Äúleader‚Äù was due to the herd lifestyle.  Fear, the instinctive need for food, protection and the creation of conditions for survival highlighted the most powerful representatives of the tribe.  The authority and the ability to hard coercion endowed the primitive leader with elementary managerial functions.  This made it possible to control the continuation of a kind and get the best food. </p><p>  In ancient Greece, even in mythology, power was based on the strength and suppression of the weak.  For example, the god Uranus constantly returned his children to the earth, fearing to die at their hands - as he was predicted.  Kronos took his place, who ate his children so that they would not take power from him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hacked.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Divine power" class="if uuid-2511783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511783.jpg"></div><p>  The term "power" is applied to a society in which consciousness existed.  The clan community is the initial unit of society, the members of which had the same right to joint ownership.  Childbirth united in tribes and unions.  So there was a need for public administration in the absence of the state. </p><h2>  Deciphering the term </h2><p>  There are about 300 definitions of power, but there is no generally accepted interpretation in modern science.  First of all, it is the willful effect of one person on another.  In addition, it is the ability of a subject or group to influence the behavior of people, regardless of their desire. </p><p>  It is established that the nature of power is social, since it is born and develops only in society.  Its absence means chaos, anarchy and decline for humanity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Unification for the sake of purpose" class="if uuid-2511752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511752.jpg"></div><p>  Any kind of submission implies inequality in various parameters.  Superiority makes it possible to use one‚Äôs position to the detriment, to abuse it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Power concepts </h2><p>  The most common theories of the origin of power include: </p><ol><li>  Institutional - arose as a result of state entities and the need to form governing bodies. </li><li>  Theological - granted by God.  The divine origin of power is based on the theory of St. Augustine, which explains its emergence as a gift, because people are weak and sinful, they are not able to maintain public order. </li><li>  Systemic - considers hierarchical relations as a tool that streamlines the interaction of society. </li><li>  Role - is determined by self-realization in establishing control over the subjects. </li><li>  Market - competition for material and spiritual goods. </li><li>  Exchange - possession of a rare item makes it possible to manage. </li><li>  Psychological and power.  These theories explain despotism as a means of surviving by forcing the weak to submit.  Freud laid the origins of the theory; it was most widely spread in the middle of the last century. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="methoblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church influence" class="if uuid-2511744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511744.jpg"></div><p>  The legal concept of power stands out separately.  Its founders were the great thinkers Rousseau, Kant, Spinoza.  Their theory is based on the fact that the primary institution is law, and power and politics come from it.  In their pure <span>form, theories of</span> origin do not occur; they mutually complement each other. </p><h2>  Components of domination </h2><p>  The origin of power in society is a natural outcome of evolution.  Three main components of power are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  A subject is a carrier of imperious behavior, it can be either an individual or a group of persons. </li><li>  An object is one who obeys, builds his behavior, depending on the content and direction of power influence. </li><li>  The source is power, prestige, law, material and social guarantees. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.angletonchristians.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power of knowledge" class="if uuid-2511746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511746.jpg"></div><p>  Power based on fear leads to rebellion and disobedience.  Its result is civil war and rebellion.  Due to this, it is gradually weakening.  The most stable system is based on mutual interest.  This is facilitated by the power of persuasion and authority. </p><h2>  Core resources </h2><p>  In the formation of power, resources occupy a special place.  These are the sources used to provide influence.  Resources are not evenly distributed, so owning them gives benefits to some individuals.  They can be used to encourage, punish, persuade.  Depending on the fields of activity, they are classified into: </p><ul><li>  Economic - material goods necessary to ensure a certain standard of living (money, products, minerals). </li><li>  Social - are aimed at improving the status and are the result of economic (level of medical care, education, position). </li><li>  Information-developing - knowledge and intelligence, their accessibility to the masses (Internet, electronic technologies, libraries, institutes). </li><li>  Demographic - a healthy population, developed intellectually, natural growth and the absence of a large age difference. </li><li>  Political - a well-coordinated mechanism of government.  It is based on a developed political culture, the presence of parties and apparatus. </li><li>  Power - work strictly in the legal field (police, judicial system, army). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="islamobile.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power of persuasion" class="if uuid-2511758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511758.jpg"></div><p>  The result gives only the integrated use of resources, but the most universal unit, without which the origin of power and the state is impossible, is a person. </p><h2>  Typology of power </h2><p>  There are various types of power.  It can be divided according to the sphere of influence into collective and sole.  Political scientists in the global sense distinguish between non-political and political.  The origin of power, depending on the form of society, can be democratic, legitimate and opposite in meaning and content, that is, illegal. </p><p>  Among the first type, family power stands out, which includes relations between spouses, children and parents.  This type of submission is the oldest. </p><p>  Depending on the historical development of society, it is possible to distinguish slaveholding, feudal, bourgeois, socialist power. </p><h2>  Public Administration Method </h2><p>  Political power, translated from Greek, is the art of management, the ability to realize certain views and, through influence, achieve established goals.  Tasks can be national or national. </p><p>  Political power has its own special features.  It applies to all residents of the entire state.  A group of leaders acts exclusively in the legal field and represents the people.  Another feature is the ability to delegate authority through the ranks both up and down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sciencenewsforstudents.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General choice" class="if uuid-2511787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89837/2511787.jpg"></div><p>  Political scientists divide it into legislative, executive and judicial.  This severely limits its impact.  According to the sphere of influence, they distinguish between central, regional and local authorities.  Also one of the criteria is the number of entities that exercise leadership - monarchist power or republican power. </p><p>  The main functions and tasks of political governance are: the organization of society within the framework of the law, the interaction of the population with the authorities, control and enforcement. </p><p>  State power derives from political power, which is broader in meaning and covers more areas of human relations.  She is public and sovereign. </p><p>  However, some political scientists distinguish political power from state power.  They believe that state power can only be realized if the party wins the election.  However, in developed countries, governance can be concentrated in the hands of several entities. </p>
