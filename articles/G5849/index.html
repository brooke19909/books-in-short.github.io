Guests of the tourism project are the most important value for the friendly and always ready to help staff.  The administrator and other representatives of the hotel will make sure that the guests of the establishment are in a relaxed atmosphere, safe and comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, "Novelty" is decorated in a modern style.

    <p>  As you know, the Novinka Hotel (Kazan) has a large selection of rooms for a reason, because this establishment has the status of a business-class hotel and three stars, although customers evaluate the project at least 4 *.  In this case, it is completely incomprehensible why some tourist complexes offering a minimum of services to their visitors have 4 *, and this interesting hotel is only 3 *.  In general, we will not go deeper, but rather we will discuss in more detail the information related to the lease. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at 14:00, but check-out is two hours before.  Payment for rooms is daily.  If you stay in a hotel for a period that does not exceed 22 hours, then payment will be made anyway for a day's stay.  For the convenience of customers, Novinka offers early check-in without booking (in this case, the accommodation is made upon the availability of rooms). </p><p>  In addition, check-in from midnight to 4 a.m. is only possible if you have booked a room previously and at the same time indicate the time of early arrival.  In turn, from 4 a.m. to 2 p.m. check-in is also possible by prior reservation. </p><p>  In addition, we note that in each of the hotel rooms you can use the telephone, satellite TV, air conditioning, wireless internet, a minibar and a safe. </p><h2>  Accommodation and other nuances </h2><p>  Hotel Novinka (Kazan, Russia) has penalties for people who exceed the length of stay in a rented room.  If you stay in your room from 12:00 to 18:00, then you will have to pay an additional fee of 5% of the cost of daily rent for each extra hour of stay.  If you leave between 18:00 and 24:00, you will have to make a fifty percent surcharge.  In addition, if the check-out is after midnight, the client will have to pay for renting a room for a full day. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that as a compliment, the 3 * Novinka Hotel (Kazan) can make its guest 1-2 hours of additional accommodation, if available rooms are available. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For parents of children under the age of 7, we note that their children are accommodated in the hotel with them completely free of charge without extra bed.  At the age of 7-14 years, an extra charge of 700 rubles is taken for placing a child, which includes breakfast. </p><p>  And now let's discuss each of the hotel rooms in more detail! </p><h2>  Single in the second building </h2><p>  The cost of renting this room is 2 and a half thousand rubles, and only one person can stay in it.  The room is decorated in beige tones.  In the room you can use air conditioning, wireless Internet, a minibar, satellite TV, a safe, a double bed, a work desk, as well as a hairdryer and shower, which are located in a separate bathroom. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that for a surcharge of 600 rubles you can buy not the basic rate, but half board, so that additional free dinner will be organized for you. </p><h2>  Single standard </h2><p>  This room has a more interesting interior: the floor in blue is ideally complemented by beige walls.  In this case, one or two people can be accommodated here.  The rental price directly depends on the number of guests: one person (basic rate) - 3100 rubles, two people (basic rate) - 3800 rubles, one person (half board) - 3 thousand 700 rubles, two persons (half board) - 5 thousand rubles.  Additionally, you should visit the pool, where you can have a great time. </p>
