    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of service at the Nicholas Park Hotel (Fethiye), it is worth noting the attention and the staff working in it.  The staff of the complex speak four languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Turkish, German, Arabic and English, which greatly simplifies communication between the administration and guests.  True, they don‚Äôt speak Russian here, because few tourists come from our country. </p><p>  What about room service?  The cleaning is quality and daily, and the maids try to come when guests have breakfast or are on the sea / walk / excursion.  The cleaning time, by the way, can be clarified and discussed.  Towels and linen are also changed daily.  Toiletries are always replenished. </p><p>  In general, many guests of the hotel notice that very smiling, welcoming and friendly people work in Nicholas Park 4 *.  Not a single gloomy face.  And a smile, according to reviews, solves all issues related to the language barrier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, at the request of guests can put an extra bed (or cradle for baby) in the apartment.  But if this is necessary, then it is necessary to first send the appropriate request to the accommodation facility so that everything is prepared by the administration in advance, for the arrival of the guests.  And more: children under 12 years old stay at the hotel for free. </p>

However, nobody needs to walk on foot, if you don‚Äôt want to, because a free bus runs directly from the hotel to the beach. </p><p>  And the sea ... It is amazing here.  Blue Lagoon is a national reserve of Turkey.  It is his photographs that can often be seen on tourist travel booklets.  By the way, you can also go to the city beach.  Some people like it even more.  But in general, a note: the coastal zone of the resort is occupied by two more beaches, in addition to the Blue Lagoon, is Kidrak and Belcekiz.  And people who have been to these places recommend visiting each of them. </p>
