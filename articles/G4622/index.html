These forces are responsible for maintaining balance, moving bodies or changing their shape.  In everyday life, you can see many different examples every day.  Movements and changes in form are crucial for the functionality of both artificial and natural objects. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="static is" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/929357.jpg" width="590"></div></h2><h2>  Concept of statics </h2><p>  The foundations of statics were laid more than 2200 years ago, when the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes and other scientists of that time were engaged in the study of amplifying properties and the invention of <span>simple mechanisms,</span> such as a lever and an axis.  Statics is a branch of mechanics that deals with forces that act on bodies in a state of rest under equilibrium. </p><p>  This is a <span>branch of physics</span> that enables the analytical and graphical procedures necessary to define and describe these unknown forces.  The section "statics" (physics) plays an important role in many branches of mechanical engineering, mechanical, civil, aviation and bioengineering, which deal with various consequences of forces.  When the body is at rest or moving at a uniform speed, then this is a field of physics.  Statics is the study of the body in equilibrium. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The methods and results of this section of science have been particularly useful in the design of buildings, bridges and dams, as well as cranes and other similar mechanical devices.  In order to be able to calculate the dimensions of such structures and equipment, architects and engineers must first determine the forces that act on their interconnected parts. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statics and dynamics" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/929359.jpg" width="330"></div><br>  Axioms of Statics </h2><p>  Statics is a branch of physics that studies the conditions under which mechanical and other systems remain in a certain state that does not change with time.  This section of physics is based on five main axioms: <br><br>  1. A solid body is in a state of static equilibrium, if two forces with the same intensity act on it, lie on the same line of action and are directed in opposite directions along the same line. <br>  2. A solid will remain in a static state until it is affected by external forces or a system of forces. <br>  3. The resultant of two forces acting at the same material point is the vector sum of the two forces.  This axiom obeys the principle of vector summation. <br>  4. Two interacting bodies react to each other with two forces equal in intensity in opposite directions along the same line of action.  This axiom is also called the principle of action and reaction. <br>  5. If the deformable body is in a state of static balance, it will not be disturbed if the physical body remains in a solid state.  This axiom is also called the curing principle. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mechanics and its sections </h2><p>  Physics in Greek (physikos - "natural" and "physis" - "nature") literally means science, which deals with nature.  It covers all the known laws and properties of matter, as well as the forces acting on it, including gravity, heat, light, magnetism, electricity and other forces that can change the basic characteristics of objects.  One of the branches of science is mechanics, which includes such important subsections as statics and dynamics, as well as kinematics. <br><br>  Mechanics is a branch of physics that studies forces, objects, or bodies that are at rest or in motion.  This is one of the largest entities in the field of science and technology.  Static tasks include studying the state of bodies under the influence of various forces.  Kinematics is a branch of physics (mechanics) that studies the movement of objects, regardless of the forces that cause movement. </p>

    <h2>  Theoretical Mechanics: Statics </h2><p>  Mechanics is a physical science that examines the behavior of bodies under the influence of forces.  There are 3 categories of mechanics: absolutely solid, deformable bodies and fluids.  A solid body is a body that does not deform under the influence of forces.  Theoretical mechanics (statics - part of the mechanics of an absolutely rigid body) also includes dynamics, which, in turn, is divided into kinematics and kinetics. </p><p>  The mechanics of a deformable body deals with the distribution of forces within the body and the deformations caused in this connection.  These internal forces cause certain stresses in the body, which ultimately can lead to a change in the material itself.  These issues are studied in the courses of the compromising materials on the resistance of materials. <br><br>  Fluid mechanics is a branch of mechanics that deals with the distribution of forces within liquids or gases.  Fluids are widely used in engineering.  They can be classified as incompressible or compressible.  Fields of application are hydraulics, the aerospace industry, and many others. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of dynamics </h2><p>  Dynamics deals with power and movement.  The only way to change the movement of the body is to use force.  Along with the force, the speaker studies other physical concepts, including the following: energy, momentum, collision, center of gravity, torque and moment of inertia. </p>

    <p>  Statics and dynamics are completely opposite states.  Dynamics is the doctrine of bodies that are not in equilibrium, and acceleration occurs.  Kinetics studies the forces that cause movement, or the forces that arise as a result of movement.  In contrast to such a concept as statics, kinematics is the doctrine of body motion, which does not take into account the fact in which way the movement is made.  It is sometimes called "motion geometry." </p>

    <p>  Fundamental quantities in mechanics are length, time, mass and force.  The first three are called absolute, independent of each other.  The force is not an absolute value, since it is associated with mass and changes in speed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="static physics" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/931880.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Length </h2><p>  Length is a value that is used to describe the position of a point in space relative to another point.  This distance is called the standard unit of length.  The generally accepted standard unit for measuring length is a meter.  This standard has been formed and improved over the years.  Initially, it was one ten millionth part of the earth‚Äôs surface, the quadrant, with which it was quite difficult to make measurements.  On October 20, 1983, the meter was defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1 / 299,792,458 seconds. </p><h2>  Time </h2><p>  Time is a certain interval between two events.  The generally accepted standard unit of time is second.  The second was originally defined as 1/86.4 of the average <span>period of the Earth's rotation around its axis.</span>  In 1956, the definition of the second was improved and amounted to 1 / 31,556 of the time required for the complete revolution that the Earth makes around the Sun. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dynamics" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/931931.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Weight </h2><p>  Mass is a property of matter.  It can be considered as the amount of substance contained in the body.  This category defines the effect of gravity on the body and resistance to changes in movement.  This <span>resistance to change in</span> movement is called inertia, which is the result of body mass.  A common unit of mass is a kilogram. </p>

    <h2>  Force </h2><p>  Strength is a derivative unit, but a very important unit in the study of mechanics.  It is often defined as the action of one body on another, and may or may not be the result of direct contact between the bodies.  Gravitational and electromagnetic forces are examples of the result of such an effect.  There are two principles of influence, forces that tend to change the movement of the system and which tend to deform it.  The main unit of force is Newton in the SI system and the pound in the English system. </p>

    <h2>  Equilibrium equations </h2><p>  Statics suggests that the items in question are absolutely solid.  The sum of all the forces acting on the body at rest should be zero, that is, the forces involved will balance each other and there should be no tendency for forces that can rotate the body around any axis.  These conditions are independent of each other, and their expression in mathematical form makes up the so-called equilibrium equations. </p>

    <p>  There are three equilibrium equations, and therefore only three unknown forces can be calculated.  If there are more than three unknown forces, this means that the components in the structure or machine are slightly larger than required to maintain certain loads, or that there are more restrictions than necessary to keep the body from moving. </p><p>  Such unnecessary components or restrictions are called redundant (for example, a four-legged table has one redundant), and the force system is statically indefinite.  The number of equations available in statics is limited, since any solid body remains solid under any conditions, regardless of shape and size. </p>
