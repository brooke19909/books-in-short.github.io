Holidays in Pattaya</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Pattaya is attractive to all categories of tourists, especially for budget travelers.  After all, getting to Pattaya from Bangkok is much easier than to the islands.  Just a couple of hours by bus or train - and you are already there.  Moneybags settle on the outskirts of Pattaya, in the "five" with a huge territory.  Whereas the city itself is at the mercy of a more democratic public.  In Pattaya it is easy to find budget accommodation.  Even not far from the beach you can find a suitable, but very decent hotel. </p><p>  Today we will talk about one of them - Sawasdee Pattaya 2 *.  But our essay will be devoted not only to this hotel.  We will analyze the nuances of rest in Pattaya.  Can a budget tourist go here in the rainy season?  How to get to the resort from Bangkok cheaper?  Which beach to choose for relaxation and where to have fun in the evening?  All this will be described below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lovepattayathailand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya today" class="if uuid-3216176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216176.jpg"></div><h2>  About Pattaya Resort </h2><p>  The city has its own airport (U-Tapao).  But only local airlines from other regions of Thailand and neighboring countries land here.  But in high season, U-Tapao also accepts charters from Russia.  You can come to Pattaya by bus directly from Bangkok airport or by train from the capital's railway station.  The journey will take about two hours.  Proximity to Bangkok International Airport (about 165 km) is not the only advantage of this resort.  Tourists choose it, first of all, because of the democratic prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This applies to the cost of housing, as well as food, entertainment and transportation.  Until 1961, Pattaya was a small fishing village.  But when American soldiers arrived here for a vacation during the Vietnam War, night moths from all over Thailand flocked to them for a lot of money.  Since then, the resort has gained a fame.  Pattaya today is the most shocking city in Thailand.  Life boils in him day and night.  But do not think that you do not need to go here with children or missus.  There are places in Pattaya for family vacations.  In addition, cereal establishments for the most part open only in the evening.  During the day, the city struggles to create a form of respectability and decency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya City" class="if uuid-3216173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216173.jpg"></div><h2>  When to go to Pattaya </h2><p>  The name of the fishing village, which was destined to become the most popular resort in the country, translates as "northwest wind."  This "phattaya" blows just at the beginning of the rainy season.  The fact that you can relax at the resort all year round is a criminal lie of tour operators.  In September-October, water can be knee-deep on the streets, and in the summer months it can rain for a couple of days in a row.  And what is Pattaya in March?  The high season at the resort is squeezed into the timeframe December - February.  The sky is then cloudless, the probability of precipitation tends to zero, the sea is calm.  But prices noticeably soar. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  November is also a good month to relax.  It only rains a couple of days, the sea calms down, and prices continue to remain low, as in the "wet season".  The exact same weather situation is observed in March.  Pattaya is still bubbling with nightlife, rains can pass three times a month, and even then at night.  But the bulk of tourists moving out of the resort, because of which hoteliers begin to reduce prices.  In April, it gets too hot, and heavy clouds are increasingly covering the sky.  Breathing becomes difficult due to high humidity.  May is considered the beginning of the rainy season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya in March" class="if uuid-3216177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216177.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to settle in Pattaya </h2><p>  The promoted resort is loved not only by backpacker students.  Wealthy tourists choose the "five" on the northern and southern ends of Pattaya City.  The resort itself is very conveniently planned - like a chessboard.  Getting lost in it is almost impossible.  The street farthest from the sea bordering the city center is Sukhumvit.  All housing is worth a penny.  In addition, the prices in the cafe there are also very, very affordable.  But the minus of this location is the distance to the sea.  Have to hire a knock-knock or rent a scooter. </p><p>  The respectable areas of North and South Pattaya are cut off from the hot center by the streets of South and North Pattaya Rd.  In Down Town, Beach Road stretches along the sea and - at some distance from it, but in parallel - Second Road and 3 Rd.  All other streets (here they are called soybeans) go perpendicular to the coastline.  They are very conveniently called by numbers.  The main and most famous of them is Walking Street - the epicenter and focus of all the rampant life in the resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location of the hotel relative to the sights of the city </h2><p>  Savasdi Pattaya is located right in the center.  His address is 13 soybeans.  This quiet side street on Second Road comes out.  The city beach can be reached in 5-10 minutes.  Nearby is Bukhao Soy, a shopping street with many cafes and shops.  The famous Walking Street is within walking distance.  And this must be taken into account when booking this hotel. </p><p>  The audience who came to Thailand not for beaches and interesting sights settles here.  Moreover, reviews are full of references to the fact that hotel staff does not take money from guests for taking girls to their rooms.  But a decent audience will be welcomed no less.  Eurowindows will provide you with silence in the room.  Immediately near the hotel there is a Seven-Eleven grocery store, a pharmacy, a currency exchange, a cafe.  To the huge shopping center "Central Festival" 10 minutes walk. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.929072" data-lng="100.88431719999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/9/1/17391.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Savasdi Pattaya is a typical city hotel.  Its territory consists of one seven-story building with an elevator, to which a flower bed adjoins.  The building was erected in 2000, and in 2015 a large-scale renovation took place.  Now the building is easy to recognize from afar - it is a juicy lilac color.  The hotel has replaced furniture and plumbing.  On the ground floor of the building there is a reception and a restaurant where breakfast is held.  The rooms are on all other floors.  Given the noise (and dustiness) of this place, tourists recommend asking for settlements on the upper levels of the building. </p><p>  Only some of the hotel rooms have small balconies that go almost right to the neighboring building.  There is no pool at the hotel.  But Sawasdee is a hotel chain.  According to the existing agreement, you can use the pool at the Savasdi Siam 3 * hotel.  To do this, at the reception of your hotel you must take a special card, which must be presented at the entrance.  The Savasdi Siam Hotel is nearby, on Bukhao Soy, a 3-minute walk.  To the city beach to go also a little. </p><h2>  "Savasdi Pattaya": a description of the rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has over one hundred guest rooms.  Most of the rooms (about 80) belong to the ‚Äústandard‚Äù category.  This is a small bedroom with an en-suite bathroom.  The room is designed as a youth, in bright, juicy violet or pink colors.  Tourists in the reviews say that the furniture is new, everything is working properly.  There is air conditioning, a telephone, a TV with cable channels, a minibar (its charge, except for drinking water, is paid).  The bathroom has a make-up mirror. </p><p>  Maids clean the room daily, and bed linen is changed three times a week.  They also bring drinking water and cosmetics (soap, shower gel and shampoo).  The second category of rooms is called ‚Äúsuperior room‚Äù.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch bedrooms, also designed for two guests, is larger.  In addition, the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù has an electric kettle with replenished bags of drinks, a safe and a hairdryer in the bathroom.  The presence or absence of a balcony does not depend on the room category. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Savasdi Pattaya&quot; - room description" class="if uuid-3216153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216153.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Savasdi Pattaya Hotel includes breakfast.  At the tour operator or already in place, you can pay for additional meals - half or full board.  Those tourists who resorted to this option were not disappointed.  Lunches and dinners are held in the buffet format, all dishes are well-prepared and tasty.  As for breakfast, the discontent concerned only the time of the morning meal.  The doors of the Sabay restaurant opened at 8:00, which broke the lark day regime and tourists' plans to leave early for the islands. </p><p>  But the breakfasts themselves were, as for a hotel with two stars, very worthy.  None of the guests went hungry.  Tourists praise pastries.  Bad coffee is brewed in Thailand, but the one given at breakfast at the Savasdi Hotel was simply excellent.  And one more service, unheard of for the deuce: here they give lunch boxes to those who check out from the hotel early in the morning.  Those who dined and dined outside the hotel say that there are many cheap cafes in the area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Savasdi Pattaya&quot;: food" class="if uuid-3216154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216154.jpg"></div><h2>  Savasdi Pattaya: service </h2><p>  This youth hotel has such a necessary service in our age as free Wi-Fi.  At the 24-hour reception staff speak excellent English.  The hotel also has a left-luggage office, a small library, and a laundry room.  Near the hotel there is a small parking place for scooters.  Parking is free for guests.  There is a safe at the reception where guests of the Standard rooms can put valuables. </p><p>  For a fee, you can make photocopies, send a fax and do similar business operations.  The hotel has a currency exchange office.  At your request, the reception staff will order tickets and excursions, call a taxi for you, and wake you up at the indicated time.  Attention: upon checking into the hotel, a deposit of approximately 1000 rubles will be charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cybevasion.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Savasdi Pattaya&quot; - service" class="if uuid-3216161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216161.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It takes about 8 minutes to get to the coast from Savasdi Pattaya Hotel.  But the city beach is not at all like a Bounty ad.  The sea is muddy, the sand is dirty, there are a lot of people.  For a good beach vacation, people go either to North and South Pattaya, or to the nearest islands.  Fortunately, transportation in the city is cheap.  So, here is a selection of good beaches.  North of Pattaya City are Naklua Beach and Dongtan Beach.  On the last beach, gays like to gather. </p><p>  In the south, a good sea and a gentle entry into the water you will find on Jomtien Beach and Pratumnak.  At 7 kilometers from Pattaya is the island of Koh Lan.  Both cheap ferries and more expensive high-speed boats go to him.  Koh Lan is surrounded by smaller islets.  Among them, Ko-Sak and Ko-Krok should be highlighted.  Considering that almost all Pattaya vacationers leave daily for the main island, for privacy you need to look for the coast on these rocks.  A fast boat will take us to Koh Phai in half an hour.  This "Coconut Island" has not yet been affected by civilization, and the beaches there are like on brochures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Beach" class="if uuid-3216175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3216175.jpg"></div><h2>  General reviews </h2><p>  Savasdi Pattaya is a two star hotel.  And this must be clearly understood when booking a room in it.  Then you will enjoy your stay at the hotel.  Do not wait for lobsters for breakfast and a spacious veranda with in-room jacuzzi.  Tourists say the hotel is just great for its price.  It is suitable for young people who come to hang out on Walking Street. </p>
