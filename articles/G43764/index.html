    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  People lived here at least 1000 years ago.  This is evidenced by the Armenian monastery and the fortress of Kaygador 11th century BC.  e.  In the Middle Ages, the village was called Provato - here the Genoese built a port.  After the October Revolution, certain parts of its modern territory were called Dvukhakornym and Failure.  In 1937, the village was given the current name in honor of the famous Georgian Bolshevik.  Locals came up with a shortened version - Orjo.  And in 2007, the authorities even wanted to rename it to Zurbagan. </p><h2>  City Ordzhonikidze, Crimea.  Sightseeing: Wonderful Nature </h2><p>  The village is located on the shores of two bays - Provato and Dvuyakornoy.  Therefore, it is protected from large waves, storms often bypass this area.  It is connected by a thin isthmus to Cape Kyik-Atlam, from which at a distance of several tens of meters there is a tiny island of Ivan Baba.  From above it seems that a piece of land simply broke away from the mainland, although, probably, it was so. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ordzhonikidze (Crimea): attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1400313.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to such a picturesque location of the village, rest in Ordzhonikidze will not be monotonous and boring.  Each beach has its own panorama.  For example, from the banks of the Dyakornoy Bay you can see Theodosius, and from the opposite side - Koktebel.  Especially in the evening it is nice to watch the flickering of lights in nearby cities. </p><p>  And these are just some of the attractions of Ordzhonikidze.  What to visit first?  Probably better to start from the coast. </p><h2>  Sights of Ordzhonikidze, Crimea: picturesque beaches </h2><p>  The village is located in an ecologically clean area, there are no enterprises and ports that pollute the environment.  Therefore, the main value and, in combination with the sights of Ordzhonikidze (Crimea), are almost virgin nature, steep cliffs, heady air and amazingly clear water. </p><p>  And the beaches here are for every taste.  Most are pebbled, in particular Agate, Under the Horseback Saddle, Under the Ferris Bridge, Lavash and Krasnyachka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ordzhonikidze (Crimea): attractions and description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32211/1400263.jpg"></div>  Sand is the central beach of the town, which stretches along the promenade.  It is perfectly equipped: cafes, restaurants and other attributes of a comfortable stay are present here.  But if you want to stay away from the noisy crowd of vacationers, you need to get to the recreation center "Donbass" or to the First Cape.  This area is more distant and no less picturesque.  If stones are preferred, then such a coast can be found between the "Krasnyachka" and the cottages.
