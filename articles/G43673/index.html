Photos of the sights of Bangkok, namely this park, can only be done in the car, for the reasons listed above. </p><p>  The second part is the tropics, in which many birds are walking.

All these cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãare not only an object of tourist pilgrimage, but also a subject of pride and veneration by local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Royal Palace in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2371740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371740.jpg"></div><p>  More often than others, the following Bangkok attractions are of interest to tourists, photos and descriptions of which are presented below: </p><ul><li>  upper residence; </li><li>  Temple of the Emerald Buddha; </li><li>  weapons museum; </li><li>  Queen Sirikit Textile Museum; </li><li>  pavilion of regalia. </li></ul><p>  Throughout the territory, a slight chime is heard.

But this is made up for by the abundance of outlets where you can purchase postcards and other souvenir products. </p><p>  To visit the Grand Palace, you must adhere to the required dress code.  But if you do not meet it, then it is easy to fix it with the help of rental clothing.  The Grand Palace is unique and unforgettable. </p><h2>  Wellness amusement park "Dream World" </h2><p>  Dream World is <span>a landmark in</span> Bangkok.  It will be difficult to get around it in 1 day.  These are recreational and recreational attractions that immerse people in childhood.  As well as the restoration of human health for several years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thailandtravel.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dream World in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2371744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371744.jpg"></div><p>  All the inhabitants of the planet have heard of amusement parks.  But not everyone knows that in Bangkok there is a "Dream World. </p><p>  You can feel a surge of energy only by going to the territory of attractions and seeing the beauty.  Only here at the equator can you feel the snow and its touch.  A person understands that fresh air improves immunity, and therefore health.  The child knows that games are a sport, which means it‚Äôs easy to protect yourself from diseases. </p><h2>  Park Attractions </h2><p>  The park is divided into four zones: </p><ul><li>  Dream World (souvenir shops are located at the entrance); </li><li>  "Garden of Joy" (there is a wonderful lake, several attractions where everyone will enjoy nature); </li><li>  "World of Fantasy" (an area with entertaining plots and scenery of fairy tales, arranged in the fresh air); </li><li>  "Adventure Land" (many different attractions have been built, where you can plunge into the world of childhood). </li></ul><h2>  Health rides help </h2><p>  Rides well help people's health.  Entertainment provides a healthy body through the activation of certain hormones.  Slides, geysers installed in the pools, contribute to the activation of endorphins (hormones of joy) in the body.  Frequent visits help improve blood circulation and promote metabolism.  You can even get rid of fullness and cure insomnia.  Water massage slows down aging and rejuvenates the skin.  The main health facilities that cheer up: </p><ul><li>  waterslides; </li><li>  geysers; </li><li>  water massage; </li><li>  counterflow. </li></ul><p>  Visiting the "World of Dreams", it seems that you have visited a paradise. </p><h2>  Temple of the Golden Buddha - one of the main attractions of Bangkok </h2><p>  Thailand has many interesting places to visit.  But their greatest concentration, of course, is in the capital of the country. </p><p>  The landmark of Bangkok is located on the Tri Mit Street, near the train station.  It is in great demand among tourists.  The architecture and structure of the temple's decorations are unique, but the statue of a seated Buddha is of the greatest value and interest.  It is made of gold, the pupils are made of sapphires, and the squirrels are made of pearls.  The weight of the statue is 5.5 tons, height 3 meters.  The estimated cost is estimated at 250 million dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bangkokculturaltours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of the Golden Buddha" class="if uuid-2372243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2372243.jpg"></div><p>  It was estimated that the Golden Buddha was built during the kingdom of Sukhothai (1238-1438).  But there are no written records of its origin.  In the eighteenth century, the Buddha was completely covered with gypsum, so that the enemy army, which invaded during the struggle against Burma, considered this an ordinary statue.  The trick worked too well.  The secret has been forgotten for centuries.  No one knows the true reason for hiding.  It was assumed that the statue was closed immediately before the Burmese invasion in the middle of the 18th century in order to hide its true value from the enemy. </p><p>  In 1955, while the ‚Äúcement‚Äù statue was lifted into her new home, the ropes could not stand it and the sculpture fell.  The next day, the surprised monk saw gold, where a piece of gypsum was chipped.  Then the remaining cover was removed and a golden statue was found. </p><h2>  Patpong Night Market </h2><p>  Patpong Night Market is one of Bangkok's attractions that is worth a visit.  After dusk, from 18:00 to 1:00, the night bazaar begins its work.  A couple of hours before the opening, the locals mount the counters, spread the goods, work on the lighting. </p><p>  On the market you can find everything that you want: a large number of souvenirs, jewelry, watches, clothes, exotic goods that you will not find in Europe, for example, stingray leather bags, crocodile leather products, python.  The market is full of sellers promoting fake brand and designer products, and bars and clubs in the area offer sex shows and girls for one night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vacations.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patpong night market in bangkok" class="if uuid-2371755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371755.jpg"></div><p>  Travel guides used to warn people of the many scams associated with sex shows, such as intimidating bouncers who insist on high pay.  These frauds have been largely eradicated.  It is hard to imagine that the girls who are being sold are not victims of poverty. </p><p>  The fact that Rolex, Apple, Gucci and many other companies, with fairly well-known names, have a large number of copies is not hidden.  There are fake iPods and iPads.  There are Gucci and Fendi bags.  Rolex and Breitling watches and much more are on this market. </p><p>  The quality of fake goods is very different.  Some of the products are meticulous copies demonstrating the undoubted skill of Thai craftsmen.  Some watches look exactly like real ones.  You need to bargain, because there are no price tags, and sellers inflate prices.  It is best to defiantly leave and pretend disinterest.  The price can be brought down to 2, or even 3 times. </p><h2>  Temple of the Reclining Buddha </h2><p>  The temple was built in the XII century.  He was noticed in 1782 when the self-proclaimed King Rama I began to develop the territory of Rattanakosin Island.  He became the founder of the new dynasty of Thailand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.virtuallynomadic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2371757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371757.jpg"></div><p>  The largest architectural complex in Bangkok is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 80 thousand square meters.  m. The main attraction of this building is a statue of Buddha, waiting for nirvana, which impresses with its size.  Its length reaches 46 meters and a height of 15 meters. </p><p>  Interesting information for visitors to the complex: </p><ul><li>  Tourists studying the statue bypass it counterclockwise. </li><li>  Also in the temple are other Buddha statues, large and small, gold and gilded, more than a thousand. </li><li>  To attract good luck, tourists throw coins into bronze vessels installed along the walls in the vihar of the Reclining Buddha. </li><li>  Throwing a coin, you can make a wish.  The number of desires corresponds to the number of coins thrown. </li><li>  On the territory of the unique temple complex there is a pond with a waterfall, a park, monks' dwellings, outbuildings and a Thai massage school, where anyone can massage and undergo training in this craft. </li></ul><p>  The rules for visiting the temple are based on respect for the shrine: before the temple, you need to take off your shoes and cover your shoulders and legs. </p><h2>  Temple of the Emerald Buddha </h2><p>  In Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, a huge number of attractions, one of which is the temple of the "Emerald Buddha."  It is believed that this building is one of the most sacred places in the whole Kingdom.  It is visited not only by tourists, but also by a huge number of local residents.  It is located in the heart of Bangkok, on the territory of the Grand Royal Palace, and is considered to be one of the most popular and visited places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thrillophilia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2371759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371759.jpg"></div><p>  Going deep into the history of the construction of this temple, it turns out that the construction began in 1784.  However, the Buddha statue, which is now in it, was born earlier.  According to one legend, this statue was discovered in the 15th century, in a stupa destroyed by a thunderstorm.  From above it was covered with gypsum or clay, but one monk saw that a green stone was visible from under the upper layer.  From here the name ‚ÄúEmerald Buddha‚Äù came, while the statue itself was erected from jadeite. </p><p>  The statue, for the entire time of its existence, visited various cities, but in 1778 returned to its homeland.  By the decision of the king, it was decided to erect Wat Phra Kaew - the temple of the "Emerald Buddha", as the locals call it, for this statue, which will also serve as the personal temple of the ruler. </p><p>  There are some interesting facts about the Temple of the Emerald Buddha: </p><ul><li>  the entrance to the temple is guarded by twelve bronze statues of lions, as well as other mythical characters who are designed to scare away evil spirits from it; </li><li>  only the king or his heir is allowed to touch the statue of Buddha himself; </li><li>  three times a year, the king himself changes clothes on the statue to attract good luck in the new season: summer, winter or rainy season. </li></ul><h2>  Siam ocean world </h2><p>  The Siam Ocean World Aquarium is not just one of the huge aquariums in Southeast Asia.  This is a real aqua tale, which begins at the box office.  Where in anticipation of the line, you can pass the time, looking and taking pictures with large, bright and colorful figures and images of marine life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.activityfan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Siam Ocean World aquarium in Bangkok" class="if uuid-2371760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/2371760.jpg"></div><p>  There you can familiarize yourself with the feeding schedule for the inhabitants of the aquariums and plan in advance the route and time spent in thematic sections.  The oceanarium is divided into seven sectors: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúMiraculous and unidentified‚Äù; </li><li>  "Deep reef"; </li><li>  "Ocean Life"; </li><li>  "Rocky coast"; </li><li>  "A tropical forest"; </li><li>  "Tunnel"; </li><li>  "Jellyfish." </li></ul><p>  Tourists also have access to a boat expedition with a transparent bottom, a contact aquarium for the youngest visitors, and a backstage tour.  All showrooms are decorated differently, according to the stated topics.  Aquariums in them of various shapes and sizes, which allows a detailed examination of their inhabitants. </p><p> An indelible impression leaves the process of feeding sharks.  Jellyfish fluttering in the rays of color music, will not leave anyone indifferent.  The thrill is made to experience the room with a transparent floor, where right under your feet, behind the thickness of the protective glass, fish swim.  The oceanarium also has a cafe and a children's room.  There is a place to take a breath from overwhelming emotions, and with new powers to plunge into the sea world. </p><h2>  Wat Yan Nava </h2><p>  Wat Yan Nava is a famous Buddhist temple complex located in Bangkok.
