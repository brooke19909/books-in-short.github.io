This death was a great loss for him.  Not inclined to express emotions, and even more so to colorful turns of speech, the young revolutionary no longer spoke of the cold stone that entered his heart.  Who knows how world history would have developed if this icy and solid object had not crushed the breasts of the future leader of the largest country in the world?  However, the <span>subjunctive mood is</span> alien to this science. </p>

    <p>  From his beloved wife, his son, Jacob, was still a baby.  Father had no time to educate him, he found other things.  The boy grew up with his grandmother, the mother of Catherine (Kato) in Tbilisi, then studied in Moscow - first at school, and then at school, for electrical engineering.  It is difficult to describe the relationship between son and father; very little evidence has been preserved of them.  Facts indicate a failed suicide attempt due to <span>unhappy love.</span>  A shot in the chest was angrily condemned by Jacob's father, he was actually refused home. </p><p>  It is hard to say whether the Soviet dictator loved the eldest son.  The whole country admired the courage of Stalin, who refused to save the senior lieutenant Dzhugashvili who was captured near Vitebsk and practically condemned him to death.  On the other hand, all the years after the death of his son, the leader of the world communist movement wore a black T-shirt under his tunic as a sign of mourning, hidden, like so much in his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Stalin's second wife, Nadezhda Sergeevna Alliluyeva, was fifteen years younger than her husband.  The daughter of a professional revolutionary, she was captivated by the image of a romantic fighter who returned from exile after the February Revolution.  She was then only sixteen, and the future Secretary General of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B.) - thirty-eight. </p><p>  <span>Active life position,</span> inexperience, naivety and a tendency to revolutionary romanticism annoyed her husband, seeking power and power. </p><p>  Her personal modesty went to extremes - many colleagues and heads of organizations in which Nadezhda Alliluyeva worked, did not even know that she was Stalin's wife.  They even wanted to expel her from the party in 1921, accusing her of passivity and anarcho-syndicalism (then it was fashionable to hang all kinds of "isms" on a person), but her husband intervened.  But Nadyusha worked not somewhere, but in the secretariat of Lenin, ‚ÄúPravda‚Äù and the editorial staff of ‚ÄúRevolution and Culture‚Äù, and even studied at the Promacademy.  There, too, neither teachers nor students knew that Stalin's wife was next to them. </p>

    <p>  They had two children, son Vasily in 1921, and daughter Svetlana in 1926.  More is known about the life of the second family of Joseph Vissarionovich than about the first.  This was made possible thanks to the book ‚ÄúTwenty Letters to a Friend,‚Äù published in 1967 in the West.  The daughter of the Kremlin dictator revealed many secrets and described her life in detail. </p><p>  Stalin's second wife committed suicide under mysterious circumstances after a Voroshilov banquet on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the October Revolution.  At the table, the husband behaved rudely, and perhaps this provoked suicide.  There were several versions of the events, from the involvement of Nadezhda Alliluyeva in the anti-government conspiracy, to the constant painful migraines, but the truth can no longer be found. </p><p>  A monument was erected on the grave of Stalin‚Äôs wife, very beautiful and expressive.  In addition to the name, surname and dates, party affiliation is indicated on it: "member of the CPSU (b)." </p>
