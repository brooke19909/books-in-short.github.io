    <p>  Ever since school, this inventor began to seriously get involved in chemistry and physics.  He did not lose interest in these sciences in adulthood.  His father created for him a small laboratory in which he conducted his experiments for many years, and this was not in vain, because the most famous Nobel invention received worldwide fame almost instantly. </p><p>  It should be noted that Alfred was primarily interested in <span>explosives.</span>  He worked with nitroglycerin, trying to tame it.  The main problem over which he struggled for a long time was the manufacture of a detonator.  But this turned out to be quite solvable - a metal capsule pre-filled with mercury did an excellent job.  So, from a mixture of nitroglycerin and a number of organic substances, the most famous Nobel invention, called dynamite, was obtained. </p>

The scientist mixed nitroglycerin with absorbent materials - the result was a powder that exploded only after a special detonator detonated.  As soon as Nobel‚Äôs invention was patented, he immediately offered to use it for Swedish railroad workers as a means for tunneling.  Dynamite proved to be excellent from the very first days: it was with the help of directed explosions that tunnels were created in the mountains, river beds were cleared, channels were created.

Although he did not want the glory of a "blood merchant," as his contemporaries called him, and was an opponent of wars, but dynamite gained the greatest popularity precisely when used in military operations.  This was one of the reasons why the inventor instituted an international award.  As you know, she celebrates world achievements in science, literature and activities aimed at <span>strengthening peace.</span> </p><p>  A few years after the planet was presented with the most famous Nobel invention, the genius was able to surpass himself and made an even more powerful explosive - smokeless gunpowder called ballistite. </p>

Although in total for life <span>Alfred Nobel has</span> filed 355 patents.  But he was not engaged exclusively in scientific activity, he owned 93 companies, which were located in 20 countries of the world.  In total, they produced 66.5 tons of various explosives annually.
