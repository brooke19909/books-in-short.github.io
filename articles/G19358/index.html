But time passes, and part of the knowledge is forgotten.  Ask someone ten or twenty years after graduation, the questions about the name of science, which studies the development of human society, is not a fact that you will get an answer.  And he is simple to impossibility: her name is history.  Let us consider it in more depth, refresh general information, analyze what role science plays in the development of society, approaches to its research and study, and a number of other issues.  After all, those who remember the story are very difficult to manage. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

She was equated with art and literature.  Initially, the task of history was to glorify various rulers and stories about their affairs.  For this, chronicles, annals and biographies were written on parchments and papyrus.  In ancient Greek mythology, the muse of history was Clio.  Her name comes from the word ‚Äúglorify‚Äù, which gives us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits then importance.  Contemporary world historical literature seeks to give impartial assessments.  But people write it, so this is not always a success.  There is no consensus on the subject of history.  <span>This science</span> of <span>social development</span> has about 30 definitions.  In many ways, the worldview of a person and his philosophical views influence the thoughts.  Also, history is a <span>science about the laws of the</span> development of society.  It allows you to take into account the mistakes of the past in order to act more effectively now and in the future.

If a person who is in a materialistic position is engaged in it, then it is believed that history studies certain patterns of development, which are limited by some kind of spatio-temporal framework.  In the Marxist approach, much attention is paid to labor, methods of production and the implementation of economic activity.  In addition, they consider various historical conditions, such as relations between different countries, class struggle, geographical and other studies.  There is also a pluralistic approach to the study of processes.  He does not recognize the existence of a common cause of development in human history, but he holds the idea that many different factors acted on society.  They, in turn, are regulated by different social groups and organizations.

So, the research uses the scientific apparatus and certain categories.  The most important of the latter is the concept of ‚Äúhistorical time‚Äù.  In this category, an arbitrary event is characterized in terms of time and place of action.  History as a process is seen as a movement between different events.  Also, this science, which studies the development of human society, works exclusively with facts.  They form the basis of knowledge.  It is on them that all concepts and ideas are based.  An understanding of historical reality and the development process largely depends on the reliability of the facts.  Therefore, let us give them special attention.

The meaning of the content depends on the ideological, theoretical and general scientific views.  Therefore, the influence of science on the development of society should not be underestimated.  After all, a person forms a science and falls under the influence of feedback.  Does this mean that it is impossible to achieve historical truth?  No, it is not.  People's ideas about the truth are changing.  Science develops from incomplete or relative awareness to a more perfect and accurate form of data presentation.  But you should not count on absolute truth.  After all, as long as society exists, the last chapter of history has not yet been written. </p><h2>  Sources </h2>

Therefore, let us find out what a science is that studies the development of human society from a research point of view.  Initially, it should be noted that the term ‚Äúhistory‚Äù has two interpretations.  The first is used to denote the development process in time (of an individual or the whole society).  The second meaning has incorporated science, which explores all the nuances and aspects of this process.  Of great importance in this matter are local features of the development of the state.  Also, do not miss the development of civilization.  By this, several aspects can be understood.  So, ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù can be used as a synonym for the word ‚Äúculture‚Äù.  This term is also used to denote the stage of social development, as well as the formed spiritual and material culture.

The rulers of countries with its help can foresee many mistakes and avoid them, people will not allow fools to power, which can destroy many social mechanisms.  Of course, for a full-fledged personality formation, only history is not enough.  But it can become a good foundation.  It is enough to recall that their parents tell their young children about the past, not only their own, but also their grandfathers, grandmothers and other relatives.  From these stories, the younger generation draws knowledge on how to behave in society, what interaction models are acceptable - and much more.  Even if there is no desire to go into politics, then you should know the story.  At least in order to know about the harbingers of troubles and, if necessary, make every effort so that the problems do not affect the state, and with it the person.
