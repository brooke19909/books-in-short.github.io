    <h2>  History of improvement and development </h2><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, with the light hand of the Nikitin brothers, residents of Ryazan were presented with a priceless jewel of circus art.  <span>This trend</span> came from countries that were part of the Old World. </p><p>  Thanks to the work of Dmitry, Akim and Peter, the Ryazan State Circus became the stage for the most famous circus artists of that time.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, A. Durov showed his number here, which at that time was not yet known as widely as happened later.  The performance was dedicated to dog training.  It was distinguished by cheerfulness, originality and was infinitely sweet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  G. Yakovlev also passed through the Ryazan circus in the twenties of the last century.  He was the holder of competitions in the French wrestling, was engaged in the construction of a summer boardwalk circus.  In the late twenties and early thirties this institution was rented by artists from a wide variety of groups.  The Ryazan circus also received participants from the Spartak labor collective. </p><p>  With the advent of this entertainment institution, its popularity, as well as that of the whole sphere of art, grew by leaps and bounds.  In winter, in the early seventies, a completely renewed entertainment complex was opened, the foundation was laid, a building was built for 1.7 thousand spectators.  The Ryazan State Circus is part of the Rosgosirc Circus, which is owned by a company of state art institutions. </p>
