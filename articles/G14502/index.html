    <h2>  Outboard motor principle </h2><p>  Outboard water-jet <span>boat motor</span> works almost the same as a screw.  The driveshaft is present in this scheme.  However, he now rotates not the screw, but the impeller.  This is a kind of impeller, thanks to which the pump and the main element of the system, which ensures the operation of the engine, begin to work. </p><p>  Thanks to the pump, water is quickly pumped into the motor, and then it is more intensively blown back.  As a result of this, a reaction force appears.  The boat simply pushes away from the water and gradually moves forward.  If necessary, the deflector can be switched on the engine.  As a result, water begins to be pumped in the opposite direction, so that the ship begins to move backward. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jet nozzles on boat motors" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1081594.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Water-jet <span>outboard motor</span> has several advantages that distinguish it from a wide range of similar products.  To understand the main advantages of these engine models, it is worth comparing them with screw systems.  Among the main advantages of jet engines it is worth highlighting: </p><ol><li>  Durability and reliability.  Boating in water bodies where a rocky and shallow bottom, as well as in shallows and shallow waters, leads to damage to parts of screw engines.  The water-jet outboard motor copes with any sections of water bodies perfectly and at the same time its integrity is not violated.  After all, all the operating elements of the system are located inside a sufficiently strong housing and are closed with a special filter grill.  This protects engine parts from damage.  In addition, most of the components of modern models are made of high-strength alloys of titanium, aluminum and stainless steel. </li><li>  Safety of use.  The jet boat engine is designed so that the system is completely safe for everyone who is not only in the boat, but also in the pond.  The screw motor, when used, can touch the diver and cause severe damage to his health.  Water jet system in this regard is completely safe. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="outboard jet engine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1081590.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  A jet boat engine, like any unit, has not only advantages, but also disadvantages, among which it is worth highlighting: </p><ol><li>  Performance and power.  Water-jet outboard motor has less power than a screw.  This is due to the smaller impeller diameter than the rotor of a conventional motor.  In addition, when the screw unit is operating, a high turbulence indicator is observed.  It also affects the power level.  The difference of the last indicator is from 20 to 30%, and not in favor of the <span>water-jet engine.</span> </li><li>  Cost.  This is another drawback that has a jet boat engine.  To significantly increase the power of the unit, manufacturers use power heads made of an expensive alloy.  As a result, this significantly increases the cost of the jet engine. </li></ol><h2>  Jet nozzles on boat motors </h2><p>  What to do if a screw engine has already been installed on the boat?  In this case, you can use water jet nozzles.  Similar accessories can be installed in those places where the <span>propeller,</span> and also a reducer fastens.  Today you can buy jet nozzles for almost any model of the boat engine and even for those that have already served for more than one year.  When choosing accessories, it is worth considering the design features of the units. </p>
