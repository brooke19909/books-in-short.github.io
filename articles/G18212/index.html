It is one of the 48 constellations that Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer, documented in the 2nd century.  The Romans called it the Flying Vulture. </p><p>  The constellation Eagle is located in the Milky Way.  It is surrounded by the constellations of Little Horse, Dolphin, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Hercules, Shield and Arrow.  You can easily recognize it by three bright stars, which are almost in a straight line on the left shoulder, back and neck of a huge bird.  The constellation Eagle in the sky covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã652.5 square meters.  degrees.  It includes 119 stars that are visible to the naked eye. </p><h2>  Eagle constellation observation </h2><p>  Above the horizon above all, the constellation Eagle is in August and September at night.  It was at this time that it was most convenient to observe it.  On a moonless and clear night, up to 70 stars can be seen with the naked eye in this constellation.  Of these, 8 are brighter than the 4th magnitude. </p><h2>  The brightest star </h2><p>  <span>The brightest star</span> in the constellation Eagle is Altair, it is attributed to stars of the 1st magnitude.  If you mentally connect its lines with the celestial bodies located near it, you get a figure that resembles a soaring eagle with spread wings.  Not only the Greeks saw this bird of prey, but also the Arabs, who gave it the name "Altair" (that is, "flying"). </p>

    <p>  Altair (the constellation of the Eagle) is one of the stars closest to our planet.  Only 16 light years is the distance from her from us.  That is why she looks so bright.  However, its dimensions are only 2 times the size of the Sun.  Its radiation is 8 times more intense than that of the sun.  Altair approaches Earth at a speed of 26 km / s, but only after 12 thousand years it will be at a distance of 15 light years from our planet, that is, only 1 light year will approach Earth.  Altair together with the beta and gamut of the Eagle forms the body of the constellation Eagle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beta, gamma, zeta, eta, epsilon and delta constellations </h2><p>  At a distance of about 44.7 light-years from our planet is the beta constellation of the Eagle.  Its <span>apparent magnitude</span> is 3.71.  The gamma of this constellation is a huge <span>yellow-orange star.</span>  Its apparent magnitude is 2, 72. Zeta is a triple stellar system.  Eta is a yellow-white supergiant, 3 thousand times brighter than the Sun.  This is one of the most striking Cepheids that can be seen with the naked eye.  The epsilon of this constellation is a triple <span>star system.</span>  An orange giant leads her.  The atmosphere of this K-type giant is barium.  The delta of the constellation that interests us is a triple star system.  Her main celestial body is an F-type subgiant.  You will find all this by looking at the constellation Oryol, the scheme of which is presented above. </p><h2>  Zeus fight against father, help of Prometheus </h2>

    <p>  An arrow is a small cluster of stars located in the Milky Way.  Mythology connects the constellation Eagle with the fate of Prometheus Strela.  Many books are being published for children today, in which you can read the retelling of the myth of Prometheus.  This story is really interesting, and not just for children.  Recall it briefly. </p><p>  When Zeus matured, he began a fight against Kronos, his father, in order to gain power over Earth and Sky.  This struggle was persistent and long, since the mighty titans were on the side of Kronos.  They Zeus metal deafening thunder and fire lightning.  Having called for the help of the hecatonheirs, hundred-armed, huge as mountains, he still defeated the titans, sending them to the gloomy Tartarus.  Only one of them - Prometheus - did not fight against Zeus.  On the contrary, he helped him in the struggle, and also convinced Themis, his mother, and the goddess Gaia to go over to his side.  Prometheus therefore could live among the gods on Olympus.  He was allowed to descend to Earth whenever he wanted. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prometheus decision to help people </h2><p>  However, the continuous feasts of the gods on Olympus and their carefree life were not attracted to Prometheus.  He descended to Earth and decided to stay among people and help them.  At the sight of how miserable the inhabitants of the planet, his heart was breaking from pain - they froze in holes and caves, they did not have fire, they died from numerous diseases and had to defend themselves from wild animals.  Prometheus decided that if people had fire, they would not be so unhappy.  However, Zeus forbade him to give fire to people, because he was afraid that people would take away from the gods the power over the world. </p><h2>  Prometheus is changing people's lives for the better </h2>

    <p>  Prometheus realized what awaited him in case of violation of the ban of Zeus.  Nevertheless, he could not calmly observe the suffering and distress of people.  He decided to steal fire from the forge of Hephaestus, then gave it to the people.  Prometheus taught them how to use fire. </p><p>  People‚Äôs life quickly changed for the better.  They stopped freezing in the caves, no longer ate raw meat, but began to cook their own food.  However, not only fire gave Prometheus to people.  He taught them to mine ore in the bowels of the earth, to melt them on fire and to obtain various metals, from which they then make plows and tools.  Prometheus taught to tame wild horses and bulls, harness them and cultivate the land with their help.  He also tamed wild goats and sheep and gave them to people so that they could use meat and milk for food, and animal skins for clothes.  In addition, Prometheus taught people to heal diseases. </p><h2>  Zeus Wrath </h2>

    <p>  Zeus, of course, was angry at the naughty titan.  The servants of this god Prometheus shackled in heavy chains.  They took him to the Caucasus - to the very edge of the Earth.  From here, rocky peaks rose to the clouds, and neither a tree nor a blade of grass grew on the seashore.  Only formidable cliffs were everywhere, on which the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves</span> with a deafening roar rained down their fury. </p><p>  Hephaestus came here by order of Zeus and chained Prometheus to the cliff with an iron hammer.  He hammered an iron tip into his chest.  So many centuries have passed. </p><h2>  Oceans visit Prometheus </h2><p>  Once the sea waves subsided.  On the golden chariots with a breeze, the oceans, the daughter of the Ocean, came to Prometheus.  Hesion, one of them, was the wife of this titan.  The wise Ocean himself appeared on the winged chariot behind them.  He wanted to persuade Prometheus to make peace with an angry god, but he did not want to hear about it.  Only Prometheus knew the secret about what exactly threatens his power on the planet. </p><h2>  Titan immersed in darkness </h2><p>  Once Hermes, the messenger of the gods, rushed to find out the secret fate of Zeus.  However, Prometheus was adamant.  Then Zeus brought down thunder and lightning on a rock with Prometheus, and she collapsed into eternal darkness.  After millennia, God decided to raise the naughty titan from the darkness and subject him to severe suffering.  The rays of Helios burned his body, the rock heated white-hot in the summer heat.  Rains and hail whipped on his emaciated body, and in winter snow fell in flakes. </p><h2>  Eagle pecking the liver of Prometheus </h2>

    <p>  Zeus every day, when Helios appeared on a fiery chariot in the sky, sent his huge eagle to Prometheus.  The eagle, noisy with powerful wings, flew up to the rock.  He sat prometheus on his chest.  With his sharp claws, he tore the titan's chest and pecked his liver.  Blood poured in streams, staining the rock.  The eagle flew away only when Helios on his lap descended to the Ocean in the west.  The wounds of Prometheus healed overnight, the liver grew, but the next morning everything repeated.  For 30 thousand years this torment continued. </p><h2>  Hercules frees Prometheus </h2><p>  Themis, his mother, once came to the titan.  She begged Prometheus to come to terms with Zeus and tell him her secret.  However, titanium remained adamant.  He knew that a hero called to put an end to his torment was already born.  It was Hercules, who went around many countries, delivered people from many monsters and disasters.  He finally came to the far end of the earth.  Hercules, standing in front of the rock, looked at Prometheus, chained to her, and listened to his story. </p>

    <p>  Suddenly there was the sound of wings, a huge eagle appeared in the sky above.  He was already preparing to attack the titan.  Hercules took the bow and lowered the bowstring.  The arrow whistled and pierced the eagle.  He fell stone in the sea.  Hermes, the messenger of Zeus, rushed from Olympus.  He turned to Prometheus and promised the Titan release if he agrees to reveal a secret, how Zeus can escape an evil fate.  Finally, Prometheus agreed and said that the thunder god should not marry Thetis, the sea goddess, since the gods of fate decided that she would give birth to a son who would be more powerful than his father. </p><p>  Hercules broke the shackles of Prometheus and tore the iron tip from his chest.  In summer nights, today Hercules is visible in the sky.  He looks at the bloodthirsty Eagle, and the Arrow is above him.  There is not only Prometheus in heaven, but people will never forget the one who gave them knowledge and fire - tools against the power of the gods. </p>

    <h2>  The legend of Prometheus in art and literature </h2><p>  It is with this story that mythology connects the constellation Eagle.  The legend presented above is very famous today.  In art and literature, it is especially popular.  Aeschylus, for example, created a number of tragedies associated with the name of the great titan: ‚ÄúChained Prometheus‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrometheus the Fire-Bearer‚Äù, ‚ÄúReleased Prometheus‚Äù.  Aristophanes wrote the comedy "Birds", Stocks - the tragedy "Prometheus."  The humanistic features of this image of a martyr rebel were developed in poetry (Shelley, Byron, Ogarev, Gauthier, Shevchenko and others), in music (Scriabin, Liszt, etc.), fine art (Gordeev, Titian, etc.).  In the drama Enlightenment Calderon, as well as in the <span>works of Beethoven</span> and Goethe reflected a late antique version of this myth.  Prometheus in it acts as the creator of the people whom he fashioned from the earth. </p><h2>  Festival "Eagle Constellation" </h2><p>  In Orel, annually, in November, a festival takes place named after this amazing constellation.  Performers and creative groups from Russia and abroad participate in it.  "Eagle Constellation" is a competition of pop vocal, pop and fashion theaters, choreography for talented young people from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Indonesia.  There are 4 age groups - up to 6 years old, from 7 to 11 years old, from 12 to 15 years old and from 16 to 25 years old.  This competition over the past years has come a long way in becoming and has become a truly exciting show.  It gathers more and more spectators and participants, including due to its bright, memorable name. </p>
