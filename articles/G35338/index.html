About 110 thousand inhabitants live here.  The city is over 2000 years old, making it one of the oldest in Germany.  His name comes from the Latin concept of Confluentes, meaning "merging."  So it was named due to its location - on the territory of the rivers - the Rhine and the Moselle. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  At first it was a fortified camp, which was founded by the famous Roman commander Germanicus.  But then the Romans built on this site a solid fortress with 19 towers. </p><p>  In the V century, the city became part of the state of the Franks - the largest and most powerful kingdom of Europe, uniting almost the entire territory of today's France and Germany.  The city already had a royal palace, and after the adoption of Christianity by the Franks, the first churches were built. </p><h2>  Koblenz Attractions </h2><p>  The Basilica of St. Castor is the dominant city temple, founded in 836.  The remains of the monk of St. Castor were brought to the built temple in 837, and from that time the saint was named the patron saint of the city.  The basilica was often completed and rebuilt - at first it was a Romanesque basilica, then a classic cathedral in the Gothic style.  It was completely completed by the middle of the 15th century.  In the XX century, the temple was destroyed during the Second World War.  The current building is a historical reconstruction reconstructed in the post-war period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XIV century, the city built a bridge over the Moselle, which today has become another attraction.  <span>The stone bridge,</span> built in the XIV century, has been perfectly preserved to this day. </p><p>  Another interesting attraction is the stone fountain, erected here by Napoleon in honor of the future victory over Russia.  Victory did not happen, but the fountain remained. </p><p>  The Rhine and Moselle at the confluence form an acute angle, a scythe called the “German Corner” or the “German Triangle”.  This is the most important and most popular place in the city, it is a pointed triangular ledge of the promenade, decorated with a majestic statue of <span>William the First</span> on horseback, the emperor of a united Germany. </p>

    <p>  In 1945, the statue was destroyed.  After the war ended, this place began to symbolize the revival of Germany: there was a memorial sign surrounded by flags of all regions of Germany, and only by 1993 the monument to Wilhelm was completely restored.  Today it is also a cultural monument, included in the UNESCO list. </p><p>  Another noteworthy place is the Ehrenbreitstein fortress, built in the 10th century.  By the XIX century, the building of the fortress was almost completely rebuilt, and before the creation of modern heavy artillery, it was one of the most powerful fortifications in Europe.  Today, there is a museum that tells about the history of the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists should visit a large private museum dedicated to the famous composer Beethoven.  Germany, Koblenz is the birthplace of his mother, the house where she was born is preserved here.  The museum has a rich exhibition, as well as completely restored interiors of the middle of the XVIII century, which Germany is so rich in.  Koblenz is a city with many attractions that are must see and visit.  However, this can be said of every city in this country. </p><h2>  Modern germany </h2>

    <p>  Koblenz is one of the important centers of tourism in the west of the country.  The main building is executed in the Baroque style: the city was almost completely rebuilt after the difficult <span>Thirty Years War of the</span> 17th century, and then reconstructed after the Second World War.  But it has Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque churches, an old university building. </p><p>  The city has many funny monuments.  For example, the Joker fountain is a bronze figure, spitting water every few minutes. </p><p>  Many river routes along the Rhine leave from Koblenz, on the coast of which there are many beautiful castles.  The streets are peaceful and cozy, there are many souvenir stalls, shops, restaurants and bars.  It is worth tasting the local wines.  The city is located at the junction of two large wine regions of Germany. </p>
