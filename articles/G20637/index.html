    <p>  Payment of a loan "Home Credit" can be made at the box office of the bank itself.  This operation is completely free.  It is enough to go to the nearest branch, give the receipt to the cashier and money.  After that, you can safely forget about the loan until the next payment.  It is worth recalling that the funds are credited to the account within one day. </p><h2>  post office </h2><p>  Home Credit can also be paid at the Russian Post Office.  To do this, you need to visit any branch that carries out transfers under the name "CyberMoney" and make a payment.  To do this, you need to fill out a special form for electronic transfer.  It is worth considering that a fee will be charged when paying. </p><h2>  Cash desks of other banks </h2>

    <p>  You can pay for a valid loan at any other bank.  The basis for the transfer is a <span>payment order</span> from the borrower or payer.

    <p>  This bank should be said separately, since in addition to the usual transfer through the cash desk, you can pay a loan through other services.  The first is Sberbank Online, which makes it possible to make transfers via the Internet without leaving your home.  In this case, a Home Credit loan is paid online.  A commission of one percent is charged for this operation. </p><p>  There is also the possibility of connecting a service called "Auto Payment".  As the name implies, payment is automatic.  To use it, you need to draw up a card at Sberbank and activate the service.  After that, it will be enough just to replenish the card once a month, and the loan will be paid on its own.  Moreover, this operation is carried out without commission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Payroll Withdrawals </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the usual methods, a Home Credit loan can be paid out of a client‚Äôs salary.  In this case, it does not matter at all how it is issued - through accounting or to the card.  This is significant only when deciding where to apply for writing off a loan. </p><p>  The procedure for registration is as follows: </p><p>  The client specifies to which details transfers are made to the bank. </p><p>  It submits an application to the accounting department, on the basis of which transfers will be made every month from the salary to pay off the loan. </p><p>  After accepting the application for work, the payment of the Home Credit loan will be carried out automatically.  Do not forget that the employer will not always agree to assume the obligation to transfer and therefore may refuse to accept the application. </p><p>  If the salary is paid to the card, you can apply at the bank where it is issued. </p><h2>  How to repay through ATMs? </h2>

    <p>  You can also repay a loan at Euroset, MTS and Beeline stores.  If you can cashless payment, you can pay by card.  If the payment is made in the amount of less than five thousand rubles, the commission will be fifty rubles, if more than one percent.  The funds are credited to the credit account the next day after payment. </p><p>  For the transfer you need a passport and contract.  If you are applying for the first time, the full name, contract number, account number, bank name and phone number are required. </p><p>  When you apply again, you only have to give a phone number, since a template is created on it, where all the transfer data is saved.  If repayment was made through the Euroset salon, the data can be read from the bar code on the check, so it is better to have it with you. </p><h2>  How to repay a loan online? </h2><p>  Like any other bank, Home Credit also has an online banking system that allows you to pay without leaving your home.  The funds are debited from the debit card to the credit account.  This type of payment does not imply any fees.  Funds are transferred within two days. </p><p>  The payment procedure in this case is as follows: </p><p>  First you need to go through authorization in the Internet banking system. </p><p>  1. Select a card to be debited. </p><p>  2. Indicate the account where the funds will be transferred. </p><p>  3. Receive an SMS with a code to confirm the payment. </p><p>  4. Enter the numbers in the system. </p><p>  5. After that, the money will be debited and credited to the credit account.  All operations are performed at a safe level and you should not be afraid that someone else will intervene. </p><p>  Protection is carried out by receiving SMS on the client‚Äôs phone with a confirmation code.  If you have a loan at Home Credit Bank, paying a loan online is quick and convenient. </p><h2>  Some tips for the client </h2><p>  If you do not meet the deadline a little, and the payment date is already very close, you should not pay at third-party banks and terminals, as the funds go several days.  Due to this, a delay may occur.  Well, who wants to pay a one-day late fee?  Surely no one.  It is best to pay in such a situation at the bank's cash desk or via the Internet. </p><p>  When paying in other banks or terminals, a fee is charged for the payment, which is established by the organization that accepts the payment.  No commissions can be paid only at the cash desk of the bank itself or through self-service devices. </p><p>  The longest of all is the method of repayment via mail.  In this situation, funds arrive within 10 days from the date of payment. </p>
