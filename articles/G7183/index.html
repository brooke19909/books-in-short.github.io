The development of feudal society always leads to this.  In itself, this phenomenon is not negative for the society of the corresponding era.  Of course, history lessons at school, as well as the study of ancient literature, instill in descendants a negative connotation of fragmentation.  It is enough to recall some authors who ‚Äúput up‚Äù the princes, warned them of the danger of fragmentation of the state.  However, this process, on the contrary, leads to the development of the periphery, the heyday of culture, productive forces in every land.  Fragmentation ‚Äúsqueezes‚Äù the maximum out of <span>specific principalities</span> before uniting into a more powerful state with a single market. </p><h2>  Fragmentation coincides with the invasion </h2>

    <p>  The formation of a centralized <span>Russian state was</span> not quick, despite all the prerequisites.  The fault is the invasion of the hordes of the Mongol-Tatars in the 30s of the 13th century.  Their expansion pushed the formation of a centralized Russian state for several centuries, and the specific centers of Russia from powerful rich cities turned into seedy villages.  The princely administration during the period of the Mongol occupation ceased to care about the territories entrusted to them.  Its main task is to collect the tribute to the conquerors in time, without forgetting to themselves.  The stronger the principality became, the more dangerous it was considered in the eyes of the Mongols. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Forgotten ‚Äúexploits‚Äù of Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  The history of this time includes several cases of the total destruction of entire cities that dared to rebel against the power of the khans.  The most remarkable thing is that such plots were "drowned in blood" by the Russian princes.  One of the main accomplices of the Mongols is our "protector" of the faith, Alexander Nevsky.  Several times, on the orders of the khans, he personally led punitive expeditions against the rebels.  However, it was Alexander Nevsky who began a new dynasty, with which the unification of the Russian lands around Moscow was connected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the unification of the Russian lands around Moscow [2], the formation of the Russian centralized state 14 15 centuries" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1496422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Background of the formation of the Russian centralized state </h2><p>  Former Russia could not unite into a single state.  This was facilitated by: </p><ul><li>  One language. </li><li>  Common faith. </li><li>  Joint traditions, laws. </li><li>  Standardized account measures. </li><li>  Kinship, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Agricultural development </h2><p>  While the development of productive forces does not reach a peak in the regions, it is too early to talk about unification.  But from the beginning of the <span>14th century</span> , active economic cooperation begins between once united lands.  The reason for this is the intensive development of agriculture. </p><p>  Earth has already learned to live under oppression.  However, do not forget that the ‚ÄúMongolian cap‚Äù reliably protected from large-scale wars and invasions.  Peaceful development has led to the fact that once empty territories began to develop again.  In addition, the invaders showed new industries that Rusich had not previously mastered - livestock and horse breeding.  Economic zoning has occurred, without which active economic interaction would have been simply useless.  Therefore, the formation of a centralized Russian state was influenced by the need to create a single market.  But most of all this was needed by large feudal lords.  The largest of these was the church.  It will be discussed further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation and development of the Russian centralized state" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1496425.jpg" width="300"></div>

This is due to the fact that during the Mongol-Tatar invasion, the invaders did not touch it.  On the contrary, they gave her complete freedom and independence.  The wisdom of the Mongols knows no analogues in history - they never changed the conquered peoples.  Being, as a rule, lower in cultural and technical development than the conquered peoples, the Mongol-Tatars tried to adopt all the significant results of their development.  However, even what they did not need was preserved: religion, literature, art.  Only political liberties were limited.  As regards economic and cultural development, complete freedom of choice was given here, if only an ‚Äúexit‚Äù was paid on time. </p><p>  Having adopted Islam, the Horde never once raised the issue of infringement of Orthodoxy in Russia and the imposition of another religion.  They understood that for a simple person, tribute is considered customary.  It does not matter where she goes - to Kiev or to the Barn.  However, an attempt on faith, on the soul - with this man could not put up.  Life was perceived as a temporary refuge before eternal bliss.  Try to change this - and the Russian people will die in the struggle against the invaders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of the formation of the Russian centralized state" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1496427.jpg" width="600"></div>

She was given empty lands that were ravaged by war and devastation.  In addition, the church was a powerful feudal lord.  Offended and oppressed people came running to her.  Here they received shelter, shelter, but were obliged to work for its benefit.  Conditions, of course, are much milder than ordinary feudal lords.  The church was exempted from paying the obligatory Mongol "exit", and the holy fathers were more modest than secular aristocrats. </p><h2>  The growing power of the feudal lords demanded a single state </h2><p>  The power of monasteries and large feudal lords demanded a single state in order to legislate their privileged position not in each individual principality, but on a single vast territory with a powerful administrative apparatus.  Therefore, the church was the first of the feudal lords to support the unification of Russian lands around Moscow.  It is precisely the move here from Vladimir, the metropolitan who is the only metropolitan for all Russian lands, long before its rise that allows us to draw such conclusions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preconditions for the formation of a Russian centralized state" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1496421.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  Creation of a single state: stage one (end of the 13th century - 1462) </h2><p>  The creation of a centralized Russian state took place in several stages.  First, the question of the future capital was decided.  Today it‚Äôs hard to believe, but the formation of a centralized Russian state could happen under the flag of Tver, and not Moscow, since it had a much better chance for this: </p><ul><li>  advantageous geographical position; </li><li>  large center; </li><li>  initial support for khans; </li><li>  economic and military power. </li></ul><h2>  Weakness is the main advantage </h2><p>  However, the peculiarities of the formation of the Russian centralized state are that the above-mentioned advantages in the struggle for leadership often developed into disadvantages.  The khans were distrustful of such centers.  At first they disarmed the city of Vladimir, making it only a nominal center.  Recall that the main title in Russia was called the ‚ÄúGrand Duke of Vladimir‚Äù.  With him, Russian princes received a label on the administrative leadership in all cities.  However, the city of Vladimir itself turned into a village, since the Mongols watched the impossibility of its elevation.  They feared that he might become the banner of the liberation struggle against the khans. </p><h2>  Winners are not judged </h2><p>  When the first <span>son of Alexander Nevsky,</span> Daniil Aleksandrovich (1282-1303), only the surrounding villages within a radius of 40 km departed for Moscow.  However, the descendants of the winner of the Germans and Swedes in 80 years have done, perhaps, everything they can: they became related with the khan, saved up money, bought up all the free boyar estates in other principalities, transferred the residence of the metropolitan to him, and brutally crushed the uprising in Tver against Khan, having razed this city to the ground. </p><h2>  First resistance </h2>

    <p>  By 1380, believing in himself, Prince Dmitry decided to give resistance to the Horde.  Of course, no matter what the annals and ancient Russian writers say, the <span>battle on the Kulikovo field</span> was not against the khan, but against one of the Horde Murza - Mamaia.  In modern language, ‚Äúupstarts‚Äù, which had no legitimate authority in the whole Horde.  But the fact of disobedience in itself gave rise to the fact that the official <span>Khan Tokhtamysh</span> , 2 years later, in 1382, personally took part in the campaign against Moscow and burned it to the ground.  History books talk a lot about the Battle of Kulikovo, its significance, victory.  However, only two lines in them mention punitive reprisals against Russians after this event. </p><h2>  Unification does not stop </h2><p>  In addition to the battle with the Golden Horde, Dmitry Donskoy continued the formation of a centralized Russian state.  Dmitrov, Uglich, Starodub, Kostroma, and the territory of Beloozero were attached to Moscow. </p><p>  By the end of the 14th century, the first steps were taken to join the <span>Novgorod Republic.</span>  However, even to secure the right to Dvina land fails.  Novgorod is a serious richest shopping center not only in Russia, but also in the world.  Huge finances allowed her to give any rebuff to the invaders.  Only later, after the annexation of all the lands that supplied bread for the freedom-loving republic, Moscow, with the help of blackmail and an economic blockade, made a breach in the defense of Novgorod.  The dependence of Novgorod on grain played a cruel joke with the republic. </p><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  The final stage of the association dates back to 1462-1533 - from the reign of Ivan III (1462-1505) to the end of the reign of his son Basil III (1505-1533).  After them, a single state will exist peacefully only under Ivan the Terrible.  Unless, of course, this time can be called peaceful.  After which there will come a long period of Time of Troubles and interventions. </p><p>  The formation of the Russian centralized state (14-15 centuries) is associated with the following major events: </p><ul><li>  <span>The overthrow of the Horde yoke.</span> </li><li>  Joining Tver. </li><li>  The accession of Novgorod. </li></ul><p>  After the overthrow of the Horde in 1480, there was no longer any force capable of hindering such a process as the formation of a centralized Russian state. </p><h2>  Timeline affiliation </h2><ul><li>  1478 - Ivan III by force annexes Novgorod.  Moscow doubles territorially. </li><li>  1485 - Tver, the main political enemy of Moscow, finally joins. </li><li>  1489 - Vyatka land with a large non-Russian population. </li><li>  1510 - Pskov, which disconnected at the time from Novgorod.  After this, joining the latter remained only a matter of time. </li><li>  1514 - Moscow conquers the ancient Russian city of Smolensk during the war with Lithuania.  This city in the future will become a stumbling block in the foreign policy of the Russian state and will lead to constant wars with the Commonwealth. </li><li>  1521 - Ryazan formally joins, although in fact a long time ago the Moscow princes dragged all the Ryazan boyars to their side. </li></ul><p>  I want to say that Muscovy, as our country was then called, was the largest in Europe.  But the formation and development of the Russian centralized state was not peaceful.  The processes were accompanied by constant wars, bribery, executions, betrayal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of a centralized Russian state" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1496426.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  The formation of a centralized Russian state.  Politics of Ivan III and Vasily III </h2><p>  After the unification process was completed, a policy was launched to enslave the peasants.  Actually, that is what the feudal lords sought, including the church.  It was in the judgment of Ivan III of 1497 that the restriction on the right to leave peasants from landowners was first recorded.  Of course, they did not tighten the nuts to the end, but such a restriction itself was already a serious shock.  So far, peasants were allowed to cross one week before St. George's Day, in late November, and one week later, in early December.  However, the Judicial Code of 1550 by Ivan the Terrible will also cancel this rule.  Hence the saying goes: ‚ÄúHere you are, grandmother, and St. George‚Äôs Day‚Äù, which rightly reflects the initial mistrust in its introduction. </p><h2>  Peasant Transition Rules </h2><p>  As for the timing of the transition, then everything is logical.  The agricultural work cycle was limited.  If the workers leave the landowner in the middle of the cycle, this will result in ruin for him.  There were two innovations in the transition: </p><ul><li>  A short period equal to two weeks of autumn. </li><li>  The need to pay the "elderly". </li></ul><p>  The last paragraph means that the peasant did not have the right to just leave the feudal lord.  It was still necessary to pay for working hands, plus for billeting, that is, for living in the house.  If the employee occupied the yard for more than four years, then he was obliged to pay the full cost of the new building. </p><p>  Thus, the formation of a single state led to the beginning of enslavement of peasants on earth, as there appeared an administrative opportunity to control their movements. </p>
