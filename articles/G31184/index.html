During a vacation in this region, no one will be bored.  But if you want to get the most vivid impressions and see something truly unusual, go on an “informal” tour, for example, visit the cemetery of steam locomotives.  Perm Territory, Shumkovo station is a place where you can see the trains of various eras. </p><h2>  Open air museum or “strategic reserve”? </h2><p>  Railway sedimentation tanks are a typical phenomenon in our country.  Progress does not stand still, locomotives and electric trains become obsolete, break down.  Since this is a large and expensive equipment, sending it for disposal immediately after decommissioning is an unreasonable decision.  This is exactly how the sedimentation tanks appear - railway dead ends, onto the branches of which drive trains removed from flights. </p>

    <p>  When and under what circumstances did the steam locomotive cemetery appear at the Shumkovo station?  Half a century ago, the Perm Territory boasted a fairly large point of repair and maintenance of railway transport.  This is exactly the purpose Shumkovo station originally had.  Locomotives were driven here for repairs, after which they were again put on rails.  Gradually, some too worn-out pieces of equipment at the station remained at a standstill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 70s of the last century, all the railways of the USSR were served by electric and diesel locomotives.  It was then that in Shumkovo a cemetery of steam locomotives was formed.  Perm Territory has long been a place of strategic storage.  The station’s old-timers recall that at first all the locomotives and trains were mothballed - full maintenance was regularly carried out, and if necessary, the machines could be put back into operation at any time.  Today, the object is considered closed and guarded, but, despite this, getting to its territory is not so difficult. </p><h2>  The total number of exhibits </h2><p>  Today at the Shumkovo station there are about twenty old steam locomotives, as well as many more modern electric trains, diesel locomotives and wagons.  In total, the “collection” in the open air has about 200 units of railway equipment of various types and times.  But once there were only 140 steam locomotives here. Where did they disappear?  The fate of obsolete railway equipment is different.  Many cars were sold to other countries, in particular in China they respect FD (Felix Dzerzhinsky) very much and consider these locomotives to be incredibly reliable.  Some units of special equipment were disposed of, while others were really lucky: they were restored and turned into monuments. </p>

    <h2>  The cemetery of steam locomotives today </h2><p>  Officially, the Shumkovo station and its sedimentation tank of obsolete railway equipment still have the status of a specially protected facility, but secrecy was removed from it a few years ago.  At the entrance to the territory there is a gatehouse, immediately after which you can see the "exhibits".  These are mainly passenger cars of the modern type, made in the nineties.  Despite their short history, they look quite battered by life.  Having stood for years in the open air and without proper maintenance, many cars are rotten and very rusted.  But even this part of the cemetery of cars is incredibly interesting and makes a strong impression. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Walking between the ghosts of trains and trains, I just want to sing the legendary “Wait, engine, don’t hit the wheels ...” under your breath.  Nevertheless, the most interesting part of the spontaneously formed “museum” is located further, it is necessary to go through the field to it.  It is here that you can see the real "dinosaurs" of the railway. </p><h2>  The most interesting “exhibits” </h2><p>  <span>The oldest steam locomotive</span> in the sump is Er 716-66, produced in Hungary at the Mavag plant in 1936.  He got to this station after forty years of operation.  This copy is well preserved and, quite possibly, it will soon gain a second life - it will become a monument, all the necessary documents are already being drawn up. </p>

    <p>  You can see in the sump and domestic cars, for example, the famous IS-20 ("Joseph Stalin").  The production of these locomotives was started in 1920, and today models of steam locomotives of this series can be seen in many museums around the world. </p><h2>  Are excursions legal? </h2><p>  Today, the territory of the <span>railway station</span> is still guarded.  On the approach to the siding, you can see the gatehouse, in which employees of a specialized Perm company are always on duty.  Of course, railway equipment cannot be stolen.  The main danger to the sump of the equipment is looters and those who want to profit from metal.  But the attitude towards tourists is more loyal.  As the security officers themselves admit, after the governor of the Perm Territory posted a photo from the station on his personal blog, the number of people who wanted to see the “landmark” increased significantly.  However, lovers of informal tourism have always come here to look at locomotives and trains.  Usually, the guards, for visibility, are displeased with the visits of tourists, but the inspection of the territory does not prohibit.  Some employees are even ready to accompany visitors during a walk and act as guides. </p>

    <h2>  Useful information for travelers </h2><p>  Steam locomotives stand on rails literally in the middle of a clean field.  Between the paths in summer, tall grass grows, which is sometimes mowed.  Station workers claim that there are many vipers in these places.  Therefore, you should go on an excursion in closed shoes and clothes.  You can get to the territory of the object not only by verbal agreement with the guards, but also by obtaining official permission.  For this, it is necessary to send a corresponding request to the management of the <span>Sverdlovsk Railway.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Locomotive Cemetery (Perm Territory): how to get from the nearest cities? </h2><p>  The closest settlement to the reserve base is the village of Spaso-Barda.  You should be guided by it if you are heading to the cemetery of steam locomotives by private car or public transport.  The closest city to the object is Kishert, which can be reached from Perm by bus.  It is most convenient to travel by car.  By choosing this option, you will definitely see with your own eyes a cemetery of steam locomotives.  Perm Territory has many roads.  The easiest way is not to get lost if you drive into Kishert, turn off from the church to Spaso-Barda.  Then you will pass the bridge over the Sylva river, after it there will be a fork. </p>

    <p>  There are no signs here, you need to turn onto the asphalt road that goes along the railway tracks.  Now it remains only to move to the fence, where you will have the opportunity to ask for an excursion. </p><h2>  “Wait, engine!”: Interesting facts about the reserve base in Shumkovo </h2><p>  Local residents have long ceased to be amazed at the “open-air museum”.  Moreover, many cemeteries of railway equipment frankly do not like it.  Meanwhile, it is impossible to call the sump at the Shumkovo station useless.  For example, recently one of the “exhibits” was involved in the festive composition on Victory Day in Perm.  A little maintenance and an external marafet - and the "old man" confidently set off on his own power, they say that it was very pleasant for the veterans to see the steam locomotive of their youth in motion. </p>

    <p>  There are also legends about the sump of steam locomotives.  Tourists staying near the station for the night claim that they heard strange sounds from the side of the equipment cemetery.  However, this is easy to explain, because nearby is the existing workshop for the repair of modern trains. </p><p>  All lovers of ancient technology and history as such should visit this place.  In many museums you can see models of steam locomotives, which are also here.  But you must admit, it’s much more interesting to look at real cars than at their smaller copies. </p>
