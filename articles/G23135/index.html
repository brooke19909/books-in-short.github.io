    <h2>  It's time to make money! </h2><p>  Oryol quarries of Yaroslavl have always been a landmark of the city.  For a long time they were under the care of the state, which from time to time was engaged in the refinement of the territory. </p><p>  However, some time ago Orlovsky quarry was leased, and since then the entrance there has been paid.  This caused a stormy reaction of the local population, people sincerely resented such ‚Äúimpudence‚Äù from businessmen.  Especially considering the fact that the fee will be charged only with motorists. </p><p>  However, not everything is so bad: the tenant promised to make a real sweet of the place of rest.  It is planned to build several cafes here, to make rental tools for recreation and accessories for water activities.  And pedestrians will be able to swim and enter the territory of the Oryol sand pit for free. </p><p>  In addition, it is planned to equip the rescue center of the Ministry of Emergencies.  As you know, careers are not the safest place to swim.  Each year, statistics are updated with information about new victims.  Therefore, it is planned to open several rescue centers on the territory of Orlovsky's quarry, which will take care of the safety of vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  How to get to the place of rest?  Careers are not located within the city.  The tenant‚Äôs bet was made on this: most vacationers are forced to come by car.  And entry, as we recall, is already paid. </p>

    <p>  If you want to get to the quarries from Yaroslavl, then move towards the Kostroma highway.  The place is located between two small villages: Yartsevo and Vorobino.  Therefore, very often near the quarry you can meet many locals who want to freshen up on a hot summer day. </p><h2>  And can you swim there at all? </h2><p>  Orlovsky quarry used to be used for sand mining.  Therefore, its shores are simply the dream of any vacationer.  Warm yellow sand, which is periodically cleaned from debris by the new owner. </p><p>  Once the quarry was flooded, and now in some places the depth can reach even fifteen meters.  However, swimming near the beaches is completely safe: the depth is about 3 meters. </p>

    <p>  Riding a career is best between June and July.  In August, the water becomes too warm and begins to attract not only people, but also algae.  At this time, they begin to multiply actively and the bottom becomes slippery and unpleasant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ministry of Emergencies scandal </h2><p>  Some time ago, the Ministry of Emergencies decided to conduct a check of a popular tourist destination.  The conclusions were disappointing: the Orlovsky quarry is unsafe for swimming, and some sanitary standards are most grossly violated. </p><p>  In particular, during the audit it was revealed that about two thousand people came to careers in a day.  However, there are no basic means to maintain hygiene.  For example, not a single toilet was noticed near the pond of the Oryol quarry! </p><p>  In addition, no litter bins were found either.  Not all tourists are so conscientious that they take garbage with them.  Therefore, a lot of packages, bottles and leftovers are lying around the reservoirs, which local services are in no hurry to clean.  In addition, you can easily spot an empty soda bottle floating past you. </p><h2>  What were you attracted to? </h2><p>  Also, no one controlled what exactly vacationers do in the quarries.  Many cook kebabs, turn bonfires, while harming nature and causing inconvenience to neighboring vacationers. </p><p>  Another nuisance: lots of stalls around.  Many people buy drinks from local sellers on a hot day.  Often in the assortment you can find alcohol, the quality of which raises certain doubts. </p>

    <p>  And it‚Äôs not even worth mentioning that, in spite of all the promises to open life-saving sites, none were found in the quarries.  But there are many children swimming there! </p><h2>  Now what? </h2><p>  As a result of the inspection, the Ministry of Emergencies decided to send a letter to the prosecutor.  If the violations are confirmed, the company renting land in quarries will have to pay a substantial fine and correct the deficiencies. </p><p>  In addition, the Ministry of Emergencies is not going to stop there.  They have already planned joint raids with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which are designed to improve the situation with beaches and security in the Oryol quarries.  Well, let's see what comes of this. </p><p>  Of course, it is up to you to decide whether or not to go to a career.  However, do not rush to refuse to spend the weekend on the beach ahead of time.  According to the results of the water test, no dangerous bacteria were detected, which means that the water there is clean and quite suitable for swimming.  Therefore, we say with confidence: you are unlikely to regret your choice. </p>
