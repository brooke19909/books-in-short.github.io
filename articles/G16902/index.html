Rublevskoe highway appeared in 1903.  A water supply station was built here.  Therefore, a large road was needed here, which was immediately built.  Rublevskoe highway started from the water intake and ended with a reservoir, which is located in the Sparrow Hills area.  Since 1912, a bridge has been operating here through which you can cross the Setun River.  In former times, Rublevskoe highway led to the cottage where Stalin himself lived.  Nearby are Davydkovskaya and Minskaya streets.

    <h2>  After entering the capital </h2><p>  A redevelopment was carried out, as a result of which the territory near Moscow State University, the stretch of road between the Vorobyevsky highway and Michurinsky Avenue from 1950 to 1953 was eliminated.  The changes significantly affected the Rublevskoe highway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The map of Moscow from now on included this territory in 1960.  Universitetskiy Avenue was enriched by a piece of the road between Michurinsky Ave and Mosfilmovskaya Street.  Changes also took place in 1965, when paths were cut near the Kuntseva station using the Filyovskaya metro line. </p><p>  Since 1966, the area between Davydkovskaya Street and Mozhaysky Highway turned out to be part <span>of Slavyanskiy Boulevard.</span>  If you look at modern drawings, you can pretty clearly see what this road was half a century ago.  There was a straight passing alley located at the intersection of the direction of the Moscow Railway going to Belarus.  You can even see an indication of the point where the passage previously operated.  Then the route was sent more north along the bridge. </p>
