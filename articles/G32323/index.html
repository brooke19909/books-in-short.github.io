    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  In the 20s of the last century, the square, which is located near the exit from the Teatralnaya metro station, had a name different from the modern one.  Like other objects in Moscow and other cities of the country, she bore the name of one of the statesmen.  It was under Sverdlov Square in 1927, according to the drawn up project, it was supposed to begin the construction of a new station.  However, this plan was not implemented then.  Construction began in 1936.  The Teatralnaya metro station opened 2 years later. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the station was also called ‚ÄúSverdlov Square‚Äù.  In those years, the Teatralnaya metro station served as a bomb shelter.  In the mid 70's.  The central interchange hub underwent reconstruction.  As a result, two transitions appeared.  The first one led to the Ploshchad Revolyutsii station, and the second one to the Okhotny Ryad station.  From the metro station "Teatralnaya" today you can go to the Sokolnicheskaya or Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya lines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1990, Theater Square was returned to its original name.  Renamed and metro station.  However, traces of the letters that made up the old name have been preserved to this day. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  The metro station ‚ÄúTeatralnaya‚Äù refers to a deep-seated station (35 m).  Tricuspid design, pylon.  When creating the plan, Ivan Fomin used the technologies that he applied for the first time in the design of the Krasnye Vorota station.  Although the Teatralnaya metro station had a different name from the beginning, in design it emphasized theatrical themes. </p><p>  The interior of the station is similar to <span>the Melpomene Temple,</span> reminding residents and tourists of the architectural and historical monuments located on the surface.  The arches of the central hall are decorated with diamond-shaped caissons.  Their bottom row is decorated with decorative porcelain inserts.  All this is sustained in the theatrical style of the peoples of the USSR. </p><p>  The figures, which can be seen on the arch of the central hall, have a height of about a meter.  Each of them depicts a character in a national costume, dancing or playing a musical instrument.  When the project was created, the USSR included only 11 republics.  Here are 7 of them.  The figures were created according to the sketches of the sculptor-ceramist Natalya Danko at the Leningrad Porcelain Factory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The design of the station is dominated by bright colors.  Crystal lamps in a bronze frame are suspended from the vaults.  Above the benches and in the niches are sconces with spherical shades.  In the central hall, the floor is faced with black gabbro tiles. </p><p>  The Teatralnaya metro station in Moscow is one of the historical sights.  Located in the very center of the capital.  One of the vestibules is built into the former apartment building and is located on <span>Bolshaya Dmitrovka</span> street <span>.</span>  From the Teatralnaya metro station, access to the city from the southern part leads to Revolution Square, and from the northern one to Theater Square. </p><p>  It is worth saying a few words about the objects that are in the vicinity of this station. </p>

    <h2>  Cultural and historical sites </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the station there are many attractions.  This is the Bolshoi Theater, and the Maly Theater, and the Chekhov Moscow Art Theater.  If you leave the station towards Theater Square, you can get to the Central Department Store in just a few minutes.  From here, it is close to Red Square, the State Historical Museum and the Metropol Hotel. </p><h2>  theatre square </h2><p>  Several centuries ago, the Petrovsky Theater was located here.  It was named after one of the streets of Moscow.  Thus, for some time the area was called Petrovskaya. </p><p>  Today, the area in which the Teatralnaya metro station is located is one of the most comfortable and picturesque in Moscow.  But a few centuries ago this area looked a bit different.  The situation was aggravated by fires, the worst of which occurred in 1812. </p><p>  The project of the future square was created at the beginning of the XIX century.  According to the plan, it was supposed to have the shape of a rectangle, and along the perimeter it was limited to symmetrically standing buildings.  It is noteworthy that most of the Theater Square was inaccessible to citizens until 1911.  There was a parade parade, fenced with ropes. </p>

    <h2>  The Bolshoi Theatre </h2><p>  The history of this cultural and historical monument began at the end of the 18th century.  Initially, it was a small theater that had imperial status.  From time to time, he became subordinate either to the Governor-General or to the St. Petersburg Directorate.  In 1917, all property, as you know, was nationalized.  The complete separation of the Bolshoi and Maly theaters happened just then.  The area where the station is located, which is described in this article, for many years was a concentration of theatrical life of the capital. </p>
