For regular customers, this procedure is simplified to a minimum. </p>

    <h2>  On what conditions can I get a loan? </h2><p>  The conditions for obtaining a microloan directly depend on the type of loan program, frequency of circulation and the borrower's integrity.  For example, at the initial application to MFIs, you can count on a microloan in the range of 1,000-30,000 rubles for a period of 1-30 days and at 0-2% per day.  And for registration, as practice shows, you only need a Russian passport.  It is noteworthy that in this case the amount of return will be 48,000 rubles.  In case of secondary circulation (under similar conditions), the borrower will have to return 39,000 rubles. </p><h2>  How can I get credit money? </h2><p>  When preparing an application, each client has the right to choose the method of obtaining <span>credit money.</span>  For example, immediately after the approval of the request, you can come to the nearest office of the company and collect cash at the cash desk of the MFI.  Alternatively, it’s realistic to order a money delivery service directly to your home and even to your place of work.  This is how the non-banking organization “Center for Loans” works.  Reviews about it can be heard both in a positive and negative way.  But to decide in favor of one or the other is possible only with a thorough analysis and personal appeal to the microfinance organization. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of contacting the Loan Center? </h2><p>  If you believe most of the customer reviews of this MFI, you can highlight the following advantages of contacting the "Loan Center": </p><ul><li>  the opportunity to get a loan with any credit history; </li><li>  high speed of obtaining a loan; </li><li>  the ability to issue a microloan in the presence of one credit delay; </li><li>  a great way to improve your credit dossier (with hasty repayment of a microloan); </li><li>  microloans for students and senior citizens; </li><li>  an opportunity to get a loan for officially unemployed and unemployed; </li><li>  issuing a loan in a convenient way; </li><li>  execution on one document; </li><li>  issuing loans for any purpose, etc. </li></ul>

    <h2>  What do clients and MFI employees say? </h2><p>  Reviews about this organization can be heard very different.  For example, some borrowers say only positive things about the organization.  So, some of them talk about how they were able to quickly get a loan.  They liked the high speed of registration and professionalism of the company employees.  Others argue the opposite.  According to them, company managers do not have the necessary knowledge in the field of etiquette.  They are openly rude and misbehaving. </p><p>  Third admire low interest and customer loyalty.  Four people like the quick response of company managers to a problem. </p><p>  The employees of the organization themselves speak out about the company in a positive way.  They like to work in a friendly team.  According to many of them, it was here that they acquired the necessary knowledge in the field of <span>customer service,</span> learned how to identify potential defaulters and improved <span>business communication skills.</span> </p><h2>  Center for loans and investments "Expert": reviews and confusion with the names </h2><p>  Often the names of completely different companies can coincide or sound identical.  For example, this is exactly the case with the “Loan Center” (LLC MCC “Finance NN”), established in 2010.  However, unlike its namesake company, this company operates exclusively in Nizhny Novgorod and the Nizhny Novgorod region.  Therefore, we ask you not to confuse them. </p><p>  In addition, Summit LLC is often associated with new customers with LLC MFI Investment Center.  The central office of this organization is located on Sovetskaya street, 7a, in st.  Dinskaya Krasnodar Territory.  She also issues microloans with and without collateral, finances business representatives and prepares pension loans. </p><p>  Another namesake MFI is the center for loans and investments, better known as the “Expert”.  The main office of this company is located in Novosibirsk, on Sovetskaya street, 22a.  Pay attention to the reviews: “The Center for Investment Loans” is considered a relatively young organization. </p>

    <h2>  What to do to avoid confusion with the names? </h2><p>  If you decide to resort to the services of the “Loan Center” and are not sure whether it is a non-banking organization, pay attention to the legal name of the company and its contacts.  You should also carefully study the reviews in order to find out which “Loan Center” they are talking about.  And finally, you can check if MFIs are registered in the unified register of the Russian Federation.  To do this, go to cbr.ru and enter the name of your organization in the appropriate search box.  Thus, you can always find an MFI that suits your requirements. </p>
