Thanks to this attire, a woman always manages to look especially graceful and inimitable.  Every century, dresses change.  This applies not only to the length, finish, but also to the style.  A-line dress is very popular today.  For the first time, it became fashionable in the last century in the sixties.  At first glance, it is very simple, free, not long, but a woman or girl will always look especially tender in him.  It perfectly hides the fullness and sits well on any figure.  Every woman will be able to sew it, because it is not difficult to make a dress-trapeze pattern.  You just have to really want to, prepare paper, scissors and a pencil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A-line dress pattern" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/445819.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  Constructing a dress pattern (trapeze) </h2><p>  Many people think that designing is difficult.  In any business, knowledge and skills are needed.  In order to make a <span>dress of a trapeze dress</span> yourself, you do not need to know a large number of formulas and higher mathematics.  It is enough if you have at hand a drawing-basis of the dress.  A tuck of the chest (sometimes humeral), tucks at the waist, etc. are outlined on it. First you need to transfer the entire outline of the drawing to a blank sheet of paper.  Tucks for the waist do not need to be circled.  For this style they are not needed.  Further from the lower point of the shoulder protrusions (this is the acute angle of the triangle), draw a vertical line down.  This line should then be cut, tucks should be closed, and the bottom, accordingly, will expand.  And go to the chest tuck. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thoracic Tuck Modeling </h2><p>  It is not necessary to transfer the tuck of the breast, especially if the size is large.  We leave it in place, but from the point of the axillary hollows it is necessary to draw oblique lines.  To do this, you need to retreat to the side of 6-7 cm from the side point of the bottom of the dress and put a new point H3.  Now we draw a line from the point of the axillary hollows to H3.  If the size of the breast is small, then the chest tuck can be closed.  The silhouette of the dress will be somewhat loose and magnificent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern a-line with sleeve" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/445830.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Summer dresses </h2><p>  The pattern of a <span>summer dress</span> (trapeze) is built very easily.  Sleeves, as a rule, are not needed, but this season it is very fashionable for the neckline of the armhole to be in the form of a raglan and the fastener on the neck.  Everyone can design such a drawing.  It is very good if you have at hand the base of the dress.  Tucks at the waist need to be eliminated, they are not needed.  From the acute angle of the chest tuck, draw a vertical line to the bottom of the dress, which then cuts through.  From the point of the armpit to the top of the neck draw a line, this will be the armhole-raglan.  To delete everything that remains from the shoulder and then simply cut it off.  What remains of the shoulder protrusions must be modeled.  To do this, from an acute angle draw a line to the bottom of the dress.  This is on the back.  And the front line should coincide with the vertical, which is drawn from the thoracic tuck.  Now close the tucks themselves, and push the bottom of the dress.  You get a drawing that resembles a certain dome.  Do not forget that there must be a fastener on the neck.  You can position it anywhere: on the back, in front.  Here we need to show our own imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="building a dress pattern a-line" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/445923.jpg" width="326"></div>

It is also easy to make a pattern of a trapeze dress for a cold pore.  The drawing is the same, only the fabric will need a denser one.  In this case, you will also need a drawing of the sleeve.  It can also be modeled.  The dress pattern (trapeze) with a sleeve does not differ much from the sleeveless version.  The armhole line does not need to be touched, otherwise the sleeve will not sit down, as it should.  You can adjust the length of the sleeve, the assembly on the shoulders, sew cuffs on the bottom or make it flared.  A long sleeves dress with a raglan armhole looks beautiful.  On it you can make a finish or perform a decorative stitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern summer dress a-line" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/445836.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Original dresses </h2><p>  A woman always tries to be unique.  A trapeze dress is just what you need for this purpose.  You can sew it with folds, cuts.  Just do not make them too deep, because such a dress is usually modeled either short or to the knees.  A long one will make the figure heavy and massive.  Starting to make a trapeze dress pattern, you must immediately take into account what length is planned.  The bottom line is drawn in the drawing, and then all the darts are modeled.  If it is decided that it will be pleated, then this must be taken into account in advance.  It is modeled in the same way as described above.  Only now the planned horizontal line will need to be further extended to the width that is planned to create the corrugation.  If you need to make several small folds, then you should draw several lines, depending on how many there will be.  They then also cut and move apart.  Such a <span>dress with a yoke</span> on her chest will look beautiful and unusual.  This style is very suitable for women "in an interesting position."  The dress is free.  Having closed the thoracic tuck during construction, you need to simulate the yoke.  From the upper point of the shoulder slope, measure 3-4 cm down and put the point of the K1 coquette.  Then from the neckline at the front bend measure down 10 centimeters down, put the point again - K2.  Connect these two points, and you get a yoke. </p>
