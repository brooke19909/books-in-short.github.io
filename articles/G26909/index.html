    <p>  He was born in the city of Suzdal.  Gastev Alexey Kapitonovich (date of birth - September 26, 1882) very early lost his father, who was a teacher in a regular school.  Left with his mother, who earned sewing clothes, he helped her from childhood, so that their family would not be below the poverty line.  And, despite the difficult financial situation, the boy nevertheless went to study at school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The prospect of becoming a teacher </h2><p>  Moreover, after her graduation, Gastev Alexey Kapitonovich first enters the school, and then becomes a student of technical courses.  The young man is diligent in his studies, so he has every chance to become a student of the capital's teacher's institute, and he does not miss this opportunity.  However, in his youth, he was very interested in the revolutionary movement, so he did not graduate from the above university because of his expulsion from it. </p><h2>  Adherent of the ideas of the revolution </h2><p>  At the age of eighteen, Gastev Aleksey Kapitonovich became an ardent activist in the political life of the country, supporting ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù movements. </p>

    <p>  His debut work, which appeared on the pages of the press in 1904, was called "Behind."  This was a story telling about the difficult life of political activists who were exiled to remote corners of their homeland.  After some time, collections of works by Gastev began to be published, the last of which was published in Moscow in 1923. </p><h2>  New Horizons </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 1920s, Aleksey Kapitonovich gradually abandoned the field of fiction and became more and more involved in the problems of rationalizing labor.  He initiates the creation of the Central Institute of Labor (CIT) at the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and himself leads his brainchild. </p><p>  It is thanks to this structure that Gastev manages to realize all his ideas set forth in scientific monographs.  During the time that he headed the CIT, the ex-revolutionary managed to train hundreds of thousands of personnel in his techniques, and, according to the opinions of enterprise directors, they became the most competent specialists in their field. </p><p>  The fame of the institution, headed by Alexey Gastev, began to spread with great speed, and soon the teachers of CIT began to instruct personnel in the most remote regions of the USSR. </p><h2>  Actual issues of workflow organization </h2><p>  Naturally, in the 30s there were serious flaws <em> </em>  in the system of labor organization in Soviet enterprises. </p>

    <p>  It was precisely on them that Gastev Alexei Kapitonovich paid close attention.  "How to work?"  - This is exactly what his scientific work is called, devoted to the issues of competent planning of the work process.  Its author emphasized that the working person initially does not know how to work in a team, and often resists obeying a person who is higher in the ranks. </p><p>  And, of course, sometimes the employee neglects the briefing that comes from above, not seeing anything shameful in this.  It is these problems that Gastev considers in detail, and, as practice shows, after reading the literature, a person really wants to become an executive and disciplined employee. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúElemental licentiousness is the root of evil‚Äù </h2><p>  The author believed <em> </em>  the development of industrialization requires a revolution in culture.  And cultural education will not have development if there is no struggle against ‚Äúspontaneous licentiousness‚Äù and enforcing in the society the rules of everyday culture that govern the regime of proper nutrition and rest, planning the day.  But this alone is not enough to correct the situation. </p>

    <p>  It is necessary to improve the socio-psychological atmosphere in society, which will allow the individual to control his behavior and emotions. </p><h2>  Lean Thinking </h2><p>  In 1924, another fundamental work by Gastev was published.  It is called "Labor Attitudes."  In this monograph, Aleksey Kapitonovich analyzed in detail the theory of the CIT. </p><p>  His scientific doctrine became the prerequisite for creating modern principles of lean thinking.  Gastev published several guidelines for the preparation of a number of specialists, including a locksmith, a textile worker, a fitter, a blacksmith, an aviator, and a turner.  In his study, the purpose of which was to prepare the workforce, Alexey Kapitonovich employed the method of studying movements in the performance of a particular work. </p><p>  As a tool for analysis, he chose cyclography (images of some elements of the movement of human organs involved in labor).  Having achieved success in the research, he switched to a global retraining of specialists, having established the commercial company "Installation" for these purposes.  The colossal experience of the pre-war and post-industrial years, trips abroad to advanced enterprises, enabled the scientist to produce the theory of the <span>Scientific Organization of Labor (NOT), the</span> principles of which were adopted even by the United States. </p><p>  But Soviet officials were skeptical of Gastev's lean principles, and his scientific research, set out in many monographs, was ignored by them. </p>

    <p>  In the early 1930s, Aleksey Kapitonovich became the editor-in-chief of the journal ‚ÄúBulletin of Standardization‚Äù.  He also worked in the print media Installation of the Labor Force and Labor Organization. </p><p>  The scientist tried to perceive the world creatively.  In his scientific works, he no longer touches on the themes of the world revolution and cosmopolitanism, he is more concerned with the problems of the common man.  Their practical significance is enormous in today's time. </p><p>  In 1938, the scientist was taken into custody on a false denunciation by the Chekists.  And in 1939, Alexei Gastev was shot. </p>
