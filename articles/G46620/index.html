Three of them deserve the title of giants.  These are Baikal, Taimyr and Chany.  Moreover, the latter is known for the most part only to Novosibirsk citizens who choose to rest on its shores.  Maybe this is for the better, because a large number of tourists do not contribute to the preservation of nature in pristine purity.  The most beautiful lake of Siberia - Chany spreads for many kilometers.  The water here is crystal clear, swans and pelicans nest in it.  On the shore of a magnificent reservoir there is a recreation center "Lazurnaya Bay."  The modern complex allows you to provide the best vacation for every tourist.  Here you are expected in winter and summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azure bay" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1930408.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The climate in these places is simply unique, not without reason "Bay of Lazurnaya" is so popular among tourists.  I would also like to note that the water in the lake is salty.  It has not yet been reliably stated that it has some properties, but swimming in the lake contributes to excellent relaxation and rest. </p><p>  But not only for <span>this, tourists</span> appreciate the rest at the "Lazurnaya Bay" base.  The healing effect is not only water, but also air.  The wind mixes in this natural hollow a pair of salty air and supplements it with the thick and rich spirit of the herbs of the Baraba steppe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For fishing fans </h2><p>  In winter and summer, people who do not see their life without a fishing rod come here to get real pleasure.  Moreover, both beginners and professional fishermen like it here.  In winter, Lazurnaya Bay is mostly inhabited by lovers of quiet relaxation alone with floats and tackle.  In total, about 16 species of fish, typical representatives of the river fauna, live here. </p><p>  And if you came to rest with children, then they will be conquered by a real bird paradise.  Hundreds of bird species live here, including pelicans and <span>blue-headed gulls.</span>  Here you can watch them in their natural habitat, so prepare a feast for birds and go to the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest azure bay" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1930407.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  You will not regret if you go here on vacation.  "Azure Bay" was created for the most active and energetic people.  This is a chance to get a charge of excellent mood and well-being for the whole year.  Of course, most of the entertainment here in the summer.  Guests can swim in the warm, healing water and have picnics.  On the lake you can ride a boat and a water scooter, catamarans and bananas.  And besides this, you can play volleyball and basketball on equipped platforms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In winter, there are other fun, but no less interesting.  Skis and snowmobiles, skates and evenings in a Russian bath, as well as the first fishing catch.  In addition, guides work on the base all year round, who arrange exclusive tours and excursions for their guests. </p><p>  I would also like to note that all the conditions for relaxing with children are provided here.  Your little ones will not be bored.  They are waiting for swings and horizontal bars, playgrounds and funny animators, and for the smallest there is a games room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center azure bay" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1930406.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The recreation center "Lazurnaya Bay" is located in the Novosibirsk region, Barabinsky district, 7 km from the village of Kvashnino.  The logical question is how to get to it with the least temporary loss.  There is nothing complicated about it, although the distance is decent.  It is almost 400 km from Novosibirsk to it.  By car, drive along the federal highway M 51 (Baikal) to the above village.  Then there will be a turn with a pointer to the base, after which you will find another 50 km along the good road. </p><p>  It is only 60 km from the city of Barabinsk, so the locals come here quite often, weekend tours are practiced.  If you do not have a car, then do not be discouraged.  From the Novosibirsk-Glavniy station, you can get to the Barabinsk railway station by train.  In addition, there is the opportunity to use the services of vehicles.  From the bus station on Krasny Prospekt to Barabinsk there is a route Novosibirsk - Northern.  A regular bus runs from Barabinsk to Kvashino, but from here you can get to the place on the way or on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Living conditions </h2><p>  "Lazurnaya Bay" (Novosibirsk region) offers its guests different conditions for living.  There are economy class rooms, modest, but convenient and comfortable.  A well-maintained business class will allow holding top-level meetings and meeting business colleagues.  And if you came for a weekend with a student company, then pay attention to wooden wagons, it is cheap and convenient. </p><p>  There is already a traditional division.  Young people most often choose to stay in wooden houses in order to relax from a city apartment and change it to a traditional suburban flavor.  And older guests prefer to live in comfort and choose a comfortable building with all amenities.  It has modern furniture and showers, Wi-Fi and cable TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bay azure lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1930677.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, no one will starve here.  Meals are not included in the price, which gives tourists a huge selection.  The territory has two dining rooms (winter and summer), a cafe and three bars.  In addition, you can always rent a barbecue area or barbecue and organize a real picnic.  The tastes of everyone are different, so the leaders decided not to make vouchers for food.  Maybe one of the vacationers would prefer to walk all day, and dine with green salad, and the other will order a full five-time diet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bay azure novosibirsk region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1930401.jpg" width="600"></div>
