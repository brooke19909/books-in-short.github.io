Some of them delight us with culinary delights, because you can prepare delicious dishes from a variety of vegetables and fruits, while others, in the form of multicolor foliage, pardon your eyes with their bright colors.  Usually, all this beauty almost instantly falls with a variegated blanket to the ground, which is why it quickly loses its attractiveness.  Unfortunately, few people know what can be made of <span>natural material,</span> thereby prolonging its life.  But crafts from leaflets, cones and chestnuts are not only funny figures and applications (although how can one imagine childhood without these cute little things?), But also an original and really beautiful decor of housing. </p>

    <h2>  Transformation of flora into fauna </h2><p>  To begin with, we will tell you how to make a variety of animals from natural material.  First of all, we distinguish between types of crafts.  These can be applications that are created using leaves and small elements.  Such material is usually glued to the base - a cardboard sheet, cloth or wooden board with glue stick or PVA.  A similar composition is flat and looks like a picture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With the help of leaves and blades of grass, you can create a variety of representatives of the animal world, the main thing is to choose the right material according to colors, size and texture.  Craft "come to life", if it is supplemented with a picture, making the beast face, tail, or even prey.  Miniature details can also be created from natural material by cutting leaves in some places to remove excess.  It‚Äôs better to glue the elements on the schematic image of the animal, so it will be easier to maintain symmetry and select individual parts of the figure. </p>

    <p>  However, there is another type of crafts in the form of animals.  This may be a bulk composition of natural material.  Most often, nuts, acorns, cones and chestnuts are used.  The body and head are made of them, and matches, twigs, floristic wire or plasticine serve as legs, paws, neck.  To do such crafts from natural materials quickly and beautifully, you can even use ready-made animal figures, if only they fit organically into the general concept. </p>

    <h2>  Wayward tangle </h2><p>  The most popular hero and prototype of children's figures at kindergarten exhibitions is none other than a hedgehog.  This prickly inhabitant of the forest is not in vain considered a symbol of autumn, because the attributes of this season are very ‚Äúto his face‚Äù: nuts, mushrooms, apples and berries.  A hedgehog made of natural material can be made from leaflets, for example, like this in the photo below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Its creation will not be particularly difficult.  The main thing is to pick up a lot of leaves of the same size and shape.  Elongated leaves with sharp tips are best suited, from which you will get needles for a prickly lump.  You can decorate the hedgehog with an apple and a mushroom of a different color, the muzzle, tummy and paws should also be slightly different from the fur coat of the animal.  The final touches are the bean nose, mouth and eyes. </p><p>  Below is another hedgehog made of natural material made from plasticine and pumpkin seeds.  This is a voluminous craft, miniature, but extremely cute.  Placing a hedgehog on an impromptu hemp and complementing it with a green spruce twig and a bunch of red berries (mountain ash, hawthorn, dog rose), you will complete the work, and you will get a wonderful composition of natural material. </p>

    <h2>  Winged miracle </h2><p>  Another favorite of children and adults is a round-eyed owl.  This bird can be made in a variety of ways: from a piece of bark, feathers, thread, leaves.  We will demonstrate to our readers a wonderful and very simple craftsmanship.  Such an owl made of natural material consists of a pine cone, several acorn hats, ‚Äúhelicopters‚Äù taken from ash or maple, hop cones and a couple of pieces of bark.  In order to assemble the craft, you need to stock up with good glue - it can be ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecond‚Äù or silicone for a hot gun. </p>

    <h2>  Autumn landscape </h2><p>  Talking about crafts, it is impossible to ignore such a kind of creativity as application.  A little higher, we have already talked about how, with the help of leaves, you can lay out figures of animals and birds, but what else can be done from natural material?  An excellent craft would be a fantasy landscape in which one leaf turns into a whole tree, and their combination - into a real dense forest.  To compose such a composition, it is very important to choose the ideal material, because it will need to be glued to the paper as a whole, and all the flaws will be visible on the sheet when laid out.  With the help of such an application, one can clearly demonstrate the whole riot of colors of a withering nature and organically place leaves taken from different trees. </p><p>  Autumn vegetation also receives an unusual embodiment in the form of representatives of the underwater world.  From miniature oblong and oval leaves, very plausible flocks of nimble fish are obtained, more material can easily be turned into pot-bellied crucian carp, and different blades of grass and thin branches will make up the flora that grows at the bottom of the sea.  Making the composition inside the cardboard box, you get a wonderful "aquarium". </p>

    <h2>  Simple but tasteful </h2><p>  There are crafts in our list, which will not be easy to do, because it will take a little longer than creating familiar products from leaves and fruits, but they are more durable, practical and useful.  This primarily relates to wall panels.  The basis of our proposed compositions is a plank, but it can be replaced with cardboard covered in cloth.  It can be burlap, linen canvas, <span>homespun cloth.</span>  The purpose of the work is to create a specific plot, it can be a village house, a forest landscape, a river, an apiary, a shed with firewood or a small wagon.  On the basis of the proposed photo, you can make excellent crafts from natural material in the kindergarten, which will be useful not only as an exhibit, but will also become an excellent decoration of the group. </p><p>  To create composition elements, you will need to prepare various objects: </p><ul><li>  straight sticks; </li><li>  small twigs resembling trees; </li><li>  pieces of bark for walls, roofs, mountains; </li><li>  moss; </li><li>  small and neat leaflets; </li><li>  dried flowers; </li><li>  nutshells; </li><li>  "Log" of sticks. </li></ul><p>  You can add color variety using pre-made figurines of pumpkins and apples.  With the help of paints, it will be necessary to finalize the picture by completing patterns on buildings and other man-made elements (you can use a burner for the same purpose), landscape, sky.  All parts are fixed to the base with glue. </p>

    <p>  The collection of panels must begin, as in the case of the application, with the creation of a schematic image.  This will help to determine the places of arrangement of elements, their sizes and visual harmonization of the entire composition.  It‚Äôs better to open the craftwork over with varnish - this will make it more resistant to external influences. </p><h2>  Wish tree </h2><p>  Next in our review will be a tree made of natural material.  This topic is relevant in several seasons, as it can be an autumn or winter crafts.  Additional materials in each case are used different, although the basis is often the same - a beautiful branch.  Only in the case of autumn crafts, it remains unprocessed, but a <span>winter tree</span> made of natural material can be covered with a layer of white or silver acrylic paint. </p><p>  As a decor for a tree, use any materials you like - these are leaves and garlands of them, berries, nuts, fruits, miniature crafts, including paper.  In this list, bumps should be separately noted - they are the basis for many interesting ideas. </p><p>  Of those that grow on Christmas trees, you can easily create wonderful elves - real forest spirits.  Curly oak leaves will become their wings, a bunch of colored wool for felting or floristic sisal will turn into luxurious hair, and wonderful caps can be made from felt or acorn.  It would be a pity to take such crafts from natural material to the kindergarten - they are so funny. </p>

    <h2>  Natural topiary </h2><p>  Recently, the topiary among the autumn crafts deservedly holds the topiary.  From natural material, you can make many options for small trees with a round crown.  Traditionally, it is a ball decorated with flowers, shells, nuts, coffee beans or any other medium-sized objects that can be compactly and neatly fixed to the base.  The crown is mounted on a trunk planted in a small flower pot. </p><p>  <span>Autumn topiary</span> made from natural material is best done in natural colors.  It can be all the same crimson leaves collected in a magnificent bunch, or artificial decorative elements.  The main feature of the topiary is their symmetry.  The tree should look beautiful and neat from all sides, additional decorations are distributed evenly over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe spherical crown.  When assembling it, it is better not to overdo it with the decor, especially with large details.  We propose to make a wonderful topiary of chestnuts and sisal.  Its charm and elegance are in a laconic form and restrained decor.  Not everyone can find such miniature cones, but they can be replaced with acorns, hazel, berries or wooden beads. </p>

    <h2>  Successful combination </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of autumn is that at this time of year nature itself offers us such paints that perfectly combine with each other.  Looking at the riot of colors outside the window, I want to take a piece of this happiness to my home.  To cope with such a task is easier than simple, you just need to make an autumn bouquet of natural material.  Whatever you add to this composition, it will look beautiful.  It is also encouraging that such decoration can decorate a house not only inside but also outside.  So, from leaves, cones and beautiful twigs, you can make door wreaths, flower arrangements and street bouquets that will look great in pot-bellied <span>pumpkin vases.</span> </p><p>  Autumn flowers are a separate topic for conversation.  Nature, preparing for a long winter, pleases with a stunning abundance of chrysanthemums, oak, asters and dahlias.  Their magnificent colorful corollas combine perfectly with a variety of natural materials.  The classic composition can be generously flavored with luxurious maple leaves, a crimson branch of wild grapes or a twig of yellow-lettuce willow.  Bushy plants with late elastic berries (dog rose, hawthorn, mountain ash) will be an excellent and especially relevant addition. </p><p>  A bouquet of autumn leaves and flowers may be small, crowning one small vase, but a multi-tiered composition will look no less appropriate.  When composing it, it is important to observe the proportions, making each new "floor" slightly smaller than the previous one. </p>

    <h2>  Seasonal Decor </h2><p>  Finally, we will share with readers the ideas of the original autumn crafts, with which you can decorate the house, make it a little more comfortable and warmer.  The multi-colored foliage on the trees will not please for long, it will fall off with the first frost, but it is very simple to make the view from the window not so dull and gray.  To do this, you just need to string small, but always beautiful leaflets on long threads or a fishing line in the form of garlands that decorate window openings. </p><p>  Golden autumn can also be "brought" home in the form of elegant candlesticks or vases.  For this, a jar of an interesting shape or an ordinary transparent glass needs to be pasted over in a circle with colored leaves.  Freshly collected material will not lie on the vessel beautifully, for a start it will need to be dried a little so that the elasticity leaves the sheet and it becomes more malleable.  You need to work with ordinary PVA, it will perfectly fix the decor on the glass, and after drying it will become transparent.  In addition, this type of glue is not afraid of the heat of a burning candle inside a glass. </p>
