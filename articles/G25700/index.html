Today Marriott Hotels <strong> </strong>  They are located on all <span>continents of the Earth,</span> excluding Antarctica, and are represented by 2.5 thousand hotels and restaurants that serve more than 200 thousand people. </p><p>  Such a wide location of Marriott hotels is possible thanks to the business scheme, according to which all new franchised hotel complexes are opened under this brand.  It follows that the founder family of this network has full rights only to a small part of all hotel business enterprises, namely 6 hotels.  Everything else belongs to different people, which does not prevent them from following the tradition that Marriott hotels always set a high standard of quality in everything. </p><p>  Under this brand, there are not only luxury hotels, but also middle-class hotels, as well as Howard Johnson restaurants.  During the existence of the Marriott brand, its owners had to go through several unpleasant moments.  So in 2001, the company filed several lawsuits from hoteliers working on a franchise.  They reported that the terms of the contract were not respected by the founders of the network.  In those years, Marriott hotels were on the verge of survival, as their stocks fell steadily down, but since 2003 the situation has changed radically.  Now to have stocks of this company in its stock is the key to financial well-being. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the most famous hotels of this chain is Goa Marriott Resort 5 *, located in the famous Indian premium resort of Goa.  It is a three-story building with 165 spacious rooms.  The hotel is located almost in the center of the island. </p><p>  In each room, guests will find an iron, an ironing board, a <span>TV, a mini-safe, a</span> bathroom, tea and coffee sets and a hairdryer.  If necessary, you can use services such as dry cleaning, ironing, help of a nanny or doctor, spend time in the fitness room or change your appearance in the beauty salon.  Another feature of this particular hotel was the best diving school in the resort.  On its territory there are 3 restaurants, a pastry shop, a bar and a night club.  Only the best chefs from around the world work here, and Wan Hao Restaurant was recognized as the best in cooking <span>Chinese cuisine.</span> </p><p>  Such Marriott hotels are designed not only to relax in the company of friends, but also with the whole family, because the most caring nannies and doctors will always come to help at the first call.  Parents can safely rest without worrying about their child.  Among other things, there are 5 conference halls, a children's playground, a newspaper stall, souvenir shops, a panoramic pool and much more. </p><p>  All reviews about Marriott hotels are exceptionally positive, as the management strictly monitors the quality of service.  And also pleasantly pleases its regular guests with big discounts.  So, having lived for several days at the hotel, you can get an invitation to the procedures in the spa salon, which is considered to be the best in the world. </p><p>  Mariot has existed in Russia for a long time and has its regular fans among senior people, deputies and others.  Today, their hotels are located not only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but also in Irkutsk, Tyumen and Kazan.  All of them are role models in the hotel industry. </p><p>  In addition, the Marriott group of companies is striving to improve the environment.  In hotels located in America and Canada, a smoking ban has been imposed since 2006. </p><p>  The hotels of this chain are not only comfortable and respectable, but also with great care for their guests.  So regular customers periodically receive gifts from Marriott in the form of a free breakfast, discounts on accommodation or spa services.  Following the traditions of hospitality and quality in everything, this company has maintained a leading position in the hotel business for many years. </p>
