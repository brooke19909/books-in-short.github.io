    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  What are the numbers in Preslav 3 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands)?  They are different.  Some are air-conditioned, well-kept, with beautiful furniture, nice, comfortable beds, and TVs.  Some even with internet access.  So it‚Äôs possible to live in these rooms.  But some rooms are not very.  In some rooms there is no air conditioning, TV.  Outwardly, these numbers look as if they had not been cleaned for a hundred years.  All this creates a lot of problems for the guests who settled in them.  So it‚Äôs worth considering before choosing such a number.  But then again, it all depends on the price.  But not only that.  Due to its proximity to the garden, various insects can live in the hotel, which penetrate the rooms every now and then.  And in the most groomed.  It can be, for example, cockroaches.  These insects create a lot of problems and scare the owners of such numbers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can choose the option of living cleaner and more decent, but such a room will cost a lot.  Any whim of a tourist for his money, only if he has this money.  If he cannot afford more serious expenses, then there is nothing to say about a decent room.  All this creates a lot of problems and negative emotions. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  But what about the staff of Preslav Hotel 3 * (Golden Sands)?  What is he like?  Here you can talk about anything.  The staff is the most diverse.  Some are lazy, knowing nothing and not wanting, others are helpful and very attentive to guests.  For example, the rescue team on the beach does not always work in a timely manner.  The cleaners, for example, do not clean all the rooms as well as we would like.  And they don‚Äôt go to some for weeks.  Maids charge extra for their services.  This also negatively affects the attitude of tourists, who subsequently write reviews about the hotel, often expressing their dissatisfaction. </p><h2>  Preslav 3 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands): reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists express an average position on this hotel.  On the one hand, most of those who visited it noted wonderful rooms, caring staff, delicious food, a wonderful clean pool, proximity to the sea and other entertainment.  But some write that bedding simply does not change for two whole weeks.  Some people are indignant at the same food in the dining room.

Therefore, he occupies an average position in the ranking of various <span>hotels in Bulgaria.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, the hotel Preslav 3 * (Golden Sands, Bulgaria), reviews of which were presented to your attention in the article, as already mentioned, occupies an average position.  It has both positive and negative sides.  Reviews of tourists about him are also different.  Nevertheless, it is not bad for those who are not going to spend their entire vacation in a room.  This is a normal option for travelers who return to their rooms to spend the night, put themselves in order, and in the morning go further to explore the country.  And around there are many attractions and entertainment.  There are all the possibilities for a good rest and recovery.  In addition, the advantage of this hotel may be its proximity to the sea coast, water parks and other entertainment in the vicinity.  So those who want to travel around Bulgaria should consider staying at this hotel.  This is an inexpensive option with good living conditions, decent food and a good sea. </p><p>  Definitely not worth going here with seven children and those who on vacation can not live without comfort.  There is no animation at the hotel, so if you are used to the fact that you and your kids are constantly occupied and entertained, think about choosing this option.  It is quiet, there are no discos and fun evenings.  For some, this is a disadvantage, but for someone it is an undeniable advantage.  The beach at the hotel is good, the sea is clean, the bottom is sandy.  Of course, you won‚Äôt dive here, but this is the specificity of the region.  The rest is the whole range of beach activities.  A rescue team is on duty on the shore, the beach is cleaned daily.  There are no complaints in this regard. </p><p>  Many tourists like having their own garden in the hotel - a quiet green corner for a secluded relaxation after a hot noisy resort day.  Also, vacationers praise the pools and fitness center on site.  But a lot of reviews about the "Soviet" territory and the wretchedness of the rooms.  Choose "preslav" or not - it's up to you.  It all depends on what service you are used to, how much you are willing to spend and what you expect from a vacation in Bulgaria. </p>
