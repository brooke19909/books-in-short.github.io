However, many still do not know anything about her.  This is a very distinctive state, located next to the major oil producing powers in southwest Asia.  Here you can go on amazing tours of Wahib sands and medieval forts, appreciate the ancient Nizwa and Muscat oasis. </p><h2>  Why Oman? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloomberg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oman Hotels" class="if uuid-2948532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948532.jpg"></div><p>  According to the latest reviews of tourists about holidays in Oman, you can get a complete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhy travelers from Russia are increasingly choosing this country.  Its advantage over most other countries of the Persian Gulf lies in the fact that it is here that extremely picturesque and diverse nature is spread.  In a small area you will be able to encounter waterfalls and mountains, tropics and savannahs, fjords. </p><p>  In addition, an original Arab and Eastern culture has been preserved here.  This is the only state in the Middle East, which until now has not fully fallen under the influence of modern civilization, while being able to maintain a high standard of living.  In addition, in the latest reviews of tourists about holidays in Oman, travelers note a rich excursion program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the state is more suitable for fans of a relaxing beach holiday or for lovers to walk around picturesque places and medieval ruins.  But young people who prefer outdoor activities will be bored here.  There are practically no night clubs, there are very few evening entertainments. </p><p>  Oman is a famous ancient state.  It was on the territory of this country that Job was buried, the legendary Queen of Sheba ruled here, from here Sinbad the Sailor set sail.  Now it is ruled by the sultan, who pays special attention to ecology.  According to the latest reviews of tourists about holidays in Oman, one can judge that literally in all corners of the country one can stumble upon national parks.  There are unique animals in the local reserves - this is a giant sea turtle, Oryx antelope, Arabian tahr, leopards, wolves, ash falcons, <span>striped hyenas.</span> </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of holidays in Oman, the most common entertainment that attracts most travelers is scuba diving.  By the number of people who are fond of diving and underwater fishing, this country takes the second place in the world after Egypt.  In addition, there are all conditions for karting and motorsport. </p><h2>  Resort cities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Country oman" class="if uuid-2948529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948529.jpg"></div><p>  The capital of the country is called Muscat.  This is a progressive and modern city in which representatives of a dozen nationalities live.  It has many cultural and historical attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Smaller resorts - Salalah, Nizwa, Sur, Sohar, Dakm.  They also have a wide variety of interesting places that are definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Immediately warn that problems may arise with the road to the resort, as there are no direct flights from Russia to Oman. </p><p>  The best option is to go from Moscow to Dubai (the journey takes about five hours), and from there you can already get to Muscat.  The second flight will take only about fifty minutes. </p><p>  Another option is to take advantage of the offer from Qatar Airways.  In five hours and twenty minutes you will reach the capital of Qatar, Doha.  The flight to Muscat takes another three hours. </p><p>  You can also get to this country with transfers in Istanbul or Abu Dhabi. </p><p>  A visa can be issued directly at the airport of arrival.  It will be issued to you by the representative of the meeting party in the transit zone.  Another option is to contact the embassy yourself.  Also, tourists are advised to pre-arrange medical insurance for the entire trip. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays with children in Oman" class="if uuid-2948528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948528.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews about holidays in Oman with children, it can be concluded that your whole family will be comfortable here.  The country has a predominantly arid subtropical climate with a pronounced monsoon influence.  In summer, it is wet and hot on the coast, and in the interior, on the contrary, it is dry.  But winter is moderately warm everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is believed that it is best to fly to Oman from September to April, as from May to August it is too hot and humid.  Rains are a rarity, for example, in Muscat, from 320 to 350 sunny days a year.  The average temperature in the capital in September is 36 degrees Celsius, in January it drops to +25, and in June and July it rises to 39-41 degrees above zero. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oman Attractions" class="if uuid-2948533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948533.jpg"></div><p>  The star rating of the hotels you can stay in is in accordance with international classification.  They provide here the highest level of service, which corresponds to the best hotels in the United Arab Emirates.  Most hotels are located in the capital of Muscat. </p><p>  Among domestic tourists, 4-5-star hotels located directly on the coast are popular.  Some have their own stretches of beaches, others provide access to municipal ones.  For example, it happens that a hotel stands on the shore, but the last ten meters from the sea may belong to the state. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.neverendingvoyage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Holidays in Oman" class="if uuid-2948530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948530.jpg"></div><p>  Talking about reviews of a beach holiday in Oman with children, travelers note that the coast is visited by a large number of local residents, especially in the evening and on weekends, which in this country fall on Thursday and Friday. </p><p>  The best beaches can provide hotels Chedi, Al Bustan Palace, Crowne Plaza Muscat, Shangri-La Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa.  In the latest reviews of tourists about a beach holiday in Oman, it is noted that these hotels stand out from the rest, as they are guarded and fenced.  All beaches are sandy. </p><p>  When checking into a hotel, keep in mind that in the room you may get three-pin sockets, which are very common here.  So it‚Äôs better to take care of the adapter in advance. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbesmiddleeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oman Resorts" class="if uuid-2948527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948527.jpg"></div><p>  If you are going on holiday to Oman with children, then remember that the local cuisine is distinguished by large portions and an acceptable sharpness of dishes.  In Southeast Asia, spices are added significantly more than here. </p><p>  Experienced travelers will definitely advise you to try the menu of seafood and fish, cooked with local seasonings and spices.  A special exotic is to try shark meat, it is served here in almost every restaurant.  Of the desserts, dates and halva are in demand. </p><p>  The traditional local drink is coffee.  It must be firmly brewed, adding ground bones, cardamom, a little pink water.  At the end of the meal, caraway seeds are served to refresh the oral cavity. </p><p>  Decent restaurants are usually located at hotels.  In the cities themselves, you can mainly find small eateries or cafes that are suitable for a quick and easy snack. </p><p>  Remember one local rule.  In Oman, it is not customary to take food with your left hand.  And if the guest feels that he is full, he will not be able to eat more, but at the same time the hosts continue to treat him, then it is enough for him to shake a cup of rice in his hands to signal this.  It is customary to take boiled cereal from plates with hands in small pinches.  Some pasty dishes are allowed to take directly with a piece of bread. </p><h2>  sights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.audleytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Oman" class="if uuid-2948531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2948531.jpg"></div><p>  From the photo in the reviews about holidays in Oman you will see that in this country there really is something to see.  There are many amazing sights here, ready to impress even experienced travelers. </p><p>  For example, Oman is known for its fortified powerful forts.  There are about five hundred of them in the country.  In the capital of Muscat, there are two at once - Mirani and Jalali.  The fort at the foot of the Ahdar Mountains, called Bahla, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Particularly impressive are its walls with a length of about eleven kilometers. </p><p>  Most of the mountain ranges in these places seem to be cut by channels of dried rivers, along which it is customary to lay new roads.  Going to the sands of Wahib, be sure to pay attention to the highest dunes on the planet. </p><p>  Local national parks are home to a large number of rare and amazing animals.  Many specially go to the island of Mazira to look at the giant sea turtles that breed right there. </p><p>  Of the religious monuments, the mosque of Sheikh Qaboos deserves special attention.  It contains the largest carpet on the planet, whose weight is twenty-one tons. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In reviews of the country of Oman, holidays in it, tourists admit that the eastern beauty here is simply captivating. </p><p>  Local authorities and residents in our time have managed to maintain the classic spirit of the real East and unique identity.  Everyone is advised to visit Muscat, which several years ago was officially recognized as the best Arabian tourist capital in the world. </p><p>  Here you will not find skyscrapers, but instead of them there will be many low old houses with sparkling white roofs. </p><p>  In the Qaboos bin Saeed Mosque, you can fully appreciate the oriental desire for luxury.  It contains the largest crystal chandelier on the planet.  About eight hundred tons of marble were spent on the construction of the entire mosque. </p><p>  This modern building, the construction of which began only in 1985, is opposed by an old market called Mutrah.  On it, local merchants, like several thousand years ago, offer to buy seasonings, incense, silver jewelry. </p><p>  During trips to the sultanate you can get acquainted with the diversity of the local culture and landscapes. </p>
