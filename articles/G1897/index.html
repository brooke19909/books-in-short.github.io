  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crafts with cats: interesting ideas from improvised materials</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cats are one of the most amazing animals.  They live next to people for more than five millennia.  They combine many conflicting qualities - sensitivity, kindness, pride, independence, etc. Cats have become very popular animals in folklore, literature.  In addition, children simply adore them.  That is why cat crafts are very popular.  Let's consider different options for creating crafts from improvised materials. </p><h2>  Chenille wire cats </h2><p>  Chenille wire is a very pleasant and soft material that children like crazy.  Make a cat out of it for a child is not difficult. </p><p>  Take for a cotton ball of different diameters.  The smaller will be used for the head, the larger for the torso.  Make a small hole and apply some silicone glue from the gun to it.  Next, we take a brown or gray chenille wire, insert it into the hole and begin to carefully wrap around the ball.  Similarly, wrap the second ball with wire. </p><p>  Then with glue we connect the torso and head of the cat.  We twist paws, ears and a muzzle from a white wire.  Now we connect all the parts with glue.  It remains to make a tail from the wire with a white tip and glue the eyes.  Antennae can be made of ordinary wire.  Nice little kitten is ready. </p><p>  Chenille wire is a very convenient material from which you can create a variety of designs.  Imagine with your child and make a whole family of cats! </p><div class="photo" data-original="spt.co.th" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cat crafts" class="if uuid-2233193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233193.jpg"></div><h2>  Felting cat </h2><p>  Another great option is to make a felting cat using the felting technique.  Such a figure will turn out to be very cute and realistic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We take two foam balls.  They can be purchased in the store for creativity.  You can buy balls in the shape of an egg.  With a smaller ball we cut a little, this will be the head of the cat.  We insert a toothpick inside the larger of the balls, prick a small ball and glue them with glue. </p><p>  Now we take special needles and wool <span>for felting.</span>  <span>We put the</span> material on the foam with the <span>needles</span> .  You can take any colors.  White cats with black spots look beautiful.  We twist the tail, ears and paws in the palms and glue it.  Eyes can be made from cardboard or purchased "running" eyes for crafts.  The antennae are made of thread or wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jezebel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts with cats" class="if uuid-2233190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233190.jpg"></div><h2>  Cork cat </h2><p>  Crafts with cats can be made from a variety of materials.  This can be plain paper, plasticine, woolen balls.  Now we will make a cat out of a float or cork. </p><ol><li>  We cut out the head and body of the future cat from the float. </li><li>  Paws, neck and tail are made of copper wire. </li><li>  Glue the wire joints with ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù. </li><li>  Now we need a woolen thread.  We put glue on the head, fix the thread on the wire and wrap the head with wool. </li><li>  Then, starting with the palms, we wrap the front legs in the same way, after covering the wire with glue.  Next, we wind the hind legs, trunk and tail. </li><li>  Ears can be made from ordinary paper clips.  First we wrap the wire itself, then completely ears.  Apply glue and glue the ears to the cat's head. </li><li>  Eyes can be made from pins with colored beads at the end.  We shorten the pins with the help of nippers and insert them in the right place. </li><li>  We make a nose out of a buckwheat seed. </li><li>  We make a mustache from a thin fishing line, carefully draw a mouth. </li></ol><p>  The result was a very cute woolen craft.  Cats and cats can be of many different colors.  Experiment with threads, use different colors to make the toy interesting and unusual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diy-is-fun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts with cats" class="if uuid-2233191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233191.jpg"></div><h2>  Sponge cat </h2><p>  Even two-three-year-old kids can do this cat work with the help of their parents.  It is ideal for playing with a small child, because it is soft, but at the same time elastic.  If you make eyes from a button, the child will be able to play with the cat in the bathroom. </p><p>  We take an ordinary colored sponge, tightly bandage it just above the middle so that the head is slightly smaller than the body.  We tie the sponge with a thread so that we get ears.  To give an acute shape, you can slightly cut the sponge with scissors.  Make a cat‚Äôs eyes and nose out of buttons or cardboard.  Black woolen threads are suitable as a mustache.  You can tie a beautiful bow around your neck.  Another cat craft is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="funfamilycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts cat and cat" class="if uuid-2233189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233189.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, you can make a toy from any materials.  To do this, pebbles, shells, epoxy, etc. can be used. You can make a cat in the form of candles made of paraffin. </p><p>  The possibilities for creativity are limited only by imagination and desire.  It is in your power to turn a child‚Äôs childhood into a real fairy tale! </p>
