The famous Latvian health resort is known for its chic sandy beaches and incredibly healing air.  <span>Rest in Jurmala</span> (Latvia) has always been considered not only useful, but also prestigious. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Jurmala (Latvia) is rightly called the largest resort in the country.  The city has a well-developed infrastructure and a rich cultural life.  The biggest pride of the resort are beaches, which are placers of quartz sand.  The coast of Jurmala annually attracts tens of thousands of tourists.  The modern city is divided into 16 districts.  A distinctive feature of the resort is a rich cultural life.  Festivals and other entertainment events are regularly held here throughout the year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Latvia Jurmala" class="if uuid-2972237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2972237.jpg"></div><p>  The population of the city is approximately 50 thousand people.  Jurmala is located just 25 kilometers from Riga. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  According to archaeologists and historians, people appeared on the territory of modern Jurmala not 750 years ago, according to the first written records dated 1245, but much earlier.  During excavations, specialists found objects of labor that were made in 2400-1800 BC.  e.  (during the late Neolithic period).  The fact that such finds are far from unique indicates that ancient people lived here settled.  It is known that the settlement was located in the Priedain valley.  Primitive settlers chose such quiet places for life, since in them they were more protected from natural disasters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The status of the resort of Jurmala (Latvia) acquired only after the region was transferred to Russia.  The starting point can be considered the year 1783, when the Sloksky district was annexed to Vidzeme, which became part of the Russian Empire.  After 20-25 years (in the first half of the nineteenth century), Riga's rich and landowners came into vogue to relax in Jurmala in the summer.  Initially, guests stayed in the homes of local fishermen.  But the land owners decided to sell the plots at a high price for development.  Since then, a real construction boom has begun.  The popularity of recreation in the region grew every year. </p><p>  In 1824, transport links with Riga were established.  At first, stagecoaches began to run on the seaside, and then a steamboat was launched.  In Dubulti in 1832, the Russian commander Barclay de Tolly built a house for himself.  After the steamboat was launched between Dubulti and Riga, the resort's popularity increased even more.  Nevertheless, the greatest prosperity came with the opening of the railway in 1877, connecting Riga and Tukums.  Gradually, the fame of Jurmala (Latvia) spread to other Russian provinces.  Wealthy people combined bathing with therapeutic procedures in equipped baths.  By 1845, 3,000 such places were equipped on the coast.  Until the end of the nineteenth century, gentlemen and ladies bathed on the beaches separately. </p><p>  The first sanatoriums can be called summer private clinics, which were opened by doctors.  The most famous healers were Til, Maximovich and Nodstr√∂m.  After the revolution, medical facilities began to be built on the seaside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Jurmala areas </h2><p>  The indigenous inhabitants of Jurmala in Latvia (photo is given in the article) divide the resort into many microdistricts - by the number of villages included in its composition.  But not every region boasts attractions, so holidaymakers do not look into many of them. </p><p>  In terms of places of interest, travelers should pay attention to the Majori, Dubulti, Dzintari and Melluzhi areas. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  The beaches and the sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJurmala (Latvia) is the main attraction of the resort.
