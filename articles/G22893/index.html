Rest in this state brings only positive emotions.  However, to spend a vacation without thinking about the problems, you need to prepare well for it.  In this article you will see a list of things that you need to take to Vietnam to relax in comfort. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  The first and most important of what you will need in Vietnam is the documents.  They need to be prepared in advance.  Before leaving, be sure to check whether you have exactly taken the following with you: </p><ul><li>  international passport; </li><li>  travel voucher; </li><li>  airplane tickets; </li><li>  insurance; </li><li>  confirmation of hotel reservation; </li><li>  visa - you will need it if you intend to stay in Vietnam for more than 15 days; </li><li>  set of photos. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="travglobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to bring to Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551080.jpg"></div><p>  You will not have a question about what to bring to Vietnam from the documents if you use the services of a travel agency.  Specialists who work in this industry will provide you with complete information about the required securities.  But if you are going to conquer Vietnam alone, then you will have to prepare for your vacation yourself. </p><p>  Once you have fully assembled the set of necessary documents, make photocopies of them.  The fact is that for safety, the originals are offered to be left in the hotel safe.  It‚Äôs enough to have copies with you.  In addition, if you intend to travel in Vietnam by car, take care of the availability of local rights.  Or rent a car with a driver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Money </h2><p>  One of the most important aspects of travel is finance.  Of course, rest becomes much more pleasant and exciting if you do not experience material difficulties.  In order not to carry cash, you can use a credit card.  Equipment for paying for goods and services with cards is available in almost all hotels and supermarkets.  Cash is useful, for example, for going to the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="currencyconvertersinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much money to bring to Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551083.jpg"></div><p>  In order to create a budget and know exactly how much money to bring to Vietnam, you need to know in advance the rates for hotel accommodation and meals, as well as add a certain amount for the purchase of souvenirs.  The minimum cost of travel per day is $ 30 (a little less than 2000 rubles).  This includes the cost of living in an economy class room, poor food and cheap souvenirs. </p><h2>  What will the money go for? </h2><p>  The cost of living in Vietnam depends on many factors.  Firstly, food prices will vary depending on where exactly the meal is.  Lunch in a cafe is cheaper than in a restaurant.  As an option, you can purchase the necessary products in the supermarket and cook your favorite dishes yourself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, the transport that you use to travel around the country decides a lot.  A bus ride is cheaper than a taxi service.  The most expensive vehicles are elephants, horses and ostriches.  Of course, these animals will not cover the same distance as, for example, a bus, but a walk on them will give you a pleasant experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to bring to Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551088.jpg"></div><p>  Thirdly, visiting many attractions is paid.  To get to the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, the Temple of Literature or the Hue Citadel, you will have to purchase a ticket.  Thus, how much money to take with you to Vietnam, you decide.  The budget depends on your desires.  Of course, a beach holiday will be much cheaper than exploring local attractions. </p><h2>  Suitcase </h2><p>  What to bring to Vietnam - to Nha Trang or any other city?  A very important thing is a correctly selected suitcase.  If you plan to travel often, it would be advisable to purchase an expensive, but high-quality suitcase that will survive more than one trip.  In addition to it, you can buy organizer bags for cosmetics, shoes and underwear.  Then all things will be neatly folded.  In addition, you need to choose a high-quality backpack, which will play the role of hand luggage, and subsequently will become an indispensable assistant when walking around Vietnam.  The necessary documents, first-aid kit, water and equipment should be placed here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Medicines </h2><p>  Another question that plagues many travelers is: ‚ÄúWhat medicines should I take to Vietnam?‚Äù  Do not rely on local pharmacies and hospitals.  The fact is that some drugs can cause allergies.  It is best to collect a personal first-aid kit, all the medicines from which are right for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.awortheyread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What medicines to take to Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551097.jpg"></div><p>  So, here is what you need to take with you to Vietnam: </p><ul><li>  Antipyretic and painkillers. </li><li>  Lotions, moisturizers and sunburns. </li><li>  Drugs that help in the fight against allergies. </li><li>  Any readily available disinfectants. </li><li>  Sprays or creams for protection against insects, especially mosquitoes. </li><li>  Medicines that you take on an ongoing basis. </li><li>  Iodine, Zelenka and adhesive.  They will not be superfluous and will not take up much space in the luggage, but you can handle any scratch as soon as possible.  However, they can just be bought at a local pharmacy. </li></ul><p>  When wondering what to bring with you to Vietnam, remember: domestic insects do not always scare away local insects.  Therefore, most likely, you will also have to buy something to protect against annoying mosquitoes upon arrival. </p><h2>  clothing </h2><p>  What to take to Vietnam so as not to overload the suitcase with unnecessary things?  This question torments many travelers.  It is impossible to give him such an answer that will suit everyone without exception, because each person is individual.  However, there are a number of general tips that will be useful to any tourist. </p><ul><li>  Prepare several sets of clothes in advance.  All things should be light and not take up much space.  T-shirts, T-shirts, shorts, and trousers made of thin cotton fabrics are best suited. </li><li>  When deciding what to bring to Vietnam, do not forget about swimming accessories.  Pack at least two swimsuits. </li><li>  Vietnam is a very sunny country.  Whether you intend to spend a vacation on the beach, or to visit local museums - it does not matter.  In any case, you will need a hat.  It is better to give preference to light caps or hats, but leave the models of dark colors at home. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothing to Vietnam what to take" class="if uuid-2551105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551105.jpg"></div><ul><li>  For walks you will need comfortable shoes.  The beach can be reached in sandals, slippers or flip flops, but walking around the city will be more comfortable if you make them in sneakers. </li><li>  You can come to Vietnam in the winter season.  This does not mean that you need to pack several warm jackets or coats in a suitcase.  Since winters are rainy and mild in this country, you need to take a long-sleeve sweater, tight jeans and a raincoat. </li><li>  The most important advice is not to burden yourself with tons of unnecessary clothes.  According to statistics, most of the items brought remain unpacked.  Take only the clothes that you definitely need, and the rest, if necessary, can be purchased at the local market upon arrival. </li></ul><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  The question ‚Äúwhat to bring with you to Vietnam‚Äù arises in full swing if a couple with children is going to visit this state.  The contents of the luggage changes significantly, because you need to provide for all the little things.  Going on a trip with the children, make a detailed list of the things you need to take, and check with him when packing your suitcase.  Here's what tourists with children need: </p><ul><li>  Water and some foods that the child eats at home.  It can be cookies or sweets, dried fruits or waffles.  Why take food with you?  It's simple: it will be much easier for the child to get used to the unusual Vietnamese cuisine. </li><li>  The first-aid kit should be supplemented with preparations intended for the prevention and treatment of childhood diseases. </li><li>  Be sure to take an interesting book, pencils and coloring books, puzzles or board games to entertain the child during the flight and at the hotel. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.insuremytrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to take on vacation in Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551110.jpg"></div><h2>  Useful things </h2><p>  A comfortable stay is made up of little things.  Therefore, special attention should be paid to the right things, which do not take up much space, but will be useful to almost every tourist.  What to take to rest in Vietnam to be ready for any situation? </p><ul><li>  Pocket flashlight.  This little thing is of great benefit to tourists, because in Vietnam, a tropical night comes very quickly.  In addition, street lighting in this country cannot be called ideal. </li><li>  Sunglasses.  The Vietnamese sun mercilessly burns everything that comes in its way.  Therefore, you need to take care of protecting not only the skin, but also the eyes. </li><li>  A backpack or a comfortable bag.  This accessory is very useful for you during long walks, trips and excursions. </li><li>  Means of communication.  You will need a phone or tablet not only in order to communicate with people, but also in order to take photos.  Do not forget to purchase an international SIM card. </li><li>  Notepad and stationery.  If you cannot communicate with the local population with the help of a translator and a dictionary, you have only one option: draw what you need. </li><li>  Printout of the card.  Mark your hotel on it.  This will help you return to the hotel if you get lost in an unfamiliar city. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gottakeepmovin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What you need to take with you to Vietnam" class="if uuid-2551115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2551115.jpg"></div><h2>  What to take is not necessary </h2><p>  Some tourists want to play it safe and bring along a bunch of things that, as it later turns out, were not useful to them.  Fans of a drink should not take domestic drinks, because in Vietnam there are bars and supermarkets.  You can buy alcohol on the spot.  The prices for it, by the way, are quite budget. </p><p>  Bed linen, shampoos, dishes only hinder the tourist.  In Vietnam, the quality of service is very good, so all of the above accessories are in hotels.  It is better to leave expensive clothes and jewelry at home.  Firstly, none of the tourists and the local population are interested in your tastes.  Secondly, losing such things is very easy. </p>
