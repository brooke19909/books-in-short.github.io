Such an accessory can be an excellent protective tool in the cold season, it protects your hands well from the cold and does not hinder movements.  Also, mitts can be a great addition to everyday or evening wear. </p><p>  If you delve into history to find out ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù  and where?"  if such gloves appeared, then all sources will lead you to stories about the <span>tomb of Tutankhamun.</span>  This kind of gloves was an accessory of luxury in those days, only rich people could wear them, but over time they lost this status, and began to be considered an element of vulgarity. </p><p>  Now such gloves are not only an aesthetic accessory, but they also have practical functions. </p><p>  Mittens knit crochet or knitting.  The choice of tool should be made depending on what you are better at. </p><p>  In order to crochet mitts or knitting need: </p><p>  - decide what exactly you want to knit?  As mentioned above, the mitts are crocheted and knitted.  After choosing a tool for work, you need to determine its numbering, that is, hooks and knitting needles have different thicknesses, the thicker the selected tool, the larger the loops, the larger and thicker the product will be and vice versa. </p><p>  - scheme of knitting products.  To make an accessory you need to choose the scheme that will correspond to your intentions.  The article offers you several options for patterns that will allow you to crochet excellent mitts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scheme number 1: </p><p>  This pattern is designed for knitting from a woolen thread. </p><p>  First you need to dial fifteen air loops.  Then two rows of single crochet are crocheted.  From the third row, double crochet begins.  So it is necessary to knit twelve rows.  After this, three rows are crocheted with single crochet with the addition of loops (at the beginning or at the end of the row, as well as in the middle of it).  Three <span>double crochet stitches.</span>  The twenty first row is knitted as follows: </p><p>  - First, a hole for the thumb is knitted: two double crochet and one single crochet; </p><p>  - then the main mitten is knitted: two columns with a crochet and two without it. </p><p>  Scheme number 2: </p><p>  For threads of medium thickness (not wool).  Mittens mesh. </p><p>  A ring of air loops is dialed (you need to dial the number of loops that will completely cover your base of the arm). </p><p>  The first row is crocheted with columns, the second row is crocheted, the third is knitted, like the first.  Fourth (from this row, knitting the net begins): five air loops are knitted, then they are attached to the base through two loops and so on until the end of the row.  Fifth - seventh rows: air loops (five pieces) are knitted and tied to the middle of each air ‚Äúfive‚Äù of the previous row.  Then a row of air loops is typed, they need as many as will pass freely between the index <span>finger</span> and <span>thumb,</span> then connects to the opposite side.  Further, the mitten continues to be knitted with a net (to the base of the fingers).  Then the air loops are knitted and connected to the opposite side so that each finger is separate.  After that, each finger is tied: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - first row - single crochet; </p><p>  - second row - double crochet; </p><p>  - third row - single crochet. </p><p>  Scheme number 3: </p><p>  Mitten fits from fingers to palm.  You can use several types of threads. </p><p>  30 pieces of air loops fit (there may be more if this number of loops is small for your hand). </p><p>  Knitted twelve rows with a crochet.  Then a small number of air loops are knitted (about ten, but they may need more) - a hole for the thumb.  After that, three to four loops are skipped and the product is further knitted with crochets.  Six rows are knitted with a decrease in the loop, two rows are reduced through two rows.  The mitten is knitted to the required length with single crochet, the thumb hole is knitted separately (four rows of single crochet).  The mitt can be trimmed with embroidery, beads, threads of a different color </p><p>  In order to crochet the mitts for yourself, the scheme is optional.  You can knit on the hand.  How?  Very simple.  First, you knit a ring of such a diameter that your hand (or the hand of the person to whom you <span>knit the mitten glove)</span> passes through it without difficulty.  After you knit the desired ring, you can knit the pattern of your choice or knit an ‚Äúelastic band‚Äù from single crochet and crochet columns, and then knit the desired patterns.  Also, without a scheme, you can knit the mitts with knitting needles.  It is best to use circular knitting needles for knitting, since you will need to try on the product on hand. </p><p>  To <span>knit the mitts,</span> dial the required number of loops (how many gloves for your hand you will know when you knit the first row) and knit an elastic band.  You can without her. </p><p>  Crocheting mittens or knitting needles is not necessarily one color, you can experiment and introduce several colors in the process, but they should complement each other, and not drown out. </p><p>  Mitts can have one way out for the thumb and one for the rest, or you can knit your way out for each finger.  It already depends on your desire. </p><p>  Mittens can be either an independent accessory or worn in combination with a scarf, hat, and leggings.  A beautiful accessory will always emphasize your appearance and beauty. </p>
