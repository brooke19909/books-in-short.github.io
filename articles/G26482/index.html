The most important of them, of course, is a discount on purchases in official MTS stores.  However, if you do not need this, you can simply and very easily and quickly spend points for additional services.  It is worth noting that the discount on goods is calculated in this way: ten points are equal to one ruble of the discount.  For 10,000 points you will be given a discount of exactly one thousand Russian rubles.  It is worth emphasizing that this discount can be accrued not only for ordinary goods (telephones, headphones, etc.), but also for ordinary communication services that you will connect or pay in the MTS official store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rspectr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM cards MTS" class="if uuid-3188559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141224/3188559.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, if you do not want to go to the official store and are wondering how to transfer MTS points, then you can use the loyalty program on the Internet.  Just go to the official MTS website and select the desired section.  Then go to your account: enter your username and password.  Next, just select the desired service and purchase it.  If you are interested in a more thorough consultation, then on the official website there is information and an algorithm of actions for spending points.  However, you can use the list of actions described in the material in this article.  Follow this instruction: </p><ol><li>  Select the "Spend MTS Points" section in your main menu of the mobile operator‚Äôs site. </li><li>  Then go to the rewards block.  It will offer many different types of rewards for your accumulated points.  Starting from simple services, ending with discounts in offline stores. </li><li>  If you are comfortable, use the filters to search for new products. </li></ol><h2>  How to pay </h2><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A man is calling a mobile operator" class="if uuid-3188563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141224/3188563.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, if you decide to spend your points, initially you need to register on the site and log in to it.  Next, you need to find the goods that you are going to pay, and begin the procedure.  After that, enter your phone number to confirm that you have bonus points in your account.  The next step is to pay for the goods with points by pressing only one button.  Points will be deducted from your account and goods will arrive on your phone.  If this is a discount, a code will come, if it is a service, it will connect to your phone number. </p><p>  It is worth noting that transferring MTS points to another number is easy.  Just go to the desired section on the MTS official website, enter the subscriber number and the amount of bonuses. </p><p>  From this article, it became clear how to transfer MTS points into money.  But how to turn them into services, we have not figured out yet.  Therefore, information on this will follow. </p><h2>  Rewards </h2><p>  For 99 points you will receive only 30 minutes of calls.  However, this applies only to the numbers of the mobile operator MTS.  You can connect this service via a USSD call or on the operator‚Äôs official website. </p><p>  For 149 points you will receive the same service, but not for 30 minutes, but for the whole hour.  It costs, of course, not so expensive, and you will also be more tempted to buy exactly an hour, since in this way you save as much as 50 points. </p><h2>  SMS </h2><div class="photo" data-original="onlinekredit-zayavka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS staff" class="if uuid-3193971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141224/3193971.jpg"></div><p>  For as many as 229 points, you can buy yourself fifty free SMS to the number of any mobile operator.  Of course, such a service will cost much more than calls to mobile phone numbers, but for those who send messages, this is very suitable. </p><p>  For 400 points of MTS, you will get the same service, but it will not be in half a hundred SMS, but in a full hundred.  By purchasing this service you save as much as 50 points. </p><h2>  Hooter </h2><p>  For the extra 75 points that may remain in your account after some expensive purchase, you can purchase the Good-Ok service.  With its help, all subscribers of any mobile operators will be able to call you and, until you answer, hear any trending music.  This is very relaxing before an important call and, of course, uplifting. </p><h2>  Discounts in stores </h2><p>  If you have accumulated from 5,000 to 40,000 points, you are offered discounts on goods in MTS stores.  It is worth recalling that one ruble discount on goods - ten points.  Therefore, with 40,000 bonuses, you can reduce costs by as much as four thousand Russian rubles.  It is completely justified. </p><h2>  Cinema, books </h2><p>  The following packages cost from 100 to 300 points.  Each of them allows you to read books for free in the MTS application or watch movies on Megogo.  The more expensive the service, the more you can read or watch movies.  In general, it is very suitable for fans of reading and film fans.  Moreover, the service is very cheap, and lasts a very long time.  Starting from the week, ending with one month. </p><section class="left-boxcont"></section>
