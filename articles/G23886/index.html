These were devices from the Classic series: 6700, 6303, as well as the Nokia 2700 model, the characteristics of which we will consider today.  Such phones have design characteristics, like the 6700. All of them are somewhat similar to each other.  When you need to decide on a phone model that works clearly like a clock, you should be quite conservative.  Two phones - 2700 and 5130 - are exactly the same.  They are suitable for an adult audience, are completely similar in function, differ only in design. </p><h2>  Size, control components and design </h2><p>  Model Nokia 2700 weighs 85 g, size - 109.2 x 46 x 14 millimeters.  All corners of the apparatus are smoothed.  In the lower area, the device narrows, making it convenient to hold the phone in your hands.  However, such a device is inconvenient to carry in a pocket in the front, because it is thick and heavy.  The entire case consists of a matte plastic chrome shade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2700" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/1047286.jpg" width="393"></div>

    <p>  The Nokia 2700 is presented only in black.  A 2 megapixel camera is located on the back of the case.  It is complemented by the inscription Nokia, which is framed by chrome plastic.  The speaker grill is curved outward.  Due to this, if you put the device on the table, the hole will not be blocked.  On the upper part are the necessary connector for charging.  And in order to connect a headset, there is a 3.5 mm output.  The plug is covered with microUSB - input.  The audio jack provides the ability to connect third-party headphones for listening to music.  Due to its quality characteristics, the phone can replace an inexpensive player.  The screen of this model is made of plastic, so it accumulates dirt and needs to be cleaned regularly.  A hole for the earpiece is available at the top of the unit.  The speaker has a high volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  The <span>Nokia 2700</span> model has a display with a diagonal of 2 inches, and a resolution of 320x240 pixels.  The screen provides a display of 262 thousand color shades.  This type of display is also installed in the Nokia 2730 and 5130. For this price, it is very good.  Viewing angles are ordinary.  It is quite bright and outwardly attractive.  The device has a modified platform S40 - 5. The advantage is that you can set the clock on the screen saver by clicking on the end call button. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2700 manual" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/1047287.jpg" width="367"></div>

The screen contrast also found a positive response from users.  Often, among the strengths, excellent build quality is noted, which is typical for the models of this manufacturer.  Among the shortcomings, users in reviews often mention a relatively long charging time, the lack of a USB cable in the kit.  Some owners of the device lack the hardware photo and volume keys.
