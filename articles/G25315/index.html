Each of the industries is distinguished by the subject of legal regulation, that is, by a qualitatively homogeneous group of social relations enshrined in legal norms.  They also differ in the method of regulation, that is, in the methods and methods of legal impact on a person. </p><p>  The main methods are imperative and dispositive.  The first method contains strict requirements that are binding, and the second offers the right to choose.  The imperative method is more inherent in industries such as administrative and criminal law.  They contain standards for the violation of which administrative or criminal liability arises. </p><p>  Branches of law are divided into public and private.  The former regulate relations in the areas of state power, judicial, executive and administrative activities.  The second are aimed at ensuring and protecting private interests. </p><p>  <strong>The main branches of law</strong> </p><p>  1.
