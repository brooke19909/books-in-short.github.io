One of them is most popular.  Many centuries ago, nomad tribes raided the modern Crimean lands.  Invaders destroyed and robbed villages, took civilians into slavery or simply killed them.  During the next raid, one of the nomad commanders looked at Mount Demerdzhi, shrouded in haze, and marveled at its beauty.  He was seized with a mystical feeling that in front of him was the best place for the forge.  He instructed one of his minions, called Blackbeard, to collect the strongest men and go to the top to forge weapons.  From the braziers came a flame destroying everything around.  Once, a beautiful girl born in these places turned to Chernoborodoy with a request to stop work and preserve magnificent landscapes.  But the evil nomad did not listen to her and killed her for such a daring request.  And then the ancient mountains could no longer tolerate such impudence and anger, huge boulders rolled from the very top, and the flame descended.  When the dust settled, the inhabitants of the surrounding villages were able to see the area filled with mangled silhouettes of people, and the nomads disappeared forever.  It is believed that this is how the Valley of Ghosts appeared in the Crimea.

It is on its slopes that the famous Ghost Valley in Crimea is located.  The very word "Demerdzhi" in translation into Russian means "blacksmith".  The mountain has two peaks: northern and southern, respectively.  An interesting fact: in the Middle Ages, the Greeks lived in this territory, and they called Mount "Funa" - literally translated as "smoking".  The peaks deserve such a name thanks to the clouds, which picturesquely descend to the very peaks, which is why the top of the mountain is really covered with some kind of haze.  <span>Mount Demerdzhi</span> consists of conglomerates, these are fragments of various rocks, pebbles of all sizes, cemented for centuries by sand and clay, stone boulders.

Fancy statues, pillars, giant mushrooms - this is the result of exposure to winds and natural rainfall.  The Simferopol-Alushta highway is quite smooth and goes down to the sea under a slope.  It is during a trip along it that you can see the Valley of ghosts.  From a distance, it seems that the area with stone sculptures is as if specially aligned.  This phenomenon was studied by specialists.  According to one version, once a very long time ago this area was flooded.  And on the site of the modern valley was the seabed.  This theory has not yet been proven, but not refuted.

A path has been preserved to this day along which legendary heroes walked.  You can look at this place also on the ‚ÄúNikulin nut‚Äù, the very tree from which his screen hero threw nuts at Shurik.  The real attraction is a stone on which Natalya Varley danced her famous dance to the song "Somewhere in the world ...".  However, only legends go about the authenticity of this boulder.  But all tourists who wish can already climb on it and dance for a memorable photo or video. </p><h2>  Memo for tourists </h2>

A variety of excursions are offered here from various cities.  If you decide to see this natural wonder with your own eyes, get ready for the trip thoroughly.  An interesting suggestion is a horse ride along the trails along the Ghost Valley.  However, agree to such an excursion only if you are really confident in the saddle and do not get tired of riding a horse.  The ghost valley in Alushta looks picturesque and calm.  Nevertheless, excursions here are recommended for adults, physically healthy people.  In fact, the route is not the easiest, but in some places dangerous.  Beware of crumbling soil, do not climb on insufficiently stable stones.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haven Valley Ghosts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/879767.jpg"></div>  If you wish, not far from the foot of Mount Demerdzhi, you can find not only entertainment and sports facilities, but also a tourist center.  Ghost Valley is not a completely safe place, sometimes tourists get injured here because of their own carelessness.  Do not be overly self-confident, choose comfortable sportswear and shoes for your trip, walk along the beaten paths.  Fear should be one plant growing in this area.  Its name is ash-tree, the people also call it "asterisk" or "burning bush".  When the plant comes into contact with the skin, you will get a chemical burn (to the second degree).  Bubbles usually appear after a few days and heal long enough.  The Ghost Valley in Crimea (photo above) looks romantic at sunset.  But do not go on a trip too late.  Remember, it gets dark very quickly in the Crimea and you can not calculate your strength and do not have time to return before dark.  It is best to go here on an excursion in the early morning, when it is already light, but not too hot.
