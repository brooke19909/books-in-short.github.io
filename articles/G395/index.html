It is almost impossible to unambiguously answer this question.  Although one thing is for sure: here for everyone there is something for everyone.  Some who climbed the Crimean mountains in this place like to just relax from the bustle of the city, lying in the tall grass and watching the birds scurrying back and forth.  There are those that climb the mountains for the sake of mesmerizing panoramic shots.  But especially practical and conscious people set off in search of medicinal plants, procuring for teas, for example, thyme, chicory, yarrow or lemon balm. </p><h2>  Baidar Valley.  general information </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned above, this area is very famous for its healing herbs.  Even in antiquity, it received special fame thanks to the rich forests and miraculous springs. </p><p>  Many people mistakenly believe that the Kaydar Valley, whose vacation is magnificent at any time of the year, received such a name thanks to kayak boats.  Nothing like this!  Historians claim that once on the site of the nearby village of Orlin there was an ancient Tatar settlement Baydary, named after one of the local leaders.  And more recently, another name appeared in the valley - Crimean Switzerland.  And this is not surprising, because it, surrounded by mountains, has a mild comfortable climate and wonderful, one might say, unique nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are a lot of attractions in the valley: historical monuments, ancient buildings and places of worship.  Flooded meadows, waterfalls, rocky mountains, canyons, lakes, mountain rivers and juniper groves, yew and beech forests, hazelnut and dogwood thickets are a truly magnificent sight. </p><p>  The flora and fauna of the Baydar Valley is represented by more than 50 species of plants and 40 species of animals listed in the Red Book.  Wild boars, hares, roe deer and foxes live in large numbers, eagles and falcons soar above the sky, fish splash in the water, ducks swim, and domestic horses, cows, goats and sheep walk quietly in the meadows next to wild animals. </p><h2>  What are the <span>Baydar gates of</span> Crimea? </h2>

    <p>  Strictly speaking, nothing special.  Many will say that the Baidar Gate is another convenient mountain pass, the Crimean Mountains have many identical ones. </p><p>  However, not everything is so simple in historical terms.  Here, for example, a stone portico once served as an important stronghold.  And they built it in the middle of the 19th century. </p><p>  Now this is only one of the <span>sights of the Crimea,</span> but during the war, in 1941, in this place, a detachment of border guards held off the fascist army for more than a day, preventing it from getting to Sevastopol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now from this place you can see a picturesque panorama.

    <p>  The villages of the Baydar Valley look great against the backdrop of a unique temple built high in the mountains.  Moreover, from any corner the view opens up magnificent, and if you want to take a picture as a souvenir without rising high, you will definitely not have to look for the desired angle for a long time.  The refined Church of the Resurrection of Christ over Foros, as if specially posed on the Red Rock at a distance of almost half a kilometer above sea level. </p><p>  It was built back in 1892 by the tea magnate Kuznetsov as a recession, because only the imperial family was engaged in the cultivation and sale of tea at that time.  The temple was erected in memory of the accident of 1888, when the tragic train crash of the royal family occurred. </p><p>  Initially, the magnificent two-tier church with nine domes, a patterned porch with an upright bell tower, gilded crosses, columns with carved capitals, marble window sills and panels represented the whole beauty of the Russian style.  Inside the church there was a carved oak iconostasis and walls painted with Byzantine ornaments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfortunately, in 1924 the church was closed, and all of its property was taken away.  Church evangelism was spilled again only after restoration in 1990. Churches erected new copper domes, gilded crosses, painted the altar and domes of the church, and now colored windows are painted on the windows.  She began to look especially beautiful at night, illuminated by searchlights, against the background of the starry sky. </p><h2>  Bold?  Prove it!  Famous Devil's Staircase of the Baydar Gate </h2>

    <p>  The Devil's Staircase, or Shaitan-Merdweden, is a former reliable and convenient <span>mountain pass</span> in the Crimean Mountains.  It connects the foothills and the South Bank.  The staircase was used until the last century, and to this day, on the flat curves of limestone, paired ruts, knocked out by carts, have been preserved.  Indeed, the Baydar Valley is fraught with a lot of surprises. </p><p>  How did this steep mountain descent have such an unusual name?  Experts say that the devil's staircase got its name because of the limestone exits in the form of huge slabs, which still resemble steps.  This name was given not only to the stone staircase itself, but to the entire pass of one and a half meter width, which is more than 500 m. Rocks and blocks of limestone, steep-walled valleys, crepid roads, the remains of side walls and stone marches are scattered throughout the pass. </p><p>  The path through the Devil's Stairs is very winding and steep.  The length of all marches is approximately 250 meters, and the slope in some places is 30 degrees.  Hinges of stairs surround a stone block at the bottom of the gorge, shelves and cornices of the mountains. </p><p>  Only three turns of the road have survived to this day.  In vain, many consider a plain and safe such a corner of the peninsula as the Baydar Valley.  Crimea, or rather, its southernmost part, often becomes the venue for rallies of climbers and climbers.  It can actually be dangerous here. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Unique Natural Monument - Uzunji Canyon </h2>

    <p>  The most beautiful place of the western Crimea, <span>Uzundzhi Canyon,</span> is a deep winding gorge with the river of the same name at the bottom.  Almost kilometer peaks hang over the canyon.  The river takes its source on Mount Ai-Petri at an altitude of more than 750 m. It flows along the Uzuzhinsky depression, then abruptly changes its direction, runs along the Skelsky depression and flows into the <span>Chernorechensky reservoir.</span>  The length of the river is only 11 km. </p><p>  If you are lucky to find yourself in such a stunning place as the Baydar Valley, Crimea will not cease to amaze you even for a minute.  Take this opportunity and take a walk along the canyon.  The journey will take place along a picturesque narrow mountain road, starting from Skelskaya Cave.  Then the path will pass along a dirt path in the forest, and finally out to the walls of an old dilapidated fortress. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that Uzundzhi is the largest freshwater source in Crimea. </p><h2>  What you didn‚Äôt know for sure </h2>

Going here on an excursion, you should be prepared for the fact that the panorama opening through the arch of the gate will actually make a stunning impression on you. </p><p>  Skelskaya cave in 1904 was discovered by the teacher F. Kirillov.  To date, it has been established that it consists of several rooms, the length of the largest is 80 m, the height is 25 m, and the width in some places reaches 18 m. </p><p>  In 2003, a chapel was erected on Laspinsky Pass in honor of the second millennium from the birth of Christ, which is worth a visit. </p><h2>  Miracles of the Skelsk Cave </h2>

    <p>  Skelskaya cave, consisting mainly of stalactites, is located in the south-west of Crimea.  Her age is several million years.  First of all, it is distinguished by its impressive size and the safety of calcite formations.  Note that the cave is divided into halls, each of the rooms has its own characteristics.  For example, the Fireplace Hall actually resembles the structure of the same name, the Knight‚Äôs Hall is considered the most beautiful and largest.  It is also worth a visit to the Ghosts Hall and the Dolphin Hall. </p><p>  The highlight of the cave is a seven-meter stalagmite called "Knight with a spear", fabulous natyki in the form of a waterfall, dragon skull with eyes and fangs, the figure of a phoenix bird and others. </p><p>  The walls of the cave are decorated with niches, bathtubs, sash curtains and ribs.  This stone miracle has not yet been fully explored, but the length of the known part is about 670 meters.  It is impossible not to mention that since 1964 this place has been a natural monument. </p><h2>  Skelsk menhirs </h2>

    <p>  If you are going to explore such a stunning corner of the Crimea as the Baydar Valley, the map will definitely come in handy.  Why?  The thing is that far from all places tours are organized, and there really is something to see here.  Here, for example, why not go to the Skelsky menhirs? </p><p>  Note that in general, menhirs should be understood as once created obelisks and stelae.  Skelsk menhirs are the first known example of architecture.  There are two monolithic blocks in the form of obelisks, set upright.  They are standing at the entrance to the village of Rodnikovskoye.  The first menhir is about three meters high and weighs about six tons, while the second is only one and a half meters high.

    <p>  Not far from the tourist camp "Mulovskoe Lake" is located Kozyrek waterfall.  Unfortunately, his historical name has not been preserved to this day.  Although there are legends to the girl who died here and about the mighty wolf that saved the village from enemies. </p><p>  And it is compared with a visor because of the submarine-like rocky ledge hanging over the grotto, from which fast and cool water runs down even in the summer months. </p>
