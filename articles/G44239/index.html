    <ul><li>  You can start saving money on deposit.  Each <span>credit card</span> has a grace period.  If you cover the resulting debt in a given period of time, then no additional fees need to be paid.  Therefore, you can postpone a certain amount of funds from the salary for the deposit.  In the grace period, use a card for settlements.  After receiving the next salary, block the arrears of the credit card.  Already at this stage, the client is in the black for the amount that was deferred on deposit. </li><li>  These cards are conveniently settled abroad.  In some countries, to place an order for a service, they require a credit card, not a debit card.  This is due to the fact that if the exchange rate varies during debit, the debit may not be enough.  A credit card may, by its purpose, go negative. </li><li>  The opportunity to profitably purchase goods.  It happens that super promotions are held in stores and discounts are offered, and wages are expected only in a few days.  It is in this situation that a credit card will come to the rescue.  At the same time, the buyer does not lose anything, because the debt will be blocked in the grace period. </li></ul><h2>  Cash loan at Russian Standard Bank </h2>
