    <h2>  Brief historical background </h2><p>  The memorial in Khatyn is a tribute to the three million Belarusians who died during the Great Patriotic War.  The ensemble is located 54 kilometers northeast of Minsk in the Republic of Belarus. </p><p>  Until the fateful 1943, Khatyn was an ordinary Belarusian village in the north-east of Minsk.  But on March 22, 1943, after a shootout of Soviet partisans and fascists in which a German officer was killed, enemy troops surrounded the village. </p><p>  Armed Germans locked all the villagers in a huge barn, and then set it on fire.  That day, about 160 people were burned alive, among whom there were 75 children.  On this terrible day, 6 people were saved.  Among them was 56-year-old Joseph Kaminsky.  He was able to find his wounded son, but he was not able to snatch him from the hands of death.  He had a bullet wound in the stomach, as well as numerous burns. </p><p>  The history of the village, where the Khatyn memorial complex is now located, is not unique.  During the Great Patriotic War, residents of 628 villages and villages of Belarus were burned alive by the Nazis.  It so happened that 186 villages from that list were never rebuilt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the war, on the site of the former village, the Soviet government erected the Khatyn memorial complex.  It was built in memory of all those who died in the lands of Belarus.  Soil was brought to build a monument from 185 unrestored villages.  Thus a symbolic cemetery was created. </p><p>  Thus, Khatyn became the 186th village - the site of this terrible cemetery.  That is why this place has become one of the most important memorial complexes in the post-Soviet space. </p><h2>  What is the Khatyn memorial complex today? </h2><p>  The opening of the memorial took place on July 5, 1969.  He accurately repeats the layout of the former village. </p><p>  In the center of the complex there is a six-meter bronze statue called ‚ÄúUnruly man‚Äù - this is a tribute to Joseph Kaminsky and his son.  Looking at it, visitors to the complex feel the bitterness and pain of loss.  In place of the barn, where the Khatyn burned, a black metal roof was installed, which was on the granary.  Next to it is a common grave with a symbolic wreath of memory on which there are words addressed from the dead to the living. </p><p>  According to the surviving documents, it is known that there were 26 houses in Khatyn.  Architects erected a log cabin crown on the site of the destroyed house, inside it there is an obelisk resembling a chimney in shape, which has a bell on top.  The silence of the Khatyn field is broken not only by the singing of birds, but also by the hourly reminder of the bell about the terrible events of March 22, 1943. </p><p>  The symbolic village is followed by the Burnt Village Cemetery.  It was there that the urns with land from 185 unrestored villages were delivered.  A Wall of Sorrow was erected not far from them.  It is made of reinforced concrete block with peculiar niches.  They placed commemorative plates with the names of the largest death camps and places where people died in large numbers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The</span> Khatyn <span>memorial complex</span> , the photo of which you see below, ends with the Memorial Square.  In the center grow three birches that symbolize life.  In place of the fourth birch, an eternal flame burns.  Nearby is the "Tree of Life", on which is a list of 433 villages.  Once they were burned by the invaders.  However, after the war they were rebuilt anew. </p><p>  In 2004, the monument was reconstructed. </p>

    <h2>  Khatyn memorial complex: how to get there? </h2><p>  To visit this historic place, nothing complicated is done.  It is enough to contact the tour desk and purchase a ticket.

Follow it, after 5 km you will reach the place of memory and sorrow. </p><p>  The Khatyn memorial complex has no address familiar to us.  You should be guided as if you are looking for a settlement. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Khatyn is another evidence of the terrible events of World War II.  Modern children must know and remember these tragic events.  Some political representatives in the post-Soviet space seek to justify the terrible crimes of fascist Germany.  Modern society should not accept this opinion!  Indeed, the views of Nazism and neo-Nazism will never lead to world peace. </p><p>  Learn the story with your children, because they study it in order not to make past mistakes! </p>
