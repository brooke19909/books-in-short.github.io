  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Construction documentation: local estimate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When carrying out construction work on fairly large objects, it often happens that it is almost impossible to determine its total estimated cost right away.  There is no secret that the prices of raw materials, building materials, all kinds of equipment, tools, labor, etc. are constantly changing, and most often upward.  In addition, one should not exclude the possibility of force majeure circumstances, which are usually indicated in the contract.  For this reason, in the process of construction or repair, it makes sense to draw up such a type of document as a local estimate.  This is an absolutely appropriate and well-thought-out decision, since at the initial stage the size of the costs was not determined definitively, and we can only name the approximate cost of all the work at the moment.  Toward the end of the repair, the estimated cost may change dramatically, and the customer may not be ready to bear the additional costs. </p><p>  What is a local budget for <span>civil works?</span>  This is the primary document in which the calculation is made for certain <span>types of work</span> and costs carried out in a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe facility.  Initially, averaged indicators are taken, which in the future, when compiling the rest of the working documentation, are specified and agreed with the customer.  Any estimates of construction and repair work are calculated using certain norms and rules contained in special directories.  Most often, such a reference is SNiP.  Since its standards are officially approved, bona fide contractors will not shy away from them in the direction of their wild fantasies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The local estimate contains basically those volumes, measurements and costs that are indicated in the working drawings or <span>working documentation.</span>  It is one of the parts of the general, object estimate, which combines data within itself for all local calculations made at the object.  Also, among other documentation, there is a consolidated estimate, which calculates certain <span>types of costs</span> for the entire construction site.  It is necessary in order to, among other things, identify unforeseen expenses. </p><p>  However, there is not only a local estimate, object and summary: this type of document can be prepared, for example, only for some specific type of work performed.  It can be construction and installation, repair, decoration and other works;  estimates can be made only by electrics or only by plumbing.  If we talk about the methods of compiling this document, then one of the most common can be considered resource.  Calculation using this method is carried out using current or forecasted tariffs and prices for cost elements necessary for the proper performance of work.  When performing a resource calculation, the following data are taken as a basis: </p><ol><li>  the need for certain materials, the amount of which is expressed in units of measurement (square or linear meters, kilograms, tons, liters, etc.); </li><li>  operating time of construction equipment and mechanisms; </li><li>  labor costs of workers; </li><li>  energy consumption, which are used for technological purposes, and much more. </li></ol><p>  All these resources are calculated based on project materials and specialized regulatory sources. </p><p>  Also, local estimates and others can be compiled by the base-index method.  It is based on the use of a system of both current and forecast indices with respect to the value that was determined at the base price level.  Often, in order to make an estimate, use the <span>resource-index method.</span>  Its essence lies in the combination of the two previous methods.  And one more option for drafting a document is very in demand: it is based on the use of certain data reflected in the design documentation of previously constructed similar facilities. </p>
