European service, hospitality of local residents, excellent cuisine, amazing nature, warm sea, lots of historical and cultural attractions - this is not a complete list of what the country attracts foreign tourists.  You will get even more pleasure from a trip to Greece if you visit its islands.  In this article we will consider the hotel Virginia 3 (Rhodes).  On the map of the island, it is located at its northeast end.  This is the Kallithea district, between the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes</span> and the Koskinu resort.  We will talk about a more detailed location below.  In the meantime, let us inform you that the Virginia Hotel is on the conditionally second line from the sea.  To get to the beach, you need to cross a small road and go down the hill.  The hotel has swimming pools, and most importantly, the all-inclusive food system so beloved by Russian tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virginia 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510619.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Only twenty kilometers separate the international airport of Diagoras from the Virginia 3 Hotel (Rhodes).  The address at this hotel is very simple: Koskinu, Kallithea.  Those arriving on the island by sea, from the port of Rhodes to the hotel need to travel only eight kilometers.  And to the main city, and even less - five.  An intercity bus stop that connects to the island's capital and Lindos on its own is located a few hundred meters from the entrance to the Virginia Hotel.  Koskinu resort is famous for its beautiful sandy and pebble beaches, crystal clear sea.  The hotel is located on a hill and offers panoramic views from the windows of the rooms.  One hundred and fifty meters away is the sandy beach of Columbia Beach.  Tourists respond extremely positively to the location of the hotel, especially those who came to explore the <span>sights of Rhodes.</span>  The only minus of a beach holiday, travelers call the need to go down to the sea and, accordingly, climb back.  One must be prepared for this or look for another hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virginia Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510614.jpg" width="600"></div>

It consists of two hotels.  The first is a four-star Virginia, and the second is Virginia 3 * (Rhodes).  Naturally, the guests of a budget hotel are in a advantageous position, since they have the right to use the entire infrastructure of a more expensive hotel.  The whole territory is very large - thirty-two thousand square meters - and well-equipped.  The arid landscapes of northeastern Rhodes remained outside the walls.  The main building and ten detached villas are surrounded by a fabulous garden with lush greenery and unprecedented flowers.  Amid this grandeur, the pools murmur.  They are filled with fresh water.  The large pool has a cascade shape.  The hotel complex was built in the eighty-eighth year of the last century.  The last renovation he went in two thousand and four. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virginia rhodes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  The hotel Virginia 3 * <span>(Rhodes, Greece) has</span> two hundred rooms.  About fifty of them are in the main three-story building with a reception, the rest are in villas.  The most popular category of rooms is a double standard.  In the villas, the guest rooms on the second floor have balconies, and those located in the basement level have direct exits from the terrace to the pool.  The hotel also has rooms of higher categories.  For those who do not want to pay All Inclusive, there are studio rooms and apartments.  They have a kitchen corner or a full kitchen with stove.  For comfortable accommodation, the three-star Virginia Hotel offers suites and maisonettes.  They include more amenities, and bathrooms include a hairdryer and toiletries.  In addition, these rooms have an extremely good location. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virginia 3 Rhodes Greece" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510618.jpg" width="600"></div>

True, using it is free only in the high season (July-August).  Reviews provide important detail.  Spenders that turn on the air conditioner and open windows at the same time will be disappointed, because the device will not work under such circumstances.  All rooms have flat-screen cable TVs and refrigerators.  Bathrooms feature showers.  The rooms are very stylishly decorated in warm beige or soothing bluish tones.  Reviews speak of very comfortable beds and snow-white linen, which was changed every five days.  The guests of the studios and apartments were satisfied with the kitchen supplement to the room.  The suite consists of two rooms, and the maisonette is a whole separate house with all amenities, which is eloquently indicated by its name. </p><h2>  How to feed the guests </h2><p>  <span>Hotel Virginia 3 * (Rhodes)</span> does not constrain its guests in choosing a diet.  Breakfast is already included in the room rate.  All other meals, including service in bars - at the discretion of customers, as they say, are optional.  It is possible to pay half board or all inclusive remotely, when booking a room, as well as on the spot.  In accordance with the diet, the guest is given a color bracelet.  Guests with apartments with a kitchen say that in the immediate vicinity of the hotel grocery shops are expensive.  But on the way to the city of Rhodes there are two supermarkets where you can find everything you need.  Breakfast (and all other meals) is served in the main restaurant of the hotel.  It has an indoor room where buffet meals are exhibited, as well as an outdoor terrace.  For those who have paid half board, drinks at lunches and dinners are paid.  Holders of all-inclusive wristbands can enjoy a drink at the bars.  There are two of them in the hotel.  One is located in the lobby and the other is by the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virginia 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510617.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food in a hotel </h2><p>  Virginia Hotel 3 * accepts groups, and that‚Äôs it.  When there is no influx of tourists (especially from the Russian Federation or China), then, according to vacationers, the restaurant has no lines, crush, panic that someone will not get something, and a fussy warping with trays full of food.  There is always enough fruit.  Breakfast is always the same, but everyone will find something to their liking.  There are sausages, cereals, and delicious pastries.  Reviews mention that for breakfast they give very tasty coffee, probably not instant, but natural.  A large fridge with ice cream is rolled out daily for lunch.  Those who have an all inclusive brother say that this system in Greece is somewhat different from that in Egypt.  You can eat not around the clock, but by the hour.  In fact, meals can be compared to full board, plus free drinks at the bar.  But the meal schedule is the most sparing.  For example, you can have breakfast from seven to ten, lunch from half past one to two, and dinner from eighteen thirty to nine in the evening.  In general, tourists were satisfied with the food.  There is always a choice of meat, fish, vegetable dishes.  But in bars, alcohol is free only if it is of local, Greek origin. </p><h2>  Beach, Pools </h2><p>  If you look at the map, the distance to the sea will be only one hundred meters.  However, in practice this is not so.  You should cross the highway and go down the road, which is also driven by cars.  True, the movement of vehicles on it is rare, and drivers behave cautiously.  But get ready for the fact that every day, or even several times a day, you will have to overcome a four-hundred-meter distance down, and then up.  For young and healthy people, this is not a problem, but rather a hardening exercise.  But elderly tourists and guests with young children very quickly changed their sea baths to swimming in pools.  Beach reviews were described as well-maintained.  There is a shower, toilet, but sunbeds and umbrellas are paid, and at obviously overpriced.  So, tourists advise, take a mat or a karemat with you.  At the hotel pools, umbrellas and sunbeds are, of course, free.  Guests of Virginia 3 * (Rhodes) can use the entire infrastructure of the Quartet, which is part of the hotel complex.  Reviews praise her spacious swimming pool.  In a three-star hotel, this tank is smaller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Virginia 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Taking into account the road to the sea, you should not go here with the kids.  Unless you rarely go out with them to the sea.  But it‚Äôs also worth going to the beach.  In its central part there is a soft sand, and the bottom is shallow.  In the summer and in the velvet season of the storm, Rhodes bypasses, and the sea miraculously warms up.  And in the hotel complex "Virginia" for the youngest guests there are two children's pools - one in each hotel.  For babies under two years old, Virginia (Rhodes) provides cots and playpens.  The restaurant has high chairs for feeding babies.  And for older children there are two equipped playgrounds in the open air with grass cover.  The hotel has a pricing policy designed to attract families.  So, children under the age of twelve, subject to payment of food, can live in the hotel for free. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Virginia Hotel 3 * has its own conference room and parking.  The hotel has a mini market and currency exchange.  Tourists mention a very extensive list of paid services.  First of all, it is access to the Internet.  Two hours of Wi-Fi cost three euros, and use during the day is five.  Also for a fee you can play billiards, table tennis, water sports.  There is an Internet cafe on site.  You can indulge in team games there.  The hotel laundry offers its services (they are paid).  But the rented car can be parked at the hotel absolutely freely (subject to availability).  At a late check-out, you can, having vacated the room, hand over things to the left luggage office.  This service is also free.  But for using the safe at the reception you will have to part with a certain amount.  Air conditioning is free only from July to September.  But at another time (for example, in no less hot June) they have to pay six euros a day for using it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Virginia Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510620.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Reviews advise you to actively explore the sights of the <span>island of Rhodes (Greece).</span>  Virginia Hotel 3 * occupies a very favorable position.  Just a hundred meters there is a bus stop, from where for just six euros you can leave for the center of the main city of the island.  Rhodes is divided into two parts.  The Old Town has many architectural and historical sights.  New is a beautiful promenade, shops.  Tourists claim that the hotel Virginia 3 * (Rhodes) is located on the Mediterranean coast.  But if you go to Prasonimi, then you can swim in two waters at once.  The city of Rhodes also stands on the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.  Hotel guests can also make excursions to the medieval castle of Feraclos, in the city of Lindos.  You should definitely visit the fortified palace of the Grand Masters of the militant monks of the Order of St. John, which was built in the fourteenth century. </p><h2>  Hotel Virginia 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists in general were satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  It is budgetary and fully complies with the European standards of a three-star hotel.  Many liked the close proximity of the Quartet.  Many tourists who visited the hotel said they would come here again and would recommend the Virginia Hotel (Rhodes) to their friends. </p>
