  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is computer science and its role in the modern world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of what computer science is can be answered very simply.  This is a science that synthesized a whole complex of scientific disciplines, systematized the main methods by which any data, information, information, etc., are created, stored, reproduced, processed and transmitted.  All operations are performed by computer technology.  In addition, computer science is studying the principles of operation of these processes and their management.  The concept of computer science is clearly revealed through the etymology of the name - it came from the French language and is formed by the merger of the words "information" and "automation".  That is, ‚Äúautomatic processing of information‚Äù, or, to use our usual language, ‚Äúcomputer technology‚Äù. </p><p>  Science computer science </p><p>  Thus, the advent of informatics served as the impetus for the emergence and dissemination of new technologies <span>for the collection of information,</span> its processing, transmission and storage of all data on host vehicles. </p><p>  The subject of this science will also tell in detail what computer science is: </p><ul><li>  <span>This is computer technology</span> with all its hardware; </li><li>  these are various programs and other software that provides computing technology; </li><li>  this is the interface, i.e.  those means by which hardware and <span>software</span> can interact and work productively.  Naturally, machines, even the most intelligent, do not work on their own - people work on them.  And the interface, in particular, provides human access to programs and applications, to the launch of work processes on computing mechanisms.  This is the "user interface". </li></ul><p>  Explaining what computer science is, one should recall its main task.  <span>Informatics as a science</span> is called upon to systematize the <span>techniques and methods of working with</span> software and hardware that provide and service the work of computers.  The purpose of systematization is to identify the most effective, efficient, promising technologies that automate the stages of obtaining and processing data, putting them into active use, promoting their development, and providing methodological support for new technological research. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Computer science should be considered not so much theoretical as practical science.  Everything that she openly finds purely practical application.  Thus, the efficiency of both the technology itself and its software is determined.  Efficiency - the ratio between the performance of the technical equipment of the machine and its cost. </p><p>  Computer Science and Information </p><p>  The science of computer science is closely connected with the concepts of "information", "information system", "information technology". </p><p>  Information is aggregated, generalized information, data.  They can be received from outside, from the outside world (called input information), sent to the environment (called source information), or stored inside the system (intrasystem information). </p><p>  Information is various documents - text or video materials, such as drawings, sounds, electrical signals, light, nerve impulses, etc.  The main properties of information: </p><ul><li>  it can be objective, independent and subjective; </li><li>  full or partial; </li><li>  reliable or not very; </li><li>  adequate, affordable, relevant. </li></ul><p>  Data collected by computers is part of the information recorded in the form of registered signals.  Various data processing methods convert data from one type to another.  The process is carried out in many operations.  The main ones are collecting data, bringing them into the same form, removing unnecessary ones, i.e.  ‚ÄúFiltering‚Äù, sorting, so that later it is more convenient to use, archiving, protection and transportation.  For modern computers, the data source is the server, and the consumer is the client. </p><p>  Conclusion </p><p>  Computers and modern latest technologies have firmly entered our everyday life, and therefore even a younger schoolchild will quite freely explain what computer science is, although the subject itself will still not be studied very soon. </p>
