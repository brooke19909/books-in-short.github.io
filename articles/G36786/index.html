Svetlogorsk is not only notable for its well-developed infrastructure, but also for its excellent location on the shores of the Baltic Sea, which attracts not only travelers, but also residents of nearby cities.  This article will talk about how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk, the distance between which is about 40 km, using different transport. </p><h2>  Ways to Travel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thisotherworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sign of Kaliningrad" class="if uuid-2867234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867234.jpg"></div><p>  As already mentioned, the two cities are relatively close to each other, so you don‚Äôt really need to worry about how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk, because there is a variety of transport that runs along the route in just half an hour, well, in a maximum of 40 minutes without traffic jams .  It will offer tourists: </p><ul><li>  Taxi: </li><li>  train; </li><li>  public bus or minibus. </li></ul><p>  Well, now we‚Äôll talk in more detail about each of these travel methods that answer the question of how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk. </p><h2>  Taxi convenience </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Highway Kaliningrad-Svetlogorsk" class="if uuid-2867240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867240.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's start the story about how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk, from the most convenient option, namely with a taxi.  This way of traveling will be the fastest, in addition, you can enjoy the surrounding landscapes calmly.  In total, such a trip will take about half an hour and will cost a little more than a thousand rubles, so for a family with children, such a trip will be most preferable, even if you have to overpay a bit compared to other travel methods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The path here runs first along the ring road, and then along the highway.  It is worth noting that the track is sometimes very narrow at times, but on its both sides there is a huge number of beautiful trees that form real tunnels in the summer because of their mighty crowns.  It will be really interesting to drive through them.  In addition, using this route, it will be possible to enjoy the species that live near the settlements by storks and also look at their nests, which birds twist right on the pillars. </p><h2>  The way from the airport to the center of Kaliningrad </h2><p>  Before looking for a way to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk, the first thing to do is figure out how to get out of the airport.  So, in the <span>Kaliningrad region</span> there is only one airport, Khrabrovo, so if you fly by plane, then land here.  It is located about 20 km from Kaliningrad itself in a northeast direction.  Now consider the possible ways to travel further: </p><ol><li>  Taxis are the only way of transportation if you need to leave the airport at night, because the buses simply do not go.  Cars stand right next to the airport, so it‚Äôs very easy to catch a taxi.  The price of the trip will vary from 350 to 500 rubles. </li><li>  In addition to a taxi, the bus number 244 C constantly runs during the day, the route of which is "Khrabrovo Airport - South Station".  The cost in one direction will be 80 rubles, but you will have to pay an extra 20 for the luggage. Travel time will be 45 minutes to the final stop, although you can leave early if you wish, because the bus stops near Victory Square.  Buses run approximately every half hour to forty minutes. </li></ol><h2>  Train </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nelmitravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train to Svetlogorsk" class="if uuid-2867225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867225.jpg"></div><p>  If you not only want to get to your destination quickly, but also relatively cheaply, then you should choose an electric train.  Now we will begin to explain how to get from the Kaliningrad station to Svetlogorsk on this particular type of transport.  However, it should be borne in mind that in total there are two stations that can be used for departure.  We will separately talk about each of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  North Station </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nelmitravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salon of an electric train" class="if uuid-2867229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867229.jpg"></div><p>  How to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk by train?  It is best to choose the North Station for this purpose, since it is located in the city center, and it will be easier to find it.  The best option from the airport is to directly get to Victory Square, where you can clearly see the snow-white church.  The station is located a little to the left, right behind the gray building where the business center is located.  By the way, it used to be the North Station, while Kaliningrad was Koeningsberg. </p><p>  Trains run on schedule exactly every hour.  You should choose very carefully.  The first step is to look at those where the final destination is Svetlogorsk-2, since this station is also located in the center.  Also make sure that there is no stop in Zelenogradsk, because in this case the train gives a big hook, so the trip will drag on for an hour and a half. </p><p>  In general, it remains only to catch an electric train and hit the road.  The train will go to the final destination for about an hour, and a ticket costs about 85 rubles.  If you wish, you can immediately buy a ticket in both directions, if necessary, so as not to worry about it later.  True, it is worth paying attention to this ticket, since only with its help it will be possible to pass through the turnstiles with which the entrances and exits to the stations are equipped.  On weekdays there is not a particularly large number of people, so there are a lot of free places. </p><h2>  South Station </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.inyourpocket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="South Station" class="if uuid-2867254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867254.jpg"></div><p>  How to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk yet?  It may so happen that it will be more convenient to start the journey from the South Station.  It is also located in the central part of the city along Zheleznodorozhnaya Street.  It covers the territory between the buildings from the 7th to the 13th. </p><p>  During the trip, the train directly stops at the North Station, so the trip route as a whole is exactly the same, but a little longer.  The ticket is selected according to exactly the same principle as in the previous case, and the travel time itself will be approximately 10 minutes more. </p><h2>  Station Svetlogorsk-2 </h2><p>  Those who are interested in the question of how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk in the Kaliningrad region need to know more such information.  In total, there are two stations in the final city: Svetlogorsk-1 and Svetlogorsk-2.  It is recommended to choose the latter precisely because it is located directly in the city center right by the sea.  There is a small cable car, which is located right next to the station, with which you can go down almost to the water.  But if you choose the Svetlogorsk-1 station, then you will have to walk about a couple more kilometers to the right place. </p><h2>  Bus way </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kaliningradguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus way" class="if uuid-2867248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867248.jpg"></div><p>  It is quite convenient to get to Svetlogorsk by bus.  Bus stations are also located near the North and South stations, but the South will be the best option, since in this case you can definitely get a seat, which is not guaranteed on the North, since the bus approaches it already full.  Such buses run here very often, approximately every twenty minutes, right from 6 a.m. until late evening - half past ten.  You need to choose a bus at number 118 - this route for travel will be the most optimal.  True, it is worth preparing that the journey will be long enough, it will take about an hour and a half to go.  The ticket price will be about 80 rubles one way, but if you wish, you can also buy a ticket on the way back at the same time so you don‚Äôt worry about it later.  Now you know how to get from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk by bus.  It remains only to choose the most convenient way. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="casypot.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svetlogorsk architecture" class="if uuid-2867237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867237.jpg"></div><p>  In general, as was noticed by tourists, getting from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk is quite simple, since a variety of transport runs here constantly.  The trip will not be particularly long, but you should be prepared for the fact that there will not be any stunning natural landscapes along the way, so looking out the window can be a little boring.  But then you can enjoy the huge number of attractions that are available in Svetlogorsk itself. </p><p>  Here you can see not only old architectural monuments, but also try interesting national dishes made from seafood.  True, it should be taken into account that the Baltic Sea is not as warm and gentle as the Black Sea, but here you can enjoy a mixture of Russian and German history, since earlier this city was part of Germany. </p><p>  It was founded in 1258, so there are many places to wander around here.  In addition to history and culture, you can enjoy nature, since most of the city is located in a green forest zone, so there is very clean air, and there is practically no heat, since a pleasant breeze constantly blows from the sea.  While in the Kaliningrad region, you should definitely allocate at least one day in order to admire the beauties of this place. </p>
