    <h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  The favorable location of the hotel Albatros Garden Resort 4 * can not but rejoice tourists who come to the Red Sea to enjoy a beach holiday. </p><p>  The city of Hurghada itself consists of three districts: El-Dahar (the old city), the new city of Saqqala and the 40-kilometer coast, where hotels are located that are located even outside the city (this area is called New Hurghada). </p><p>  Unlike the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada boasts sandy beaches with a gentle entrance, hotels with pontoons are very rare. </p><p>  Almost every hotel has its own lagoon, outside of which it is impossible to appear in the sea without special shoes.  An injection of a sea urchin entails swelling of a limb, a visit to a hospital, taking medication and spoiled rest, so be careful not to touch the representatives of marine and coastal flora and fauna once again. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, each hotel, including Beach Albatros Garden Resort 4 *, has its own reef for the joy of all lovers of snorkeling.  Such a number of beautiful multi-colored fish and bright colors of the underwater world, which are in the Red Sea, is, perhaps, not anywhere else in the world. </p><p>  The relatively low cost of living in Hurghada hotels is partially due to their long-standing construction.  Today, there are about 200 hotels on the coast of the resort, but developers continue to develop the coastal zone, and every year several more new hotels appear here.  Compared with the same Sharm el-Sheikh, the entrance to the sea in Hurghada is almost everywhere safe - at the dawn of the establishment of the hotel business, coral was cut down here. </p><p>  Not far from the city there are other resort areas of the Red Sea: the famous El Gouna is located 22 kilometers away, drive to Makadi Bay a little closer - only 12 km separates this area from Hurghada.  If time permits, you can visit the elite resort of Sahl Hasheesh, which is now under construction. </p><p>  As for the climatic conditions in Hurghada, the sunny days are throughout the year.  The climate is dry.  We do not recommend coming to Hurghada in February, as strong cool winds blow at this time, the air temperature does not exceed 25 degrees, and the sea - 20 degrees Celsius.  For those who, due to their health, do not tolerate heat, doctors do not recommend coming here in July and August.  At this time, the air temperature rises above 40 degrees, and the water warms up to 30 degrees Celsius. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <strong>Hotel</strong> location <strong>and description</strong> </h2><p>  Albatros Garden Resort (Ex. Albatros Resort 4 *) is conveniently located twenty minutes from the city, on the second coastline.  The distance from Hurghada Airport is only 6 kilometers (15 minutes to go), but despite this, none of the tourists complained about the noise from taking off and landing planes. </p><p>  The hotel has a common area with the hotels Albatros Aqua Blue Resort and Albatros Aqua Vista Resort &amp; SPA.  Guests of the complex can use all the amenities of the hotels, with the exception of the main restaurants. </p>

Some of the hotel guests were pleasantly surprised not so much by the animals and birds from the towels, but by the fact that the linen was changed every day, and no one left extra tips. </p><p>  The surroundings leave a good impression: a well-groomed look and an abundance of beautiful flowers are pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  Especially sophisticated tourists who are skeptical about eating in Egyptian hotels with the All inclusive system, noted the abundance of food and the high quality of pastries. </p><p>  The guests noted as the indisputable advantage of the hotel the expanded territory of the territory, since it is combined with two other complexes belonging to the Albatros network.  Accordingly, the beach is wider and larger. </p><p>  The guests all as one noted in a positive way the work of the animation team, which did not let anyone get bored. </p><p>  Some guests did not like the fact that they had to take a bus to the hotel, the waiting period of which could be somewhat delayed.  Especially impatient tourists complained that walking 700 meters to the beach on foot under the scorching sun was a rather difficult event, especially if you were going with children. </p><p>  But on the other hand, everyone liked the beach, and not only the purity of the sea and the abundance of underwater landscapes, which are breathtaking.  It‚Äôs convenient that you don‚Äôt have to dress for lunch to visit the restaurant: next to the beach there is a bar where you can eat without actually leaving your deck chair. </p><p>  The disco is open until 2 am, therefore, in this regard, the youth liked this hotel more than older people, who, however, could not hear the disco noise. </p><p> These are the impressions that developed last year at the guests of the Albatros Garden Resort 4 * hotel.  The reviews of 2014, it must be said, turned out to be no worse than those left by guests a few years ago.  This indicates the maintenance of the hotel service at a high level.  It is hoped that in the coming years the Albatros hotel chain will pursue a policy of improving its facilities, and the Albatros Garden hotel will become even more popular with Russian tourists. </p>
