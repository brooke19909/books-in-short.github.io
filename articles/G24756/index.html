This concept is deciphered as a set of specialized documents, or rather standards, through which the regulation of the procedure for creating financial statements, which is freely available for external users, is carried out. </p><h2>  IFRS versus Russian accounting system </h2><p>  First of all, there is a difference in the end users with information, which includes the relevant accounting indicators, grouped according to the above standards.  In particular, the Russian model was aimed at government and statistics, while the international model was aimed at investors, enterprises and financial institutions.  As a result of this, in the differences associated with it regarding the interests and needs for financial information, various principles also appear, on which the procedure for generating these statements is based. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IFRS financial statements" class="if" height="190" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/521294.jpg" width="600"></div>

In accordance with IFRS, these features are significant in order not to reflect them in equity. </p><h2>  The purpose of implementing IFRS on Russian enterprises </h2>

    <p>  It is worth highlighting a number of advantages of this accounting system, which can be associated with the activities of the following entities: </p><ol><li>  <span>Financial analysts,</span> investors, as this is due to understandability, transparency, reliability and lower costs. </li><li>  Companies, because the costs of measures to attract investment are reduced, there is a single accounting system, there is no need to coordinate financial information, the procedure is both in internal and in external accounting. </li><li>  Auditors: in view of the fact that there is uniformity in the fundamental <span>principles of accounting,</span> there is an opportunity to participate in the adoption of relevant standards, large-scale trainings are held. </li><li>  The developers of these standards themselves - due to the fact that this is a great opportunity to exchange experiences, the basis for future national standards and the convergence of existing ones. </li></ol><p>  All of the above helps once again get the answer to the question: ‚ÄúIFRS - what is it?‚Äù </p><h2>  How to smooth the transition to IFRS? </h2><p>  The tasks of reform include the following: </p><ol><li>  Special training of accountants to the level of professional knowledge of the fundamentals of the accounting system under consideration. </li><li>  Strengthening in the minds of enterprise managers a real interest in providing truthful and objective information. </li><li>  The final distinction between accounting tax, financial and management. </li></ol><p>  The importance of the transition is determined by the fact that IFRS are standards that are a compromise between the main world accounting systems. </p><h2>  The appeal of accounting reform for businesses around the world </h2><p>  The IFRS financial statements under consideration can facilitate companies from different countries to enter world-class capital markets, as well as increase the comparability of information and make it more transparent to external users. </p><p>  Specifically, Russian enterprises will be able to speak the same language with their foreign colleagues and strengthen their business positions in foreign markets in terms of equal opportunities, as a result of which numerous prospects for international capital markets will become available. </p><p>  The introduction of IFRS will have a positive impact on the quality of <span>management accounting,</span> in particular on its improvement, and will also contribute to updating information systems and staff motivation. </p><p>  In addition, attracting foreign capital without reporting compiled in accordance with IFRS is currently very difficult.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if this is done either with the help of Western banks, or by entering the stock market located abroad, or by attracting private investment from abroad.  Reporting compiled in accordance with PBU, a potential foreign investor, most likely, will not understand.  Therefore, it is worth taking care of the formation of the reporting regulated by IFRS. </p><p>  Companies are aware of the fact that in the not too distant future international standards will become national ones.  For many firms, IFRS reports are already required today to provide a significant competitive advantage by attracting resources in international borrowing markets such as bonds, loans or IPOs. </p><p>  Thus, all of the above helps to understand in more detail the question: "IFRS - what is it?" </p>
