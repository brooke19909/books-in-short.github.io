    <p>  Hotel Delphine el Habib Resort is located in the famous resort town of Monastir, almost on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

And if you want a memorable beach holiday, Tunisia is perfect.  Delphine el Habib Resort is a relatively small hotel complex.  The doors for tourists first opened here in 1987.

In the center is the main complex - a large snow-white multi-storey building built in a traditional oriental style.  Most of the hotel's territory is reserved for swimming pools, which are surrounded by neat lawns, bright flower beds and a lush garden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of rooms </h2>
