After all, not only attention should be paid to the brand, it is worth considering the sound quality, how comfortable the headphones are, what characteristics they have, and much more.  Also an important parameter is the price, because expensive does not always mean cool.  In today's review, we will look at 4 very good over-ear headphones that will appeal to even the most fastidious connoisseurs of sound. </p><h2>  JBL T450BT </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t450bt over-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2329270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329270.jpg"></div><p>  Open <span>the headphone rating</span> - JBL T450BT.  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that this model is wireless, although there is also a T450, which is already connected via a standard 3.5 mm cable.  Let's take a closer look at this model. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The T450BT on-ear headphones are supplied in standard, translucent packaging, through which you can view the headset itself and get acquainted with some characteristics.  Inside the box, the user will find the usual equipment, consisting of: headphones, a USB cable for the charger, warranty card and instructions. </p><h2>  Appearance and specifications </h2><p>  Headphones have a folding mechanism.  The cups bend inward and turn to the side.  Thus, the headphones can be easily transported in a backpack or a small bag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All controls and connectors are located below on the right headphone cup.  There are volume control buttons.  Between them - play and pause.  A little further - the on / off button, LED indicator and microphone hole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best jbl t450bt over-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2329271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329271.jpg"></div><p>  Now, regarding the technical specifications.  <span>Closed-</span> type <span>headphones</span> have a frequency range of 20 Hz-20 kHz and a resistance of 32 Ohms, the Bluetooth version is 4.0.  As for the built-in battery, it allows you to listen to music for 11 hours without interruption from a full charge. </p><p>  In terms of sound quality, you can say so - a solid four with a plus.  There are good and rich bass.  The high frequencies are clearly audible, but the middle ones pump up a little.  Of course, you can stretch them out using the equalizer, but not everyone will do it. </p><h2>  Reviews and cost </h2><p>  The reviews on the JBL T450BT headphones are mostly positive, although there are some complaints from users.  The first is not too comfortable headband.  With prolonged listening, it begins to put pressure on the head.  The second is the midrange, as already noted.  And the third - buttons are hard to grope for, it takes time to get used to.  Buy on-ear headphones JBL T450BT at the moment you can from 2500 to 3800 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sennheiser PX 200-II </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.easylounge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser px 200 ii on-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2329262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329262.jpg"></div><p>  The following are top Sennheiser PX 200-II earphones.  At one time, the PX 200 was incredibly popular, primarily because of the high sound quality.  The updated version is a good continuer of the line and will appeal to all music lovers. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Headphones are delivered in a small box with a transparent plastic insert through which you can see the headset when folded.  Also on the package are the main characteristics and "chips" of the model. </p><p>  Inside, in addition to the overhead headphones themselves, there is also an instruction manual, a warranty card and a small branded carrying case. </p><h2>  Characteristics and appearance of the model </h2><p>  Externally, the headphones look stylish, but at the same time their design is strictly for the amateur.  The headband has a folding structure and is additionally reinforced with a metal arc.  When folded, the headphones take up very little space and can be carried even in the pocket of a shirt or jacket. </p><p>  In order for the user to be comfortable listening to music for a long time, the headband at the headphones has soft lining made of high quality leatherette.  Ear pads are made of the same material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since the PX 200-II are wired headphones, they connect through a standard 3.5 mm jack.  For convenience, a manual volume control was also placed on the wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.munkonggadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best sennheiser px 200 ii overhead headphones" class="if uuid-2329263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329263.jpg"></div><p>  Now about the characteristics.  <span>Closed-</span> type <span>headphones</span> have a frequency range of 10 Hz-21 kHz, a sensitivity of 115 dB and a resistance of 32 ohms. </p><p>  The sound quality is at a very high level primarily due to the wide frequency range.  The bass sounds good, but in moderation.  Regarding midrange and treble - no complaints.  Everything sounds very clear and balanced.  Lovers of the classics will be clearly pleased, as well as connoisseurs of other musical genres. </p><p>  This model can be safely called one of the best over-ear headphones in its segment. </p><h2>  Price and reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Sennheiser PX 200-II still has some drawbacks, but they are not related to sound quality.  Users note a strange design that not everyone likes, incomplete noise isolation, in particular due to soft ear cushions and problems with the volume control on the wire.  Over time, it begins to junk and when it is used, extraneous noises appear that drown out the music.  Also, in some 1-2 years after the purchase, the sound in the right cup begins to disappear.  Most likely, this is due to sloppy operation. </p><p>  If we talk about the price, then you can buy Sennheiser PX 200-II for 4000-6000 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Urbanears Plattan ADV Wireless </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Urbanears Plattan ADV Wireless On-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329273.jpg"></div><p>  Another good and high-quality on-ear headphones - Urbanears Plattan ADV Wireless.

In this case, the cable provided will help. </p><p>  Buy Urbanears Plattan ADV Wireless at the moment you can for 5000-6500 thousand rubles, which is quite acceptable for this level of headphones. </p><h2>  Sony MDR-ZX330BT </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony MDR-ZX330BT On-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329274.jpg"></div><p>  Well, the latest on-ear headphones in today's ranking are the Sony MDR-ZX330BT.  Sony is known for many of its music products, of very high quality.  So this model was no exception. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Headphones are sold in a small cardboard box with a headset and technical specifications.  There is nothing interesting inside the package: the headphones themselves, the manual, the warranty card and the charging cable. </p><h2>  Headphone specifications and appearance </h2><p>  Headphones look pretty.  The main part is all made of matte plastic, and the surface of the cups is styled with anodized steel.  The headband has a non-separable design, which, of course, is a minus.  Also, there are no additional ‚Äúsofteners‚Äù on the bow, which already hints at a short listening to music.  But the ear pads are made of high quality leatherette.  They are quite soft and do not put much pressure on the ears. </p><p>  All controls and connectors are located on the right cup: charging connector, power button, volume control buttons and multi-function slider for play / pause, rewind and answer a call. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best Sony MDR-ZX330BT On-Ear Headphones" class="if uuid-2329275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2329275.jpg"></div><p>  Headphones have a standard frequency range of 20 Hz-20 kHz, a sensitivity of 98 dB and a resistance of 19 ohms.  The installed battery allows you to listen to music without stopping for 30 hours!  The latest Bluetooth wireless technology and NFC technology for quick pairing are used as wireless interfaces. </p><p>  The sound quality of the headphones is good.  Traditionally for Sony, the emphasis is on low frequencies, which are very juicy and vibrant here.  The middle is a bit overwhelmed, but not critical, any player with an equalizer eliminates this problem in a couple of moments.  There are no complaints about high frequencies - they are smooth and well tapped. </p><p>  The only thing Sony MDR-ZX330BT are designed more for electronic music and hip hop.  Fans of other genres, especially classics and rock, will have to turn the equalizer. </p><h2>  Model price and reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of this model show that the headphones have several disadvantages, but not critical.  Users note not very good ergonomics, fogging of the ears during long listening, scratched plastic on the surface of the cups and a little creaky plastic.  The cost of Sony MDR-ZX330BT at the moment is from 4000 to 5000 thousand rubles, which is quite acceptable. </p>
