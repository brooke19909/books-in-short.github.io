This is the basic construction of the modern architecture of the European state.  The object was created specifically for the international exhibition EXPO-58 and immediately became not only a symbol of the state, but also the property of world culture.  In addition to the Atomium, Belgium can be proud of its other attractions, which are rightfully considered the best in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atomium belgium" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1822902.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The birth of a grandiose building </h2><p>  Atomium (Belgium) is a <span>monumental sculpture,</span> which is a gigantic model of an iron crystal.  At the same time <span>, it</span> is also a monument to the peaceful atom and the infinite power of atomic energy.  The height of the object reaches 102 meters, and it is a grandiose symbol of scientific and technological progress. </p><p>  The steel structure was built in the style of surrealism.  It is often compared with the Paris Eiffel Tower.  Just like the French landmark, the Atomium was planned as a temporary structure.  He was supposed to be demolished immediately after he played his part: "take part" in the 1958 world exhibition. </p><p>  The architects of the project were Andre Waterkane, Michelle and Andre Polaki.  At that time, the futuristic statue was to demonstrate the victory of socialism over capitalism.  In addition, the Atomium was to become a symbol of the peaceful use of atomic energy.  After the exposition, the structure was not dismantled.  Today it is perceived solely as a cultural and artistic object.  The statue has turned into the most striking landmark in Belgium, the architecture of which fascinates hundreds of thousands of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the country of belgium" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1822903.jpg" width="600"></div>

More precisely, these are atoms that have combined into a piece of the crystal lattice of iron, increased by 165 billion times.  The total weight of the sculpture reaches 2400 tons.  The initial coating of the object was a ball of aluminum.  On each sphere there were 720 plates of a triangular shape.  But in 2006, a major overhaul was carried out, as a result of which the Atomium acquired a steel shell. </p><p>  The windows of the corridors and spheres were originally made of organic glass, but later this material was replaced with tempered glass.  During the capital reconstruction of the facility, connecting pipes, an elevator and escalators were changed in it. </p><p>  Each of the Atomium atoms in Belgium is 18 meters in diameter.  They are connected by 23-meter pipes.  In the middle of these pipes there are connecting corridors and escalators, allowing tourists to move.  Six out of nine balls are always open for tourists. </p><h2>  What does Atomium offer? </h2><p>  In the uppermost sphere of the main symbol of Brussels are a restaurant and a panoramic observation deck.  In the depths of the middle connecting pipe, a high-speed elevator hid, delivering tourists to the above places for 23 seconds.  The observation deck offers stunning landscapes of the Belgian capital and its environs. </p><p>  In the Atomium spheres there are many other institutions that delight visitors.  One of them is a thematic museum.  Its exposition tells about a <span>peaceful atom,</span> about atomic energy, about what achievements were made at different times of its research.  This is a permanent exhibition.  However, temporary exhibitions are regularly organized here, telling about other achievements of scientific and technological progress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, there are cafes, cinemas, a gift shop, concert halls.  There are also rooms in which you are allowed to stay for the night to enjoy the night metropolis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brussels symbol" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1822904.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <h2>  Another miracle of Belgium </h2><p>  Atomium is undoubtedly an amazing object.  But there are some other attractions of the country of Belgium that can easily give odds to the largest atom in the world.  Such a place is, for example, one of the most ancient zoos on Earth - the Antwerp Zoo.  It is located in the Belgian city of Antwerp.  Over 770 species of animals, numbering five thousand individuals, live there.  Giraffes, Indian lions, okapi, Siberian tigers and even pandas live here. </p><p>  The zoo in 1843 established the Royal Zoological Community. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="andre waterkane" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1822905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some more beautiful objects </h2><p>  The main attractions of the country of Belgium are known to all inhabitants of the planet.  Well, who did not hear about the fountain "Manneken Pis", which is a visiting card of Brussels ?!  The Royal Palace, which is called the heart of the capital of Belgium, is also a well-known building. </p><p>  While in Brussels, it is imperative to visit the city of Li√®ge - the largest and oldest settlement in Wallonia.  Popular attractions such as St. Lambert Square, the Perron Fountain and the Walloon Museum are located here. </p><p>  The city of Modav is another Belgian center with world-famous attractions.  Here is the castle of the Counts de Marche, the first mention of which dates back to 1233.  A stunning reserve adjoins it. </p><p>  Belgium is a country that is really worth seeing.  Here, even the air is not the same as everywhere. </p>
