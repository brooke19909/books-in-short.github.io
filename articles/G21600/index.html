How many children did Kesem Sultan have?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Throughout the entire existence of the Ottoman state, not only great sultans, generals and magnificent strategists have been immortalized in history, but also wise, intelligent and treacherous representatives of the fair sex.  Although they were behind the curtains, but this did not stop them from ruling the greatest country.  These include the incomparable Machpeaker, who was a beloved concubine, and who later became the wife of the wise ruler Ahmed I.  Many are interested in this mysterious person and how many children gave birth to Kesem Sultan.  Her life was very remarkable, so many legends and stories are composed about her even in our days. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Little facts are known about the childhood years of the Sultana, only sheer guesses and assumptions.  Many historians believe that she was born at the end of the sixteenth century and at birth, her parents called her Anastasia. </p><p>  Her father was a Greek clergyman.  When the girl was fifteen, she was captured by the slave traders, after which she was put up for sale at a slave market in Constantinople.  The young beauty liked the eunuch of thirteen-year-old Ahmed, so he decided to buy it for him.  So she got into the harem. </p>

    <h2>  Life at the court of the Sultan </h2><p>  In this place she received the nickname "moon-faced".  The young Sultan did not immediately turn his attention to the young and lovely concubine.  But, having a persistent character and great willpower, the girl forbade herself to shed tears about this, as well as in her home and relatives.  She set one sole purpose and firmly decided, by all means, to occupy the highest position in the harem and be sure to win the heart of the Ottoman ruler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For this, the girl began to learn foreign languages, studied the technique of seductive oriental dances, the various rules of palace etiquette, as well as playing all kinds of musical instruments.  And finally, the moment came when the concubine had to go on a date with the Sultan.  The young ruler was struck by her beauty, grace, sharp mind, tact and ability to maintain a conversation on any topic. </p><p>  The Sultan gave the girl another name, which meant "most beloved."  They had deep, sincere and warm feelings.  Undoubtedly, Kesem Sultan <span>and Ahmed</span> 1 were very happy. Their children, of course, were direct evidence of such love. </p>

    <h2>  Descendants of the great woman </h2><p>  She was not the mother of the first son of the ruler and heir to the throne.  But almost every year the Mahpeaker reproduced Ahmed the hereditary shehzade and princesses.  In exchange for this, Kesem Sultan received his great favor.  Her children appeared one after another and in the entire fourteen-year history of the union with the great ruler, she gave birth to thirteen offspring.  Five of them left the world in infancy.  The first child of Kesem Sultan is AIChE, born in 1605. </p><p>  In general, a woman had more daughters than sons.  Possessing extraordinary intelligence and wisdom, she was able to profitably give them in marriage to Kesem Sultan.  Children in the end only managed to strengthen her position at court. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Exile </h2><p>  When the ruler of the empire, Ahmed, died, his brother Mustafa took the place on the throne.  A little later, a coup took place with the participation of Mahfiruz Hatice - the mother of the heir.  After this, the sultan was deposed and Osman II, the son of Ahmed from his other wife, became ruler. </p><p>  Despite this, Kesem still continued to engage in political affairs of the country and thereby interfered with the parent of the young Sultan.  It is believed that it was on her orders that the Machaker was sent into exile in a place away from the palace.  But Osman could not stay in power for long, and as a result of the rebellion he was killed.  And, despite how many children Kesem Sultan had that could take the throne, Mustafa again came to power, although he himself did not want it. </p><h2>  Valide Sultan </h2><p>  A year later, a new coup occurred in the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> .  All this was only in the hands of Kesem Sultan.  Her children could now become rulers of the country.  Therefore, the eleven-year-old Murad IV ascended the throne.  Due to its young age, the state was ruled by his mother. </p><p>  After the death of this ruler, a younger brother, Ibrahim, took the place on the throne.  Therefore, the influence of Valide Sultan at the palace especially increased.  During these years, the <span>Ottoman Empire was</span> in a great crisis.  This ruler was the last son of Kesem Sultan.  The children left at the Machpeaker were representatives of only the weaker sex.  Therefore, Ibrahim needed to think about the continuation of a kind.  But this young man had a complex character and was completely not interested in relations with women. </p>

She brought healers for the ruler from all over the earth.  Finally, such efforts were crowned with success, and the Sultan appeared heir.

    <p>  As a result of the next coup, the ruler of the empire and the last son Valide Sultan died, so her grandson, six-year-old Mehmet, took the place on the throne.  But on this, the unquestioned power of Kesem was over, since the figure of Turkhan, the mother of the young ruler, arose.  A terrible confrontation and constant rivalry of two strong women began, which lasted about three years. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  Despite how many children Kesem Sultan had, they could not give her many grandchildren who could take the reins of government into their own hands.  But besides Mehmet, she still had one offspring of her descendants - Suleiman, whom she decided to enthrone during the coup.  She would have succeeded if Turkhan had not found out about her plans, having ordered the capture and execution of Kesem. </p><p>  Thus, this great woman was killed in 1651 and buried, according to her high position, in a mosque next to her husband. </p>

Everyone who knew her spoke of the Sultana, that she was smart, talented, insightful and beautifully sang.  Ahmed simply adored his Kesem and wished that she was always with him.  But being a wise woman, she never spoke with the Sultan on political issues, so only with her he could feel happy.
