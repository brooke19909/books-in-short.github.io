    <h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  For example, to refuse any service, you can simply call your operator and inform about your intentions.  We‚Äôll dial 0500 from a mobile phone and wait for someone to answer you. </p><p>  Now report that you would like to refuse this or that service.  If necessary, they will ask you for personal data (usually a first and last name is enough), and then fill out an application.  As a last resort, they will explain to you what to do to refuse.  In some cases, you will need to tell the operator a confirmation code to complete the request.  Please note: calling 0500 is absolutely free.  This method is suitable for those who do not really want to understand alternative solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Office visit </h2><p>  How to disable the tariff on the "Megaphone"?  There is such a scenario as a personal visit to the nearest post office of your mobile operator.  Not the most popular, but quite effective option.

    <p>  What is required of you?  Come to the office of the Megafon company and tell the operator that you want to abandon this or that opportunity connected to the SIM card.  Do not forget to bring your passport.  It is sometimes required by employees to make sure the room belongs to a specific person.  Give your phone to an office employee, he will do everything necessary to disable the manipulation, and then return the gadget to you. </p><p>  The option is relevant for those who suddenly think about disabling a particular service directly on the street.  Or if you have plenty of free time.  But subscribers try not to resort to this method.  After all, there are many more ways that will help answer how to disable the tariff on Megafon. </p><h2>  Plan change </h2><p>  If we are talking about the main tariff plan, then you may well not puzzle your mind about the task before us.  If you are thinking about how to disable the "All Inclusive S" ("Megaphone") tariff or any other tariff, simply change it to a new offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="traffic megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128815.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Please note that in some cases, replacing an existing plan is paid.  Details will have to be studied on the official website of the telecom operator.  Usually it‚Äôs enough to enter the USSD command and click on the subscriber‚Äôs call button.  After that, you will receive a message in which the result of the operation will be written.  That's all the problems are solved.  Now we know how to disable the <span>"All Inclusive S"</span> ("Megaphone") tariff.  However, like any other basic plan on a SIM card.  This approach is most often implemented by subscribers throughout the country. </p><h2>  Traffic check </h2><p>  A little distraction.  Some tariff plans and packages have so-called traffic.  "Megaphone" allows all its customers at any time and absolutely free to track it.  This applies to the Internet, and messages, and the free minutes that you have on your account. </p><p>  As a rule, to check traffic, Megafon suggests the use of USSD commands.  For example, for the Internet XS service package, dial * 558 # on your smartphone.  The same goes for the Internet S tariff.  The full list of combinations for verification should be found on the official website of Megafon.  Enumerate them for a very long time.  After all, each tariff has its own USSD requests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the megaphone tariff all-inclusive" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128820.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The official website can also be used to check the balance of traffic.  To do this, go to "My Account" and select the appropriate team there.  There is nothing supernatural in this. </p><h2>  Internet disconnect </h2><p>  Well, more or less figured out how to turn off the tariff.  Megafon, by the way, offers to cancel the Internet in several ways.  Please note that, as in the case of traffic verification, there are a lot of approaches.  But they all consist mainly of SMS requests and commands. </p><p>  For example, "Internet XS" is disabled if you write "Stop" in the message, and then send it to 05009121. After a short wait, you will receive a notification about the successful operation.  Please note: sending SMS is absolutely free.  In addition, you can refuse Internet services using a USSD request.  In our case, this is * 236 * 00 #.  And if we are talking about the Internet S tariff, you can send Stop to the short number 0500122 or through a similar USSD command.  Nothing difficult, right? </p><p>  The only drawback here is that each service has its own teams and short numbers.  And they will have to study.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs impossible to answer how to turn off the tariff on Megafon.  Or you will need to call the operator / personally come to the office.  This is not always convenient.  Therefore, another interesting approach was invented for subscribers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable internet megaphone tariff" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128813.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Personal Area" </h2><p>  Which one?  Suppose we already know all the tariffs that interest us from Megafon.  How to disable services that are no longer needed without assistance?  Use the official page of the mobile operator.  It has a "My Account".  He will help in the implementation of ideas.  It will be possible to answer without problems how to disable the "All Inclusive S" tariff.  "Megaphone" offers using the "Personal Account" to refuse any other proposal.  It is very easy to do. </p><p>  Log in to the Megafon website, after which you will be taken to the page where your profile will be displayed.  Take a look at the Services section.  Find the package you need there, and then look at the right side of the corresponding line.  If you have activated a service, then "Disable" will be displayed opposite it.  Otherwise, you will see "Connect."  Click on the corresponding function.  A line will appear on the screen to enter the operation confirmation code.  He will come in an SMS message immediately after clicking on "Disable".  Sometimes delays of 5-10 minutes are possible, but no more.  Now enter the secret combination and confirm all the manipulations.  It is done. </p><p>  So we became aware of how to turn off the Megafon All Inclusive tariff or any other service on a SIM card using your Personal Account. </p><h2>  SIM card purchase </h2><p>  Sometimes the most logical decision is to buy a SIM card for the phone.  This step allows in one fell swoop to refuse both the tariff plan that has been connected and all additional services.  However, pay attention to the fact that this process is not free.  On average, a Megafon SIM card costs 150-200 rubles.  Not critical, but you should be aware of this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone tariffs how to disable services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128817.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The method is popular when you want to get yourself a new number along with the tariff.  You can buy a SIM card either via the Internet (on the Megafon official website) or at any communication office.  New sim - new features.  There will be no trace of old services. </p>
