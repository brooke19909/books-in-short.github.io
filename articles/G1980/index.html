    <h2>  A little more about the sights </h2><p>  The history of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral began simultaneously with the founding of Novosibirsk, which was still called Novonikolaevsky.  It was the first stone building in the city.  "Azimut" - a hotel in Novosibirsk, located in close proximity to this architectural monument, which is interesting not only for believers.  History connoisseurs will be very surprised by the number of thematic exhibitions, variety and quality of exhibits, visiting the local museum of local lore, which is also located near the hotel. </p><p>  It is also necessary to pay tribute to the Novosibirsk Museum of Railway Engineering, despite the fact that it will have to go quite far towards Berdsk, but it is still Novosibirsk.  The city is very large, there is something to see.  But there is no need to go far to the monument to Sovereign Alexander the Third.  There is also the only memorable farm of the very first bridge across the vast Ob.  It was here that the trains went along the Trans-Siberian Railway to explore the expanses of Siberia.  The guides provided by Azimut will help to inspect all this and not get lost.  Hotel (Novosibirsk) is only grateful for reviews of this service.  In general, there are a lot of reviews about the hotel.  They mention a high level of service, room comfort, service, friendly staff, and especially often guests write about the wonderful cuisine of the Senate restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  One of the largest zoos in the country is also located in Novosibirsk.  A special pride of Siberians is the largest collection of cats and mustelids.  Novosibirsk people like to come here, even if there is not much free time.  Here lovers make appointments, young and old married couples and always a lot of children are walking.  On excursions come daily from very distant cities. </p><p>  Animals do not seem to be burdened by captivity, for each species, a natural habitat is created, aviaries and everything else are equipped: rest corners, catering points, and so on - Novosibirsk did not stint.  The animals of the zoo are unique.  There is a white tiger, a huge number of rare birds.

    <h2>  Azimuth (hotel) </h2><p>  The city of Novosibirsk, as already mentioned, is famous, among other things, for the longest avenue in the world - Red.  This is the main artery where concentrated architectural, historical and cultural attractions. </p><p>  It is not far from Red Avenue that the Azimut (hotel) is located.  Novosibirsk, whose photo can be seen in the article, appreciates its residents and travelers.  Over the years, the hotels of this chain have become part of Novosibirsk, and many other cities of the world.  There are a lot of achievements, there is something to be proud of for the employees who work at the Azimut Hotel.  Hotel (Novosibirsk), whose vacancies are rarely open, values ‚Äã‚Äãits employees: layoffs are extremely rare. </p><h2>  Hotel History </h2><p>  The number of rooms and geographical coverage are such that Azimut is named the largest hotel operator in the country.  It is now one of the fastest growing and growing brands.  The hotel chain was created in Russia, but quickly went abroad, as a business class and a single booking center, European <span>standards of service, and a</span> common corporate culture made it widely in demand.  Guests are offered more than eight thousand rooms, banquet and conference rooms, ubiquitous free Wi-Fi. </p><p>  In addition to the Siberian in question, you need to pay attention to other hotels of this network.  In 2004, the first <span>hotels</span> were opened <span>in Kostroma,</span> Ufa and Samara, a year later they were joined by St. Petersburg, Vladivostok, Astrakhan and Murmansk. </p><p>  In 2006, the Azimut chain was officially presented, and by 2008 it began a journey around the world: hotels were opened in Vienna (Austria), Nuremberg, Munich, Cologne, Dresden, Berlin, Erding (Germany).  In 2010, the Azimut Hotel (Novosibirsk) opened its doors in Siberia.  Its address is: Lenin street, house 21, metro station "Red Avenue".  This is the very center of the city.  But the opening of the hotel in Siberia, the network has not stopped its development.  At the same time opened the same in Voronezh, a year later in Nizhny Novgorod.  After that, the company began a process that simplifies management and integrates Russian and European units into a single network.  The headquarters of AZIMUT Hotels has settled in Moscow.

    <h2>  Reflection of the best </h2><p>  The character and mood of the city, all its main advantages are reflected in the Azimut Hotel.  Hotel (Novosibirsk), the description of which will be presented below, has many advantages.  Differences between hotels of this network located in different cities, of course, exist.  But all hotels are united by a single <span>corporate standard of</span> hospitality.  Equally here, the fact that all hotels: in the cities of Russia, Austria or Germany - are always located in the very center of the city.  They attach great importance to access to the Internet, so everywhere there is both wired and wireless.  The best opportunity to organize an event of any scale simply can not be found: there are excellent modern banquet and conference rooms.  Regular guests are served by special programs, there are even accrual miles for bonuses from all major airlines. </p><p>  And among all the diversity of the Siberian capital, the Azimut hotel chain and the Siberia hotel (Novosibirsk) enjoy a special location.  Booking, that is, a special form of service reservation and room reservation, exists in all three forms.  Most often, the Internet is used, where there is an immediate status confirmation.  There is not only direct booking, in which the client directly receives the services of the supplier when only the hotel‚Äôs tools are working: media with media and contextual advertising are unlikely to give a complete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe experience of previous guests.  Categories of hospitality reviews exist everywhere, as well as the ability to make online reservations at the Azimut Hotel. </p>

    <h2>  The rooms are more expensive </h2><p>  Spacious junior suites are distinguished by a reasonable zoning of the common space, so all sixty can be visually detected at thirty-five and a half square meters.  The work area is quite far from the rest area, and the king-size bed promises a royal rest.  Air conditioning will help to create the necessary weather for the guest in the house.  Telephone, cable TV and high-speed Internet (leased line) will not let you feel in isolation from the rest of the world.  The fridge and minibar will create the right mood.  In addition, the convenience and comfort of a hairdryer, signature slippers and a bathrobe are added.  The bathroom is equipped with everything you need. </p><p>  The most comfortable rooms are suites and superior suites, where there is a plasma panel in the recreation area, upholstered furniture and a cozy bedroom.  These are stylish and elegant two-room rooms with a working area and space for relaxation, air conditioning, a refrigerator and a safe.  In the bathroom there is not only a bath, but also a shower, a bidet and even a telephone.  In the superior, almost fifty-four square meters, there is a large entrance hall, dining room, large-scale living room.  Here you can receive guests and arrange holidays. </p><p>  Only very quick, attentive and ready to provide a full range of services are hired by Azimut.  The hotel (Novosibirsk), whose vacancies appear very rarely, but almost never on the Internet, promises that they will wake you up on time, find all kinds of information, call a taxi, help with your luggage, and organize everything up to excursions. </p>
