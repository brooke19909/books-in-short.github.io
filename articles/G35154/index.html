People lived quietly and went about their crafts.  After several centuries, the Izmailovo district began to attract tourists with its rich history and natural beauty.  There was a need to create a large-scale park for any contingent, and the idea was implemented. </p><h2>  What is the appeal </h2><p>  The territory <span>of the Izmailovo amusement park</span> in Moscow was chosen very well.  Nearby are several ponds, a forested area, and the whole area is planted with green plants.  Nearby is also the famous Izmailovo hotel complex and the Izmailovsky Kremlin - all the delights of Russian traditions for foreign tourists, restaurants, and the crafts market.  A good place for family vacations and entertainment, so tourists and locals are eager to visit the attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park izmailovo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2139981.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The recreation park includes several sites with different themes.  Sports and active games, quiet areas for lovers of contemplation, children's centers and catering facilities. </p><h2>  Journey to a fairy tale </h2><p>  A separate area is reserved for a complete immersion in carefree.  This part of the amusement park - "Attrapark Izmailovo" - has several dozens of special slides, carousels and other attributes of a children's paradise.  Addictive even to adults. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The huge set includes carousels: the family and chain "Hispaniola", as well as an elegant wedding carousel.  It is worth coming here even for vivid photographs, to capture the happy faces of the company during a smooth whirl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park attpark izmailovo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2139993.jpg"></div>  And the old village train is nostalgic for the older generation.  Wooden locomotive on rails as in Soviet times.  In summer, water rides operate.  The canoe river and bumper boats are rafting along an artificial pond.  Also on the pond you can run in balloons.

    <p>  And the highlight of the program is a roller coaster called the Dragon, known for having a dead loop.  That is, visitors are literally turned upside down, while gaining high speed.  This adrenaline rush is not liked by everyone, but is an important part of going to an amusement park.  Photos of the rides in the Izmailovo Park will not convey the feeling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park in Moscow Izmailovo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2140004.jpg"></div>

"Extreme" - a solid jump height, a sense of flying and overcoming gravity, trampolines show aerial tricks.  For children there is an absolutely safe trampoline "Flight".  Its amplitude is adapted to light weight and allows simple exercises to be performed without harm to the spine.  Young children frolic on an inflatable trampoline in a sports room. </p><p>  Team games are held on courts with professional coverage, there are as many as five.  The large territory of the park allows.  To train the tenacity of hands and coordination, you can climb to the climbing wall.  Inveterate racers try themselves on the racetrack and Tanks, and those who dream of cowboy life ride a toy bull on the Rodeo.  To stretch and dance is to go to the "Crazy Dance". </p><h2>  Where to take a breath </h2><p>  Slot machines are also available to take a break from skating.  You can solve puzzles and shoot in the dash using tokens.  The prize-winning attractions of Izmailovo Park offer interesting games with a win-win outcome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park attpark izmailovo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2140017.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And in the summer, not only outdoor games, but also creative workshops are held outdoors.  For example, they teach modeling from clay, painting with sand.  Of the more sophisticated types of creativity - decoupage and cutting seasonal fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  Nearby, a large Ferris wheel rises 50 meters from the ground.  Gorgeous views of the surrounding attractions will open for 7.5 minutes - a full turn of the wheel.  A break from dizzying centrifuges and a view of the city from a height is a great alternative. </p><h2>  For the smallest </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the rides in the Izmailovo park exist for all ages.  Therefore, next to the attrapark in the very center of the cultural and entertainment complex, there is a specialized Kroha children's zone.  Everything is done as colorful and safe as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions in the park Izmailovo photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65853/2140007.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Small family slide, so that children feel comfortable and do not feel fear.  Also a smaller version of the Ferris wheel.  Roundabouts in the form of chocolate cups and stylized, but very detailed planes.  Joy for kids and peace of mind for parents. </p><h2>  How to entertain yourself </h2><p>  The natural complex of culture and recreation is known not only for attractions.  Since not everyone gravitates towards spinning, tossing, and turning over devices, ordinary paths and alleys for admiring nature are equipped.  And to breathe fresh air was even more useful, you can rent equipment: </p><ul><li>  bicycles (adults, children and teenagers, tandems); </li><li>  roller skates of any size; </li><li>  scooters, segways and electric cars for accelerated movement; </li><li>  Nordic walking poles. </li></ul><p>  And also in Izmailovsky Park there is a family riding club, where you can not only ride, but also learn how to handle horses.  Under the guidance of competent instructors, amateur classes are held. </p><h2>  Winter time </h2><p>  In the cold season, the huge ice rink ‚ÄúSilver Ice‚Äù opens in the central part of the park: 8000 square meters of natural and 3300 artificial ice.  Hire is available in hockey and figure skates.  A caf√© with hot drinks and pastries is located on site.  Nearby there are snow slides and a small cinema. </p><p>  Also in winter in the Izmailovo theme park there is a winter sports school.  Here anyone can learn to skate or ski, play hockey and winter football.  Local competitions are also held here. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  A must-see place for tourists and families, located next to the entire infrastructure.  Nearest metro stations: Enthusiasts and Izmaylovskaya Highway (MCC). </p><p>  The exact address of the Izmailovo Amusement Park: <span>Moscow,</span> Bolshoi Krug 7 <span>alley</span> . </p><p>  Entrance to the park is absolutely free, and the cost of attractions does not exceed 200 rubles.  A cultural place full of vibrant events and giving new experiences. </p>
