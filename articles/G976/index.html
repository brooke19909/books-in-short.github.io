If we talk about the appearance, then each of them is a piece of plastic measuring 53.98 by 85.6 mm, which can have either a magnetic strip or a chip.  The difference is that in the second case, the funds on the card account are considered more secure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank cards" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/75797.jpg" width="300"></div><br><br>  Any bank card is a very convenient means of payment.  Not for nothing that their number is increasing annually at a good pace.  Through ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, Russians receive wages and pensions, scholarships in educational institutions, accumulate interest on <span>deposits</span> and so on. <br><br>  <strong>About varieties</strong> <br><br>  Currently, <span>bank cards</span> come in several varieties: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Settlement - used to pay for goods or services within the framework of funds available on the account of the holder.  The process of registration is quite simple, and the cost of maintenance is low. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Credit - allow you to use the funds of the issuing bank, without going beyond the established limit, which is calculated based on the solvency of the citizen.  Situations may arise when the amount of withdrawn funds exceeds the limit.  This means that the holder "climbed" into the overdraft.  The interest on it is high, so try not to allow this. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Prepaid - a great option to give someone a gift.  It happens that a person does not want to give money.  In this case, you can replenish the prepaid "plastic" account, and then give it as a gift. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Intrabank - a special type of payment instrument that can be used exclusively at ATMs, cash centers and terminals of the issuer. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment by cellular credit card" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/75799.jpg" width="579"></div>  The product in question is fully versatile.  Each holder can either withdraw cash from the ATM network and pay for the purchase, or do it by bank transfer.  Subject to the limitations above. <br><br>  It is also possible to pay by cellular credit card.  A very useful and convenient service, I must say.  By the way, it can be carried out both by order (by sending the appropriate SMS message), and as part of the automatic recharge service of a mobile phone. <br><br>  <strong>But she is ...</strong> <br><br>  Now I would like to dwell in more detail on such a variety as a virtual bank card.  With her, it is like a gopher from one famous Russian film: the heroes of the rodent did not see, but he was. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual bank card" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/75801.jpg" width="575"></div>  So this product is not ‚Äúplastic‚Äù in its classical sense.  This is a set of details that allows you to pay for goods on the Internet.  We only need to indicate the card limit, get the number, CVV-code and its validity.  Most often, this product is executed in the case when they do not want to risk funds in the main account.  Even if the information mentioned is compromised, virtual type bank cards for withdrawing money cannot be used under any circumstances.  Unless with their help you can buy something on the Web.  But only within the limit.  Therefore, do not set it too large.
