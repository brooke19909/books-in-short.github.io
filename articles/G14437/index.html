An insurance document will help you get paid to the victim due to a traffic accident.  But most drivers do not know where to go in an accident, which insurance company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which insurance to apply for in an accident" class="if uuid-2727887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727887.jpg"></div><h2>  CTP </h2><p>  <span>OSAGO insurance</span> helps drivers in case of a traffic accident to repair damage.  This agreement is binding on all drivers.  Moreover, the policy does not insure the car itself, but only the responsibility of drivers who are driving.  If the owner of the vehicle does not insure the car, then in the event of a traffic accident, the perpetrator will have to compensate the victim with his own funds.  Thus, the culprit will need to repair his car, as well as someone else's.  Typically, the amount of payments for the victim is set in court. </p><h2>  Accident </h2><p>  A traffic accident is an event that occurred as a result of the movement of a vehicle, which caused other cars to be damaged, and caused harm to the life and health of people, buildings and structures.  Compared to other countries, there are many accidents in the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mitchgrissim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two car accident" class="if uuid-2727889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727889.jpg"></div><h2>  Appeal to the company of the culprit </h2><p>  In an accident, contact which insurance company?  This question can be answered based on the circumstances of the accident: </p><ul><li>  number of cars involved in the accident; </li><li>  nature of damage; </li><li>  casualties during the accident; </li><li>  the presence of a genuine insurance policy for all participants; </li><li>  terms of contacting insurance companies. </li></ul><p>  What insurance to apply after an accident?  If not only cars but also people were injured due to the accident, then the company of the guilty party should deal with the matter.  That is, the injured driver takes the policy of the culprit, prepares all the necessary documents and addresses the insurance company.  After writing the application, you must provide your car for inspection to the insurer.  You cannot be late or postpone the meeting, since the faster all the procedures go through, the faster the driver will be able to receive payment and repair his vehicle.  Often in an insured event, the amount of damage exceeds the limit for compulsory motor liability insurance.  With this scenario, the victim must receive money from the company of the culprit, and the remaining amount must be received from the guilty driver. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ruyameali.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accident with injured" class="if uuid-2727892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727892.jpg"></div><h2>  Submission of documents after an accident </h2><p>  After the victim found out which insurance company to contact in case of an accident, he needs to decide on a list of necessary documents.  There are two types of documents: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Documents that are always in the hands of the driver. </li><li>  Information provided by the traffic police officer (it is necessary to check the correctness of writing personal data so that there are no problems with receiving payments in the future). </li></ol><p>  What documents are needed in the insurance after an accident?  List of required papers: </p><ul><li>  Passport of the owner of the vehicle, which in the accident was the injured party. </li><li>  Statement.  The form is provided by an employee of the company. </li><li>  Bank details.  Necessary for the insurer to transfer funds.  Valid requisites without restrictions. </li><li>  A document or a certificate of a traffic accident is issued by the traffic police. </li><li>  Protocol on accident (its copy). </li><li>  A notice in which the scheme of the incident is indicated, as well as the incident itself is described.  This document is filled in by all participants in the accident at the site. </li><li>  Documents for the affected property, that is, for a motor vehicle (PTS). </li></ul><p>  What documents should be submitted to the insurance after an accident additionally?  In addition to the basic documents, the victim has the right to provide additional information.  For example, bills, receipts for services that were required due to an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.einsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Appeal to the insurer" class="if uuid-2727890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727890.jpg"></div><h2>  The culprit has no policy </h2><p>  What kind of insurance does the victim of a traffic accident go to if the guilty party does not have an insurance policy?  Using a motor vehicle without an insurance policy protecting driver liability is prohibited by law.  Punishment for violation of the law is in the form of a fine of 800 rubles.  Therefore, most drivers argue that it is more profitable not to purchase a policy, as their police officers may not stop.  This opinion is erroneous, since the policy is valid for a year, and during this period of time, police officers can stop the owner of the car many times.  Accordingly, you will have to pay a fine for every time a person comes across a violation of the law. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But a fine is not a terrible punishment.  Car driving can lead to a traffic accident. </p><p>  If the culprit of the accident does not have an insurance policy, then what should the victim do, what insurance to apply for in case of an accident?  In this case, there are few options.  The victim may try to contact their insurance company in order to receive payment in a short time.  But not always the insurance company agrees to the payment.  If the insurer agreed to pay the funds, then in the future there will be a regression in relation to the culprit.  That is, the insurance company will file a lawsuit in court in order to recover money from the culprit to cover the costs associated with a particular accident. </p><p>  If the insurance company refused to pay the injured party, then the driver needs to receive money from the culprit.  The victim assesses the damage, negotiates with the culprit about the amount and time of payment.  If the guilty driver agrees to pay, then there is no need to go to court.  But if the driver does not want to pay, then you need to appeal to the court in a short time.  By decision of the court, the guilty driver will be required to pay the money and cover all additional costs associated with the accident, within the time period set by the court. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesnews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Going to court" class="if uuid-2727886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727886.jpg"></div><h2>  The driver is not included in the policy list </h2><p>  Drivers often break the law and can drive without a policy.  But sometimes people who are not included in the policy get into an accident.  That is, the owner of the vehicle has a valid insurance policy, but there is no culprit.  In this case, the injured person will not be able to use this policy.  Payment will have to be requested from the culprit.  That is, the issue is regulated in the same way as in the absence of a policy at all.  Therefore, in an accident it is necessary to check the policy of the guilty party for the presence of the driver in the list of the contract.  Sometimes the victim does not check the information in the document and receives a refusal due to the fact that the document does not contain the intruder. </p><h2>  The fake policy of the culprit </h2><p>  After an accident, which insurance company should the driver contact if the perpetrator had a fake policy?  During a traffic accident, it is imperative to check the policy of the offender for the presence and authenticity of the policy.  Authenticity can be verified using the PCA website.  To do this, you need to drive in the basic data of the car or the policy itself.  If the information is not found, then the policy is fake. </p><p>  The presence of a fake policy is equivalent to its absence.  Therefore, in this case, you must try to contact your insurance company or file a lawsuit in court to receive payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tarbija24.postimees.ee" data-author=": Scanpix, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accident protocol" class="if uuid-2727888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727888.jpg"></div><h2>  Loss of license </h2><p>  What kind of insurance to apply for in case of an accident if the company of the culprit has lost its license?  In accordance with the law, the deprivation of the license of the <span>insurance company</span> does not remove the obligation to pay the organization.  That is, when the license is withdrawn or limited, the insurance company can no longer sell policies, but it is obliged to make payments.  Therefore, in an insured event, the injured driver has the right to contact the company of the culprit, even if it already does not have a license. </p><p>  If the company, citing the lack of a license, refuses to pay, then the driver needs to go to court.  It is also necessary to write a complaint to the PCA system. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in case of deprivation of a license, PCA can cover the damage caused during a traffic accident.  But this process is lengthy.  And drivers usually can‚Äôt wait for payment and carry out car repairs on their own. </p><h2>  Europrotocol </h2><p>  What kind of insurance should I apply to in case of an accident if there are no serious violations?  Since 2014, it has become possible for drivers to contact their insurance company using the Euro Protocol.  But in order to be able to use it, certain conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  Only two vehicles are involved in a traffic accident. </li><li>  There is no disagreement between the drivers over who was guilty. </li><li>  Damage received due to a traffic accident should be no more than 50,000 rubles.  Sometimes there are hidden damages that can be detected only after inspecting the car in the service.  Therefore, before agreeing to Europrotocol, you must be sure that there are no serious damages. </li><li>  The damage was caused only to vehicles. </li><li>  There are no injured or dead people. </li><li>  All drivers involved in the accident have a valid and genuine insurance policy. </li></ul><p>  When issuing the Euro Protocol, there is no need to call the police.  The form of the document is issued together with the insurance policy.  Making a protocol is a convenient solution, since you do not need to spend time and wait for the police, but you can independently resolve the issue in a short time. </p><h2>  Period </h2><p>  After the driver has determined which insurance to apply for in an accident, he needs to provide all the documents without violating the deadline.  In 2018, there were changes in terms.  Previously, the driver could contact the insurance company within fifteen days.  But now the circulation time has been reduced to five days.  That is, if the driver for this period does not fit in the office of the company, then in the future he will be refused payment.  Therefore, in order to receive funds, it is necessary to collect and submit all documents within five days. </p><p>  If the owner of the vehicle could not contact the insurance company for reasons beyond his control, then the insurer has no right to refuse to pay.  But this requires documentary evidence.  For example, the victim was in the hospital - he must submit the sick leave as confirmation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hoffmannworkcomp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accident with injured" class="if uuid-2727891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2727891.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what to do in case of an accident, which insurance company to contact the affected party.  In Russia, many accidents happen every day, and they are all different.  Most often, the injured driver turns to the company of the culprit.  But there are exceptions in which he has the right to contact his company.  After an accident, it is important to check all documents for correct completion, since the payment depends on them.  It is also necessary to collect all the documentation in a short time, since the time for contacting the insurance company is limited. </p>
