Another sensation in the industry was the cheapest smartphone, released with a protective glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. It is called VKWorld VK700X.  Reviews about the device, information about its characteristics, as well as our findings will be discussed in this article.  And we will start it with a description of the concept of this model, with a designation of how it is characteristic and differs from others. </p>

    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  As already noted, the <span>VKWorld VK700X</span> smartphone <span>(the reviews</span> of which we have prepared in the following sections of the article) is positioned in the budget niche.  At least this is evidenced by the title of ‚Äúcheapest‚Äù in one category or another.  The availability of the model may also be indicated by its technical characteristics.  In particular, this is 1 GB of RAM and the MTK6580 processor. </p><p>  However, do not immediately enroll the device to the category of ‚Äúcheap Chinese‚Äù, who have overestimated technical characteristics and are not able to perform the simplest steps stably.  We will conduct a more detailed review of all systems of the device and try to compose a single picture of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  We begin the description of the device with a description of its design - how the model looks and from which components it is assembled.  So, externally, the model resembles either Apple's technique, or some kind of ‚Äúflagship‚Äù from Samsung: this is evidenced by the chrome bezel on the side faces, which is visible even from afar.  It definitely makes models expensive. </p><p>  Separately, we can note the appearance of the front side of the smartphone.  It has classic navigation buttons represented by icon lights.  Other than that, there is no other expression for these buttons anymore.  But the connection of the blackened front part and the shiny ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù, which covers the sides and the back, looks very beautiful.  It turns out quite a spectacular combination of metal and glass, of which the VKWorld VK700X is made.  Reviews also write that design is one of the strengths of the device. </p><p>  Separately, I would like to note the attractive oval volume buttons and the button to unlock the screen (also made of metal). </p><p>  The back side of the device is plastic, a round peephole of the camera with a flash is placed on it, and there is also the inscription vkworld.  Below is a hole for the speaker. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone that we characterize in this article is equipped with a 5-inch display, so it can be called classic in size.  As for the external coating, here we have installed a <span>protective glass</span> Gorilla Glass 3, which we already mentioned at the very beginning of the article.  To prove that it has increased strength, the smartphone‚Äôs advertising video shows its crash test.  The reviews describing the VKWorld VK700X model confirm the stability of the glass of the smartphone. </p><p>  As for the technical characteristics of the screen, it has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  It should also be noted that the display operates on the basis of IPS technology, which can characterize it as such, which has high brightness, good picture quality (image density of 294 pixels per inch is proof of this) and excellent color reproduction. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Of course, special attention in each mobile device deserves its ‚Äúheart‚Äù - a processor that determines the performance of the model.  In the case of VKWorld VK700X, reviews note that <span>Mediatek MT6580A</span> is used <span>.</span>  This is a solution for budget devices, which shows, frankly, not the highest stability.  But with the refresh rate of the image of the 4-core processor, everything is fine - each core has a frequency of 1.5 GHz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the graphics processor, in this case, the ARM Mali-400 MP1 is used. </p><p>  The RAM installed on the phone has a capacity of 1 GB. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Characterizing any smartphone, it is important to indicate the parameters of its camera.  In the case of VKWorld VK700X, reviews note the presence of two cameras - the main and front (with a resolution of 8 and 5 megapixels, respectively).  In addition to the camera, the device also comes with a powerful LED flash, which allows you to take high-quality pictures even in low light conditions. </p><p>  The main camera supports the ability to shoot movies in 1080p quality. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device, according to official data, does not have support for working with 4G-format networks, instead there are 2G / 3G-modules.  The device operates at all frequencies supported by standard devices.  At the same time, it is worth noting the presence of two SIM card slots, which makes the model somewhat more universal: the user can significantly save on payment for mobile services by choosing different operators to purchase services of one nature or another (for example, call from one operator and use the Internet from another).  Speaking about communication modules, it is important to note the <span>Wi-Fi adapter, Bluetooth,</span> GPS, USB support. </p><p>  There is no NFC function for contactless payment of bills using a smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Almost any Android device has such a problem as a lack of optimization in work.  As a result, you can observe a gradual reduction in the duration of the device, its rapid loss of charge.  Only battery replacement or an additional purchase of so-called Power banks will help to avoid discharging your gadget at the wrong time.  With them, you can extend the life of the device. </p><p>  The reviews describing the VKWorld VK700X MTK6580A model also confirm the presence of this problem.  Whatever the device, the size of its battery is limited by the physical parameters of the device.  Due to this, it is not necessary to talk about its long work, and even during the operation of a colorful screen that is actively consuming charge.  Therefore, we can say that the battery with a capacity of 2200 mAh, which is installed on the original VKWorld VK700X, is called not the most ‚Äúhardy‚Äù.  At least in the video viewing mode via Wi-Fi connection in one hour 15-17% of the battery disappears from the battery.  Not the last role in this is played by the Android operating system, which also consumes battery power quite actively. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  By the way, speaking about the firmware of the device and its platform, Anroid Lollipop 5.1 should be noted, which, possibly, will be updated to the next, sixth version in the future.  In fact, if the smartphone‚Äôs software is based on the classic Android, the graphical interface is non-native.  The fact that it is modified gives out slightly changed icons - they seem smaller and have more rounded corners. </p><p>  There are also some ‚Äúnon-native‚Äù additional functions.  For example, using the left button you can call up the menu responsible for the visual design of the system (effects, smooth transitions, window opening style).  There is also a ‚ÄúSmart Movement" item.  Its meaning is to be able to call any function while the phone is in sleep mode. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, we made a brief technical description of the VKWorld VK700X device.  The feedback of the owners that we used when writing this article came mainly from those who reviewed this device, as well as from those who only recently started using a smartphone.  The reason for this is its recent release (the model was released only in 2015).  At the time of this writing, he has only been on official sale for several weeks (and by no means in all stores).  Now, at least, you can find the device on Chinese online sites. </p><p>  Those recommendations that we were able to find are positive.  As for the device, the cost of which is only $ 60, the phone holds well.  Reviews describing VKWorld drill VK700X mark its stable operation, rather high build quality and nice looking design.  Regarding the technical parameters, we already wrote above - on them the device can be characterized quite positively. </p><p>  Therefore, in general, we can say that the phone deserves attention.  It is simple to operate, affordable, has fairly strong specifications and supports two SIM cards.  Those users who write about receiving it from online stores rate it high, recommending it to others.  We also join in this view. </p>
