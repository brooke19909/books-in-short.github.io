Tourists reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays in Cyprus are always wonderful.  The mild climate, white beaches and crystal waves are a fabulous island where Aphrodite emerged from the foam of the sea. </p><p>  In Cyprus, there are many hotels for every taste in both the Greek and Turkish sectors.  This article provides information about the reviews of tourists who visited the Seagull Hotel Apts 3 - a small hotel in the resort town of Protaras in the Turkish part of the island. </p><h2>  Protaras </h2><p>  In ancient times, Protaras was an ancient Greek polis (from which small ruins were preserved).  In 1974, this part of Cyprus was occupied by the Turks, and the active development of the resort industry began in Protaras.  Now dozens of hotel complexes, restaurants and entertainment centers have been built here. <strong></strong></p><p>  <span>The best beaches of Cyprus</span> are located in Protaras, for example, the world famous Fig Tree Bay <span>(</span> Fig <span>Trees),</span> not far from which Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * is located. </p><p>  Protaras has a reputation as a resort for a relaxing and quiet holiday.  In search of more active entertainment, you can go to the neighboring village of Ayia Napa (6 km), where a youth audience gathers. </p><p>  Among the local attractions, one should mention the medieval Orthodox church dedicated to Elijah the Prophet (14th century) and built on a hilltop with amazing views of the sea coast. </p><h2>  Climate and beaches </h2><p>  The climate in Protaras is subtropical (as on the whole island) - dry, hot summers (25-40 degrees), warm spring and autumn (30 Celsius), not at all cold winters (15 warm).  For Russian tourists accustomed to the cold, this means that you can relax here all year round - it is warm in any season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beaches stretch almost continuous sand strip and are the best in Cyprus.  There are no high waves, the sand is fine and clean, the entrance to the sea is shallow, the water is warm and clear (and the most beautiful shades of blue and emerald color) - a paradise for families with children. </p>

    <p>  From the Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * to the municipal beach is only 2 minutes walk.  This is a calm bay where you can not only swim, but also engage in diving, as well as other water sports. </p><p>  There are no crowds on the beaches, you can always find a free place.  The most well-equipped beach is in Ayia Napa (a neighboring resort).  An excellent beach in the Bay of Figs near the Chaika Hotel (you can take a bus for one and a half euros).  One of the most beautiful is Konnos Bay, which you have to go down along a magnificent path (you can walk to it from Seagull Hotel Apts, but with a child the transition will be difficult). </p><p>  Near Cape Greco there is also a nice beach and Pirate Caves, where tourists have fun jumping from a cliff. </p><p>  Very popular beaches in the bay of Pernera (200 meters from the "Seagull"), they are often called chamber for privacy, comfort and tranquility. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists who lived in Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * report that on any beaches for a sunbed and umbrella you need to pay 5-7 euros (depending on the particular beach), and in local stores you can buy a beach umbrella for 10-11 euros. </p><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * (Cyprus) is a hotel with "home" apartments, that is, with a kitchen corner in each room, where you can cook your own meals and not pay for meals. </p>

    <p>  The rooms do not have a TV, but there is a radio, a bathroom with a bathtub (soap, shampoo, gel, toilet paper are provided), a balcony, air conditioning, a hairdryer and a kitchenette with a set of dishes and household appliances. </p><p>  There is no Internet in the rooms (only in the lobby).  For an additional fee, you can take a safe (10 euros per week), but it is very small, only for documents, and the tablet, for example, does not fit. </p><p>  Tourists living in Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * (Protaras) note that there are no insects in the hotel, the rooms are spacious, but there is nowhere to hang wet bathing suits and towels - there is no rope or clothes rack on the balcony. </p><p>  Air conditioners are often installed directly opposite the bed, so some tourists moved their beds (and the cleaners put them back daily), while others changed the head and slept with their feet to the air conditioner. </p><p>  All balconies of the studio apartments face Protaras Street or the parking lot (almost always empty), with views of the mountains and trees. </p><p>  The furniture is upholstered with dermantine, water is pumped into the toilet with a special lever. </p><p>  Mostly tourists are satisfied with their stay at Seagull Hotel Apts 3 *.  The photo below gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa typical studio room. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * is located 2 km from the center of the resort town of Protaras and 60 km from the international airport in Larnaca (transfer to the hotel takes one and a half hours, as the "Seagull" is at the very end of Protaras). </p><p>  Nearby there is a car rental and bus stop, from where you can go to almost any <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Cyprus.</span> </p><p>  The "Seagull" is located near several beautiful beaches with a gently sloping bottom and calm clear water, so there are many children here, and for tourists with kids there will always be a fun company. </p><p>  The town has a large number of various cafes, taverns and shops, as well as a picturesque promenade (promenade), connecting all the beaches of Protaras. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  Many tourists report their impressions of their stay at Seagull Hotel Apts 3 * (Cyprus).  Reviews confirm the hotel‚Äôs good reputation. </p><p>  The spaciousness and convenience of studio apartments, the good work of air conditioners, which cool almost the entire room, are noted. </p><p>  The pool is large and comfortable. There are bars and cafes in the hotel and on the territory. </p>

    <p>  The kitchen corner is well equipped, there is everything necessary for cooking and receiving guests. </p><p>  The reviews also mention the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  dermantine covering of sofas and armchairs; </li><li>  inconvenient location of air conditioners; </li><li>  lack of a TV; </li><li>  cold floors (tiled); </li><li>  noise (loud music from the street bar opposite and the hotel bar near the pool). </li></ul><h2>  External irritants </h2><p>  Annoying noise is noted by almost all tourists who lived in Seagull Hotel Apts 3 *.  The reviews are full of reports of constant music from two bars - outside on the street and inside near the pool. </p><p>  In all rooms below 4 floors, many tourists could not fall asleep either at night (music plays until 2 o‚Äôclock) or during the day (noise starts from 11 a.m.).  Closed windows and balconies and included air conditioning did not help. </p><p>  For older people and families with children, the ability to get enough sleep is very important, so you should pay attention to this feature when choosing a hotel. </p><p>  On the other hand, many tourists believe that music does not interfere very much - with the windows closed and their headphones closed, they slept quietly in their apartments.  In addition, there are people who go to bed late. </p><p>  Also, one should not forget that loud music in bars is characteristic not only for the Chaika Hotel, but also for most hotels in many popular resorts.  Therefore, replacing a place of residence does not always help to solve the problem. </p><p>  And finally, the proximity to the bar gives one advantage - a good Wi-Fi signal and the ability to calmly watch movies on the Internet in your room (in headphones), not paying attention to external irritants. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The staff of the Protaras Seagull Hotel Apts 3 hotel complex is always attentive and responsive, but there are no Russian-speaking staff at the reception, although there are maids who speak Russian, and you can always ask them to help in communicating with the administrators. </p><p>  The rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily (tips - 1 euro - usually left on the table).  Very clean in the pool and on the playground, the territory is well looked after. </p><p>  If vacationers arrived before 14.00 (when check-in begins), then they can leave their luggage in the luggage room and go to the beach. </p><p>  At the reception you can ask for an iron or an adapter to charge the phone - employees will always meet you (you need to pay a deposit, which is returned upon departure). </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The price includes only a continental breakfast - the same set of products every day: </p><ul><li>  tea, coffee, milk, juice (2 types, diluted concentrate); </li><li>  yogurt with jam (4 types); </li><li>  croutons, toasts, margarine (no butter); </li><li>  fried eggs, fried potatoes, sausages; </li><li>  omelet (once a week); </li><li>  canned beans, olives, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers; </li><li>  bread, cereal (muesli 4 types); </li><li>  processed cheese and inexpensive sausage; </li><li>  watermelon. </li></ul><p>  It should be remembered that there is no baking, fruit, butter, milk porridge - therefore, many people (especially with children) prefer not to take breakfast at all, but to cook in the room. </p><h2>  Self catering </h2><p>  Near the hotel there are many grocery stores, as well as taverns and restaurants where you can order wonderful Cypriot dishes (the portions are very large, so you can take for two), as well as soups for children, seafood, etc. </p><p>  For example, a hot meat dish with a side dish and a salad of fresh vegetables costs 6-10 euros (in institutions with live music - 11-14 euros).  For regular customers who come for the second time, they give a 10% discount. </p><p>  In restaurants you can have a delicious dinner for 30-40 euros for two (with alcohol). </p><p>  According to reviews, the nearby stores have a very limited range of products and high prices, so you need to go to a large supermarket - it's cheaper there. </p><p>  Interestingly, everywhere in Cyprus, coffee is not very good, even in cafes.  <span>Tea Lipton</span> sachets costs 4 euros.  But pizza is much better than in Russia. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Excursions are cheaper to take at agencies on the streets of the town, rather than from a tour operator.  The duration is a whole day, they give a dry breakfast with them, they must go to the buses at 6.30 in the morning.  The following trips are offered: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúGrand Grand Tour‚Äù (with tasting of olives, wines, liquors and other local products). </li><li>  ‚ÄúSea safari‚Äù (10 euros, children under 12 years old are free; from 10.30 to 13.30, ride a ship along the coast, swimming in the lagoon). </li><li>  ‚ÄúOn land and at sea‚Äù (a tour of the beaches, swimming in the lagoon). </li></ul><p>  Those who do not want to get up early and love independent rest, it is better to rent a car, ATV or buggy to ride on their own in Paralimni, Famagusta and Ayia Napa, visit the fountain show, water park and other interesting places. </p><p>  For children, many playgrounds and attractions have been built (near taverns and hotels).  At 20.00, a children's disco begins at the Crown Resort Hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Here is a list of things to take with you when traveling to Cyprus at the Chaika Hotel: </p><ul><li>  Clothesline clothespins (dry wet bathing suits and towels on the balcony). </li><li>  Express porridge (for children). </li><li>  Shampoo and gel (sometimes they are not in the room). </li><li>  Slippers (cold floor). </li><li>  Earplugs or headphones (noise from the bar). </li><li>  Tea and coffee bags. </li><li>  English dictionary (can be electronic on the phone). </li><li>  Convenient kitchen knife (usually dumb and old in the room). </li><li>  A flash drive with films, books and games (there is no Internet in the rooms). </li><li>  <span>Beach towels</span> (hotel does not provide). </li><li>  Lightweight plaid (put on a dermantine sofa and use while traveling). </li></ul><p>  Also, many tourists recommend the following: </p><ul><li>  Take products in large supermarkets: Metro (go towards Paralimni) and Lind in Protaras (on foot for half an hour or by bus for one and a half euros). </li><li>  Order a <span>dry breakfast</span> in the evening if an excursion is planned in the morning. </li><li>  Buy a <span>beach umbrella</span> in the store (cheaper than paying every day), and then sell it to other vacationers. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Chaika Hotel is a very satisfactory budget vacation option for those who do not want to overpay for relative luxury and towel swans, but prefer to travel more, returning to the hotel only to spend the night or to wash. </p>
