    <h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  Each section is equipped with high-speed silent European-made elevators, guaranteeing comfort and safety to every resident.  Spacious entrances with wide flights of stairs, stained-glass windows are what all customers have noted.  The innovative project of GK PIK "Salaryevo Park" was among the best projects of our time. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  If you want to live in a well-developed and developed area, to buy an apartment at a very affordable cost, the best option for you would be PIK Group (new buildings).  "Salaryevo Park" offers all residents a wide selection of apartments from 1 to 4 rooms: everyone will find the best option in every respect.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments is presented in the range from 19 to 92 square meters with a ceiling height of 3.2 meters.  It is clear that the apartments are not impressive in spaciousness, for a four-room 92 square - quite a bit.  Yes, the outlet housing turned out to be small, but due to the rational approach and the reasonableness of planning decisions, it is possible to use every square meter of area. </p>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Among the presented planning solutions from the Salaryevo Park LCD (PIK) are classic options and real designer finds that will surely attract the attention of brave and extraordinary personalities.  European planning - a new developer, combining functionality and comfort.  By the way, apartments with such a layout are sold out first.  In such housing space is clearly divided.  A kitchen-living room becomes a public area intended for eating and family evenings, and isolated bedrooms hidden in the far side of the apartment are designed to provide comfortable sleep and relaxation.  Due to this, even in a small four-room apartment, it is possible to provide maximum comfort to each tenant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
