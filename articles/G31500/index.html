Not in vain Helios generously endowed this paradise of the earth with sunny weather, which attracts many tourists eager for a gracious rest to this territory. </p><h2>  Land of the Gods </h2><p>  The Greek god Poseidon, endowed with the power to control the elements of water, generously endowed this region with magnificent sea depths with a gentle surf.  Aeolus, the <span>god of the wind,</span> brings a light breeze and a romantic atmosphere to the Greek lands.  Dionysus is called to closely monitor the plantations of grapes that belong to Attaviros. </p><p>  Rhodes can certainly be called the largest Dodecanese island.  Once upon a time, Helios was considered his patron, because the name of this geographical object now sounds like "island of the Sun."  On this magical land there are many hotel complexes.  One of the noteworthy is the Olive Garden Hotel in Rhodes (Greece). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olive garden hotel 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1526424.jpg" width="550"></div>

The cost of sightseeing trips offered by the hotel will be given below. </p><p>  Fans of sightseeing holidays in Greece expect a trip to the territory of the old <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes</span> and a monastery with a huge history called Filerimos.  The departure program includes a visit to the monastery itself, the oldest Ilissos and observation of the city from the height of a special observation deck.  It is also proposed to visit the place where there are remains of ancient Rhodes.  The excursion program includes a trip to the so-called homeland of the Colossus of Rhodes.  The cost of the tour (together with a pass ticket) is approximately 37 euros.  By the way, the island of Rhodes in Greece was recently officially registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  Near it there are corners of a lost nature, from the beauty of which it simply takes your breath away.  Each tourist can have very vivid memories from visiting the famous Greek Valley of the Butterflies.  The Greek Pompeii, or Kamiros, will never leave anyone indifferent.  The bus stops for a photo shoot on the island of Kritinia, whose nature is simply fabulously beautiful.  Embona village will be remembered by holidaymakers as the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù of the world's best wines.  Winery tasting is free of charge.  Also, guests are invited to dine in a real tavern, built and equipped according to all the laws of the Greek style.  At Monolithos, travelers can admire and appreciate the grandeur of the chapel, which was hollowed out in stone.  These neighborhoods are famous for their excellent production of honey and olive oil.  Also in this area is the collection of honey from thyme and the production of branded wine and vodka products.  The total price of a guided tour is approximately 41 euros.  For lunch and tickets to the Valley of the Butterflies and Kamiros for 6 euros.  Entrance to the valley of butterflies costs 5 euros.  The cost of lunch during the tour is about 13 euros. </p><p>  Lindos is considered one of the most beautiful places on the island of Rhodes.  The Ionites had built a high fortress several centuries ago, which proudly rises above all the streets and alleys of the old city.  The Acropolis is still considered one of the most popular tourist spots in Greece.  If a traveler, tired after a long ascent, glances at least with one peep at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, then all despondency will be lifted like a hand, and instead a feeling of deep admiration for the creation of human hands will come.  Lovers of exotic are offered the option of moving on a donkey.  During the tour, you can visit the houses of famous captains, visit the church and the Acropolis.  A return trip can be offered by a visit to a china factory.  The price for the tour is approximately 51 euros.  Having been once in Greece, a person will definitely not want to limit himself to one visit and will come there again. </p><p>  The best criterion for evaluating the hotel Olive Garden Hotel 3 * - traveler reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olive garden hotel rhodes 3 greece" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1526422.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  According to experienced travelers, if possible, it is better to check into the rooms located on the second floor.  They offer beautiful views of the pool and mountains.  All apartments are well equipped.  Available there is modern furniture, a bathroom combined with a bathroom.  Everything is clean and well maintained.  Pleased with the presence of a plasma TV, however, from the Russian channels shows only one.  Even at elevated temperatures on the street, air conditioning may not be used.  The room is very comfortable.  Internet is available, but for an additional fee of 20 euros per week.  You can access the network from only one device. </p><p>  There is no safe in the rooms, so it‚Äôs better not to leave valuables in sight. </p><p>  The food in the hotel Olive Garden 3 * (Greece Rhodes Island), judging by the reviews, is delicious and of high quality.  The food is not very varied, but it is quite possible to satisfy hunger.  A large assortment of fruits is offered.  Free cocktails and beer are very decent.  Water is sold in the lobby and in the store.  Price - $ 0.5 per half liter. </p><p>  Those who want to travel Rhodes by car should rent a car.  Tourists say that the best option is to arrange a car at Georg Auto.  The service is located in a nearby hotel on the coast.  For example, Nissan Micro for 3 days will cost about 100 euros. </p><p>  The path to the beach takes only 7 minutes.  The water in the sea is clean.  But it‚Äôs not very convenient to enter because of the stones.  At the bottom, the bottom is sandy.  For families with children, it is better to find another beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olive garden hotel lardos greece" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1526419.jpg" width="480"></div>
