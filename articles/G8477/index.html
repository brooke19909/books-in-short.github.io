In a metropolis, it‚Äôs not enough to want to get out into the countryside, you also need to know the permitted places for barbecue.  There are a lot of them in Moscow, today we will talk about some of them.

    <h2>  If there is no time to leave the city </h2><p>  You can choose the simplest option - go to the barbecue or restaurant.  However, the price tags here are not at all encouraging.  And with the onset of summer, I want to sit not in a stuffy room, but under the trees, on green grass.  Today, finding places for barbecue in Moscow is not difficult.  Thousands of places are equipped in the capital and its environs, where you can come with a barbecue and sit comfortably under the canopy of trees or in gazebos.  Moreover, in most cases they will not even take money from you for using them.  Except in cases where you need to rent a barbecue or charcoal. </p><h2>  Responsibilities of holidaymakers </h2><p>  Before talking about places for barbecue in Moscow, I would like to recall the basic rules.  First, you must comply with established rules of conduct, and secondly, fire safety rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Drinking alcohol is strictly prohibited. </li><li>  It is forbidden to make a fire outside specially equipped areas. </li><li>  Illegal <span>felling of trees</span> and their use as firewood is punishable by a fine. </li><li>  The brazier can be installed at a height of at least 30 cm from the ground so as not to damage the roots of plants. </li><li>  Open fire is prohibited; charcoal can only be used. </li><li>  All garbage after it is necessary to clean. </li></ul><p>  All places for barbecue in Moscow are regularly supervised by special services.  Violation of these rules leads to administrative liability and fines in the amount of 5,000 to 300,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  City center </h2><p>  The closer to the center, the more difficult it is to find a suitable place to sit quietly around a fire.  Therefore, it is advisable to find a little time and get out closer to the park areas and outskirts of the capital.  However, in the Central Administrative District there are special barbecue facilities.  For example, a wonderful option is the Vorobyovy Gory reserve.  It is located on the picturesque, right bank of the river.  Unfortunately, finding a free spot here on a good, clear day is almost impossible. </p><h2>  Your best choice </h2><p>  Considering the most popular places for barbecue in Moscow in 2017, it is impossible not to note the special zones that are located at St. Andrew's Ponds.  People are attracted by beautiful nature, well-groomed and good equipment.  In addition, they are located next to the metro and Auchan hypermarket, where you can easily buy everything you need, including pickled meat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  City gardens also invite you to spend time under the shade of trees in the cool alleys.  Gorky Park and Neskuchny Sad are ready to provide a convenient place for a picnic, but only on the condition that you bring fried meat with you or order it in neighboring restaurants.  The rest is an ideal place to relax.  With the onset of spring, hammocks and deck chairs appear on the lawns where you can sunbathe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="places for barbecue in Moscow" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1898727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Serebryany Bor </h2><p>  If you do not want to go for luck, then you need to look for places for barbecue in Moscow.  2017 was not marked by anything new, the basic preferences are still the same.  A win-win option is the beloved Silver Forest.  If the Western district of Moscow is convenient for you, opt for it.  Here you will find 20 free barbecue facilities with gazebos, where you can definitely accommodate the whole company, and everything you need.  And besides, 10 VIP gazebos, indoor and very cozy.  The place of deployment is the shore of the Moscow River and the Endless Lake. </p><p>  In the Western region, the Moskvoretsky Park invites you to a picnic.  Considering the places for grilling kebabs in Moscow, it should be noted that here, as a kind of bonus, you get the opportunity to breathe fresh air and watch squirrels and hares, if you're lucky, of course.  There are four sites in total: two in the Kirov floodplain and two in the Stroginskaya.  Muscovites say that even for several hours in Serebryany Bor, they restore health and give strength. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Kurkino </h2><p>  This is a natural park, which is located on the northwestern outskirts of Moscow.  The valley <span>of the Skhodnya river</span> forms this place of rest for citizens.  The park is stretched along its left bank.  Meadows here are replaced by mixed forests and copses, there are small swamps.  Four picnic areas are equipped on the territory.  Pleased with the presence of barbecue and benches, urns.  You can come on your own or with a company. </p><p>  Allowed places for barbecue in Moscow allow each of us to spend our day off in the best way, in the circle of our relatives and friends.  For residents of the northwestern part of the capital, a nearby Stroginskaya floodplain, the right bank of the Moscow River Gulf, would also be a good option.  There are only five points with barbecue facilities, but in addition there is the opportunity to walk with children in the playgrounds, sunbathe on the beach and go boating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="allowed places for barbecue in Moscow" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1898726.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Northern District </h2><p>  It is here that the most parks are located, in which there are equipped places for barbecue.  In Moscow, it is the greenest and most attractive area for recreation.  In particular, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo natural-historical park awaits you.  Its vast territory is conducive to outdoor recreation.  Special areas for frying are in the All Saints Grove and Shchukinsky Forest Park.  Do not forget that you will have to walk a considerable distance until you reach the place of deployment.  Therefore, comfortable shoes and functional backpacks are a prerequisite. </p><p>  Fili Park is located in the same area.  It resembles a fabulous, protected forest.  It is clean and quiet, it is one of the most beautiful and cozy places in Moscow.  People come here to relax and play sports.  Mangal sites are huge, luxurious, as if created in order to bring together a whole company.  If you compare the places where you can fry kebabs in Moscow, then, judging by the reviews, it is really best to get together.  Wooden tables, huge and comfortable benches, cast-iron barbecues, urns - in a word, there is everything for a cultural holiday. </p><p>  Finally, Khimki Forest Park is located in the same area.  Children will really like it, because there are a lot of squirrels running around it.  They are very trusting and contact.  Take with yourself more treats for them - it is quite possible that you will be able to feed yourself. </p><p>  There are about ten picnic sites.  They are ideal for gathering a large and friendly company.  There are barbecues, but, according to the regulars, they are very deep, the consumption of coal is enormous, but you will cook a lot of meat. </p><h2>  Northeast District </h2><p>  And we continue to consider places where you can fry kebab in Moscow.  Two parks can be noted in this area.  The first is called "Joy."  It is located in the floodplain <span>of the Likhoborka River.</span>  Here are several sites with wooden gazebos equipped with benches, tables and barbecues. </p><p>  The second park, which more closely resembles a dense forest, is Timiryazevsky.  The place is almost deserted, wild and very pretty.  It is very beautiful, there is an interesting flora and many secluded corners.  Picnic places are equipped with tables and benches, but you have to carry the brazier with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="equipped places for barbecue in Moscow" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1898725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural-historical park "Izmailovo" </h2><p>  And we continue our virtual journey through the capital.  Now the focus is on the Southeast District.  Allocated places for barbecue in Moscow are not difficult to find, but you need to expect that gatherings at the barbecue can be delayed.  Therefore, the closer you get to your home, the better.  Izmailovsky forest has changed in recent years.  He was cleaned and put in order.  It is famous for broad-leaved plantations, linden groves and oak forests, ponds and quiet alleys.  Now there are 15 picnic points equipped.  They are located in <span>Terletsky Forest Park,</span> along the Main Avenue.  Stationary barbecue facilities and large oak tables with benches are installed everywhere. </p><p>  Relatively close to the natural-historical park "Kosinsky".  Very beautiful, quiet, he also offers his guests to taste aromatic barbecue.  True, there are only three venues here, and on the weekend the competition will be quite high.  One of them is located closer to the village of Rudnevo, the second is near Lukhmanovskaya street, another one is on the shore of Lake Bely.  All of them are designed for large companies and equipped with everything necessary. </p><p>  Kuzminki Park includes three picnic towns.  You will not get lost, here, signs and <span>information boards</span> lead to each of them <span>.</span>  Each seat is equipped with long tables and sturdy benches, benches and awnings.  Huge barbecue facilities, garbage containers and barrels for used coals are installed nearby. </p><h2>  Southern district of the capital </h2><p>  We will consider it last.  Here are the best places for barbecue in Moscow, but the competition is high, so you have to come almost in the morning.  Want to spend an unforgettable evening?  Go to the arboretum "Biryulevsky".  Of course, you can‚Äôt make a fire here everywhere, it‚Äôs strictly forbidden at Tsaritsyno‚Äôs estate.  But if you go further, then in the depths of the park you will find wonderful picnic areas.  There are paid and free places, tables and benches, barbecue facilities - all under the roof in case of rain.  There are only eight free sites for the entire park, so come early on the weekend.  Otherwise, you have to wait a long time while others will fry the meat and free the barbecue.  You can come here with your children, they will have a great time on the playgrounds. </p>

    <p>  If you do not want to go to the arboretum, pay attention to the <span>Bitsevsky forest.</span>  There are three places where you can make kebabs.  But that is not all.  You can also conduct a cultural program in the park.  After everyone has eaten up, visit the Boyarsky house, a noble estate and ancient barrows.  And again I want to note that you need to take a place here earlier.  It‚Äôs better to fry the meat and settle on the nearest lawn, leaving the grill next to those who wish, than wait in the queue, inhaling the fragrant smoke. </p><h2>  We leave the city </h2><p>  If you have your own car, then there will be no problems finding a place for barbecue.  The farther beyond the MKAD, the more chances to have a picnic in peace and quiet with your friends.  Within the capital on a fine day, hundreds and thousands of people are looking for opportunities to take a cozy gazebo in the shade of trees and have a great time enjoying delicious meat.  Therefore, counting on the fact that you easily and simply find a free site is hardly worth it.  If there is no car, then get out to the park as early as possible, in the morning.  But outside the city, with a personal grill in the trunk, you can choose a place to your liking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="places where you can fry barbecue in Moscow" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1898723.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Urban <span>park areas</span> today are becoming more equipped and adapted for families.  There is a huge amount of entertainment that will suit all family members.  Gone are the days when shish kebabs were fried in nature through the use of two stones, between which the branches assembled here were fired.  Today we learn to protect nature and keep order.  Therefore, picnic areas are everywhere open so that people have the opportunity to relax culturally without disturbing others. </p>
