It is here that you can not only look at the crocodiles, but also feed and stroke them.  To get away from the bustling reality will help climb Mount Taku, where the silence and beauty of a Buddhist temple will show how small and primitive the material world is.  To fall in love with national Vietnamese cuisine and try to find the very, only favorite dish - all this will help to feel the resort of Phan Thiet.  Hotel Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * can be a starting point for collecting experiences. </p><h2>  Phan Thiet Resort </h2><p>  This young resort attracts 2 types of travelers: lovers of exoticism and thrills.  The former have at their disposal incredible local cuisine, beautiful nature, attractions and beaches.  For the second - high waves to "ride" a wave, and a strong wind for kitesurfing. </p>

    <p>  As vacationers note in their reviews, the resort and infrastructure are still not well developed at the level of infrastructure and entertainment, but for a family or sports holiday it is perfect.  The most frequent visitors to this region are Koreans, Chinese and Russians.  You can go here at any time of the year, but the locals themselves distinguish 2 seasons: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  From May to October, it rains in the evenings and nights, which somewhat softens the heat of the day.  This period is called the low season, and it is best suited for couples with children.  Prices for hotels and for all entertainment at this time are lower. </li><li>  High season belongs to surfers.  From November to April it is hot here, strong winds blow and waves rise such that it is difficult to enter the sea.  But extreme water sports at this time of the year are incredibly popular. </li></ul><p>  Hotel Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * is suitable for a relaxing family vacation, and for lovers of thrills. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  For many travelers, the location of the hotel within walking distance from the beach, restaurants, clubs, cafes, shops and attractions is one of the main factors when choosing a vacation destination.  Such is the Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * (Phan Thiet).  Phan Thiet is a resort that includes 9 city blocks and 10 villages.  Mui Ne, a former poor fishing village, is part of this resort and the most popular place for tourists, since it is here that the most beautiful strip of beaches is located. </p><p>  Today, the resort business is rapidly developing in this region, although fishermen, as before, go to sea every morning to return in the afternoon with a catch that many tourists will eat for lunch in one of the restaurants. </p><p>  Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * is located near the mountains, the stairs going from it descend directly into the sea, to the center of the town - only 13 minutes, and to the famous red dunes - 10. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The best restaurants, bars and cafes of the resort are located on the right and left side of it, so every day you can choose a new route to search for the next thrilling impressions of local cuisine. </p><p>  Everyone who rested here noted that the location of the hotel makes it popular with travelers, so there are rarely vacant rooms. </p><p>  The only thing that is far from the Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * is the airport, which is 240 km away.  From him to the city of Phan Thiet there is an intercity bus from the bus station 3 times a day.  The road will take up to 6 hours.  You can use the services of the Vietnamese railway.  From the railway station, trains run in the right direction 5 times a day, and after 4-5 hours you can be there. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * (guest reviews say this) provides a transfer from the bus station and airport, but you need to be prepared that a fee is charged.  To use this service, it is enough to inform the hotel about the time of arrival 3 days before arrival.  This can be done online at the time of booking confirmation. </p>

    <p>  Another option is to order a taxi, the trip on which will take 5 hours and will cost about 6,000 rubles.  This service can also be arranged in advance.  Hotel Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 * ensures that the car will be on time and the driver will help with luggage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The majestic white five-story building with columns, built in a Mediterranean style, welcomes its guests with the sound of the surf and the smiles of the hospitable staff.  This is the hotel Ocean Front Hotel Muine 3 *.  Reviews from his customers cannot fully convey the atmosphere prevailing in him.  Beautiful white columns covered with "gold", a painted ceiling with a large chandelier, a marble floor and a staircase - all this resembles the decoration of the palace of the ancient Roman patrician. </p>

    <p>  The hotel building literally hangs over the sea, so the sound of the surf is heard even in rooms with windows overlooking the city. </p><p>  In the large lobby, in addition to the reception with polite staff, guests will find comfortable armchairs and a sofa in which you can relax, waiting for your check-in. </p><p>  Important information: check-in starts at 2 p.m., and check-out starts at 12. Some of the staff speak Russian, but most of them speak broken English.  To get everything you need, for example, change the number or ask for an extra cup, you can explain them with gestures. </p><p>  The courtyard of the hotel is well-kept, and a small staircase descending to the coast is the only thing that separates the land from the sea.  At high tide or on a windy day, water covers its steps.  At other times, guests will find a narrow strip of the beach with sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  At the disposal of hotel guests are 35 rooms of various categories.  The standard room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m <sup>2</sup> and includes: </p><ul><li>  shower and toilet; </li><li>  TV with cable channels; </li><li>  mini-bar (paid); </li><li>  everything you need for making coffee and tea; </li><li>  Wi-Fi </li><li>  safe (extra charge). </li></ul><p>  There are 19 standard rooms, twelve of which have 2 single beds, and 7 have 1 double bed.  These rooms have no balcony. </p>

    <p>  Deluxe Ocean rooms (there are 11 of them) have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 m2, sea and pool views.  In each of them: </p><ul><li>  balcony; </li><li>  carpet on the floor; </li><li>  double bed; </li><li>  safe and minibar (paid); </li><li>  tea and coffee facilities; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  TV; </li><li>  Phone, Wi-Fi </li><li>  toilet / shower; </li><li>  bath accessories, bathrobe, slippers, hair dryer. </li></ul><p>  It is important to know: the Internet, as noted by customers of the Tien Duong (Ocean Front) 3 * hotel, works great in all rooms and in the lobby, but weakly catches by the pool. </p><p>  Family Ocean rooms (there are 4 of them) have the same comfortable conditions as Deluxe Ocean, but they have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 m <sup>2</sup> .  The only VIP-room in addition to the above amenities has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã80 m <sup>2</sup> and a bath.  In general, all rooms have comfortable furniture and have everything you need to have a good time in Vietnam. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  This hotel is perfect for a relaxing family vacation.  It is located in a quiet area, surrounded by a small park, outside of which the quiet life of a Vietnamese small town flows. </p><p>  At the disposal of tourists: </p><ul><li>  Large swimming pool with stunning sea views.  It is cleaned daily, as well as the surrounding area.  On a windy day, hotel guests prefer to relax on the sun loungers near it. </li><li>  Cafeteria and restaurant serving national and international cuisine.  The cafeteria has an open terrace with sea views. </li><li>  Dry cleaning and laundry services. </li><li>  A conference room is equipped for business people. </li><li>  Gym and massage room. </li></ul><p>  This hotel does not have much entertainment, so lovers of nightclubs and discos will have to look for adventures outside its walls, but travelers who come to enjoy the beauty of Vietnam and its hospitality will really like it. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the customer reviews of Ocean Front Hotel 3.5 *, the <span>hotel (Vietnam,</span> Phan Thiet) offers buffet breakfasts.  They consist of toast, scrambled eggs, meat with sweet and sour sauce, vegetable salads and fruits. </p><p>  The food here is hearty, but somewhat monotonous, so many guests, having breakfast and lunch in the hotel restaurant, prefer to look in the evenings for new impressions of local cuisine in the neighboring restaurants. </p>

    <p>  Of the fruits, the most popular are bananas, dragon, mango, papaya, melon and watermelon.  The main dishes are prepared from meat or seafood, which are very diverse in this area.  Natural juices, excellent <span>Vietnamese coffee</span> and tea - all this awaits guests in the cafeteria and restaurant of the hotel. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  This hotel belongs to the category of beach holidays, so the main entertainments take place on the water.  For those who wish to try their hand at sports such as surfing, windsurfing and kiting, there are schools within walking distance of the hotel where you can also rent the necessary equipment. </p><p>  Fishermen expect local fishing experiences, but divers have nothing to do here - they will not make any discoveries and will not receive impressions from diving. </p><p>  Those who are used to caring for themselves even while traveling, are waiting for the Bin Chau hot springs, near which a spa has been built.  It is equipped not only with mineral water pools, but also with relaxation rooms, mud baths, sports fields and bars. </p>

Prices for outerwear, bags and wallets made of crocodile leather and souvenirs are rather low, but you still have to bargain with sellers. </p><p>  Local wines and dried fruits, down jackets and shirts with a national ornament are in great demand. </p>
