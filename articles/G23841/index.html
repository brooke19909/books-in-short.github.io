To simplify access to the global network, many operators offer to purchase modems that can be connected to both a stationary PC and laptop, as well as a tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tarifam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure a usb modem beeline" class="if uuid-2934276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2934276.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, just visit the company salon and choose the appropriate model of the device.  And in the article we will share secrets of how to configure the Beeline modem, and the nuances of its use. </p><h2>  What devices does the company offer to access the Internet </h2><p>  In October 2018, USB-modems from ZTE and Huawei manufacturers were presented in the stores of the Beeline mobile operator: </p><ol><li>  Huawei E3370 - speed up to 100 Mbps, the presence of connectors for connecting external antennas. <div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.buyreklama.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up an online beeline modem" class="if uuid-2934280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2934280.jpg"></div></li><li>  Huawei E3372 - speed up to 150 Mbps, it is also possible to connect antennas to increase the signal level. </li><li>  ZTE MF833T - maximum supported speed of 150 Mbps. </li><li>  <span>ZTE MF823D,</span> MF823 - 100 Mbps, you can connect external antennas. </li><li>  ZTE MF821D - similar to previous models. </li><li>  <span>ZTE MF831</span> supports higher 150 Mb / s.  It has connectors for connecting antennas. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="anna.belodedenko.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure a usb modem beeline" class="if uuid-2934319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2934319.jpg"></div><p>  All of them allow you to access the Internet at high speeds and support work not only in 3G mode, but also in LTE. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  OS requirements </h2><p>  Before you start using, you need to familiarize yourself with the system requirements, and which operating systems are compatible with the device.  All offered models are quite new and have been released in the last few years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tazabek.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure a beeline modem on a laptop" class="if uuid-2934300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2934300.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, if Windows 7, 8 or 10 is installed on a personal computer or laptop, you can be sure of stable collaboration.  Owners of technology from Apple, too, can confidently use these modems. </p><p>  The requirements for the technology itself are minimal - there is space on the hard disk for installing drivers, a free USB-connector and the absence of software conflicts. </p><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  As with other electronic devices, avoid contact with water and do not touch the modem with wet hands.  At the end of the work, it is necessary to close all applications that the device uses, and remove it out of the reach of children or animals.  There is also a restriction on the operation of the modem near medical equipment and on the plane.  It is highly desirable to refuse this, since the device signals can interfere with air transport or equipment in clinics. </p><h2>  Step by step installation </h2><p>  The new owners of the usb modem have no reason to be bothered by the search for drivers, special applications, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The whole process takes several minutes, because everything you need is already flashed in the device software.  For the first Internet connection, you must perform the following sequence of actions.  Let‚Äôs take a look at an example of how to configure a Beeline modem on a laptop: </p><ol><li>  Turn on the laptop. </li><li>  Insert the SIM card of the selected operator into the corresponding slot inside the mobile device. </li><li>  Place the modem in the USB port of the laptop. </li><li>  First of all, drivers are installed, the message ‚ÄúA new device was found‚Äù will notify you of the successful completion of the procedure, which will appear in the menu around the clock on the monitor.  The correctness of the work can be checked.  First, go to the "Control Panel", then in the "Devices and Printers" section.  Select a modem, right-click on it, find the ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù menu. </li><li>  Next, the necessary utilities are installed. </li><li>  Read the instructions and find out how to set up the Internet on a Beeline modem.  Depending on the model and manufacturer, two options are usually used: through a web interface or a special application that installs automatically. </li><li>  Go to the modem‚Äôs operating mode management utility and make the initial settings: network type (2G, 3G, 4G).  Some models have a built-in router, which can be enabled in the same menu. </li></ol><p>  You can check the correctness of the settings and the presence of a connection by opening any page in the browser. </p><h2>  If the internet is slow </h2><p>  The connection speed directly depends on the signal level and the workload of the nearest base station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cells.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Base stations" class="if uuid-2934333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2934333.jpg"></div><p>  If another user cannot affect the number of connected subscribers, then he can completely improve the signal quality. </p><p>  To do this, just remember a few rules: </p><ol><li>  There should not be any obstacles in the form of walls or partitions near the modem. </li><li>  The best signal level at the window. </li><li>  To move the modem, try using a USB extension cable.  By changing the position of the device, you can achieve better reception quality. </li><li>  A complete set of external antennas will allow you to get the maximum signal level and significantly increase speed in difficult conditions: at a considerable distance from the base station, in the presence of interference or a large number of reflected signals. </li></ol><h2>  Features of the Beeline modems </h2><p>  All modem manufacturers indicate the maximum supported speed.  In practice, the speed can be significantly lower.  If several thousand subscribers are connected to the base station, then the speed will vary depending on the remoteness of the tower and the number of active connections at a certain moment.  However, if the BS is installed in rural areas and the terrain is quite even and homogeneous (no hills, dense forests) - the speed can be significantly higher, since in villages there are often much fewer Internet users. </p><p>  If you are concerned about the high temperature at the included modem - check the signal level.  Models of any manufacturers can heat up, but usually this is a consequence of a weak and unstable signal.  Try moving your laptop or PC closer to the window. </p><p>  Many telecom operators install firmware or locks, because of which the device can only work with a SIM card of one operator.  How to configure a Beeline usb modem, if a SIM card of another operator is installed - the answer is no way.  The output may be a change of firmware or unlocking the modem by entering a special code.  There are popular resources and forums on the Internet where users share their experiences and tips on removing this restriction. </p><h2>  Consumer Reviews </h2><p>  According to the end of the first half of 2018, Beeline was in third place with 130,000 base stations operating in Russia.  Of these, 34067 operate in the LTE standard.  For six months of active construction, the operator showed the highest growth rates of towers and a significant improvement in the quality of the coating.  It is worth noting that subscribers appreciated both the increase in data exchange speed and the stability of the connection. </p><p>  What do Internet users like from the all-Russian Beeline company: </p><ul><li>  good coverage and virtually no "white spots" when traveling around the country; </li><li>  favorable rates and lack of national roaming; </li><li>  stable internet connection at high speed. </li></ul><h2>  Life hack: how to set up a Beeline modem on a router </h2><p>  If you have several devices that connect to the Internet, there is no need to buy several SIM cards of the operator and pay for each number.  In a country house, village, city apartment or office, you can install a router that supports a modem connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ucexpert.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure a router modem beeline" class="if uuid-2936659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2936659.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you will have constant access to the network, and you can connect your tablet, laptop or smartphone via Wi-Fi connection. </p><p>  Pay attention to the models from Zyxel, TP-Link, D-link, Asus - for almost all manufactured items, manufacturers have provided for the use of a Beeline usb modem.  And how to configure the connection can be found in the instructions for the router. </p>
