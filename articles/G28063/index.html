It's about Gary Tatintsian. </p><h2>  A bit about the founder of the gallery </h2><p>  As an Armenian by birth, he moved to Moscow to continue his father‚Äôs work and become a dentist.  But he did not like this specialty, and when in 1988 Gary and his family emigrated to Germany, his worldview changed dramatically.  Once abroad, the young man began to carefully study the art world of Western countries and engage in collecting.  Soon he managed to open his gallery in Berlin, which, however, disappointed him very quickly, and it had to be closed.  But Gary, despite the first failure, continued to study the art market. </p>

    <h2>  Art Gallery in New York </h2><p>  Not finding work to his liking in Berlin, Tatintsian moved to America.  In 1998, he decided to establish his own exhibition center for contemporary art in New York.  Having decided to shoot, as the press wrote, in the New York public, he gathered in one place the work of three artists who create in an innovative style who at least have never exhibited together, but, being familiar, had a great influence on each other.  These were the Americans Frank Stella, George Shugarman and Judy Pfaff.  It must be said that the New York gallery of Gary Tatintsian was an incredible success.  America "surprised", "smiled" and recognized the collector. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gary Tatintsian Gallery in Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1582104.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was located on Ilyinka street.  Then, the art dealer brought the creations of eight artists to his first exhibition: Tony Ousler, Vic Munis, Peter Helly, Christine Calabriz, Anthony Gormley, Torbin Guiller, Stefan Balkenhol and Tony Matelli.  Each of them was represented by two works.  The metropolitan audience was able to appreciate the work behind which many European museums are in line. </p><p>  The first gallery of Gary Tatintsian in Moscow was focused on conceptual Western art, Russian avant-gardeism of the early twentieth century, photography and design.  The art dealer is confident that in the Russian capital there are many well-off intellectuals who are able to appreciate such art. </p><p>  Since its opening, the first gallery of Gary Tatintsian has already managed to present such contemporary artists as Joel-Peter Whitkin, Daniel Richter and Damien Hirst, Peter Helly, Tala R, Christopher Wool, Yasumasi Morimura, Peter Doiga, Jonathan Meese, Cecily Brown, Georg Baselitz , Chris Ofili, Tony Matelli, George Condo and others.  Here were exhibitions and such famous photographers of the twentieth century, such as Wiji, Rodchenko, Mohoy-Nadia and Lersky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ron Arad Gallery Gary Tatintsian" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1582106.jpg" width="600"></div>

The opening was combined with a solo exhibition of the famous German artist Rayle.  Exhibitions by contemporary authors are regularly held here, including a group show by Tony Matelli, John Miller and Olaf Brening. </p><p>  Today, the Moscow Gallery of Gary Tatintsian (address: 19 Serebryanicheskaya Embankment) is located in the modern Arthouse building.  It is decorated in a simple design, which is dominated by light colors.  This solution allows you to easily and quickly convert existing space to any exhibition requirement. </p><p>  The main exhibition areas of the Gary Tatintsian Gallery are avant-garde, constructivism, conceptual design and, of course, photography.  Especially often here the viewer sees art installations that enter into dialogue with reality. </p><h2>  The famous Ron Arad </h2><p>  In the spring of 2016, the gallery of Gary Tatintsian exhibited the American artist Soule.  His collection was called You Better Call Saul.  In November of the same year, a personal exhibition of the famous London architect and designer Ron Arad was presented here.  Being famous for his conceptual art works of steel, this artist for three decades has embodied its brightness and uniqueness of style in a variety of art objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gary Tatintsian Gallery address" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1582107.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <p>  The exhibition in Moscow became a retrospective of the work of this designer, combining the <span>FIAT 500</span> series of extruded machines <span>,</span> as well as its iconic steel objects, including the author's design called Free Standing China, as well as the unique interactive The Last Train, which was specially developed for the Arad studio . </p><h2>  Gallery Reviews </h2><p>  Many Muscovites have already visited Arthouse.  Judging by the reviews, connoisseurs of contemporary art appreciated many of the exhibits.  Muscovites say a lot of positive words about the publicly excited exhibition of photographs of Joel-Peter Whitkin, about the works of artist Peter Helly, designer Ron Arad and many others. </p><p>  In the gallery of Gary Tatintsian there is an opportunity to consult with experts on issues related to the organization of museum exhibitions or the formation of a collection, to conduct an examination of a particular work of art. </p><p>  This is a great place, especially for those who are already bored with traditional art in its classical manifestation.  The unusualness of the exhibits, the originality of the paintings, the amazing installation of the novelty - all this attracts visitors here. </p>
