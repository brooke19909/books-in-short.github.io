As a rule, students find it difficult to answer, since this transitional stage is quite difficult to understand: all spheres of society have undergone such deep and strong changes that it is extremely difficult to fit this topic into the pages of a school textbook. </p><p>  Therefore, it is necessary to draw the attention of students to the most important aspects of the economic condition of the country at the beginning of the 17th century.  Pupils should take into account the fact that, long before the start of known events, the country was in a difficult situation due to the decline of the agricultural sector of the economy, as well as the redistribution of the land fund during the reign of Ivan the Terrible.  Some compensation was the development of Siberia, which partially corrected the property status of certain categories of the population.  The latter circumstance should be mentioned when studying this topic in schools. </p><h2>  Consequences of the crisis </h2><p>  First of all, during the peasant uprisings and riots, villages and villages that essentially fed the country were affected.  This led to hunger, which, in turn, provoked an explosion of social discontent.  The lack of central authority also adversely affected the state of society.  Therefore, as a rule, at the end of the paragraph on the topic under discussion, you can read the task: "What are the sources of replenishment of the treasury after the Time of Troubles." </p><p>  To answer, the student must analyze the state of the country at the beginning of this century.  Peasant riots and wars, foreign interventions brought the country's economy into decline, from which it then could not recover for a long time.  It took several decades for the Russian economy to become competitive again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The agrarian sector was especially badly damaged, which even in the years of the oprichnina was depleted by land redistribution and the allocation of allotments between landowners.  Trade relations between cities have weakened, the market has almost ceased to exist.  Therefore, the government of the new tsar was faced with a difficult task - to raise the country's economy to the level at which it was before the terrible upheavals. </p><h2>  Tax policy </h2><p>  Raising money from the population has always been an important problem for the tsarist government and before the events under consideration.  The government made every effort to attach additional categories of the population to their places of residence so that financial receipts to the treasury were uninterrupted and regular.  Therefore, after the establishment of new power, the tsar and his boyars had to return to this old measure, despite the fact that the bulk of the population was already exhausted by the war. </p><p>  The answer to the question: “What are the sources of replenishment of the treasury after the Time of Troubles,” - you should start by mentioning the measures taken by the leadership to restore finances.  Of course, for this I had to raise some taxes, increase corvee and dues, and also add new categories of the population to the lists of taxpayers (for example, the so-called “White people” - people who lived on lands exempted from taxation).  In addition, the government introduced new customs duties, and also engaged in the sale of wine and tobacco, which it had never done before.  These measures somewhat stabilized the economic situation in the state. </p><h2>  Resume trading </h2><p>  The task “What are the sources of replenishment of the treasury after the Troubles” implies a comprehensive description of the economic condition of the country after the accession of a new dynasty.  An important phenomenon of the time considered was the restoration and growth of cities, which became the center of craft and trade. </p>

That is how the conclusion of the answer to the question “What are the sources of replenishment of the treasury after the Time of Troubles” should sound.  Briefly describe the situation in the country using maps and tables. </p>
