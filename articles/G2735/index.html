Of course, they expect a beautiful card from him.  It can be made of cardboard and paper, draw a picture with paints or create an original craft from napkins.  Many people know how to make a postcard with their own hands, but you want it to be the most beautiful and spectacular.  To do this, you need to get acquainted with different techniques for making paper crafts.  Often, masters use folding origami paper according to patterns, twisting quilling strips with crochet patterns, and unconventional tearing paper. </p><p>  In the article we will consider several samples of postcards.  How to make such crafts with your own hands can be found in the detailed instructions.  All finished products can be seen in the available photographs.  The works presented in the article have a different level of complexity.  Such cards can be presented as a gift to mom, grandmother, teacher at school for the holiday on March 8.  Also, do not ignore your beloved dads.  On February 23, you can make a beautiful tank on cardboard. </p><h2>  Origami Tulips </h2><p>  To make such a voluminous postcard, you need to learn how to fold a flower from a square sheet of paper.  For work, prepare several multi-colored sheets of double-sided colored paper, cut them into squares of different sizes.  Then the bouquet will consist of a variety of flowers.  Each square must be folded diagonally, carefully smooth the finger with a finger, then the future flower is bent again in half.  It turns out small rectangular triangles.  It will turn out to be a do-it-yourself postcard on March 8, if you unbend the last fold back and turn the blank over with the back side.  Then it remains to bend the corners of the base up, but not completely.  These will be the tulip petals.  You can bend the edges a couple of millimeters to give the flower a larger volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="poradum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami tulip" class="if uuid-2391647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2391647.jpg"></div><p>  First, the stems and leaves of tulips are glued to the lower edge.  Leaves for bulk before gluing are folded in half.  The flowers are held on the glue by folds, the rest of the surface of the cardboard sheet does not touch. </p><h2>  Greeting card for February 23 </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can make a gift to your beloved men using the quilling technique.  In the stationery store, you need to purchase green thin strips.  Instead of a professional hook for a one-time job, you can use the body of the felt-tip pen.  A sample <span>crafts for dad</span> can be seen on the main photo in the article.  The tank consists of several parts.  The lower part is tracks with wheels, the upper parts are the tank tower and the long barrel of the gun. </p><p>  How to make a card with your own hands, so that it is bright.  You need to place it on a contrasting background.  It would be interesting to draw up the basis of two different sheets, as in the photo.  The manufacture of military equipment begins with winding four wheels.  A quilling strip is wound onto the marker body or pencil to the desired size, and the edge is glued onto the PVA to the last turn. </p><p>  For a tank, it will be enough to create two small skeins and two larger central ones.  Then they are glued onto cardboard and wrapped in one or two turns around.  The next step is the tower according to the well-known algorithm.  If desired, you can make a hatch.  In a different way, the manufacture of the gun is ahead. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is more convenient to place it on a dense basis, for example, wrap a strip of cocktail stick or a straight branch of a tree. </p><h2>  Spring sprigs of mimosa </h2><p>  Bright balls of women‚Äôs favorite flower of fragrant mimosa can be made of a yellow napkin.  The leaves of the bush perform often located incisions on the workpiece.  How to make a DIY card from thin layers of napkins?  This is not difficult.  It is necessary to tear small pieces from the whole product and crumple them with your fingers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="detkam.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mimosa from napkins" class="if uuid-2391631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2391631.jpg"></div><p>  Then a small ball is rolled from the workpiece, dipped on one side into a small plate with glue and laid out over a twig.  It will be much easier for a small child to work with an adhesive pencil.  He does not get his hands dirty and holds together the details of the craft well.  The more balls glued, the more beautiful the postcard looks. </p><h2>  Tulip for beloved teacher </h2><p>  For International Women's Day, you can make an unusual postcard for the teacher, but to make it you will need a carved round paper napkin.  The spring flower itself is assembled from several patterns folded in half.  The more elements in the design, the more magnificent the tulip will be. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper tulip" class="if uuid-2391570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2391570.jpg"></div><p>  The stalk and leaves are cut from light green double-sided paper.  Thanks to several layers, the craft looks voluminous.  When assembling together, the first thing to do is stick a napkin folded into a triangular roll for a flower.  Then the remaining elements are pasted, and the bouquet is finally wrapped. </p><h2>  How to make a beautiful card with your own hands? </h2><p>  Older preschoolers will quite cope with the work on the craft on March 8, although it consists of different materials.  During the walk, the teacher should cut the same branched parts of the bush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rivne1.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="greeting card" class="if uuid-2391617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2391617.jpg"></div><p>  Then prepare a template for flowers and leaflets.  In the preparatory group, children already have a good knowledge of the ability to trace along contours and cut out details for application with small scissors.  The eights are similarly executed.  The original solution is a paper hand holding a bouquet.  To cut it, you need to circle your palm with a pencil. </p><h2>  Quilling flowers </h2><p>  This is a rather time-consuming craft, you can offer its production only to schoolchildren.  How to make a DIY postcard from paper, read below.  Quilling is a difficult and very exciting experience.  Thin stripes are twisted.  Cutting them is not required, as they are available in any color scheme.  The flowers presented on our sample are wound tight, but there is a hole in the center of each.  Therefore, you can use the ballpoint pen to work.  If one strip is not enough, the next is attached to the edge of the first and winding continues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card with flowers" class="if uuid-2391598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2391598.jpg"></div><p>  Presented options for greeting cards can be performed by children of different ages.  Moms will be pleased to receive a voluminous bouquet made by themselves.  Using these examples, you can dream up and create your own original craft.  Creative success! </p>
