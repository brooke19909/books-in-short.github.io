Capital of papua new guinea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most people are familiar with large states - France, America, Germany.  However, there are several countries on the planet such as Guinea.  All of them are important economic components of the whole world.  The article considers the capitals of each Guinea, describes their potential and population.  Attractions will also be given. </p><p>  At school, few hours are devoted to studying these countries and their capitals.  This question is quite interesting, because even though they are united by one name, culture and history are completely different. </p><h2>  Portuguese Guinea </h2><p>  This African colony lasted exactly 500 years, from 1474 to 1974.  The capital of Portuguese Guinea is Bissau.  He and Kasheu have long been the center where the slave trade flourished.  The Portuguese possessions received this name in 1879. </p><p>  Initially, only the coast belonged to the indigenous people.  At the very beginning of the 20th century, the Portuguese actively began to oppose the tribes that lived in the center of the continent.  This resistance lasted long enough - in 1936 Bijagos passed into the possession of the Portuguese. </p><p>  In 1956, the struggle for independence began, the leader of which was the PAIGK party.  For a long time, it was conducted through political discussions, and five years later it turned to armed clashes.  In 1973, the independent Republic of Guinea-Bissau was proclaimed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of guinea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1471910.jpg" width="600"></div>
