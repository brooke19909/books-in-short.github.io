How to call a telemaster at home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, people have become more and more used to various kinds of amenities.  For example, just press one button on the remote control, after which you can enjoy watching various movies or TV shows.  However, it also happens that the TV fails or defects in its operation are observed: the image disappears, the sound bursts, and so on.  Such problems are considered quite common, so it is easy to deal with them.  What to do if the TV breaks down, read on. </p><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Like any other electronic equipment, TVs can fail over time.  In this case, it does not matter at all, you have an ultramodern model with the ability to access the Internet or the old Soviet "Stork".  Malfunctions can be observed even in the most famous brands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.webliststore.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The master fixes the TV board." class="if uuid-2871094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871094.jpg"></div><p>  Famous manufacturers give a guarantee on their products, which on average lasts from two to three years.  In this regard, the repair of TVs is divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  after warranty; </li><li>  warranty. </li></ul><p>  With the warranty, everything is more or less clear - you just need to take the device to the store where you bought it, after which it will be sent to the service center for repair at the expense of the manufacturer.  But the after-sales service is worth dwelling in more detail.  Where to repair the TV if it has expired the warranty?  Which service center is best to ask for help?  Or maybe it will be cheaper to buy a new unit?  If there is no signal on the TV - what should I do?  Let's get it right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Common Malfunctions </h2><p>  If your TV is broken, then do not rush to run to the service center or call the master at home.  Try to deal with the problem yourself first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plantdex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The master repairs the TV." class="if uuid-2871095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871095.jpg"></div><p>  There is a list of typical breakdowns that are characteristic of absolutely all models of this device.  Here are just the most common ones: </p><ul><li>  The TV stopped turning on - problems with the scanner or inverter power supply. </li><li>  There is sound on the TV, but no picture - there is a problem with the matrix, lamp or inverter. </li><li>  Channels do not switch - a malfunction in the control unit, processor, or in the TV remote control itself. </li><li>  Blinking the screen - a breakdown of the cooling system or the backlight. </li><li>  The bars on the screen are problems with the transformer, video processor, matrix, video amplifier, or scanner. </li><li>  No sound - the sound card has broken or there is no contact with the cable for connecting to it. </li><li>  Noise on the screen - the antenna, cable is damaged, or there is simply no signal on the TV. </li><li>  What to do if one of the flowers is missing?  Understand problems with the color module, microcircuits, contacts, circuit board or video amplifier. </li><li>  The TV does not see the devices to connect - problems with the Wi-Fi module or with the port. </li></ul><p>  Today, most models are repaired in blocks, that is, the entire idle unit is replaced with a new one.  For example, if you have certain problems with one of the microprocessors on the sound card, the master will not re-solder the processor, but will replace the entire board. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Matrix Failure </h2><p>  If there is sound on your TV, but no picture, then it‚Äôs all about the matrix, which is not able to display information normally.  Typically, this occurs after mechanical damage caused by improper transportation of the TV.  You must open the device cover and inspect the surface of the matrix for damage.  Even a small crack can lead to image loss.  In this case, resolving a similar issue through repair in a service center may be unprofitable, so you should consider replacing the entire TV. </p><h2>  Damage or displacement of the matrix cable </h2><p>  If your TV does not show the image, but no damage to the matrix has been detected, the device may not receive the necessary signals from the processor to work.  A special loop is responsible for the data transfer and connection of the matrix with the forming unit or control board.  It is quite delicate and thin, so even a little shaking during transportation or a careless blow can cause it to disconnect.  In this case, you have to completely disassemble the TV, and then check the integrity and connection of the cable.  In case of displacement, it will be enough just to reconnect it to the board.  If the cable was damaged, it will have to be replaced with a new one.  You can buy it at any specialized store for a small price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.webliststore.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board on the TV." class="if uuid-2871102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871102.jpg"></div><h2>  Inverter failure </h2><p>  Sometimes the TV does not show the image due to the fact that the backlight cannot function normally.  The task of highlighting is to convert information from a matrix into a picture.  A large number of LED lamps, as well as a power inverter for themselves, are responsible for this process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The failure of even one element leads to the fact that the backlight does not start or simply turns off after a few seconds of action.  Accordingly, the matrix sends a signal, but we do not see the image.  In this case, a professional can replace or even repair the backlight of the TV.  Such work is considered quite complicated, so only real specialists can cope with it. </p><h2>  What TVs are worth repairing? </h2><p>  Black and white televisions have long gone out of fashion, so most masters will not undertake to repair them.  No new parts can be found on them, and the terms of operation are out.  In the event of a breakdown, it is best to purchase a new device or try to repair it yourself.  Modern TVs that already have a warranty period, it makes sense to try to repair, however, this procedure can be very expensive due to the high cost of parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mapquest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The master unscrews the lid of the TV." class="if uuid-2871097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871097.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not have sufficient knowledge and skills in repairing TVs, then the best solution would be to seek help from a specialist.  This can be done in two well-known ways - call the telemaster at home or take the device to a service center. </p><h2>  Repair in the workshop </h2><p>  Perhaps in every city there is a service center or workshop that is engaged in the repair of household appliances and various electronics.  A similar procedure can be very expensive, but effective.  If you do not have sufficient knowledge about the device and the principles of operation of electronics, then you should definitely contact the service center.  What workshop to choose if your TV is broken?  Where to repair the TV in the shortest possible time?  Read about this and more in the following sections. </p><h2>  Workshop selection </h2><p>  If your TV is broken, then the first thing to do is find a list of all the television workshops of the city.  This can be done through advertisements in newspapers or on the Internet.  Those companies that have long been engaged in the provision of repair services have a full description of their range of actions.  However, you should pay attention not only to how long the company has been on the market, but also what types of services it provides.  Also, it will not be superfluous to read reviews.  You should not expect only laudatory words addressed to this or that organization.  Some of them, in an attempt to advertise their services, write monstrous flattering comments about themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloggalot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Girl with a soldering iron." class="if uuid-2871098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871098.jpg"></div><p>  Some of the service centers for the repair of household appliances or electronics specialize only in certain brands of TVs (LG, Samsung, etc.).  It would be best to contact just such a company, since the repair of a certain brand will be much better, because the masters have a narrow specialization, repairing a certain brand of TV.  In the warehouse of such workshops there are almost always a large number of spare parts, which significantly reduces the repair time, because you do not have to wait for the receipt of the necessary part. </p><h2>  Price and Warranties </h2><p>  Firms that repair TVs almost always provide a written warranty for the use of the device.  However, before contacting such a service center, it is recommended to call and clarify all the details - about the period of repair, the warranty on the operation of household appliances after repair and the cost of services. </p><p>  It is worth noting that no self-respecting workshop will tell you the timing and cost of repairs in advance.  First, you will be asked to bring a TV for diagnosis, the cost of which is paid on the spot.  Only after that the device is inspected by the master and all the malfunctions are revealed, as well as the cost of future repairs.  Remember that the price of new parts can be quite high, so sometimes it will be cheaper to just replace the TV with a new one.  As a rule, contacting other workshops does not reduce the cost of repairs, so you run the risk of simply spending about 500 rubles more on diagnostics. </p><h2>  Call a telemaster at home </h2><p>  Some companies or private specialists provide the opportunity to call the master at home for diagnostics and repair work.  Such a service will be very useful if your unit is large and inconvenient for transportation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.delfi.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call a telemaster at home." class="if uuid-2871104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871104.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need to know? </h2><p>  Calling a telemaster at home can be very expensive, since you also have to pay extra for convenience.  Before you arrive, it is recommended to collect as much information as possible about your device in order to facilitate the work of a professional.  If the master cares about his reputation, then he will be interested in a quality repair, so he will ask the owner some questions.  It is recommended to know the following: </p><ul><li>  what kind of problems have occurred; </li><li>  number of years of operation; </li><li>  type of TV (plasma, LCD, picture tube); </li><li>  model and brand of device. </li></ul><p>  After collecting this information, the specialist will be able to proceed with the diagnosis and search for damage.  Feel free to refuse services if repairs prove prohibitively expensive.  The fact that you called the master to the house does not mean that you have already agreed to the provision of services. </p><h2>  Warranty Repair </h2><p>  Has the TV broken under warranty?  What should the owner do to make the repair absolutely free?  Firstly, if your device still has a warranty period, then in no case try to repair it yourself.  As a rule, there is a special seal on the covers.  If its integrity is violated, no one will carry out warranty repairs.  Who knows what you tricked into trying to repair the TV with your own hands? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tvservisi.istanbul" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The master solders the board." class="if uuid-2871101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/2871101.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth remembering that warranty repair is not carried out after mechanical damage.  That is, if you acquired a new plasma yesterday, and today it has fallen and stopped working, you will have to repair it at your own expense. </p><p>  Unscrupulous specialists can deceive the consumer by accusing him of breaking the TV.  The most common excuses: </p><ul><li>  slight scratches on the case; </li><li>  power surges (lack of transformer); </li><li>  improper operation. </li></ul><p>  Remember that you can seek help from the nearest Rospotrebnadzor body for an independent examination.  As a rule, even the slightest hint of possible problems with the law will cool the ardor of such "homemade" ones and they will take up repairs.  However, for this you need to present not only a warranty card, but also a box from the device, so in no case do not throw it away. </p><p>  Also, do not forget that you can rent the same TV under warranty several times.  Experts will install a new seal after repair, however, the warranty period in this case, unfortunately, is not extended. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  A few important tips in the end for people who have a broken TV: </p><ul><li>  Do not turn on the device immediately after repair, especially in cold weather.  Let it stand for several hours to warm up. </li><li>  If you do not have sound on the TV, then most likely the sound card has broken.  Such a part is relatively inexpensive, so the repair will be best done on its own. </li><li>  If you are interested in which cable for the TV is better, then it is recommended to give preference to the Russian brand RG-6.  A 1 mm thick central copper core guarantees long service life. </li><li>  If you do not have an image on the TV, then most likely the matter is in the matrix.  Its repair can cost a round sum, so it will be easier to buy a new TV. </li></ul><p>  That‚Äôs probably all.  Contact only trusted service centers and do not forget that any breakdown can be repaired by yourself if you should understand it properly. </p>
