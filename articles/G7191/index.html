In this ancient country, the traveler is waiting for the magnificent pyramids of Giza, the tombs of the Valley of the Kings, colorful desert mountains and an unforgettable Arabic flavor.  But not only antiquity can impress the traveler‚Äôs imagination Egypt.  Since <span>fresh water was</span> brought to the deserted shores of the Red Sea in the seventies of the last century, real oases of lush greenery and flowering gardens arose and flourished in the desert, as if by magic.  To feel the difference between natural and man-made landscapes, you just need to go outside the gates of the hotel in the resorts of Egypt.  Therefore, many hotels in Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh have the word "oasis" in their name.  In this article, we will just talk about this - it is called Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort 5 *.  This is an eco-hotel, which means that everything in it is built on a careful attitude to nature and concern for the environment.  And the five stars decorating the hotel sign guarantee you high quality service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sentido reef oasis senses resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which Egypt Resort to Choose </h2><p>  The most famous are Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh.  These former fishing villages have grown enormously, occupying hundreds of kilometers of space along the coast.  They have got satellite villages, such as El-Gouna or Makadi Bay in Hurghada and Nabq in Sharm el-Sheikh.  But in recent years, completely new resorts have appeared and began to actively develop: Safaga, Taba, Dahab.  All of them have their own specifics that you need to know in order to get what you want from a vacation in Egypt.  If you want to see the historical sights of this country, then you should choose the resorts of Big Hurghada or Safagu.  They are located near Luxor - the ancient Thebes.  By the way, Hurghada is much cheaper than Sharm el-Sheikh.  But at the last resort the public is more pretentious, and the quality of leisure and services is higher.  After all, Sharm el-Sheikh translated from Arabic means "royal."  And the rest is waiting for you here.  Last-minute tours to Sharm El Sheikh will save you some. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharm el sheikh sand beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739242.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When to go to Egypt </h2><p>  The climate of this African country is such that you can sunbathe and swim here all year round.  Water in the Red Sea never cools below + 20 degrees, because only in this temperature can corals live - another attraction of Egypt.  Due to climatic features, the country is going through several tourist seasons.  They fall mainly on holidays.  Christmas and New Year are replaced by a very low season.  Indeed, in the winter in the desert strong winds blow.  In late January and early February, last minute packages to Egypt can be bought for $ 350.  This price includes flights, transfer to the hotel and accommodation for a week in a three-star hotel according to the all-inclusive concept.  In the summer, this country is incredibly hot.  Rest at such a time is attracted only to extremes, because +45 in the shade is difficult to withstand, and you certainly will not go on excursions.  Therefore, the high <span>season in Egypt</span> can be called spring and autumn.  Our hotel is located in Sharm El Sheikh, on the Sinai Peninsula.  This is the northeast of the country.  The resort has its own climatic features.  What do the reviews say about them? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oasis Sharm El Sheikh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739247.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh: April </h2><p>  At the beginning of the month, great tourist activity has not yet been observed, and prices are encouraging: tours cost a little more than in February.  Khamsin scares many - the strong March wind bringing sand from the desert.  But from the second decade of April in the Sharm el-Sheikh protected from dust storms the beginning of the tourist season is observed.  Everything becomes more expensive - both vouchers and excursions.  This is influenced by various factors, but especially <span>Catholic Easter,</span> as well as the fact that at this time tourists come from <span>Western Europe,</span> since school holidays begin there.  At the end of the month, vacationers from the CIS also come to spend <span>May holidays</span> in Egypt <span>.</span>  Tours in Sharm El Sheikh in April this year cost $ 400 - in a three-star hotel, 450-500 - in the "four" and 600-750 - in the "five".  As for the weather, it is optimal for a European.  In the afternoon, the air warms up to +30, and water - up to +25 degrees.  Great time for snorkeling or diving.  The nights have not yet become stuffy - + 18 ¬∞ .  The beginning of the tourist season in Egypt is also marked by interesting events.  In April, the resort traditionally hosts the Yoga Festival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sentido reef oasis senses resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739251.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh: May </h2><p>  This most fertile month of the year is drawing near - for us, residents of middle latitudes.  And what do the reviews say about the May weather in Sharm El Sheikh?  It is very hot, but due to the dryness of the air, the heat is easily tolerated.  On average, in the afternoon, in the shade + 34 degrees, although there are also highs - up to + 42 ¬∞ C.  The nights are already very warm - there is no need to take a sweater: the temperature is unlikely to drop below + 24 degrees.  But the water in the Red Sea, especially in those places where the bottom is shallow, differs little from the bath: + 28 ¬∞ C.  You can not be afraid that your child will catch a cold, splashing for hours in the waves.  However, it is worth considering the insidiousness of the spring sun: be sure to take a protective cream with you.  At the beginning of the month in Sharm el-Sheikh it is very difficult to buy vouchers (especially last-minute tours).  The excitement decreases only at the end of May, when the temperature is rapidly approaching the peak.  Usually a tour this month for two for eight days will cost $ 750 ("treshka"), $ 1250 - in a hotel with four stars and a half and two thousand - in a hotel of the highest rank.  Reviews say May in Sharm El Sheikh is eventful.  In addition to the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad with a traditional carnival, there is also a festival with the participation of camels.  Everyone can bet on races on these animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Sharm El Sheikh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739261.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is the "trick" of Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  Due to the translation ‚Äúroyal‚Äù one gets the impression that only sybarites, who value above all bliss and glamor, rest in the resort.  There really are a lot of such an audience here, but not it makes up the lion's share of tourists.  After all, Sharm el-Sheikh has unsurpassed <span>coral reefs,</span> and therefore diving lovers rush here from all over the world.  In Hurghada, you can also admire the bright tropical fish, but you will not see such a rich underwater world as in Sharm anywhere else.  Probably this is facilitated by two parks - Ras Mohammed and Nabq.  Near the coast there is a small uninhabited island of Tiran.  Excursions go to him to observe the life of giant turtles in their natural habitat.  The proximity of Sharm el-Sheikh to Israel makes travel to this country possible.  You can plan a one- or two-day excursion to the Holy places and the Dead Sea.  The Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort 5 * hotel we are interested in on the map of Sharm El Sheikh is located in the very south of the resort, closer to the Ras Mohammad Nature Reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Sharm El Sheikh April" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739288.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Arab Eco City </h2><p>  Now it's time to deal with our hotel.  What do the reviews of vacationers say about him?  In fact, this is not even a hotel, but a whole hotel complex, comparable in size to a small town.  It belongs to the Sentido Hotels &amp; Resorts chain.  In architectural design, it is built as a fabulous Arab city.  It has different quarters.  The huge complex itself consists of two hotel-zones: Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort and Reef Oasis Beach Resort.  Both hotels have five stars.  The difference lies in the distance from the sea.  That hotel, in the name of which the word ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù appears, stands on the front page of the beach.  And "Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort" - on the second.  But from the buildings of this hotel to the sea is not difficult to reach: 5-10 minutes of leisurely walk along the paths among the palm trees.  No desire to walk?  Reviews say that a bus takes the vacationers to the beach.  The interval between flights is ten minutes.  Tourists note that the guests of "Sentido" can use all the services, pools, water park and infrastructure of the second hotel, but the guests of the "Reef" - no. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The buildings of the Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort 5 * (Sharm-el-Sheikh) are a newer extension of the Reef Oasis Beach Hotel.  Therefore, the number of rooms in this hotel is newer.  Everything is working properly.  The rooms for guests in the hotel are divided into categories: "superior" (overlooking the pool or garden), "deluxe" and "family".  All rooms are designed in hi-tech design and have an open, spacious terrace.  Deluxe has a separate living room with two sofas, separated from the bedroom by an arch.  All rooms have a minibar with drinks, air conditioning, multi-channel TV, a set for self-preparation of tea and coffee.  Reviews of tourists even mention such trifles as bathrobes with slippers, beach bags.  By the way, you will find a laundry bag in the closet.  For the duration of your stay, guests can do twelve laundry services for free.  They clean the rooms daily and, regardless of the tip, very carefully.  As for prices, the rooms in the Oasis (Sharm El Sheikh) cost from five to ten and a half thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most hotels in Egypt and Sharm El Sheikh operate on an all-inclusive basis.  Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort is no exception.  Guests are served breakfast, lunch and dinner, and in between these meals they offer light snacks (pizza, barbecue), alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and sweets.  The main restaurant, Mo, is open buffet style.  It serves international, Egyptian and Mediterranean cuisines.  In addition to it, there are a la carte restaurants: Italian ("La Terrace"), Indian, Asian, fish, barbecue ("Cactus").  In addition to drinks and snacks, you can also dine on the patio bar.  In the "Eastern Corner" guests are offered real coffee and hookah.  A significant advantage of the guests of the Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort 5 * reviews is that they can use the restaurants and bars of the Reef Oasis Beach Hotel.  Tourists recommend a visit to the grill bar (near the disco). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Sharm El Sheikh May" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/739290.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of these places are coral coasts, where reefs come very close to the coast.  This is what has become famous among divers around the world Sharm el-Sheikh.  Sandy beach (natural) is only in one bay - Sharm El Maya.  But do not worry about sharp corals and buy special slippers.  At Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort, the beach consists of albeit loose, but still clean sand.  And this is a huge rarity for Sharm.  Nearby hotels instead of the beach have a dull pontoon descent into the sea.  The coast here is protected from the wind, because the hotel complex is located in a secluded bay.  On the territory there are as many as thirteen pools and a water park. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Reviews say that the services in the Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort 5 * correspond to the declared five stars.  They welcome guests warmly: they sit on sofas, treat them to cool mango juice, and let them refresh themselves with wet towels.  A continuous international works at the reception: even those who do not know foreign dialects can easily solve their problems.  The same goes for animation: adult and child.  Reviews mention that the Wi-Fi at the hotel is free, but it only pulls in the lobby and on the solarium by the pool.  For those who wish to exercise, the hotel has a tennis court, gym, soccer field.  There is a diving center on the beach.  Sauna and spa are free for guests.  Every evening, a bus leaves from the hotel to Naama Bay, the entertainment district of Sharm El Sheikh.  There you can admire the singing fountains, sit in a cafe, listen to the performances of visiting "stars". </p><h2>  Family facilities </h2><p>  At Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort, great attention is paid to children.  For them there is a water park with safe slides, a playground and two shallow pools.  From eight to nine in the evening for teenagers a disco is organized.  A mini club also works.  Animators who speak Russian, entertain children, hold competitions with them. </p>
