    <h2>  Agriculture in Ancient Egypt: History </h2><p>  Agriculture at that time was the basis of the economy.  Agriculture in ancient Egypt was considered especially important for the development of the country.  This was due to the level of technological progress and the features of natural conditions.  Thus, farmers in ancient Egypt had great potential for productivity growth.  People had a need to develop annual river spills.  This could play a crucial role in the development of the economy.  What would the Nile Valley be if it were not for artificial irrigation and drainage?  It would be a marshy lowland in the middle of <span>quicksand.</span> </p><h2>  Development in the Neolithic </h2><p>  The oldest agricultural tribes did not have the opportunity to borrow the skills of growing crops in <span>Asia Minor.</span>  Also, they did not interact with the population of Mesopotamia, Palestine and Ethiopia.  This could play an important role in the development of the economy of the Old Kingdom.  In Ethiopia, the first traces of agriculture date back to the III millennium BC.  e.  Perhaps wild cereals could be in North Africa.  For this country in the Neolithic era, humid climatic conditions were characteristic.  Thus, scientists can conclude that the ancient farmers in Egypt developed their activities independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agriculture in ancient egypt history" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556373.jpg" width="411"></div>

We are talking about the highlands east and west of the Nile.  This factor may indicate that the ancient farmers in Egypt were forced to quickly settle along the banks of the river and fight with the thickets of the valley and swamps.  Stone tools were improved, and copper tools also appeared.  Thanks to this, the ancient farmers in Egypt were able to make many devices from stone and wood that were necessary for the corresponding work and cutting down thickets (axes, adzes, hoes).  Due to this, labor productivity has increased significantly.  Along the banks of the Nile on natural hills, archaeologists managed to discover the settlements of early farmers, which belong to the second pre-dynastic period.  They switched to a <span>settled lifestyle.</span>  Ancient farmers in Egypt learned to use the floods of a mighty river for their needs.  They built primitive ramparts that held spilled water in the fields. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="farmers in ancient egypt" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556374.jpg" width="459"></div>

    <h2>  Further development </h2><p>  A complex system of pools did not appear immediately.  It was the result of painful and hard work, as well as the accumulated experience of drainage measures in the Nile Valley and Delta.  The formation of this system went in stages.  Gradually, dams, dams, ramparts and so on were built.  Thus, it is advisable to conclude that the Nile provided all of Ancient Egypt.  Agriculture continued to develop rapidly.  In order to create irrigation pool systems, observant representatives of this craft used the features of the country's relief and the specifics of <span>the river‚Äôs</span> water <span>regime.</span>  Neil spilled every year.  We are talking about regular events from June to October.  The flood came out of the Nile and flooded the banks to the most desolate highlands.  These territories at that time were distinguished by savannah-steppe vegetation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient egypt farming" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556375.jpg" width="235"></div>

As for the last period, then, perhaps, the guns were somewhat more advanced.  Many different devices were invented by people who inhabited Ancient Egypt.  Agriculture developed and contributed to the creation of new tools.  A primitive-type plow is depicted in the drawing letters, which date back to the times of the II dynasty.  On the monument to the king is shown a hoe.  In one of the tombs belonging to the middle of the 1st dynasty, dozens of wooden sickles were found with inserted blades made of pieces of flint.  As for grinding grain, it was produced manually.  Rough graters have also been preserved.  They consisted of two stones, between which the grain was ground.  Most of the bread plants that were during the Old Kingdom remained known to the Egyptians during the Early Period.  This also applies to the fig tree, date palm, vine and others.  Among the vegetables, there were also hardly new species (lettuce, cucumbers, garlic, onions, root crops, and so on). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agriculture in ancient egypt history" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556376.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  Features of creating an irrigation system </h2><p>  It is known that flax growing was quite developed even before the time of the Ancient Kingdom.  As for the creation of an <span>irrigation system,</span> it required exceptional skills and tremendous work.  In addition, in-depth knowledge was needed in the fields of construction, hydraulics, mathematics and astronomy.  As mentioned earlier, agriculture was completely based on the basin irrigation system.  Accordingly, the annual cycle of workers depended on the water regime of the Nile. </p><h2>  The invention of the agricultural calendar </h2><p>  Farmers (later astronomers) from ancient times observed the first early rise of the <span>stars of Sirius.</span>  This marked the beginning of the new year and was accompanied by the rise of the Nile.  Based on these observations, the Egyptians were able to invent an agricultural calendar.  It is fully consistent with the water regime of the Nile.  The names of the seasons reflected the essence of agricultural work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient agricultural tribes" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556377.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Organizational moments </h2><p>  Workers were free to dispose of their land.  Allowed gift, sale and testament.  One nobleman could have several householders.  They, in turn, were the main managers of the farms.  In the fields during sowing and reaping, labor detachments worked.  Judging by the preserved images, they consisted exclusively of men.  Sculpting was female work.  If the nobleman was a nomarch, and the reapers were not enough, then he could attract "royal" people to help his personal detachments.  We are talking about community farmers.  Fields were also processed by slaves. </p>
