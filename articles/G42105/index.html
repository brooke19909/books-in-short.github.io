They are created with a hook, and then they decorate items of clothing, hats, hairpins, bracelets, bags, etc. They make wonderful bouquets, necklaces and earrings from these flowers - all the fair sex will be happy to receive them as a gift. </p><p>  There are a huge number of knitting methods - from narrow petals to oval, voluminous and flat inflorescences. </p><h2>  The use of knitted flowers </h2><p>  The size of knitted flowers is also diverse, they are both large and smaller.  They can decorate absolutely everything - from hooks for curtains to coats.  With their help, masterpieces are created! </p><p>  Having connected many small flowers, you can make unique jewelry, a hair clip, a holiday card or a photo frame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-colored flowers" class="if uuid-2844009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2844009.jpg"></div><p>  The advantage of these products is their great resistance to wet processing - washing, dry cleaning.  They do not warp, perfectly retaining their original shape.  They are attached to the material either with glue or sewing with threads. </p><p>  In short, anything is possible with imagination and patience!  Crochet small flowers according to patterns and decorate your favorite things! </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  For work on knitting small flowers, there is no need for additional costs for new skeins of yarn, use the remnants of materials left over from old knitters!  Each needlewoman has such a bag with glomeruli, which I really do not want to throw away.  Now they will come in handy! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We also note that when working with different types of threads, completely different effects are obtained, even if the knitting follows the same pattern.  Suppose a thin woolen yarn gives a fluffy soft texture to the flower, a cotton thread creates very clear outlines of the leaves, mercerized cotton will bring a slight glow to the finished product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegreendragonfly.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting flower" class="if uuid-2844005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2844005.jpg"></div><p>  Each knitted flower should be crocheted in an appropriate size - it is selected to the thickness of the yarn.  The most suitable for such work are the thinnest hooks - No. 1, 2 and 3. </p><p>  Also, for the middle of the flowers, beads, beads, rhinestones are needed. </p><h2>  Crochet flower - patterns for beginners </h2><p>  If you take many different colors of threads and impose miniature small flowers from them, and then combine them into one canvas, you can create pretty nice things.  Crocheting small crocheted flowers according to the patterns is very easy - now you will see this! </p><p>  We will begin to knit with a yellow thread from the ring of "amigurumi", into which we will collect 16 posts.  without crochets.  Tighten the free end, and connect the columns with a half-column.  You can tighten the thread ‚Äúall the way‚Äù, or you can leave a free hole.  The middle is tied - you can cut the thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We attach the yarn of the desired color and continue knitting. </p><p>  In the first loop, we knit 1 pillar.  without nak., 1 column.  with nak .; </p><p>  In the second - a pillar.  with 1 nak., pillar  with two nak., a column.  from 1 nak .; </p><p>  In the third - a pillar.  with 1 nak., pillar  without nak. </p><p>  So, they tied the petal, which took three loops of the previous row and consisting of seven columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittochka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple flat flower" class="if uuid-2843717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2843717.jpg"></div><p>  Knit each subsequent leaf in the same way, as a result you get a small five-petal flower. </p><h2>  Simple little flower crocheted - diagram and description </h2><p>  Some of the simplest patterns are those where knitting is limited only to the central row - the ring and several individual petals.  These flowers are insanely easy to manufacture, and their sizes depend only on the texture of the threads and the thickness of the hook.  The middle is knitted from a chain drawn by air loops and several columns crocheted or crocheted knitted into a ring.  Any of the options for such an inflorescence has the same central part, becoming more complicated in some cases. </p><p>  The petal is given the shape of a semicircle due to the fact that by the middle of the number of yarn increases, and then again decreases. </p><p>  So, here is the diagram of the simplest flower, which even beginner knitters can do! </p><div class="photo" data-original="domihobby.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower for beginners" class="if uuid-2843735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2843735.jpg"></div><p>  Each leaf is knitted either in all the columns of the previous row, or several columns in one previous. </p><p>  Sometimes, when they start crocheting small flowers with complicated patterns, they notice that arches from air loops or pico are added to the single crochet columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochethealingandraymond.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pico flower" class="if uuid-2844012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2844012.jpg"></div><p>  In this design, they get a slightly different kind of flower, more complex and original. </p><h2>  Crochet viola </h2><p>  Creating asymmetric flowers, for example, viola, is not at all complicated, as it seems at first glance.  The base is the same as in the previously described options - a ring of loops with a pillar tied into it.  without crochets.  The only difference is knitting leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittochka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="viola knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2843710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2843710.jpg"></div><p>  There are 3 stages in the work. </p><p>  On the first, a core of yellow yarn is knitted, which is then tied with half-columns. </p><p>  The second step will be the joining of purple yarn and tying a pole in a circle.  without crochets.  The same thread is knitted arches from air loops. </p><p>  And already flower petals are created on them. </p><h2>  Miniature layered flowers </h2><p>  Having mastered the simplest techniques for crocheting beautiful flowers according to patterns, you can begin to manufacture much more interesting inflorescences!  After all, many flowers were created by nature with several rows of leaves.  Creating voluminous flowers is easy using flat color schemes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="domihobby.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layered flower pattern" class="if uuid-2843722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2843722.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the work, they also knit a ring of air loops, tie it with single crochet columns, and then with the help of arches tied under the petals of the previous row, they increase another row of petals. </p><p>  This row will be larger than the previous one by one loop.  Each arch in the next tiers is gaining one more additional loop. </p><p>  The diagram shows in detail how a similar flower fits. </p><p>  Crocheting small flowers according to patterns is very exciting, and things decorated with them will delight you and others for a long time! </p>
