    <h2>  Recovery </h2><p>  Many people wonder whether it is possible to recover the password from the Sberbank card.  This question is easy to answer.  No, this chance is not provided to clients of a financial institution. </p><p>  You can change the pin code at an ATM or through a variety of Internet services to the one that the client wants.  But there is no way to restore the secret combination.  This nuance must be taken into account.  Therefore, at least, if the card is blocked, you will not be able to use it anymore.  But money can be recovered.  For this, a plastic recovery process is provided.  During it, a new card will be made, but tied to the old account.  About how to implement this idea - a little later. </p><h2>  Lock </h2><p>  How to find out the password from the Sberbank card?  If the envelope issued by the financial institution upon receipt of the plastic is lost, then it will not be possible to completely obtain this information.  Even if you call the bank and ask for the access code.  But what then? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If a person has forgotten the pin code, it is necessary to restore the card.  Then a new account will be opened, to which funds are transferred from the old one, and you will also receive a new access password.  The first step to go through is blocking the card. </p><p>  There are several ways to do this.  By the way, this is a mandatory item.  Until the old card is blocked, a new reissue will not work.  What to do?  Forgot password from Sberbank card?  Then it is proposed: </p><ul><li>  3 times at the ATM, enter the access password incorrectly and wait for the lock; </li><li>  call Sberbank and block the plastic; </li><li>  personally apply for blocking. </li></ul><p>  There is no significant difference in process data.  The only thing that needs to be taken into account is that if the PIN code is incorrectly entered in the ATM, then the card will be held by the machine.  You will have to contact the employees of a financial company to extract it.  This is a fairly long process.  Therefore, most often, customers call Sberbank.  Organization phone number: 8 (800) 555-55-50.  It is enough to tell the employee your passport data, quite often they require a secret word (not to be confused with a PIN code).  Next, you can express a desire to block the plastic.  It's all.  After a while, the card will be blocked.  You can proceed to the following algorithm of actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank phone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1454658.jpg"></div>
