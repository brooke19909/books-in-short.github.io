Until 1826 it was a place for public executions.  Currently, it hosts performances by musicians and street performers, as well as various fairs.  Often in the square you can meet crooks and charlatans, so when walking, you should stay away from suspicious persons. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Located between the hill of Pinchio and the Tiber (it. - Tevere), near the Bergese park, Piazza del Popolo in Rome looks amazing.  It is decorated with churches, monuments and marble memorials erected in honor of past historical events.  Interestingly, the square was originally known as Piazza del Trullo.  This name was given to her by a conical fountain, which once stood in the very center of it.  In its appearance it resembled a characteristic southern Italian dwelling.  With the disappearance of this fountain, the old name of the square disappeared.  Most likely, she got her current name in honor of the poplars that once grew here (populus - in Latin, pioppo - in Italian). </p>

    <h2>  Entrance to the square </h2><p>  In the north of the city are the gates of Porta de Popola, leading to the square and perfectly fit into its architectural ensemble.  They were first erected as early as 271-275.  and bore the name ‚ÄúFlaminin‚Äù in honor of the consul Guy Flaminius.  From them once began the famous road connecting Rome with the north coast.  Through it, most travelers arrived in this city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The gates of the Port de Popolo were reconstructed in 1562 by order of Pope Pius IV, who wanted to impress the pilgrims.  Later, their inner part was redone by Bernini, and the fortress towers located on the sides were demolished.  The facade was reconstructed by the same architect in honor of the <span>Swedish Queen Christina,</span> who converted to Catholicism and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica (one of three women who received this honor). </p>

    <h2>  Obelisk </h2><p>  In the center of Piazza del Popolo is an Egyptian 23.2-meter obelisk transported here from the Temple of the Sun, once located in Heliopolis.  In the years 1815-1816.  Giuseppe Valadier erected around the base of this architectural monument four Egyptian lions, created by the sculptor Giovanni Ceccarini, and a central fountain.  As a result, the area acquired a more advanced look. </p>

    <h2>  Symmetric Churches </h2><p>  At the southern end of Piazza del Popolo in Rome, on both sides of Via del Corso, there are two churches - Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto, created in 1658 by the architect Carlo Ryandi on a special commissioned by Pope Alexander VII.  Despite the great external similarity, the buildings still differ from each other.  So, the first church has a more rounded dome, and the second has a smaller area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Basilica in the square </h2><p>  Also on the square is the church of Santa Maria Del Popolo.  It is located on the site of the mausoleum in which the ashes of Nero were previously stored.  According to legend, a huge walnut once grew here, in whose foliage black crows and demonic forces allegedly settled.  The place at that time was considered damned, and people did their best to get around it. </p><p>  In 1099, Pope Paschalia II dreamed about the Blessed Virgin Mary, who commanded to cut down this terrible tree, and throw the ashes along with the remains of the grave into the Tiber.  The next day, dad did this with the help of his employees.  They say that since then the ghost of Nero began to appear on the square once a year and scare the townspeople.  But just on what day it can be seen, no one can say that. </p><p>  The basilica was erected in 1472 on the site of the church of the Order of the Augustinians, located near the northern gate of Rome.  It is interesting for the presence of five aisles, built as a family tomb for church dignitaries and the Roman nobility.  The first chapel, known for the film "Angels and Demons", was built by Rafael Santi in honor of his patron Agostino Chigi.  The paintings for the altar were painted by Sebastian del Piombo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The walls of the second chapel (Cherazi) were painted by masters of the early Baroque - Caravaggio and <span>Annibale Carracci.</span>  Later, under Alexander VII, the interior of the basilica was significantly updated by the architect Bernini.  Today it is one of the most important monuments of the Renaissance in Rome.  Since March 24, 2006, Pole Stanislav Dzivish has served as a cardinal priest here. </p>

    <h2>  Fountains </h2><p>  The history of the Piazza del Popolo in Rome says that the only decoration of the square was once only the fountain of Giacomo della Porta, built in 1573 by order of Pope Gregorius XIII.  It was one of the 18 fountains that were planned to be created in Rome after the restoration of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct.  But while designing, Domenico Fontana discovered that the axis of intersection of 3 future roads of the city converge in its place.  To improve visual perception, it was decided to move the fountain closer to the beginning of del Corso, and place an Egyptian obelisk in its place, which was subsequently done. </p><p>  The fountains of Giovanni Ceccarini were placed, as already mentioned in the article, around the obelisk, as well as in the western and eastern parts of the square, surrounded by neoclassical statues ‚ÄúThe Seasons‚Äù (1828).  The first of these is a statue of Neptune, which holds a trident in its hands and is accompanied by two dolphins.  The second was created in honor of the goddess of Rome.  Her statue is armed with a spear and helmet.  In front of her is a she-wolf, who allegedly nurtured Romulus and Remus, and on the sides - the figures of bearded men, symbolizing the Anenier and Tiber rivers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Piazza del Popolo in Rome" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2089970.jpg"></div>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  If you look at the map, you will notice that from Piazza del Popolo there are three streets leading to the city, forming the so-called trident (il Tridente): Via del Corso;  Via del Babuino (opened in 1525 as Via Paolina) and Via di Ripetta (opened by Leo X in 1518 as Via Leonina).  The main street leads through the city gate to Piazza San Marco (Venice).  The one on the right in the picture - to <span>the Tiber River,</span> on the left - connects the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza di Spagna (an area located in the center of Rome). </p><p>  To the north of the described attraction is Flaminio Square.  To the left of Piazza del Popolo is the so-called Campo Marzio.  In ancient times, it served as a training field for soldiers, and is currently one of the most attractive areas of the city.  Here you can see baroque and renaissance palaces, numerous boutiques and grocery stores. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about Piazza del Popolo indicate that it is a very beautiful and large area with fantastic architectural structures.  Two similar churches, the famous basilica - these are the buildings that are its "calling card".  Many are pleased that there are good restaurants with delicious food and the usual tourist eateries, where you can have a cheap meal. </p><p>  Also, tourists like the statues that are installed here.  Many willingly walk near the obelisk named after Ramses the Second, located in the very center of the square and surrounded on all sides by four fountains in the form of Egyptian lions.  Still nearby, as some vacationers write, there is a Napoleon‚Äôs staircase leading to the Pincho hill, on which there is an observation deck.  Judging by the responses, if you look down from it, you may be seized with enthusiastic thrill.  Fountains, shops, cafes - just a "gingerbread" atmosphere. </p><p>  Many love the Piazza del Popolo in Rome (Italy), which truly reflects the spirit of the Eternal City.  But there are 2 things that you should pay attention to: the abundance on the square of people offering to buy any nonsense, and the presence of scammers.  You should carefully monitor your bags and wallets, and also not take any "gifts" so as not to become a victim of any crime. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in how to get to Piazza del Popolo in Rome.  In fact, there is nothing complicated.  You can, for example, buy a plane ticket from a reliable airline company and fly to the airport closest to the square, then transfer to the bus and get to any of the streets leading to the square.  There will be only a little walk on foot.  You can also go to Rome by car with the included navigator, which will help you get to the right place.  But, pay attention, it is forbidden to call into the square by car today.  Therefore, leave it in the nearest parking lot and continue on your own legs.  Have a nice trip! </p>
