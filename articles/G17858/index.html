    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Our ancestors, the <span>ancient Slavs,</span> called the Varangian Sea exactly because the Old Russian name of the Scandinavian peoples among the Slavs was ‚ÄúVarangians‚Äù.  And they came to our territory because of this sea.  By the way, the trade route that connected the Black and Baltic Sea (‚Äúfrom the Vikings to the Greeks‚Äù) was called so.  This name was preserved until the XVIII century, and after it became known as the Baltic Sea, which had Lithuanian roots in its origin. </p><p>  In addition, the Varyazhskoe Sea was once called by other names.  For example, Sveisky, Svebsky, Amber.  Also, in the XVI-XVII centuries, it was of great strategic importance for Russia, as an exit to Europe and the main sea route.  After the Russian Empire won the Northern War with Sweden, it began to own almost all of its east coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, now we know that in ancient times the modern Baltic Sea was called the Varangian Sea.  By the way, some researchers and scientists are inclined to believe that this is not at all the case.  They cite numerous facts for the fact that the Varyazhsk Sea in the annals and the modern <span>Baltic Sea</span> are not the same, but they used to call the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.  Thus, now there are at least two options.  However, we will still be inclined to the first option, as more believable. </p><h2>  Location of the sea and coastal zone </h2><p>  The ancient Varyazhsk Sea was formed about fourteen thousand years ago due to the sinking of land.  Prior to this, there was a lowland at this place, which was filled with water during the <span>melting of glaciers,</span> and a fresh lake appeared.  At this point, the land rose and fell several more times.  The latter happened about seven thousand years ago, which led to the formation of the sea within the limits that are available now. </p><p>  Today, the coastline of the Baltic Sea is quite uneven.  Here you can find a large number of bays of various sizes, bays, streamers and capes.  The northern part of the coast is quite rocky, but towards the south the stones gradually turn into a mixture of pebbles with sand and later completely into sand. </p><p>  This sea belongs to the basin of the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> and is inland, deeply cuts into the land.  In the <span>north, its extreme</span> point is almost near the Arctic Circle, and in the south - near the German city of Wisma.  As you can see, it has a fairly large extent, which affects its climate.  The most extreme western point is the city of Flensburg (also Germany), and the eastern one is part of the city of St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Other information about the sea </h2><p>  It should be noted that the Varyazhsk Sea is slightly salted.  This is due to the fact that many freshwater rivers flow into it, but a rather weak connection with the Atlantic Ocean.  Complete renewal of marine salt water occurs in about thirty or fifty years.  However, the salinity of the waters in all places is different.  This is due to weak movements of the vertical layers of water. </p><p>  If we talk about its temperature regime, then it is quite low.  In summer, it reaches an average of seventeen degrees in the Gulf of Finland. </p>

    <h2>  Baltic Sea Features </h2><p>  The Varangian Sea, the modern name of which is the Baltic, has its own characteristics.  It was mentioned above that it is slightly salted.  It should be noted that as a result of all this, its fauna is rather poor, and is divided into zones with marine species and those that live in fresh water. </p><p>  This is also due to the fact that the sea itself in its present form is quite young (about five thousand years), which is quite a short time for adaptation of the animal representative of the water world.  However, the poverty of species is compensated by the number of representatives of the animal world. </p>

    <h2>  Today's marine environment </h2><p>  Today the Varangian Sea (the modern name is the Baltic) has its own environmental problems.  Due to the large washout from the fertilized fields of nitrogen and phosphorus, their level increases in it, which leads to a decrease in oxygen and, as a result, difficulties in the processing of organic substances.  Entire sections appear that are very saturated with hydrogen sulfide. </p><p>  Another important issue for the Baltic waters is oil.  It enters the sea with various effluents and pollutes the surface very much.  In addition, the sea accumulates and increases the amount of <span>heavy metals</span> that get there with household and industrial waste. </p><p>  Since the Baltic has always been in the thick of historical events, and many ships went along it, at the bottom of it lies a considerable amount of flooded cargoes that are dangerous.  After all, it is not known when the metal that holds harmful substances will thin out, and what can happen. </p>
