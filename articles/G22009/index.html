    <p>  In this article, we dwell on this type of banking services, such as salary projects. </p><h2>  Why pay salaries on bank cards? </h2><p>  Very few organizations today pay salaries to employees through their own cashier.  Most carry out this operation using the services of banks. </p><p>  The question arises: "What is the benefit?"  Everything is quite simple.  Using banking institutions to pay salaries, the employer does not need to maintain its own cashiers and a large number of other service personnel, which is associated with payroll calculations with employees. </p>

    <p>  Even though it is necessary to deduct some percent (payments) to the bank for its services, this form of payment is still beneficial.  Moreover, if the agreement is concluded with a bank that provides services at a high level, then every participant in the salary project will be satisfied. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who concludes such projects? </h2><p>  The director of the enterprise enters into an agreement with the bank together with the chief accountant, or they are done by their authorized persons who have the appropriate powers of attorney to perform transactions on their behalf. </p><p>  If the organization is new, then basically its representatives themselves go to the bank, find out the conditions and conclude an agreement.  But if the enterprise is already serviced by some bank, then other financial institutions constantly send out their business proposals, including offering salary projects. </p><p>  Moreover, it is much easier to attract a recently opened organization than one that has already concluded an agreement with another bank.  In the process of fighting for <span>market shares in</span> financial services, banks are ready to do whatever they want so as not to lose the customers they have already won.  Therefore, very favorable conditions are created (for example, free transfers), which are almost impossible to get around. </p><p>  At the time of <span>conclusion of the contract</span> from the bank, there is usually a head of the department and a financial consultant who specializes in servicing legal entities. </p>

    <h2>  How are salary projects concluded? </h2><p>  First of all, the enterprise must provide the constituent documents to the bank, and other additional certificates and certificates may be required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After a full familiarization of the authorized employees of the enterprise with all conditions and tariffs, the parties enter into an agreement.  Bank salary projects involve the transfer to the bank of a list of employees and photocopies of their documents necessary for identification, as well as the issuance of new plastic cards to which their <span>salaries</span> will be transferred <span>.</span> </p><p>  After issuing cards, there are two ways to issue them.  The first one is when bank representatives come to the enterprise and there they issue each employee personally both the card itself and the PIN code for a receipt.  The second is when the employees of the enterprise independently contact the bank and receive a card with a PIN code already in the branches. </p>

    <p>  Often the second option occurs when the organization‚Äôs employees were absent at the time of arrival of the bank‚Äôs employees for the mass issuance of cards due to illness or any other. </p><p>  Analyzing current banking offers in the financial services market, five levels of salary projects can be distinguished. </p><h2>  Low level </h2><p>  This level is the most common.  It is very cheap for the enterprise, since they do not imply any additional services.  If an enterprise is just starting to cooperate with a bank, then the first thing it chooses is a salary project.  Sberbank, for example, charges only 300 rubles for servicing such a product.  per month.  Most often, this option of a salary project is offered to <span>budget organizations.</span> </p><h2>  Standard level </h2><p>  The company pays a slightly larger amount for servicing a standard-level salary project, but at the same time receives a large number of additional services: a reduction in the commission for payments, free SMS notifications for all employees. </p><h2>  Gold level </h2><p>  The gold level implies the issuance <span>of</span> high-quality <span>salary cards to</span> employees.  Some banks at this level offer chip cards, which are more secure than standard ones.  For example, such a salary project Sberbank offers enterprises for 3,000 rubles.  per month. </p><h2>  Platinum level </h2><p>  This level involves service at a higher level.  The cost of such a package of services is quite high and not affordable for every enterprise.  This level includes all the advantages of lower levels, and also implies some others.  For example, banks offer free card replacements, in case of loss, insurance of the property of their owner, as well as medical life insurance, which is valid both in the Russian Federation and abroad. </p><h2>  Premium level </h2><p>  The premium level is not offered by all banking institutions.  And those who provide such a service do not provide it in all cities where there are branches, only in those where there is demand.  Serving such a package of services is quite expensive, but includes many advantages: discounts in stores, hotels, the presence of a dedicated personal hotline operator, and much more. </p>

    <p>  Customers with cards of this level are classified as VIP clients. </p><p>  The conditions in all banks are different, and the above is an average list, which is compiled by comparing the offers of the largest banks operating in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  If you are thinking about what level of salary project to choose, then you should not immediately conclude a contract for platinum or premium.  Remember that even a low level can be quite attractive, the main thing is that the banking institution fulfills its obligations and qualitatively serves both the management of the enterprise and ordinary workers. </p>
