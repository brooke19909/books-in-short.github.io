    <h2>  Turkey, Konar &amp; Doruk Hotel 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Many guests call their stay in Kemer ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù, and the Konar &amp; Doruk hotel - ‚Äúan excellent institution.‚Äù  If the priority is a warm clear sea, mountains, greenery, sun, and the budget of the trip is quite limited, then Konar &amp; Doruk will be the best option. </p><p>  The linen in the hotel rooms is, according to reviews, quite worn out.  Soundproofing, unfortunately, is absent here.  The rooms are small, reminiscent of housing in Soviet hotels, but are equipped with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãplumbing, air conditioning, TV - everything works fine.  Some reviews provide information that while taking a shower in the rooms, water floods the floor outside the shower tray.  Tourists recommend how to avoid such a "disaster": you just need to fill the shower curtain into the tray and do not direct the hose at it.  The rooms have a small balcony, furnished with two chairs, on which you can hang up beach towels for drying.  The linen in the rooms changes regularly, cleaning is done systematically, no tips are necessary.  The TV shows 4 Russian channels.  The downside is many residents call unattended air conditioning: the presence of fungus and mold is noticed in it.  Guests have to breathe for some time the harmful composition of the air, as the problem when submitting a complaint to the reception is not solved quickly enough.  The quality of the rooms, according to many, can hardly ‚Äúreach‚Äù 2 *. The hotel is suitable for tourists who prefer an active vacation and who plan to spend little time in the rooms. </p>

    <p>  The safe can be rented in the lobby at the reception.  Cost: $ 1 per day (about 60 rubles). According to reviews, nothing disappears from the safe. </p><p>  Food guests call sufficient, but not designed for the capricious eater.  The fact that guests do not finish their meal at lunch will be served for dinner, the authors of the reviews share.  It is better to forget about meat dishes during your stay at Konar &amp; Doruk for those vacationers who eat exclusively at the hotel.  Many praise local coffee and jams.  The All Inclusive system covers: breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as bar service (from 10:30 to 22), where beer, <span>Turkish vodka,</span> wine (red and white), cola, tea, coffee, <span>drinks are</span> provided <span>("Yuppie"</span> from the machine).  Beer and vodka, as noted by the reviewers, are obviously diluted for economic reasons, but this is about 40-45 degrees for the heat and not bad, tourists say.  Strong alcohol in such conditions can be detrimental to health. </p>

    <p>  Guests call the kitchen designed for the average eater.  They cook dishes that are not too fatty, and not too sharp.  For breakfast, a regular set of products from cheese, eggs, 2 types of ham, feta cheese, herbs, vegetables, cottage cheese, yogurt, various cereals is offered.  For lunch and dinner, pickles, pastries (cakes, cakes, puddings), as well as watermelon are added.  There are almost no fruits - sometimes apples are served.  Fish happens quite often, guests of Konar &amp; Doruk share, in addition, they serve meat dishes, meatballs with potatoes, vegetable salads.  Eggplant dishes are especially popular for holidaymakers.  The authors of the reviews say that the guests of Konar &amp; Doruk are not hungry all day. </p><p>  Food at the hotel, the authors of reviews write, is still more suitable for vegetarians who feel full and satisfied, eating greens, fresh cheese, tomatoes, vegetables.  But the restaurant usually lined up for meat dishes.  Many reviewers believe this is not too comfortable for guests.  Nevertheless, hotel guests believe that the institution received its stardom (3 *) precisely because of the more or less tolerable organization of food. </p><p>  Vacationers amend the hotel information offered in advertising booklets, as well as in some reviews: from the hotel to the sea you should go not 250 m, but all 400, but this road does not cause any difficulties.  Own beach, according to reviewers, the hotel does not.  The beach here is not sandy, but mostly pebble, so vacationers recommend buying slippers with a hard sole on the market - it will be very convenient to walk on pebbles, in addition, such shoes will not fly off during swimming (2 pairs cost $ 11 on the market, or about 655 p.). </p><p>  The hotel staff is very satisfied, they call it welcoming, polite and friendly.  Never refuses any requests.  The hotel staff, although they do not know the Russian language, somehow cope with the problems that sometimes arise among Russian tourists and everyone is satisfied.  The rooms never disappear, you can not even use the safe, holidaymakers say.  The owner of the hotel usually has breakfast with the guests. </p><p>  The hotel area, according to reviews, is small, but clean, well-groomed and comfortable.  Guests can relax by the pool, but many people like to swim in the sea, so they do not use pools.  There is no animation at the hotel, but there are many places in the city where you can have fun.  A fairly significant minus, which even animal lovers note, is that a huge number of cats live on the territory.  Reviewers report that there are more than 20 of them.  Cats themselves are lovely animals, guests share, but if so many of them roam the territory, the restaurant, the hotel corridors, this somewhat infringes on the conveniences of the residents themselves. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the Konar &amp; Doruk hotel is fully consistent with its 3 * category, vacationers say.  This option is recommended for tourists who prefer a quiet, relaxing budget holiday, as well as lovers of excursions and active leisure activities.  The authors of the reviews do not recommend coming with small children to this hotel: there is nothing to occupy here.  Many are very pleased with their stay at the hotel and express a desire to return here. </p>
