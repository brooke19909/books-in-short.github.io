Electromagnets and their application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are four fundamental forces of physics, and one of them is called electromagnetism.  Conventional magnets have limited use.  An electromagnet is a device that creates a <span>magnetic field</span> during the passage of an electric current.  Since electricity can be turned on and off, the same goes for an electromagnet.  It can even be weakened or amplified by decreasing or increasing current.  Electromagnets find their application in various everyday electrical appliances, in various fields of industry, from conventional switches to propulsion systems of spacecraft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where are electromagnets used" class="if uuid-977964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977964.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  What is an electromagnet? </h2><p>  An electromagnet can be thought of as a temporary magnet that functions with a stream of electricity, and its polarity can be easily changed by changing the <span>direction of the current.</span>  Also, the strength of the electromagnet can be changed by changing the magnitude of the current flowing through it. </p><p>  The scope of electromagnetism is unusually wide.  For example, magnetic switches are preferred in use in that they are less susceptible to temperature changes and are able to maintain rated current without false triggering. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where can you use electromangits" class="if uuid-977962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977962.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Electromagnets and their application </h2><p>  Here are some of the examples where they are used: </p><ul><li>  Motors and generators.  Thanks to electromagnets, it became possible to manufacture electric motors and generators that operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction.  This phenomenon was discovered by the scientist Michael Faraday.  He proved that electric current creates a magnetic field.  The generator uses the external force of the wind, moving water or steam, rotates the shaft, which makes a set of magnets move around the spiral wire to create an electric current.  Thus, electromagnets convert other types of energy into electrical energy. </li><li>  Industrial practice.  Only materials made of iron, nickel, cobalt or their alloys, as well as some natural minerals react to a magnetic field.  Where do you use electromagnets?  One of the areas of practical application is the sorting of metals.  Since these elements are used in production, iron alloys are effectively sorted using an electromagnet. </li><li>  Where are electromagnets used?  With their help, you can also lift and move massive objects, for example, cars before disposal.  They are also used in transportation.  Trains in Asia and Europe use electromagnets to transport cars.  This helps them move at phenomenal speeds. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where are electromagnets used in life" class="if uuid-977960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977960.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Electromagnets in everyday life </h2><p>  Electromagnets are often used to store information, since many materials are capable of absorbing a magnetic field, which can subsequently be read to extract information.  They find application in almost any modern device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Where are electromagnets used?  In everyday life, they are used in a number of household appliances.  One of the useful characteristics of an electromagnet is the ability to change the <span>magnetic force</span> when changing the strength and direction of the current flowing through the coil or winding around it.  Speakers, loudspeakers and tape recorders are devices in which this effect is realized.  Some electromagnets can be very strong, and their strength can be regulated. </p><p>  Where are electromagnets used in life?  The simplest examples are <span>doorbells</span> and electromagnetic locks.  An electromagnetic interlock is used for the door, creating a strong field.  As long as current passes through the electromagnet, the door remains closed.  Televisions, computers, cars, elevators and photocopiers - this is where electromagnets are used, and this is not a complete list. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where are electromagnets used in everyday life" class="if uuid-977958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977958.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Electromagnetic forces </h2><p>  The strength of the electromagnetic field can be adjusted by changing the electric current passing through the wires wrapped around the magnet.  If you change the direction of the electric current, the polarity of the magnetic field also changes to the opposite.  This effect is used to create fields in a magnetic tape or computer hard drive for storing information, as well as in loudspeakers of speakers in a radio, television and stereo systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the use of electromagnets" class="if uuid-977957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977957.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Magnetism and electricity </h2><p>  Vocabulary definitions of electricity and magnetism are different, although they are manifestations of the same force.  When <span>electric charges move,</span> they create a magnetic field.  Its change, in turn, leads to the appearance of an electric current. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="electromagnets and their application" class="if uuid-977956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977956.jpg?1554998419"></div><p>  The inventors use electromagnetic forces to create electric motors, generators, <span>MRI</span> devices <span>, levitating</span> toys, consumer electronics and many other invaluable devices, without which it is impossible to imagine the everyday life of a modern person.  Electromagnets are inextricably linked to electricity; they simply cannot work without an external power source. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where do you use electromagnets" class="if uuid-977959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977959.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Application of hoisting and large-scale electromagnets </h2><p>  Electric motors and generators are vital in today's world.  A motor receives electrical energy and uses a magnet to turn electrical energy into kinetic.  A generator, on the other hand, converts motion using magnets to generate electricity.  When moving dimensional metal objects, lifting electromagnets are used.  They are also necessary when sorting scrap metal, to separate cast iron and other ferrous metals from non-ferrous ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="lifting electromagnets" class="if uuid-977963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977963.jpg?1554998419"></div><p>  The real miracle of technology is the Japanese levitating train, capable of speeds up to 320 kilometers per hour.  It uses electromagnets to help soar in the air and move incredibly fast.  The U.S. Navy conducts high-tech experiments with a futuristic electromagnetic rail gun.  She can direct her shells over considerable distances with great speed.  Shells have tremendous kinetic energy, so they can hit targets without the use of explosives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where are electromagnets used" class="if uuid-977965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977965.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  The concept of electromagnetic induction </h2><p>  In the study of electricity and magnetism, the concept of <span>electromagnetic induction</span> is important <span>.</span>  <span>Induction</span> takes place when an electric current arises in a conductor in the presence of a changing magnetic field.  The use of electromagnets with their induction principles is actively used in electric motors, generators and transformers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where can you use electromagnets" class="if uuid-977966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977966.jpg?1554998419"></div><h2>  Where can I use electromagnets in medicine? </h2><p>  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans also work with electromagnets.  This is a specialized medical method for examining the internal organs of a person that are not available for direct examination.  Along with the main used additional gradient magnets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="MRI electromagnets" class="if uuid-977967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/977967.jpg?1554998419"></div><p>  Where are electromagnets used?  They are present in all types of electrical devices, including hard drives, speakers, motors, generators.  Electromagnets are used everywhere and, despite their invisibility, occupy an important place in the life of a modern person. </p>
