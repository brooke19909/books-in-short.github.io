    <h2>  The youth of the future hero </h2><p>  Mikhail Isaakovich was born on August 13, 1907 in a small Jewish family.  His father was a hereditary blacksmith and dreamed that in the future his son would continue the family business.  However, Mikhail chose a different path - when he reached adulthood, he packed up his things and drove away from his native village. </p><p>  Mikhail Isaakovich decided to find his true calling in Leningrad.  In order to settle in the new city, he got a job at the <span>Baltic Shipyard.</span>  Here he quickly became the soul of the team - it was difficult to find a person who did not like the young intern.  However, Mikhail lived not only with work, almost immediately after the move, he signed up for a labor school, which helped him to enter the University of Leningrad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the university, Mikhail Isaakovich Mukasey studied foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the culture of other peoples.  Here he met his future wife - Elizabeth Emelyanova.  They played the wedding immediately after graduation, after which a new, unusually complex and dangerous chapter began in their life. </p>

    <h2>  Scout family </h2><p>  <span>Soviet intelligence</span> knew well who Mikhail Isaakovich Mukasey was.  The biography of this man was crystal clear, and his skills and knowledge made him an ideal candidate for intelligence.  In early 1937, official recruitment took place, which ended quite successfully. </p><p>  In the same year, Mikhail Mukasey went to study at the school of the Intelligence Directorate of the Red Army.  Along with him, Elizabeth Ivanovna, who also agreed to help her husband and the Soviet regime, is taking espionage courses.  In 1938, their son Anatoly Mukasey appeared, who in fact became the youngest intelligence officer in the USSR.  Thus, by the end of the year, the entire Mukasey family was already ready for its first mission. </p><h2>  Illegal Scout in the USA </h2><p>  In 1939, Mikhail Mukasey was sent to work in Los Angeles under the guise of a Soviet vice consul.  Naturally, this post was just a cover.  Its main task is to collect data useful to the Soviet Union, as well as the recruitment of new informants and agents.  But how exactly did this happen? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The scheme was simple.  Every week Mikhail arranged lush festivities, which all the stars of the local beau monde dreamed of getting on.  It should be noted that in those years, many Hollywood actors spoke closely with politicians and the military, which means that they had valuable intelligence information.  And talking to the stars was much easier than civil servants - the main thing is to pour in a glass on time and not skimp on flattery. </p>

    <h2>  Again in my native land </h2><p>  The Mukaseev family returned in 1943.  Alas, they did not have a chance to take a break from their duties, since the terrifying sounds of the Second World War thundered with might and main.  During this difficult period for the country, Mikhail Isaakovich began training young intelligence officers.  His experience and knowledge helped many children to stay alive, performing deadly for the good of the Motherland. </p><h2>  Mission in Europe </h2><p>  In 1955, the intelligence family again received a task from the country's leadership.  This time they had to go to Europe in order to provide the Soviet Union with valuable information about other countries.  True, this time <span>Anatoly Mukasey</span> remained at home, as his parents decided to protect him from potential danger and persecution. </p><p>  According to official figures, Michael and Elizabeth Mukasei not only did an excellent job of their task, but were also able to create their own agent network in Europe.  Thanks to this, the <span>Soviet Union</span> received timely operational data on time, which allowed it to take a more advantageous position in the international arena. </p>

    <h2>  Finally at home </h2><p>  Scouts returned to their homeland in the mid-70s.  Having rich espionage experience, Mikhail Isaakovich gets a job in a school of scouts.  For all the time of teaching, he trained more than one generation of professional spies.  Books written by him to this day are one of the best manuals in the intelligence school.  At the end of his life, Mikhail Isaakovich Mukasey said the following phrase: ‚ÄúIf no one knows about us in the country, it means that we have completed the tasks.‚Äù </p><p>  The great scout died on August 19, 2008, at the age of 101.  A year later, Elizaveta Ivanovna, a woman who tirelessly accompanied her husband for 70 years, left after him. </p>
