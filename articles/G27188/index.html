This is the foundation upon which all further knowledge is built.  <span>The goals and objectives of</span> biology, as well as its subject, methods and significance will be considered in this article. </p><p>  First, let's turn to history.  For the first time, the <span>term ‚Äúbiology‚Äù was</span> proposed by J. B. Lamarck, a French scientist.  He used it in 1802 to designate the science that interests life as a special natural phenomenon.  The tasks of modern biology are very extensive.  It represents a whole complex of sciences involved in the study of wildlife, the laws of its development and existence. </p><h2>  Salient features of biology </h2><p>  This science is characterized by: </p><ul><li>  close interaction with various disciplines included in its composition; </li><li>  high specialization; </li><li>  integration. </li></ul><p>  Today, the science of interest to us is constantly enriched with new generalizations, theories, and factual material. </p><h2>  The main task of biology </h2><p>  The tasks of modern biology are very diverse, but the main one is the knowledge of the laws by which evolution proceeds.  The fact is that the organic world has changed since the advent of life on earth.  It is constantly developing as a result of natural causes.  The biosphere plays a large role in the formation of the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and in creating the face of the earth. </p>

So, the main tasks of biology are to know the various general laws by which the development of living nature occurs, to study life forms and reveal its essence. </p><h2>  Subject of biology </h2><p>  The science of interest to us studies life, its forms and various patterns of development.  The diversity of all extinct, as well as currently living on our planet living beings is the subject of its study.  We have just described the tasks of biology; now we dwell in more detail on its subject.  Biology is interested in the structure (from anatomical and morphological to molecular), origin, functions, evolution, individual development, distribution, as well as the relationship of organisms with each other and with the environment. </p><p>  This science studies both particular and general laws that are characteristic of life in all its manifestations.  The tasks of biology include studying the exchange of energy and substances, variability and heredity, reproduction, development and growth, discreteness, irritability, movement, auto-regulation, etc. All of the above is its subject. </p>

    <h2>  Directions </h2><p>  In biology, depending on the objects of research, a number of areas can be distinguished, such as anthropology, zoology, botany, microbiology, virology, etc. These sciences study the features of development, structure, origin, vital functions, as well as the distribution, diversity, properties of each type of bacteria viruses, plants, animals and humans.  In the field of knowledge that interests us, we distinguish anatomy and morphology, physiology, genetics, developmental biology, evolutionary doctrine, ecology, and others according to the properties, structure, and manifestations of life. Genetic problems in biology, by the way, are an important part of the practice included in the school curriculum for this science. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Biophysics and biochemistry study the physical and chemical processes and chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, the physical structure and chemical composition of <span>biological systems</span> at various levels of organization.  Biometrics allows you to establish patterns that can not be noticed when studying single phenomena and processes.  That is, it is the totality of all planning techniques, as well as processing the results using mathematical statistics.  The objectives of molecular biology include the study of life phenomena occurring at the molecular level.  These include, in particular, the functions and structure of cells, organs and tissues.  General biology develops universal laws of structure (structure) and functioning.  That is, she is interested in what is common to all organisms. </p><h2>  Molecular level </h2><p>  The subject and objectives of biology can be considered at various levels.  Now we will describe each of them in detail. </p>

    <p>  Today, several levels of the study and organization of vital phenomena (structural and functional) are distinguished: biosphere-biogeocenotic, population-specific, organismic, organ, tissue, cellular, molecular.  The latter studies the role of molecules that are biologically important in the development and growth of organisms, in the transfer and storage of hereditary information, in the conversion of energy and metabolism in living cells, etc. We are talking about the following molecules: lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides and other </p><h2>  Cell level </h2><p>  The cellular level involves consideration of the structural organization of a single cell.  The doctrine of it is called cytology, which includes cytochemistry, cytogenetics, cytophysiology, cytomorphology.  This doctrine allows us to establish structural-functional and physiological-biochemical bonds observed in various organs and tissues between cells. </p>

    <h2>  Population and species level </h2><p>  We proceed to consider the next level, population-specific.  It is fundamentally different from the previous one.  The life expectancy of individual individuals is genetically determined.  After some time, they die, having exhausted the possibilities of their development.  However, in the presence of suitable environmental conditions, their combination as a whole is capable of developing indefinitely.  The subject of ecology, phenology, morphology, genetics is the study of the dynamics and composition of the <span>population.</span>  <span>A population</span> is a collection of individuals of a certain species that have a common gene pool and live in a certain space with approximately the same living conditions at the organismic, cellular and molecular levels. </p>

    <h2>  Biology methods </h2><p>  We now describe the <span>research methods</span> that this science uses.  The first of these is observation.  Using it, you can describe and analyze various biological phenomena.  Another method is based on it - descriptive.  In order to understand the essence of a particular phenomenon, it is first necessary to collect factual material.  After you need to describe it. </p><p>  Another important method is historical.  Using it, you can identify the patterns of occurrence and development of an organism, study the formation of its functions and structure. </p><p>  The experimental method is based on creating a system in a targeted way.  With its help, you can explore the phenomena and properties of wildlife. </p><p>  The last method that we characterize is modeling.  It is the study of a certain phenomenon by creating its model. </p><p>  So, the subject, tasks and methods of biology we have described.  In conclusion, we will talk about the importance of this science. </p><h2>  The importance of biology </h2><p>  Of course, it plays an important role in shaping our worldview, as well as understanding the fundamental philosophical and methodological problems.  In addition, it is of great practical importance (it gives a solution to the food problem, recommendations for pest control, etc.).  In particular, in order to meet the human needs for food, it is necessary to sharply increase the volume of agricultural production.  Such sciences as animal husbandry and crop production deal with this task.  They are based on the achievements of selection and genetics. </p><p>  Knowledge of the laws of variability and heredity allows you to create more and more productive breeds of domestic animals and cultivars.  This allows humanity to farm intensively, not extensively.  Thanks to all this, the needs of people in food resources are satisfied.  Achievements in biology are used in medicine, as well as in environmental protection. </p><p>  As you can see, the goal and objectives of the science of biology are very important from a practical point of view.  Thanks to her achievements, mankind has made significant progress. </p>
