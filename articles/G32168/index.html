How long does the journey take?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many roads have been laid from the glorious capital of the Russian Federation to the ancient city of Kiev, spread on two banks of the Dnieper.  In order to find out how many kilometers to Kiev from Moscow, you need to determine the type of transport that is preferable for overcoming a short journey.  Consider the main modes of transportation, and consider the advantages and disadvantages of all of them. </p><h2>  Airways from Moscow to Kiev </h2><p>  Flight from one capital to another is the fastest way to overcome the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How many kilometers to Kiev from Moscow" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19064/373494.jpg" width="400"></div>  In addition, based on the axiom that the shortest way from point A to point B is a straight line, and the air way to get to Kiev implies just such a line, we inevitably conclude that this route is also the shortest.  How many kilometers to Kiev from Moscow when moving by air?  Answer: a little over seven hundred and twenty kilometers.  Given the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKiev itself, which is about eight hundred and fifty kilometers, these are mere trifles.  The distance from Moscow to Kiev is covered by plane in an hour and a half.

    <p>  The most common route is the route ‚ÄúMoscow-Obnensk-Zhizdra-Bypass highway <span>Bryansk-highway Bryansk-Gomel-the</span> border of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus-Chernigov-Kiev. </p><p>  How many kilometers to Kiev from Moscow?  This route is 970 kilometers and is the longest.  Gasoline is calculated based on the amount of liters consumed by this individual car.  The distance from Moscow to Kiev is covered in 10-15 hours, depending on the time spent on customs, the number of stops for a snack, and the speed of movement directly. </p><h2>  ... and a little about the final destination </h2><p>  Whatever route and mode of transport is preferred, universal for all cases is the recommendation to set the clock back an hour, since the time difference between Kiev and Moscow is exactly one hour.  The Ukrainian currency is the hryvnia.  It is about four Russian rubles. </p><p>  In general, Ukrainians are not much different from Russians - both in appearance and manners, so that, having arrived in distant Kiev, the Russian person will not feel much difference with their homeland. </p>
