What are the types of societies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will talk about what is the multivariance of <span>social development.</span>  Revolutions and reforms are the first things we have to get to know.  Forward! </p><h2>  The reform </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth saying that the multivariance of social development is all the ways in which different societies develop.  It is no secret that the development of society cannot be linear, because of which there is a sufficient number of different groups that are very different from each other.  The nature of social development can take two main forms: reform and revolution.  Let's dwell on the first. </p><p>  So what is reform?  From the Latin language, this word translates as "transform."  Reform is a method of social transformation, which is being implemented gradually, through the successive change of individual elements.  A characteristic feature is that they do not violate any basic norms.  Reforms can be progressive and regressive.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to predict in advance.  Obviously, the first type of change brings benefits to society now or in the future (for example, the great reforms of Alexander II), and the second - harm (for example, the counter-reforms of Alexander III).  It is worthwhile to understand that progressive reforms allow society to take a step forward in its development, while regressive or reactionary ones return society to a previous stage of development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multivariance of social development" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1675276.jpg" width="472"></div>

Of course, they can be distinguished much more, but the basic ones are only these three: political, economic and social.  The former are aimed at some transformations in the political life of society (changing laws, expanding rights, modernizing the electoral system, etc.).  The latter are aimed at transforming the economic aspect, that is, everything related to the management of the economy (antitrust law, excise taxes, private business, etc.).  Social reforms are aimed at society itself.  They make it possible to improve or complicate people's lives (changing retirement age, social protection, providing jobs, etc.). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multivariance of social development types of societies" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1675275.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  Reforms can be carried out in all spheres of society, for there is nothing that does not give in to changes.  They can have insignificant consequences, but can lead to a change in the social system or a change in power: reforms of Peter I, reforms of the 90s of the last century in Russia, etc. </p><h2>  Revolution </h2><p>  The multivariance of social development is not only reform, but also revolution.  From Latin this word is translated as ‚Äúcoup‚Äù.  It can be said that revolution is the opposite of reform.  It implies a qualitative and quantitative change in many or even all areas of society, which is achieved by decisive action.  Most often, these are coups and riots, which have long-term consequences.  Revolutions can be long-term and short-term.  The former can last a very long time: for example, the Neolithic revolution.  The second lasts up to a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multivariance of social development is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1675272.jpg" width="524"></div>

Currently, concepts such as revolution or reform are being supplanted by the word ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù.  What it is?  This is a small one-time improvement that maximizes something to the limit in the created conditions.  You can also often find such a thing as ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù.  Sociologists closely associate the development of societies with this term, because it means a transition from something traditional to a newer, more developed and more perfect one.  There are two theories of modernization: </p><ul><li>  Primary, which is based on the type of development of Western capitalism. </li><li>  Secondary, which means the crowding out of identity and the introduction of uniqueness in the Western style.  Sometimes this theory is called the theory of direct borrowing, or westernization. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The multivariance of social development: a typology of societies </h2><p>  Most often, societies are classified according to four basic criteria: writing, the number of management levels, level of development, and formation characteristics.  According to the first criterion, written and preliterate types of society are distinguished.  In the second (the number of levels of government, differentiation of society) - simple (in which there is no distinction between ordinary people and power, between rich and poor) and complex (multi-stage management system, there is a stratification of society) societies.  In terms of development, any of them can be developed, developing or backward.  Formational attribute classifies societies as follows: </p><ul><li>  A classless society that includes primitive communities and a communist society. </li><li>  <span>Class society,</span> which includes slaveholding, feudal and capitalist societies. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Marx's Formational Approach </h2><p>  What could be the multivariance of social development?  What is this - we already know, but to answer the question of what it can be, it is possible with the help of special approaches.  There are several of them, but we will consider two - civilizational and formational.  The latter was developed by Karl Marx and <span>Friedrich Engels.</span> </p><p>  The key concept in their approach is the socio-economic formation.  To summarize, it turns out that this is the same as society - a society that is at a certain stage of development and is considered in the unity of its production and economic forces, over which there must be an add-on.  It represents a certain ideology or belief system inherent in the whole society, and plays a crucial role in the formation of public opinion, and is also closely intertwined with economic postulates.  There must also be a certain basis, which represents a certain economic system, independent of entities that enter into economic relations. </p><p>  In the theory of Marx, an important place is occupied by productive forces ‚Äî people and means of production that possess the necessary knowledge or skills.  The add-in is selected depending on which basis was selected.  The latter determines the basis of the formation and solves the issue of belonging of a society to one or another type. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multivariance of social development is a definition" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1675274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Civilization approach </h2><p>  What is the multivariance of social development?  This definition in the civilizational approach has a number of differences from the first approach considered: </p><ul><li>  The object of research is not a type of economic system, but a society of individuals that develops depending on their needs and interests. </li><li>  A person is considered not only as a productive resource, but also as a person with his moral, moral and social principles. </li><li>  Different spheres of society are equal (politician, culture, law, economics).  Economic development does not play a dominant role. </li></ul><h2>  The multivariance of social development: types of societies </h2><p>  There are three main types of societies: </p><ol><li>  The traditional, in which the main factor of production is the land.  It itself is aimed at obtaining food and is carried out through manual individual labor.  Agriculture in such a society occupies about 80%.  Man lives 40-50 years.  Characteristics: closed social systems, there is no contact with other countries, low social mobility. </li><li>  Industrial, in which industry and capital accumulation come first.  Society becomes controlled, relations with other states are being established, the rule of law is proclaimed. </li><li>  Post-industrial, in which knowledge and services have value.  The level of labor automation sharply increases, and life expectancy increases (more than 70 years).  Society remains controlled, political pluralism arises, and democracy develops. </li></ol>

    <p>  As we see, the multivariance of social development (the types of societies we examined above) has many differences.  Not all countries today have switched to a post-industrial form.  What can the states remaining at the industrial stage do?  To make a plan.  The multivariance of social development will allow you to choose the necessary development strategy for the coming years in order to switch to the post-industrial type. </p>
