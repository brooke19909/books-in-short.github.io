    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the western part of Crete, there is such a large city as Chania.  This is not only an interesting place from a historical point of view, but also a resort popular in our time.  The town of Agia Marina-Nea Kidon belongs to the prefecture of Chania.  This is where the CHC Galini Sea View 5 * is located.  This complex is located on a hill, so you need to go down to the sea.  But still, the path will take a little strength and only two minutes. </p><p>  At a distance of 4-7 kilometers are several interesting sights.  For example, the church of Agios Dimitrios, the Franciscan monastery of St. Fragkiskos, the municipal garden, the golden beach, the archaeological museum of Chania and much more.  By the way, the airport is also nearby.  It is located 10 kilometers from Chania. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the most important thing is Daratso beach, which is the highlight of the resort and the most beautiful in the whole bay. </p><h2>  What is available in the hotel? </h2><p>  CHC Galini Sea View 5 * is a resort hotel with a well-developed infrastructure.  There is free private parking and Wi-Fi, a business center and a 220-meter conference room with one meeting room, another 24-hour reception and a luggage room for guests.

Another option is the ‚Äúround table‚Äù (100 people) and ‚Äúbanquet‚Äù (180 people).  There is a lobby, an outdoor terrace, surround sound equipment, projection screens.

Near the building there is a beauty salon and a hairdresser. </p><p>  The hotel staff is pleasant and friendly, but speaks only three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- German, Greek and English.  Nobody knows Russian, possibly because this hotel has not yet seen such a strong influx of tourists from the Russian Federation as in other complexes. </p>

From the windows starting from the floor, a panoramic view of the sea or the garden opens (depending on which option the guest chooses).  There is a spacious balcony and terrace.  The bathroom has a hydromassage shower.  And, of course, everything previously listed in the apartment is also available.

Gifts are also awaited for those guests who will have a birthday on one of their vacation days. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  About the rest at CHC Galini Sea View reviews leave exclusively positive.
