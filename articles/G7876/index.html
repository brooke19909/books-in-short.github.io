Reviews about the club recreation in the Guards</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Karelian-Finnish myths tell of a fabulous forest state called Tapiola.  The lord of this country Tapio is a forest god with a gray beard, who patronizes hunters.  This magical place-name is called the recreation center “Tapiola”.  Guards - the village where it is located. </p><p>  The surroundings of the Guards are truly fabulous.  <span>Forest Lake is</span> framed by picturesque rocky shores.  It is surrounded by fir trees with shaggy paws and relict pines, among which enormous boulders were attached, covered with velvety mosses.  In this paradise, the club recreation center “Tapiola” has comfortably settled down with a luxurious hotel, cottages, bathhouses, a water park and a restaurant. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Near Finland, in the place where Vyborg settled, among the everlasting forests of the village of Gvardeyskoye lies the wonderful Lake Forest.  On its picturesque coasts, in a birch grove, which adjoins a pine-spruce massif, the Tapiola hotel complex was hidden.  130 kilometers from the recreation center is St. Petersburg. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  A wonderful hotel complex - recreation center "Tapiola", reviews, in any case, say so.  Those who relaxed there like spacious rooms, a swimming pool with spa, which can be used free of charge in the morning.  A pleasant impression on vacationers is made by boat trips, service and food in the restaurant. </p><p>  According to the guests, the kitchen equipment in the cottages is not up to par, there are too few dishes.  They have a claim to parking.  There is not enough parking space for those who live in the apartments of the base, due to the fact that tourists come during the day who want to use the services of a water park with a spa area. </p>
