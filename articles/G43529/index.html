It is equal to 57 meters, while the deepest station - “Admiralteyskaya” - is at the level of 102 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg metro stations" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1116372.jpg" width="600"></div>  Absolutely all the stations of two lines - Pravoberezhnaya and Frunzensko-Primorskaya - are just that.  60 <span>metro stations of St. Petersburg</span> out of a total of 67 are located at a depth below the average (57 meters).  Only three are located at shallow depths, and all of them are three-span columns.  Four ground stations are indoor.  One of these under the name "Country" refers to forever closed.  She worked from 1966 to 1977, when the trains became six-car.  The length of the platform did not allow them to be received.

    <h2>  The longest platform </h2><p>  There is a closed-type station in the metro with the longest platform that St. Petersburg has - the Moskovskaya metro station.  The platform stretches under the entire Moscow square and has exits on both sides of it - from the Pulkovo highway and from the city center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Petersburg metro station" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1116373.jpg" width="600"></div>  The station is interesting in that it does not have a ground lobby.  Passengers get into the subway through the box office.  Moskovskaya has 52 doors, an equal number on each side of the square.  On November 11, 2015, the station was closed for an hour in the afternoon due to an orphan bag, forgotten by someone on the bench.

Parnas is the northernmost metro station in the entire Russian Federation.  This system of high-speed off-street traffic includes 73 vestibules, 856 turnstiles, 255 escalators, 5 operational depots and one repair depot.  St. Petersburg metro stations are interchange.  There are 7 such nodes in the St. Petersburg metro - 6 two-station and 1 three-station.  The Sadovaya station is an integral part of the only three-station interchange hub in the Northern capital - Spasskaya - Sennaya Ploshchad - Sadovaya. </p><h2>  "Ladoga" </h2><p>  One of the deep-seated stations is the Ladozhskaya metro station.  St. Petersburg is also known throughout the world for the Road of Life, laid in blockade on the ice of Lake Ladoga.  But the station is named after the planned Ladoga station, since it was implied that its ground pavilion will become part of this station.  But the construction of the latter was delayed, and the lobby was erected as a separate building.  However, the interior design of the station is dedicated to the Road of Life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg metro station Moscow" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1116374.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Ladoga (Right Bank Line) is located at a depth of 61 meters, so the escalator that delivers passengers moves 2 minutes 20 seconds.  People leaving the metro get to the <span>Ladoga station,</span> as well as to Karl Faberge Square, Bolshaya Yablonovka and Zanevsky Prospekt.  In the future, it is planned to build the Ladozhskaya-2 station.

They are single-vaulted (such as in the St. Petersburg metro 15), pylon (17), columned (18) and closed-type stations (10).  The longest is the stretch between the two metro stations of St. Petersburg - “Alexander Nevsky Square” and “Elizarovskaya”, equal to 4 kilometers.  The shortest is between the Technological Institute and the Pushkinskaya Institute, equal to 800 meters.  There are cross-platform stations in the St. Petersburg metro - Technological Institute and Sportivnaya.  They are characterized by the ability to switch to another line on the same platform. </p><h2>  “Bypass channel” </h2><p>  In recent years, in both capitals of the Russian Federation, intensive construction of the subway is underway.  Under construction St. Petersburg metro stations are located in all parts of the city.  These include the Bypass Canal, located on Ligovsky Prospekt, at 153. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg metro stations under construction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1116375.jpg" width="500"></div>  On the ground floor of this building is the lobby of the station - the entrance is located on Ligovsky Prospekt, and the exit leads to the Obvodny Canal.  It is planned that by 2017 this station will become a transfer to the new Krasnoselsko-Kalinin line and that the Obvodnoy Canal-2 station will be built in the area of ​​the bus station.

    <h2>  Championship objects </h2><p>  The Admiralteyskaya station is one of the new ones, the grand opening of which took place on December 28, 2011 and marked the end of the largest ambitious construction project in the history of St. Petersburg metro.  The next new metro station in St. Petersburg - Spasskaya - was commissioned on November 7, 2013.  The Bukharestskaya, Mezhdunarodnaya, Prospect of Glory, Danube, Shushary stations and the lobby of Sportivnaya-2 station are planned to be commissioned by 2018.  Also, according to plans for the development of the metro of the Northern capital, it is planned to open a section of the Right-Bank Line (4th) from Spasskaya to Mining Institute by 2018.  Between them will be the "Theater". </p><h2>  The implementation of ambitious plans </h2><p>  The 3rd line of the St. Petersburg metro will be extended - Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya - from the Primorskaya station to the Begovoy station.  In 2020, it is planned to begin construction of the 6th metro line of St. Petersburg.  And by 2025, along with a significant extension of the existing lines (the “red” branch will extend all the way to Pulkovo), it is still planned to put in place the ring line, the construction of which has been in limbo since 1980. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New metro station St. Petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1116376.jpg" width="600"></div>  Separately, it should be noted that only in the Northern capital there is a tunnel going to the new Shushary station (Frunze radius), in which two tracks will be located.  This is a completely new project for the Russian metro, costing the city 30 million euros, tentatively called "Hope".
