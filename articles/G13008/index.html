In 1899, Pyotr Arkadyevich became first a county, and then the provincial leader of the Coven nobility.  In 1902 he was appointed the governor of Grodno, and in 1903 he accepted the <span>Saratov province.</span>

    <p>  During the revolutionary unrest of the peasants in 1905, he energetically and harshly suppresses speeches, while showing personal courage.  Partly due to the fact that against the background of the revolution, Pyotr Arkadyevich was able to ensure a relative order in his province, in April 1906 he received the post of Minister of the Interior, and in July of that year he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers.  Stolypin‚Äôs biography says that in August he was committed the first assassination attempt, as a result of which his daughter and son were injured.  There have been eleven in their entire lives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having received his posts, Stolypin energetically takes up the job.  A revolution is rampant in the country.  First, the official introduces the military field courts, which carried out the proceedings in 48 hours, and brought the sentence to execution - in 24 hours.  According to statistics, in the period from August 1906 to April 1907, 1102 people were sentenced to death, and the gallows began to be called "Stolypin ties."  Subsequently, Soviet historiographers and propagandists strongly condemned these measures and branded Stolypin as a bloody obscurantist.  However, for comparison, in 1937 681 692 death sentences were carried out in the USSR, and in the period 1961-1962 (calmer Khrushchev times) - about 4 thousand. </p>

    <p>  One of the statesmen of the Russian Empire, who was greatly concerned about the level of efficiency and the state of agriculture, was Peter Stolypin.  His biography is largely interesting thanks to the comprehensive agrarian reform that he began to carry out.  Pyotr Arkadevich believed that the problem lies not in the ‚Äúland hunger‚Äù, but in the low productivity of the peasants, as well as in the existing communal way of managing.  He wanted to resolve the situation without affecting the land ownership of the landowners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the elimination of community restrictions, the land should naturally have become the property of peasants strong in the economic plan, with the consolidation of all rights.  Ruined peasants had to be employed in industry or resettled on the outskirts of the state.  The reform also included the elimination of tear-streaks, lending and subsidizing peasant farms, assistance in the redemption of private land, agronomic consultations, the use of fertilizers, etc. </p>

Overall, his reform failed.  Perhaps due to the fact that he was simply not allowed to finish it.  Pyotr Arkadevich was killed by a terrorist in 1911.  However, the private results of his activities are impressive.  In the period 1906-1915, about a quarter of households left the community.  By 1915, they accounted for about half of the grain produced in Russia.  A negative role was played by the systemic attacks on Stolypin by Nicholas II and his entourage, as well as by open hostility with Rasputin, which aroused hostility towards the statesman from the empress.  It is believed that the obstacles "from above" that repaired Stolypin only brought closer the bloody upheavals of 1917.
