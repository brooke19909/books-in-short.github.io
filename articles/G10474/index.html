Of course not!  It is inconvenient to heat water for tea or coffee in a saucepan.  You have to wait a long time until it boils, and after that you still need to pour it into the cup without spilling it.  In a word, life without a kettle is much more complicated.  A wide variety of models are on sale: for conventional gas stoves, induction, as well as electrical appliances.  The latter is convenient to use not only at home, but also in offices or other workrooms. </p><p>  Electric kettles appeared a very long time ago.  Almost all well-known household appliances companies are engaged in their production.  Thanks to such competition, new technologies are developed every year that allow not only to boil water quickly, but also to keep it warm for a long time.  An <span>electric kettle</span> with a temperature regulator has such an opportunity.  The device sets a certain temperature for heating water, that is, it is not necessary to constantly bring it to a boil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric kettle with thermostat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1520991.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of teapots with a temperature regulator </h2><p>  At first glance, it is difficult to imagine how you can improve a conventional electric kettle.  However, as it turned out, there is no limit to perfection.  Conventional models are designed only for boiling water.  When the liquid reaches a temperature of 100 ° C, the device automatically turns off.  And if necessary, only warm up the water will have to be turned off independently.  This is inconvenient, since it is extremely difficult to guess the temperature.  For these purposes, special thermostats have been developed.  It is these devices that control the degree of heating of the liquid.  And, importantly, the device not only automatically turns off when the set temperature is reached, but also turns on periodically to maintain it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An electric kettle with a thermostat has many advantages.  With its help, you can significantly save the time spent on boiling the liquid, and reduce energy costs. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, all devices have disadvantages.  If we consider an ordinary <span>kettle for a gas stove,</span> then the maximum that will happen to it is the formation of rust or peeling of enamel.  But an electric kettle with a temperature controller can cause big problems.  For example, if you forget to turn it off from the mains, then during the day it will turn on and off periodically, which will lead to additional electricity costs.  Also, many buyers noticed that the thermostat often fails.  Its replacement or repair will require investment.  This criterion is quite weighty, since these models of dummies are much more expensive than usual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric kettle with temperature regulator" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1520982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wide range of features </h2><p>  An electric kettle with a temperature regulator is a device that will suit gourmets and connoisseurs of tea traditions.  Indeed, in order to prepare a truly high-quality drink, you can not use boiling water.  If you brew tea with a liquid heated to 100 ° C, then it loses almost all its properties.  Gourmets know that each variety requires a specific temperature regime.  For example, green tea - 80 ° C, hibiscus - 70 ° C, plain black - 90 ° C.  How to create optimal conditions?  How to quickly and easily control the degree of heating of water?  Only purchase an electric kettle with a thermostat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These models are also useful to mothers with young children.  After all, some mixtures must be diluted only with a liquid heated to 40 ° C.  It is in this case that you can be sure that all the useful properties of baby food will be preserved in full. </p><p>  It is useful for those wishing to purchase such a device to know that almost all models are equipped with protection systems (from overheating, switching on without water), a filter that prevents scale from entering the cup, an indicator of the amount of liquid and automatic shutdown.  And some devices even reproduce a characteristic sound signal. </p><h2>  How to choose an electric kettle? </h2><p>  Before you purchase an electric kettle with a thermostat, you need to familiarize yourself with the most important points. </p><ul><li>  <em>Power</em> .  This indicator affects the speed of heating water.  For example, for home use, the best option would be a device with a power of 1.5-2.2 kW.  In cafes or offices, where there are always a lot of people, it is better to pick up a 3 kW kettle. </li><li>  <em>Capacity</em> .  The optimal size of the kettle's capacity varies from 1 to 3 liters.  For example, a family of 2-3 people should opt for 1.5-1.7 liters.  For numerous teams, 2-3 liter models are suitable.  A large volume is not recommended, since it will take a lot of time to heat it. </li><li>  <em>Manufacturer</em>  Which company is better than electric kettles with a temperature controller?  There is no definite answer to this question.  Of course, it is better to choose products of well-known brands with a good reputation.  The most popular brands will be considered a little later. </li><li>  <em>Thermostat</em> .  Currently, kettles are equipped with two types of devices: stepless and step.  There is not much difference in them.  The only difference is in the way the temperature is changed: stepless - smoothly, stepwise - step by step (discrete). </li><li>  <em>Heating element</em> .  Previously, manufacturers installed an open spiral in electric kettles.  Its use is currently minimized.  Modern models are usually equipped with a closed heating element.  It is located under a flat disc made of stainless metal or aluminum. </li><li>  <em>Body material</em> .  Manufacturers currently offer a large selection.  Modern models are made of different materials: plastic, stainless steel, ceramics and glass.  There are also combined options, for example, the Bosch electric kettle with a temperature regulator (TWK 8611/8613/8617 series).  It harmoniously, and most importantly, practically combines metal and plastic. </li></ul><h2>  Electrolux </h2><p>  Electrolux EEWA 7800 - an electric kettle with a capacity of 1.7 liters.  It is equipped with a network cable 75 cm long. There is a special compartment for its storage.  The case is made of stainless steel.  A power of 2.4 kW provides fast heating of the water.  There is a mesh filter that cleans water from scale.  The kettle has a display and five operating modes (80 ° C, 85 ° C, 90 ° C, 95 ° C, 100 ° C).  The temperature is adjustable in the range from 50 ° C to 100 ° C.  Management is carried out using buttons.  There is an automatic shutdown, it also works when removed from the base.  This model uses OneCup Turbo technology.  Thanks to it, you can quickly boil a small volume of water (200 ml). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In most cases, reviews about the device are positive.  The assembly is high-quality and reliable.  However, during the boiling of water, the case becomes very hot, there is a chance of getting burned.  During operation, it emits a characteristic noise that stops only after a shutdown.  Shutdown is accompanied by a squeak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glass electric kettle with temperature regulator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1520946.jpg" width="513"></div>
