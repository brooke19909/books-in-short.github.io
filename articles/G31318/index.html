  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Credit system reform and population income</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The rapidly changing needs of users are forcing providers of banking services to expand the range of services, to seek new solutions that increase household incomes that meet the needs of each consumer.  When it comes to improving the work of the bank, it is necessary, first of all, to ensure the competitiveness of the offered lending services and to compare the <span>real incomes of the</span> population.  The Bank needs to be more careful in analyzing the creditworthiness of the client, monitoring the intended use of the loan, the proper execution of loan security, etc. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the current situation of the country's development, there are a number of problems that determine the condition of the bank as a whole, and in particular its credit operations to individuals.  To solve them, it is necessary to develop a more effective legislative, regulatory and methodological framework developed by both the bank itself and the Central Bank. </p><p>  The main and main goal of the financial manager is to increase the wealth of the company owners, and the purpose of the entire banking system is to ensure that the incomes of the Russian population are such as to ensure adequate satisfaction of all social needs. </p><p>  For any bank, control over the repayment of loans received is the basis of the <span>credit policy of a</span> commercial bank. </p><p>  An analysis of the dynamics of consumer lending over the past few years has shown a steady increase in the volume of this type of service, however, with the onset of the financial crisis in the United States, many banks faced the problem of attracting foreign credit resources, which immediately affected lending volumes and, of course, affected household incomes.  Tighter requirements for borrowers, temporary moratoriums on certain types of lending, and interest rates have led to a steady decline in lending to individuals throughout the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the promising types of consumer lending is corporate lending, in which individuals are granted loans for various consumer purposes under the guarantee of the employer, which can significantly affect the income of the population and their structure.  Another important aspect of improving the mechanism of consumer lending, which determines the income of the population, is the development of relations between the bank and insurance companies and the transition from property and life insurance of the borrower to insurance directly of the risk of loan defaults when lending to the population.  This <span>form of insurance</span> provides a reliable guarantee to the bank in the form of obtaining an insurance policy, and also makes the borrower more carefully weigh their ability to repay loans on time.  In addition, in order to ensure sustainable economic growth, the <span>bank</span> needs to expand the range of <span>bank loans</span> for the population, improve the quality of the risk management system in terms of assessing creditworthiness, improve the quality of credit services, reduce bank loan rates, stimulate an increase in the share of household deposits in banks through deposits to increase credit potential of commercial banks. </p><p>  As a rule, the main alternative form of saving is the purchase of freely convertible foreign currency and its subsequent deposit.  The profitability of a foreign currency purchase transaction is the sum of the rate of change of the ruble exchange rate and interest rates on deposits in this currency. </p><p>  Currently, banks offer different types of deposits, both in rubles and in foreign currency.  Basically, the term of the deposit is up to one year, and on a longer-term basis, up to 3 years.  A wide variety <span>of deposit rates</span> are also offered <span>.</span>  These can be fixed rates, floating, with <span>capitalization of interest,</span> with a monthly payment, with a quarterly payment at the request of depositors. </p><p>  The population increasingly trusts the banking system and often prefers to invest free money in the bank on various deposits in national and foreign currencies, as this allows you to receive <span>additional income</span> from the deferred money.  However, the existing system of guaranteeing funds raised by banks is quite complex.  She is still far from the completion of her formation. </p>
