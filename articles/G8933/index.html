What features of each model should I pay attention to?  Answering all these questions is not so simple.  There is a truth for everyone.  Nevertheless, according to statistics, there are unrivaled leaders among manufacturers of washing machines for the home.  Who is it about?  And what tips and tricks will help to dwell on a particular model of technology? </p><h2>  By type of download </h2><p>  Initially, you should dwell on several key points.  They will help you choose a specific model of washing household appliances without regard to the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What brand of washing machine is the most reliable" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620498.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The type of load of linen is the first thing that a buyer should decide on.  The thing is <span>that there are models</span> with vertical loading, there is a front.  Each option has a number of advantages. </p><p>  If you are wondering which brand of washing machine is the most reliable, it is worth considering that the leaders usually have high quality front and vertical models.  What are the benefits of each type of download? </p><p>  Choosing the front model is the easiest.  It is of this type that washing machines are often found.  The drum is located in front of the device.  Such units have a lower cost, are convenient for housewives, they can be built into furniture.  Front-loading washing machines are generally shorter in height.  But a similar technique is more cumbersome.  It does not support the possibility of reloading linen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>A top-loading washing machine</span> is less common in the goods market.  It is compact but tall.  During washing it is allowed to load things.  Such models are usually not too cheap.  Therefore, they are not so often preferred. </p><h2>  About capacity </h2><p>  We continue to give advice on <span>choosing a washing machine.</span>  The next criterion is capacity.  It is measured in kilograms.  This parameter is considered one of the most important when choosing household appliances for washing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which washing machine company is the most reliable" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620499.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Some parameters of the device, its dimensions (width), depend on the capacity.  Preference should be given to those models that fit into the allotted space.  To do this, pre-measured places under the washing machine. </p><p>  What brand of washing machine is the most reliable?  The rating of manufacturers does not depend on capacity.  In practice, preference is given to washing machines with a capacity of about 5-6 kilograms.  This is ideal for families with children. </p><p>  Another caveat: the wider the washing machine, the quieter it works.  Narrow models are more prone to vibrations, more often noise.  These features are usually forgotten.  And after installing the "washer" it turns out that the device is working too loud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Spin, Wash, Energy Saving </h2><p>  The following important components are the spin, wash and energy saving classes.  What are these parameters for?  What is the best choice? </p><p>  The spin class is how well the washing machine will spin the laundry.  To date, the highest rate is marked with the letter "A".  It makes about 1400-2000 revolutions. </p><p>  In practice, about 1200 rpm is enough to keep the laundry dry at the end of the wash.  Yes, on most models you can adjust this parameter, but you will have to overpay for a larger number of revolutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="german washing machines" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620500.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  A washing class is how well the device launders things.  As with spin, the higher the indicator, the better.  Today, all manufacturers of washing machines offer class "A".  This is the highest rate.  Even budget models are endowed with such a characteristic.  Therefore, the washing class is usually not given enough attention. </p><p>  Energy conservation also plays a very important role.  Especially for families where it is planned to wash a lot.  It is recommended to give preference to devices with a higher rate of energy conservation.  In practice, such cars are more expensive, but this is a reasonable waste. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Washing programs </h2><p>  If you want to choose the most good and convenient technique for washing clothes and things, you will have to pay attention to washing programs.  Now all manufacturers of such household appliances offer approximately the same opportunities in this area. </p><p>  Sometimes it may seem that the choice of washing programs is huge, it can be easily confused.  In fact, the hostesses mainly use the following modes: </p><ul><li>  cotton; </li><li>  Kids' things; </li><li>  handwash; </li><li>  synthetics; </li><li>  delicate things; </li><li>  wool; </li><li>  quick wash. </li></ul><p>  In the selected model of "washer" should be all of these programs.  All other features are usually ignored.  It is recommended to dwell on a specific model based on what things prevail in the house and in the wardrobe of the family. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Some buyers say that the appearance <span>of the washing machine</span> is an important nuance for them <span>.</span>  Accordingly, preference is given to manufacturing companies that are able to surprise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine tips" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620501.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you look closely, then each model of the washing machine has its own characteristics.  Often Samsung offers devices for every taste.  Nevertheless, if you want to find out which brand of washing machine is the most reliable, it is not recommended to look at the appearance of the equipment.  It often happens that an attractive look is acquired due to damage to the quality of the wash or the operation of the equipment. </p><h2>  Leading Manufacturers </h2><p>  And what brand of washing machine is the most reliable?  This is the most difficult question of all.  As already mentioned, everyone has their own view on each company producing home appliances.  Therefore, it is very difficult to name the leaders. </p><p>  If you look closely at the statistics and the results of the polls, then most often the preference is given to the following brands: </p><ul><li>  Siemens </li><li>  Miele. </li><li>  BOSCH. </li></ul><p>  These manufacturers are considered the best.  Moreover, regardless of the model of the washing machine. </p><p>  It should be noted that Siemens and Bosch are German washing machines.  This technique is recommended to be preferred by many experts.  By the way, the country of origin also leaves its mark on the quality of the device.  What can be said about this? </p><h2>  Around the country </h2><p>  It's no secret that in Russia there are more and more things from China.  This applies not only to clothing and gadgets, but also to large household appliances for the home.  Therefore, experts advise when choosing washing machines to pay attention to the country of origin.  And only then to a specific company. </p><p>  The best models of the studied equipment are German.  Washing machines from Germany are distinguished by their quality and durability.  They rarely break.  The development and creation of such equipment is carried out by experienced specialists who think about the comfort of use and the quality of the devices. </p><p>  But other countries are not recommended to be trusted.  The thing is that in these countries the quality of production is lower than in Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warranty period for a washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620502.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Korean washing machines are not that bad either.  In Russia, some Italian models of equipment are in demand.  Yes, such devices are inferior to the "Germans", but they still allow you to wash for a long time and without difficulty. </p><h2>  Rating of washing machines </h2><p>  It‚Äôs already clear which washing machine company is the most reliable.  Nevertheless, the list of leaders does not end on the list above.  In Russia, many manufacturers are in demand.  Among them, as already mentioned, you can find both Korean devices and Italian. </p><p>  If you look at some statistics, you will notice that after the leaders listed above, consumers give preference to manufacturers with the following names: </p><ol><li>  <em>LG.</em>  Korean brainchild, well-established in the goods market.  It features a variety of models.  LG washing machines can be found for every taste and at different prices.  The manufacturer has both budget models and expensive. </li><li>  <em>Samsung</em>  Another Korean manufacturer.  Like LG, it has a wide selection of models.  Buyers note that the appearance of such a technique does not leave indifferent.  At Samsung, most devices are of quality.  Repair the washing machine in case of breakdown is not difficult.  There will be models from inexpensive, but functional to expensive "premium" class. </li><li>  <em>Ariston</em>  Italian manufacturer of washing machines.  He has reliable <span>narrow washing machines</span> for everyone.  Today, similar equipment is assembled in Russia. </li><li>  <em>Indesit.</em>  A company that produces washing machines similar to Ariston.  Experts say that Ariston is often understood as "Indesit".  After all, these washing machines are assembled in similar factories from the same components. </li><li>  <em>ARDO.</em>  One of the best companies working in Italy.  Typically, the models of this manufacturer are quiet and stable.  The design and prices are also pleasing.  Only a reliable vertical washing machine (or any other is not so important) is unlikely to be from ARDO.  Experts note that this organization often breaks the fasteners that ensure the stability of the structure.  Tank suspension and electronics also leave much to be desired. </li><li>  <em>Zanussi.</em>  An Italian brainchild that has earned the praise of many people.  It is noted that "Zanussi" (washing machine) is a technique that will last a long time.  But it is different.  Experts divide washing machines into 2 categories: produced before 2011 and after.  Early models deserve special attention.  They are not inferior to German manufacturers in the quality of washing and work.  What else can be said about Zanussi?  A washing machine of this production, released after 2011, will most likely disappoint.  Some call the new Zanussi a symbiosis of Chinese, Russian, Italian, German and other components, the work of which is difficult to predict. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps these are all the most common manufacturing companies.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of model the device will be, with front or vertical loading.  The main thing is that the advantages and disadvantages of all manufacturers will be reflected in each technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine manufacturers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620503.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Service Center Reviews </h2><p>  So, as already clear, a reliable washing machine can be found in the store.  Automatic or not - not so important.  What do workers of service centers of household appliances say about modern manufacturers?  They can give the most accurate assessment and statistics of customer complaints. </p><p>  If you believe the employees of various repair services of washing machines in Moscow, then Ariston and Indesit in recent years began to use low-quality components.  In particular, on boards installed to control devices.  After some time, the new washing machines from Ariston and Indesit begin to "blink like Christmas trees."  Devices are repaired quickly, but similar incidents still deliver some discomfort. </p><p>  Electrolux is a manufacturer that doesn‚Äôt supply the most shock-resistant washing machines.  If you connect the device to a power outlet with more than 230 Volts or less than 200, it starts to ‚Äúfail‚Äù.  Some believe that washing machines fail.  However, when connected to normal voltage, the problem disappears.  In addition, this manufacturer does not differ in the quality of other components. </p><p>  Not too often have to deal with washing machines from Kandy.  Recently, this manufacturer uses very high quality components.  In the market for goods, Candy has established itself in a very good light.  If you need a compact washing machine, it is Kandy that allows you to choose an inexpensive and high-quality model. </p><p>  We cannot ignore the fact that most manufacturers of washing machines today have the same components.  For example, to "Kandy" include Hoover, Iberna, Zoppas.  To "Electrolux" - "Zanussi" and AEG.  Etc.  Therefore, to predict which washing machine company is the most reliable is not so simple.  In most cases, the washing quality and reliability of devices are the same for different corporations. </p><h2>  Summary and Conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to choose the right washing machine.  Which manufacturers to prefer?  This question is also no longer a secret.  In fact, all firms have successful models and not very. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reliable narrow washing machines" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1620504.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the warranty on the washing machine has not expired, and the device has already delivered a lot of trouble to the buyer, you can either exchange it or repair it.  Employees of service centers assure that the choice of the studied equipment must be approached wisely.  A washing machine with excellent quality lasts about 5-10 years, and if you're lucky, then longer. </p><p>  Among other things, before buying a specific model of the device it is recommended to study customer reviews about it.  It is consumers, not employees of service centers, who can emphasize some of the features. </p><p>  All of these tips and tricks will help you make the right choice.  In practice, BOSCH, Electrolux and Samsung appliances are often purchased, mainly due to the availability and variety of models.  Where is better to buy a washing machine?  In specialized stores of household appliances.  On the Internet, ordering such machines is not recommended. </p>
