Volodarsky, who was fatally assassinated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe construction of the future bridge in 1918.  Hundreds of workers came to lead the revolutionary on their last journey to the <span>Field of Mars.</span>  Later, in 1925, a monument to Volodarsky was erected at the scene of the murder, created by architect V.V. Vitman and sculptor M.G. Manizer.  The Volodarsky Bridge is the only bridge in <span>St. Petersburg</span> with an overpass extension for trams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volodarsky bridge" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10680/22782.jpg" width="444"></div>

    <p>  In the 30s, in connection with the new design of the south-eastern part of Leningrad with a ring transport highway, the need arose to build a permanent bridge.  The project was developed by an engineering team led by Professor G.P. Perederiy, which also included specialists V.I. Kryzhanovsky, K.M. Dmitriev and A.S. Nikolsky.  The Volodarsky Bridge was a three-span reinforced concrete arched structure with a lower passage, with an average metal adjustable span and two transport interchanges with both banks of the Neva.  According to the constructive solution, the bridge scheme was brought closer to the Bolsheokhtinsky bridge.  For the construction of arched structures of the side spans of the bridge structure, metal pipes filled with concrete were first used.  The adjustable span was blocked by trusses, in the connection of which welding was used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

It was one of the most beautiful bridge structures in Leningrad.  Traffic on the Volodarsky bridge was opened on November 7, 1936.  Its construction was one of the first major projects of the Soviet era with a number of architectural and technological innovations.  The scheme, which later became the model for <span>Moscow bridges, was</span> first implemented in this project.  In fact, the bridge was 325 m long and 27.4 m wide. During the Great Patriotic War, the Volodarsky Bridge was used as a backup of the Finland Railway Bridge for transporting rolling stock between the <span>banks of the Neva.</span>

    <p>  From 1970 to 1971, some parts of the bridge were reconstructed, which are outdated since their commissioning.  Subsequent repairs were carried out between 1987 and 1993. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volodarsky bridge divorce" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10680/22785.jpg" width="333"></div>  Volodarsky <span>Bridge (St. Petersburg),</span> after its commissioning in 1993, had significant bandwidth.  Many large vessels now have the opportunity to pass under the bridge without wiring the central span.

    <p>  In 2008, the reconstruction of the bridge was carried out to strengthen the metal structures of stationary spans. <br>  The Volodarsky Bridge, whose divorce is carried out together with other drawbridges of the city, attracts spectators and romantics every night.  The construction of bridges in St. Petersburg takes place in the summer during the white nights season, when the city is especially beautiful.  At this time, bridges are being built over the Neva for passing ships.  This is done in a sequential order, starting from the Gulf of Finland and from the Volodarsky bridge to the center. </p>
