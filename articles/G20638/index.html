How to choose a wireless parking sensors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The conditions of a close metropolis force many motorists to turn to electronic assistants to facilitate the process of driving a car.  One of the most difficult operations is parking maneuvering.  The need for outside help in such a situation arises not only for beginners - often experienced drivers, due to additional factors and interference, experience certain difficulties in controlling the dimensions of the car.  In any case, wireless parking sensors provide effective support of this kind.  The response of the average motorist about such systems has a positive connotation.  Owners note the advantages of the system in the form of functionality, ergonomics and accuracy of determining the position of the machine.  However, there are also disadvantages to wireless models. </p>

    <h2>  Features of wireless parking sensors </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that any parking sensors include sensors that determine the distance to surrounding objects due to the ultrasonic signal.  After indicating third-party interference, the detector sends a signal to the <span>head unit,</span> informing about the current position of the on-board computer and the driver.  In traditional systems, this signal is transmitted via wires.  In this case, the use of a radio frequency channel is provided, on the basis of which the sensor and wireless parking sensors are connected.  A review of such a bundle most often indicates the convenience of its use, since there is no need for laying wires.  Actually, this is the main difference between the wireless models of parking sensors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2>

    <p>  To begin with, you should determine how important the coverage of the car with the sensor system is.  Rather, how extensive in terms of control a wireless parking sensor should be - 8 sensors, for example, provide the maximum indication of the dimensions of the machine.  Sensors will be located behind and in front, fully controlling the position of the car relative to surrounding objects.  However, even if there is a need for increased support from the electronics, one should also take into account the disadvantage of using a large number of sensors.  The fact is that such a snap increases the likelihood of frequent system triggers, most of which will be false. </p><p>  Immediately it is worth moving to <span>the notification system.</span>  At a minimum, a noise indication should be provided, which will warn of approaching interference even in cases where visual attention is fully turned to the road.  It is also worth considering the possibility of additional equipment.  For example, parking sensors are wireless with a mirror due to the integration of the monitor from the rear-view camera, they can receive information not only from the radio signal, but also through direct visual tracking. </p><h2>  Mounting method - which one to prefer </h2>

It must be said that this is the most difficult part of installing a parking sensors system in traditional complexes.  But, again, wireless <span>parking sensors are</span> spared such trouble <span>.</span>  <span>Installation</span> is reduced only to the mechanical integration of sensors.  And there are difficulties in choosing from two mounting options.  The most common method involves drilling holes of the desired bumper diameter and the subsequent introduction of the sensor into the formed niche.  An alternative method requires less technical installation operations, but also has its drawbacks.  This is the integration of the sensor in the license plate locks.  This solution seems more attractive because it eliminates the need for drilling a bumper.  However, in practice, this configuration is less effective because the corners of the machine are left without proper sensor coverage. </p><h2>  Front or rear </h2>

    <p>  You can use different sets that are specifically designed to equip the front or rear of the car or offer a combined configuration - the most popular option.  Experts recommend at least providing a system for equipping the rear, which is the most problematic from the point of view of observation.  From the side of the hood, parking sensors wireless will also not be useless, since not all obstacles can be detected from the inside of the car with the help of mirrors.  Moreover, the most responsible drivers use video surveillance for the front part, complete with parking sensors.  If there is a question about the integrated provision of a car with an electronic valet, then it makes sense to dwell on a version of 6 sensors - 3 elements on each side.  The minimum set provides for supplying only the rear with 2-3 sensors. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on wireless parking sensors </h2>

    <p>  Wireless models have one major advantage that almost all users of such systems point to.  It is expressed in the absence of wiring - therefore, the need for internal electrical installation operations is eliminated.  In addition, a complete transition to the electronic principle of operation also provides for new optional features.  For example, there is an increase in the functional use of sensors that wireless parking sensors work with.  The recall of an ordinary user of such a system, in particular, notes the advantage in the form of the ability to synchronize the sensor with other devices.  That is, when changing the main equipment, wiring updates are not required - just change the settings in the wireless channel. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The operation of modern electronic assistants quite often has not only attractive, but also negative aspects.  In the case of parking, the disadvantages are expressed as a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensors.  The internal filling of such devices does not allow them to work stably over long distances - more than 100 m. However, a lot depends on the element base on which the wireless parking sensors are built.  Feedback criticizing the operation of such systems is often addressed to the quality of the interaction of the sensors with the head equipment.  The time to transmit a signal from the sensor to the main device is one of the main characteristics of parking sensors.  At the same time, radio-frequency wireless models take longer to receive a signal than equipment that directly connects to its sensors. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless Parktronics Manufacturers </h2><p>  Almost all manufacturers of electronic parking lots produce wireless models.  For example, the initial segment is represented by Challenger with the model PL01-V4.  This equipment is advantageous in that the sensors in it are interchangeable and, if necessary, it will not be a problem to update with minimal expenses.  In the middle category, a good Erisson wireless parking sensors is presented in the CP-W47 modification.  This model provides in the basic set of 4 sensors that supply a signal to the head unit, supplemented by a screen with digital indication.  It also makes sense to pay attention to the offer from Incar and ParkCity.  These companies implement decent options in terms of reliability and functionality. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In terms of cost, parking sensors are far from the most expensive car accessory, which contributed to its distribution.  By average, parking sensors with wireless sensors are estimated at 4-6 thousand rubles.  This is a reasonable price, given the benefits of properly installed and configured equipment.  In addition, it is models that suggest a radio frequency communication method that require minimal effort in the installation process.  True, the user will pay for the loss in sensitivity for getting rid of the problematic installation, so you should pre-calculate the radius of the sensors and, if possible, not save on the quality of their performance. </p>
