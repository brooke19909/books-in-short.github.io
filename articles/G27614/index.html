The explanation is simple.  It is in such crafts that a piece of the soul of his mother or father is embedded.  Girls love to play with sewn rag dolls, who need to finish their faces or sew outfits, play with home-made furniture, which dad made for a toy house. </p><p>  In the article we will look at several examples of making interesting home-made toys made by parents for their baby, give detailed instructions on how to make such crafts at home, which requires additional purchase, how to decorate it. </p><h2>  Racing car </h2><p>  To create such a car, a toilet paper sleeve was used.  It is strong enough, so you can play with it for a long time.  In addition, you need to pick up a piece of thick cardboard and cut four identical wheels according to the circle stencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="redtri.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="race car from the hub" class="if uuid-2322514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322514.jpg"></div><p>  In the central part of the sleeve, a hole is cut like the letter "H" and the edges are bent back and forth.  The back part serves as a back for the driver, and the steering wheel is painted on the front.  Then comes work on decorating a homemade toy.  You need to paint the wheels and body of the car with gouache.  Strips, arrows, serial number of racing vehicles will look spectacular.  As a driver, the little man from the Lego constructor is suitable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The wheels are put on metal sticks from another broken machine or attached to paper clips.  It is advisable to make them spinning, as children love mobile toys.  So that the paint does not stain the baby's hands, you can cover the homemade toy with acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Dollhouse </h2><p>  From the used packing box, you can make your daughter a wonderful two-story mansion for dolls.  To do this, put the box on the end part.  Lockable parts are carefully cut and used subsequently to create floors on the second floor and for the attic.  With a sharp knife, windows are drawn, drawn in advance with a simple pencil on cardboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meggiecat.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box house" class="if uuid-2322510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322510.jpg"></div><p>  On one side is a door that can be opened and closed.  You can make a pen with a bead.  The roof is made from an additional strip of cardboard bent in half.  All parts are attached to the tape.  Each floor has furniture, which can also be made of cardboard.  It is easy to make such a homemade toy with your own hands in a couple of hours, attracting a child to work.  You can paint the house with paints, markers or paste it with colored paper or cloth. </p><h2>  Kitchen stove </h2><p>  Putting on a regular chair a cover sewn by yourself from fabric, you can make a wonderful stove for games.  To pattern the cover you need to draw a rectangle whose length is equal to the height of the chair, plus the length of the seat, plus the distance from it to the floor.  This will be the main cloak.  The sides are sewn to it, the width of which is equal to the length of the seat, and the height is the distance from it to the floor.  The edges of the crafts can be sewn on the sides, and can be worn on ties, as in the photo below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ehow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children cooker" class="if uuid-2322522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322522.jpg"></div><p>  This homemade toy for children is made out with an applique made of fabric.  Attach hobs, oven, side pockets for dishes.  On the upper part, you can attach a plastic dryer for toy dishes or make a window with curtains, as in the photo.  The cover plate is easy to put on and take off, so that the rest of the time the chair will fulfill its main function. </p><h2>  Ragdoll </h2><p>  Before you sew such a home-made children's toy, you need to make a template for a pattern.  To do it easily, it is enough to draw the contours of the head, body along with legs and arms on a sheet of whatman paper.  The head can be drawn with the body together.  Before cutting according to the pattern, just leave one centimeter from each edge to the seams on the fabric.  The craft is sewn from the back, then, leaving a small open area, turned on the front side.  For convenience, you can use the knitting needle to align all corners carefully.  Then the doll is stuffed with synthetic winterizer or cotton.  The last open area is sutured.  Hair most often for rag dolls is made of knitting threads with a hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tsabitacraft.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric doll" class="if uuid-2322493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322493.jpg"></div><p>  Facial features can be drawn with a marker or embroidered with mouline thread.  It remains only to sew clothes.  As a rule, children are very fond of such toys, they are soft, you can go to bed with them with them. </p><h2>  Homemade soft toys </h2><p>  Such a funny cat with sausages is easy to sew even for a beginner master handmade.  First of all, the template is executed on paper, as in the previous version of tailoring the doll.  Draw the animal completely with its head and legs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="soft cat crafts" class="if uuid-2322553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322553.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to use natural material, since the child will often hold the toy in his hand, maybe even want to sleep with her in bed.  If you want the toy to be soft and pleasant to the touch, then felt is the best option for sewing.  It can be cut, glued, sewn with applique.  Sheets of felt usually have bright and saturated colors. </p><p>  When transferring the contours to the fabric, be sure to add 1 cm to the seams.  Two halves are manually gathered together by threads on the wrong side of the fabric, then the craft is turned on the front side, and the filler is inserted into the middle.  You can use synthetic winterizer or artificial cotton.  At the end, the cutout is sewn with an internal seam.  Separately, tail, small parts and sausages are cut out. </p><h2>  Toy book </h2><p>  From felt sheets, you can easily make a homemade book in which a new training task will be given on each page.  This is not just a toy, it is a didactic educational tool for the baby.  Sheets of felt are brightly colored, so that all the elements of the book will be interesting to the child at a glance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toy book for a child" class="if uuid-2322533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322533.jpg"></div><p>  Each page has some kind of task, for example, to make a sneaker with laces.  It will be easier for the child to learn how to tie shoelaces with the help of such a toy.  On another page, place the geometric shapes with Velcro or make abacus with beads. </p><p>  You can come up with various tasks: assemble a pyramid or find a missing piece for a rug, put apples on an apple tree on buttons, arrange objects according to color and size, and more. </p><p>  A book of several pages is laced with lacing; sheets are also attached with seams.  The book can be fastened with a button or velcro. </p><h2>  Homemade Puppet Theater </h2><p>  As a home-made toy from paper, you can make a child a puppet theater.  Characters are drawn on a sheet of cardboard, painted and cut along the contour.  So that the figures do not get dirty, they are sealed with transparent tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="joyfulmamasplace.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home-made puppet theater" class="if uuid-2322489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322489.jpg"></div><p>  The theater itself is most conveniently located in an old cardboard box, which is glued with cloth or self-adhesive.  Curtains are pulled from above on a fishing line, and the inside is designed as a stage.  It can be changed for each performance.  Figures of characters are made on stands or pasted on ice cream sticks, poked into a hole cut out at the bottom of the box. </p><p>  Theatrical activity develops not only grammatically correct speech, the memory of the child, but also imagination, the ability to convey the emotions of the character, and use expressive means in the scene. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As can be seen from the text of the article, making toys for children on their own is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.
