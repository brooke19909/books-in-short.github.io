Even with the transition to a digital transmission format, familiar devices do not lose relevance.  In the market of radio equipment, you can find antennas for different purposes, taking into account the nuances of installation and operation.  It should be noted that Russian manufacturers of equipment are widely represented in this segment, and this also affects lower prices.  Despite the advent of more technologically advanced installations, the passive <span>television antenna</span> is still in demand, the pluses of which are reliability and ease of maintenance.  Of course, there are obvious disadvantages of such devices, but in some cases it is quite possible to put up with them. </p>

    <h2>  What is the peculiarity of the passive antenna? </h2><p>  The main difference between passive models is that they do not imply an electrical connection.  For the user, this means the inability to connect the amplification adapter.  Accordingly, in the design of such installations there are no transistors, microcircuits, or other electronic components with electronic filling.  Therefore, it is justifiable to pose the question of whether an active or passive antenna will better cope with the tasks in a particular case?  It is important to understand that the presence of active elements in the structure makes it possible to receive a signal in the most difficult conditions precisely due to additional amplification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But there is a downside to this decision.  The fact is that the lack of electronics relieves passive models of characteristic noise and noise, which also improves reception quality.  Moreover, one cannot talk about the complete absence of reinforcing ability in equipment devoid of special adapters.  The geometry of the structure, which passive antennas possess, is initially oriented towards independent and high-quality signal reception.  Another thing is that not always these abilities are enough to service the equipment in a remote area from the relay station. </p>

    <h2>  Key Features of Passive Antennas </h2><p>  With consumer currents, the main characteristic is the gain, measured in decibels.  As already noted, passive models lose to their active counterparts in this indicator, however, the exclusion of interference compensates for this flaw.  Usually passive antennas (TV) provide amplification in the range of 12-20 dB.  This is sufficient if it is intended to receive a signal propagating tower in the coverage area.  There are also models with a coefficient of more than 30 dB, but you should be more careful with such devices, since a similar level is more likely to be characteristic of active devices.  By the way, an important characteristic of passive installations is the number of functional parts in the design.  It is on them that the antenna‚Äôs own ability to enhance reception without electronic means depends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Indoor antennas </h2><p>  Models for indoor installation were originally designed for a stable and confident TV signal.  It should be understood that even active devices do not always cope with providing a high-quality display in a room, therefore, the choice of passive antennas for indoor use should be approached more carefully.  But if the repeater is in an accessible coverage area, then this option will be beneficial for several reasons.  Firstly, a passive indoor antenna eliminates the need for roof mounting with long cable connections.  Secondly, such models can be adjusted in direct accessibility through special "antennae".  But, again, ensuring a high-quality ‚Äúpicture‚Äù is possible only with the appropriate signal from the broadcasting tower. </p><h2>  Models for cars </h2><p>  Car devices generally operate on the same principle as conventional television sets.  In particular, a passive antenna for a car also works with radio waves of the electromagnetic field, but then directs it to the radio.  In traffic conditions, signal stability is especially important, so active models are in high demand.  But passive designs have their advantages, for example, they are distinguished not only by their ease of use and compact size, but also by their high sensitivity. </p>

    <p>  There are some nuances of operating such devices.  It is important to consider that a passive antenna for a car is essentially external, so it must be protected from mechanical influences.  This primarily relates to telescopic telescopic structures. </p><h2>  External antennas </h2><p>  In terms of reception quality, this is the best option.  In the case of street models, you do not need to think about third-party interference, since the design is designed for long-distance reception.  However, obvious interference near the installation site should still be eliminated.  As a rule, a street passive antenna has massive dimensions and many functional elements in the design.  It is these qualities that allow such receivers to work at large distances from repeaters.  But to pay for these advantages will have to be installed on the roof.  The antenna must be securely fixed so that the wind and precipitation could not interfere with its operation.  In addition, cable routing will be required.  If we are talking about a private house or cottage, then there will not be any special problems with this, but in multi-story buildings you can not do without multi-meter coaxial wires. </p>

    <h2>  Manufacturers and prices </h2><p>  Classic models of passive antennas are produced by companies such as Locus, Deltoplan, Anteks, etc. Most often these are inexpensive devices costing 300‚Äì500 rubles.  Room models can also be purchased for 200-250 rubles.  Street versions cost a little more, but even a demanding buyer will be able to keep within 1000 rubles.  Car passive antennas are produced under the brands "Triad", "Mysteries", "Prolodzhi" and others. In this case, the cost may increase, as manufacturers complete models with additional accessories.  On average, the prices of such antennas are 1000-1500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback on passive antennas </h2><p>  Among the main advantages noted by users of passive antennas, it is worth highlighting the easy installation, the absence of the need to connect electronic components and high reliability.  A simple design in optimal operating conditions is able to provide good reception and a "picture" without unnecessary interference with which active models sin.  Many also note that passive antennas work better in adverse weather conditions than alternatives.  The reinforced design without unnecessary electronics is characterized by stable reception and protection from external influences. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  As practice shows, all the advantages of passive equipment are reduced to zero if the repeater does not provide the proper signal level.  Users note the dependence of such devices on the quality of the local television tower.  Passive antennas intended for installation in a room are particularly problematic in this regard.  The very concept of such installations involves small dimensions, so the function of the reinforcing structure is minimized.  For this reason, for indoor use, experts recommend still referring to active models whose operation is supported by the power supply. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The passive antenna has an elementary design, so many home craftsmen replace it with improvised materials in the form of metal parts.  In some cases, good results are achieved when simulating active devices.  However, even with the competent implementation of the structural part, far from in all cases one can count on obtaining the expected result.  The fact is that a passive television antenna, with all its simplicity of design, has one essential characteristic.  This is the coordination of impedance indicators with the cable, due to which the reception parameters are optimized.  In addition, the owner of the factory antenna can count on convenient and correct configuration settings.  As a result, the balanced adjustment of the functional parts allows counting not only on high-quality reception of a television signal, but also on work with the radial range.  Achieving similar quality with the help of improvised devices is almost impossible. </p>
