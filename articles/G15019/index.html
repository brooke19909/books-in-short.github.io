Ostankino television tower</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not only foreign resorts attract travelers.  Most of them will never refuse to visit large Russian cities, including such as St. Petersburg, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Veliky Novgorod and, of course, Moscow.  The capital city of Russia attracts thousands of guests annually, providing a branched infrastructure and an interesting cultural program, collected from visits to many attractions, for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Let's figure it out </h2><p>  It is easy for a modern tourist to get lost in the capital of the Russian Federation, in the city of Moscow, because the city, according to the latest data, has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo and a half thousand square kilometers and a population of more than twelve million people!  Often, when traveling to Moscow for a couple of days, it is difficult for a traveler to decide which sights he wants to see.  The choice is truly enormous: it includes numerous cathedrals, the Ostankino tower, the Kremlin, <span>Red Square,</span> Tsar Bell, Tsar Pushka, museums, parks and much, much more. </p>

    <p>  Particular attention is drawn to the layout of the city, the so-called radial beam.  The city has long been built from the center to the outskirts, streets-rays and rings (Sadovoe, Boulevard, Moscow Ring Road, Third Transport and so on).  The Moscow metro repeats the city map: there is also a ring and branches-rays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tower </h2><p>  But, walking along the streets of a metropolis, not everything can be seen with your own eyes and appreciated.  One of the most interesting sights of Moscow - the Ostankino tower - invites guests to the observation deck.  It is from here that you can evaluate the city from a bird's eye view, look at buildings resembling matchboxes from above, see rings and beams of the city layout. </p><h2>  Tower erection </h2><p>  The construction was built between 1963 and 1967 according to the project of architect N.V.  Nikitina.  According to verified Internet sources, the author came up with a building scheme in one night.  <span>This building is</span> not only a landmark of the city‚Äôs architecture, it has functional significance: it is the <span>television tower of</span> Ostankino, as well as broadcasting. </p>

    <p>  Currently, its antennas have an audience reach of over fifteen million people!  The construction of the building is very simple and durable, the structure has a small base, many times greater in weight than the mast top. </p><h2>  Building Features: Purpose </h2><p>  For eight years, the Ostankino tower retained the title of the tallest building in the world, and now firmly occupies the eighth place in this indicator after the towers in Toronto and New York, Guangzhou and others.  The structure stands on a conical base of ten reliable supports, and the maximum deviation of the tower top from the center is, according to modern data, taking into account <span>the wind speed</span> of a maximum of twelve meters.  It is also interesting to know that the foundation of the tower does not exceed four and a half meters, and the weight of the building together with the foundation is 55 thousand tons.  The diameter of the base of the building is about 65 meters, and the usable area inside is as much as fifteen thousand square meters!  From afar, the tower looks very "thin", the question arises: "How does it all fit inside ?!" </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Five hundred and forty meters is the height of Ostankino, a tower that is rightly considered the tallest building in Moscow.  Initially, the building was not so high, ‚Äúonly‚Äù five hundred thirty-three meters, and then it was completed (the flagpole was attached).  Inside the building there are several elevators, including passenger, cargo and passenger, restaurant.  Elevators have from nine to forty-seven stations each.  Two of the lifts are currently not working, the question of their restoration is being considered. </p>

    <p>  More than twenty television channels work in this landmark of the city of Moscow, including Channel One, TVC, Russia-2, Peretz, NTV, Domashny and many others.  Some broadcasters are switching to modern technology, and for this purpose the Ostankino tower provides them with many opportunities. </p><h2>  Functional use of this facility </h2><p>  The building is also a sports facility.  In different years, various competitions were held on it.  For example, in 2000, a race to a height of 337 meters was arranged on the stairs.  Also in 2003, a record was recorded: twenty-six people jumped from the building at the same time.  However, a year later, in 2004, the record was broken: thirty people risked their lives at a time.  Not without accidents: the girl clung to the protruding part of the tower and almost died, hitting the wall. </p><h2>  The observation deck in the tower: what is it </h2><p>  But not only this famous Ostankino tower.  An observation deck is what attracts thousands of tourists to this place every year.  Tourists can look at the city from glazed and open areas.  The glazed part of the building is located at an altitude of 337 meters, and the open - at an altitude of 340 meters, just above the closed one. </p>

    <p>  The grounds offer a magnificent view of the city, this is an unforgettable sight!  This place is often visited by wedding processions, photo shoots are organized against the background of a bird's-eye view of the city.  That is why the most visited place in Moscow is the Ostankino tower.  Photos on the background of this attraction are often found on social networks.  Indeed, the images are impressive!  The man seems so small compared to the height and base of the tower, and the panorama of the city from above is amazing! </p><h2>  Concert Hall and Restaurant </h2><p>  The open observation deck of the tower accepts visitors only on warm days of the year, from about May to October.  Excursions are daily, but there is a limit on the number of people: at the same time no more than seventy tourists are allowed to go upstairs.  The tower also has a concert hall and a restaurant.  The concert hall is a modern equipped room in which movie shows and concerts are held.  The hall has 750 seats, in the stalls and amphitheater.  The concert venue is called the Korolevsky Hall. </p>

    <p>  Probably, there is no Russian person who would not know the film ‚ÄúThe Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath‚Äù.  Everyone knows the famous dialogue between Zhenya Lukashin and Gali, his abandoned bride.  ‚ÄúBy the way ... they offer to celebrate the New Year in the restaurant of the Ostankino tower.  Give me the crown.  He is spinning. ‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell, if you want to spin, then of course spin ...‚Äù </p><p>  So, for the sake of this, it was worth a visit to Ostankino.  The restaurant really rotated until 2000, when the famous fire occurred.  Three floors made a revolution around the axis of the tower in one to two times in forty minutes.  The restaurant was located at an altitude of 328 to 334 meters, had, as already mentioned, three levels (like Olympic medals, gold, silver and bronze floors).  It was, of course, prestigious to visit this place, and the guests were pleased with the excellent view from all the windows of Moscow.  Now the restaurant does not work, since a long reconstruction is underway. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the Ostankino TV and Radio Broadcasting Tower always invites tourists to viewing platforms, it is one of the most visited architectural objects of the city of Moscow, it is interesting and informative to visit it at any time of the year.  There is an official site site where you can clarify information about the Ostankino tower, sign up for a tour or view photos. </p>
