Having begun its history relatively recently, in 1997, it has become one of the most successful in the resorts of the <span>Arab country,</span> which is known as the pearl of this continent.  And the German company has earned this title because Azur hotels operate in an all-inclusive system and under the slogan ‚Äúfeel the difference‚Äù.  They are located in the most luxurious places in Egypt, where nature not only fascinates, but also makes the tourist forget about all the vain, calling only to enjoy unforgettable moments of stay in one of the paradise corners of the globe.  The stunning <span>seashore,</span> sparkling with amazing sandy beaches, is located right on the doorstep of most hotels in this chain. </p><p>  Azur hotels are famous for their chic rooms located in the most modern buildings of the original architectural solution.  Spacious rooms, sparkling with cleanliness, are provided with everything necessary to create the most comfortable conditions for tourists to stay. </p><p>  Azur hotels pay special attention to the selection of staff.

Most of them are happy to describe the cleanliness and tidiness of the hotel grounds.  They also talk about how well they feed in the restaurants of this hotel chain.  I must say that the cooks of these hotels are distinguished by their skill in preparing not only oriental exotic dishes.  Given the differences in tastes of customers, Azur hotels include in the menu of restaurants and food, traditional for residents of many countries. </p><p>  Of course, the infrastructure of Azur hotels is not just about restaurants.

And pedestrian areas, to the delight of lovers of shopping, usually start close to hotels. </p><p>  Reviews of Azur hotels are full of thanks to those vacationers who stayed here with their children.  The organizers of the hotel service made sure that adults were able to feel what a good rest is by organizing separate sets of events for children.  While parents enjoy contemplating the beauties of Egypt or shopping at shops in search of souvenirs, children are entertained in mini-clubs or animation events under the close supervision of the staff responsible for the safety and health of young tourists. </p><p>  Relaxation in the Azur hotels is an opportunity to feel at the top of the bliss that a person feels after a hectic day, plunging into a cozy bed with snow-white starched linen in the rooms, which serve the best coffee and tea in the world.
