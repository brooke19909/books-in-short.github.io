    <p>  Many Muscovites and guests of the capital believe that there are not two cathedrals on Red Square, but much more.  This opinion is erroneous, since other masterpieces of Russian temple architecture, although visible from Red Square, are located behind the <span>Kremlin wall,</span> on the territory of the Moscow Kremlin.  Thus, the answer to the question of how many cathedrals on Red Square is unambiguous. </p><p>  The center of Moscow is characterized by an abundance of architectural monuments. </p><p>  Pokrovsky Cathedral on Red Square, the photo of which is presented in this article, is located opposite the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, at the beginning of Vasilyevsky Descent.  Nearby is the bronze memorial of Minin and Pozharsky, erected in 1818. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cathedral of the Intercession on Red Square is the most grandiose <span>attraction in Moscow.</span>  Groups of tourists and individual visitors spend hours walking through galleries.  And if you ask a Japanese, Frenchman or Dane about which cathedral on Red Square they liked more, they will not hesitate to call the Cathedral of the Intercession.  Muscovites will say the same. </p><p>  Pokrovsky Cathedral on Red Square is an unrivaled masterpiece of temple architecture in the mid-16th century, built in honor of the great event that took place in Russia in October 1552 - the capture of Kazan and the victory over the Kazan Khanate.  Tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered to build such a church, "which there can be no resemblance."  This "church" was the Pokrovsky Cathedral on Red Square, which was built in six years, from 1555 to 1561.  Later, several extensions of a cult character were made. </p>

    <h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The architects Barma and Postnik created the design of the cathedral, consisting of a central pillar and eight chapels, which they placed on the cardinal points, in accordance with the canons of church construction of that time: </p><ul><li>  The central pillar is the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </li><li>  To the east is the chapel of the Holy Trinity. </li><li>  To the west - the chapel "The Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem." </li><li>  To the north-west is the chapel of "Gregory the Catalikos of Armenia." </li><li>  To the southeast - the side chapel of "Svirsky Alexander". </li><li>  To the south-west is the chapel of Varlaam Khutynsky. </li><li>  To the north-east is the chapel of "John the Merciful". </li><li>  To the south is the chapel of "Nicholas the Wonderworker." </li><li>  To the north is the aisle of Cyprian and Ustinha. </li></ul><p>  There are no basements in the cathedral, the foundation is a fundamental basement, the arches of which rest on three-meter-thick brick walls.  Until 1595, the basement of the Intercession Cathedral was used to store the royal treasury.  In addition to gold, the most valuable icons were located in the vaults. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second floor of the temple is directly all the aisles and the central pillar of the Intercession of the Virgin, surrounded by a gallery, from which you can get through arched entrances to all rooms, as well as go from one church to another. </p>

    <h2>  Kazan Cathedral on Red Square </h2><p>  In 1625, a wooden Church of Our Lady of Kazan was built on Nikolskaya Street at the expense of Moscow Prince Pozharsky.  Nine years later, the Kazan Church burned down and a stone Kazan Cathedral was erected in its place.  This time the construction of the temple was paid by Tsar <span>Mikhail Fedorovich,</span> and the new building was consecrated in 1636 by Patriarch Joasaph the First. </p><p>  During the Stalinist reconstruction of Manege Square, the cathedral was demolished, this happened in 1936.  The Temple of Our Lady of Kazan was recreated in the early nineties, at the initiative of the Moscow Society for the Protection of Cultural Monuments.  Currently, Kazan Cathedral, located on Red Square, is one of the most noticeable masterpieces of Moscow temple architecture. </p>
