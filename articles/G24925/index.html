This is due to the features of knitting.  The headgear can be adjusted during operation so that the product takes the correct shape.  Consider several models of berets for the warm and cool season. </p><h2>  Spring red beret </h2><p>  This headpiece can start to knit from an elastic band or crown.  The shape of the beret is created by reducing and adding columns, as well as changing the thickness of the hook.  Having typed a chain of three or four loops, you start to crochet from the crown. </p><p>  Scheme and description. </p><ul><li>  Knit 8 single crochet stitches. </li><li>  In each column, knit a bump (three crochet columns having one base loop and apex) and 4 loops between them. </li><li>  Alternate a “column” column with 4 loops between them (there should be 16 columns). </li><li>  Knit 8 fans (in one loop of the base there are four “column” columns) with 4 air loops (that is, on the previous column there is a fan, in the next element there is a <span>connecting column</span> with air loops). </li><li>  In the next row above the fan, knit 4 “knit” columns with a common top, and between them - 7 air loops with a connecting loop on the previous arch. </li><li>  Further, in all the loops, except for the connecting ones, knit solid “cap” columns. </li></ul><h2>  Red hat </h2><p>  Continue to crochet the red beret. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/721292.jpg" width="366"></div>

To do this, type a chain around the head circumference.  With eight single crochets, tie eight rows.  The resulting strip is connected in a circle with connecting posts.  Add the loops halfway, that is, if the elastic band consists of 120 loops, then 180 SC should be obtained. </p><p>  Next, go to the "column" columns.  Alternate them with bumps (14 “flare” and a bump of two double crochet columns with one base loop and a common apex).  Please note that in each row 12 loops are added.  The increase goes between the bumps. </p><p>  Having reached the desired diameter (approximately 21-23 cm.), Knit the next 4 rows without increases with a smooth shift of the cones.  Due to this, the cap is “bent” (takes).  Crochet pattern of any headgear knits quickly due to decreases.  In this case, you reduce 12 columns in each row, while the cones move and form wedges.  The remaining 8 -12 loops are pulled together, hiding the thread on the inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern for girls" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/721301.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  White beret with a visor </h2><p>  Pay attention to the children's model with a visor.  The whole emphasis rests on a large flower, in which the second petals begin from the base of the first (how voluminous flowers fit).  Knitting starts from the middle.  Six rows in a checkerboard pattern alternate the "cap" column with an air loop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then the resulting oval is tied with half columns.  Further, due to the "cap" columns, half columns and air loops, 21 petals are formed.  Pay attention to their location (look at the photo a white crochet with schemes of a flower and a peak).  Next is the increase and work on the second row of petals: 6 large and 21 small.  The latter are unevenly located, so read the diagram carefully. </p><p>  For a beret, you need to impose leaves consisting of one large and three small petals (the same as those of the flower itself).  The bottom of the headdress is tied with arches and "cap" columns.  The peak is knitted last of all by “cap” columns and loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="takes a crocheted pattern" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/726470.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Beret with a visor for beginners </h2><p>  These hats with a visor can be knitted for both boys and girls.  Only for the stronger sex, choose a simple pattern.  To make it turn out to be more stylish, take melange, sectional yarn.  Just remember that it is very moody and unpredictable in the sense that the product can take a variety of forms. </p><p>  Knitting starts from the bottom.  In a ring, knit sixteen double crochets.  Then alternate the “cap” column with an air loop.  Next, knit all the double crochet (two in each air loop).  You knit a few more rows with an increase due to the alternation of a “column” column and two air loops. </p><p>  So keep knitting fully crochet.  The scheme for a girl or a boy can be any, most importantly, to adjust the shape of the headgear due to increases and decreases.  As soon as the bottom is tied by adding loops, proceed to the formation of the height of the beret. </p><p>  Try on a product.  Measure the location of the visor, knit with convex and ordinary single crochet columns.  Every five convex columns increase by one more column.  This is necessary for the visor to stand.  Its shape is obtained by reducing the loops at the edges (knit the last two columns together). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork crochet patterns" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/726471.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  "Motive" crochet: diagram and description </h2><p>  From individual motifs, elegant head berets are obtained.  The bottom line is to form from them first the bottom of the beret, then the sidewalls, and knit the elastic band with half columns with a trim to match the pattern.  At the same time, the sidewalls are knitted without increases, so that the edges are bent. </p><p>  Consider how to knit a floral <span>openwork beret (crochet).</span>  The schemes of the magnificent flower will be as follows.  All rows end with a connecting loop, and begin with one lifting loop.  Make a sliding loop (fold the thread in a circle so that you can then tighten it). </p><ul><li>  Collect an arch of three air loops and a half-column.  Only six elements. </li><li>  Then there are twelve magnificent columns (in one loop of the base there are five “crown” columns with one top) and three loops between them, that is, on each arch of the previous row, two magnificent columns. </li><li>  Knit, as in the first row, an arch of three loops and a half-column.  You should get twenty-four arch loops. </li><li>  Tighten the sliding loop. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat crochet pattern" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/727940.jpg" width="225"></div></li></ul><h2>  The connection of motives </h2><p>  We continue to consider <span>how to crochet</span> motif children's berets.  The connection diagrams of the elements are represented by arches from air loops and half columns.  For each element, leave tails for tying the last row and attaching motives.  The ends of the threads are hidden in lush columns on the inside. </p><p>  When the second element is created when knitting the last row, immediately attach to the first flower with connecting columns for the three arches of the first flower.  Further, the elements are joined in the same way for the three arches of the first and second flower, and the 4th arch remains free, that is, of the 24 arches connected, there should be 18, and 4 free. </p><p>  In the next row, motives are also attached, but they take a thicker hook to increase the size of the product.  Connect the flowers to the <span>size of the head.</span>  As you can see, it turns out an unusual, stylish beret crocheted.  The headband gum scheme is represented by the usual half-columns, which are attached to the middle of each arch of the previous row.  The harness consists of lush columns and a connecting loop. </p><p>  If you need to increase the size of the beret, then tie the flower several times with arches and half columns.  You can take a thicker thread and a larger hook number to also achieve the desired size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby berets crochet patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/721285.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  When knitting a beret, pay attention to the yarn and hook number.  For headgear, the brands <span>Alize (</span> Cotton Gold), <span>Jeans (YarnArt Jeans),</span> Crystal, and Diamond are <span>suitable</span> .  For cool weather, choose wool with acrylic or bamboo, and for summer - cotton.  If you work with an unfamiliar yarn, first knit a sample to see how the thread behaves in the work. </p><p>  Beginners should follow the instructions, and professionals can crochet from any pattern.  The scheme for a girl, boy, adult differ only in size.  The essence of knitting remains the same: the bottom is knitted with increments in the size of the crown, adjust the height of the beret and narrow the loops to the size of the forehead. </p>
