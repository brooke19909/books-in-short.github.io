If the name Elettromedia is unfamiliar, then it is the parent company of such reputable brands as Hertz and Audison.  Hertz HSK 165 <span>speaker system</span> user reviews are called one of the best products in the series, which is aimed at conscious music lovers. </p><h2>  Hardware Components </h2><p>  The unpacked speakers are in good condition thanks to a well-thought-out box that holds everything tightly in place and does not harm the environment, as it is entirely made from recycled materials.  The package contains a lot of everything that may be required to install the system in various places, including four types of speaker mounting configurations.  If you need to place them hidden or on the surface, everything you need is already included.  The grilles for 6.5-inch woofers allow 3 types of design.  There is a black ABS plate, which is installed behind the driver, protected by a black perforated metal cover.  You can simply use the silver grille with shockproof protection, simulating a tweeter for a more cosmetic look, or use both options.  It seems that the system offers many parts that will remain unclaimed.  Does anyone else put up large grilles? </p><p>  In general, the drivers used in this system are very well designed and could decorate any home acoustics. </p>

    <h2>  Mid / bass range </h2><p>  Marked with 125 W continuous power, the 6.5-inch midrange / woofer has a cast aluminum base that fits into a 5.75-inch hole.  The driver is 69 mm deep, fastened with four screws at an angle of 90 degrees.  Each midrange component is designed for high quality sound.  For example, in an effort to reduce interference from the back wave, three ‚Äúspokes‚Äù were used in the mount instead of the usual four or more, and it was given an aerodynamic shape.  The aluminum base also includes a ventilated bottom plate and a radial ventilation system to improve heat dissipation.  Other enhancements include a large magnet and a 1.2-inch copper-trimmed aluminum voice coil wound around a lightweight kapton frame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The diffuser is also unusual in its design.  The company calls it a V-diffuser.  It is made of pressed fibers and is given a special shape designed to improve off-axis dispersion and high frequencies.  The diffuser is attached to the aluminum base with a 3.5-inch nomex cross, and on top with a butyl rubber frame.  A deep V-shaped safety cap completes the design of the V-diffuser.  The contacts are made in the form of a plug-plug, they are very durable and do not cause fears of damage when connected.  Interestingly, the Hertz HSK 165 speakers require female-type terminals, but neither wires nor connectors are included.  This can be a problem for enthusiasts who may not have such components. </p>

    <h2>  Tweeters </h2><p>  The tweeters used in the Hertz HSK 165 system are also made in a special way.  They consist of a 1-inch dome of tetolon fiber, a neodymium magnet, a damper chamber and a volumetric type of a waveguide diaphragm grating that scatters off-axis dispersion.  They come with about 20 cm of wire with soldered terminals.  The more powerful Hertz HSK 165 XL uses similar 1.1-inch HT28 speakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crossover </h2><p>  The filling of the crossover is located in a beautifully finished case, which is easy to remove, but which is securely closed by the top cover.  The fixing screw is inside to give a more finished look after installation.  The case of the box is covered with a really good ‚Äúrubber‚Äù finish with silver contrast plastic.  Inside are -12 dB low-pass / mid-range and high-pass filters. </p>

    <p>  Tweeters use a point with a frequency of about 3.2 kHz, which is useful to know if an active crossover is planned.  The iron cores of the inductors are designed to eliminate magnetic interference, and polyester capacitors are used in the high-pass filter.  Resistors for attenuating the RF and equalizing to the midrange are mounted high above the board to provide maximum cooling and reliability.  The connectors for the speakers and amplifier are made in the form of screws securing the terminals to the contact plates.  The tweeter level is adjusted by selecting one of three terminals: +2 dB, 0 dB or -2 dB. </p><h2>  Listening </h2><p>  Test listening Hertz HSK 165 was held in a special room - a quiet room with controlled acoustics, so that the sound was not colored by all kinds of variables that appear in the car.  The kit was mounted on a panel, and the tweeters were initially connected to the 0 dB jack.  Diana Kroll S'Wonderful's CD from The Look of Love is very suitable for evaluating how well the speakers recreate the fantastic vocals, as well as for the feel of the sound stage.  The first thing you can notice is the warmth and naturalness of the mid frequencies.  The timbre of the voice and the atmosphere of presence on the recording were obvious.  The transition to Dire Straights Ride Across the River again showed even warmth, a natural timbre and a very good definition of the middle range.  The tweeters seemed too polite, and after switching them to +2 dB, <span>Mark Knopfler‚Äôs</span> great detail and hiss appeared <span>.</span>  The bass output was powerful and even, with good clarity and impressive clarity. </p>

    <h2>  Hertz HSK 165: Listening Review </h2><p>  No matter what is played - pop, rock, jazz, classical or rap - the system simply plays the music as it should, and this is exactly what is required from high-end equipment.  Unlike some less successful kits, the Hertz HSK 165 does not require any tone adjustments when switching music genres or significantly changing the volume level.  Even after loud rock playing, enough not to hear the interlocutor, the acoustics did not complain about anything.  The only relatively insignificant criticism is that, although the mid-range frequencies sound good even off the axis, the tweeters have become rather scattered and have become more humble than they should have been when turning 30‚Äì45 degrees.  The solution to this is to mount the tweeters as high as possible and as close to the sound axis as possible so that you can fully appreciate their high performance.  Negotiations with the manufacturer confirmed this, they also recommend installing tweeters on the front pillars and directing them as close to the axis as possible to ensure maximum effect. </p><p>  Frequency response and impedance curves are fully consistent with the test sound.  They are pleasant and even, with a small tubercle below, from which "warmth" comes.  The woofer resonance is at 70 Hz, and another slight increase in impedance is observed at 1500 Hz - this is the resonance frequency of the tweeter camera. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Generally speaking, <span>the</span> Hertz HSK 165 <span>speaker system is</span> superbly well-made, with an unusually smooth and natural tone when properly tuned.  Users like the way it works, especially after increasing the RF output and pointing to the sound axis.  The system copes with powerful amplification and is not against a loud game, but it does not need much effort to create a great sound.  Acoustics are relatively inexpensive, about $ 335, while there are kits that cost twice as much, but whose sound is not much better.  As always, before buying, the work of any <span>speaker system is</span> best checked personally. </p>
