Workers note that they are confident in their future, as they work in a reliable and stable company.  Many are attracted by the fact that the salary is piece-rate, so you can yourself influence the size of your income. </p><p>  When fulfilling all the established plans, one can have a fairly high income.  Here, reality has career prospects, as the company regularly sends its employees to trainings and continuing education courses, teaching both sales and the features of insurance products. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Among the negative feedback from employees about Ingosstrakh, there are many complaints that the company actually has no career prospects.  It is not easy for beginners to cope with a high flow of customers, but this is a good school, an opportunity to gain invaluable experience in practice. </p><p>  Often in reviews of Ingosstrakh there are complaints about the arrogant attitude of managers towards subordinates who can insult staff, swear, use obscene language when communicating with employees. </p><p>  Some of the employees are annoyed by the dress code that exists in the company.  This is mainly a requirement of those offices in which there are high-ranking customers, so jeans are categorically undesirable. </p><p>  At the same time, judging by the impressions of real workers, the salary here, although stable, is very small.  It is very problematic to get the award, often it can directly depend on the mood of the boss.  Many are bribed by voluntary health insurance, which is issued to employees, but in reality it is cut back every year, as a result of the opportunities to use it there is less and less. </p><h2>  Customers </h2><p>  In the reviews of the Ingosstrakh insurance company, some of the clients note that they are satisfied with the cooperation with it.  As a rule, one directly encounters its activities during the execution of the contract and the occurrence of the corresponding case. </p><p>  In the reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in Ingosstrakh, clients always emphasize when they manage to receive payment on time and in full.  Faced with such a professional attitude to their duties, customers decide to trust this particular insurer in the future. </p><h2>  Negative sides </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews about Ingosstrakh" class="if uuid-2967739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967739.jpg"></div><p>  Enough negative reviews about Ingosstrakh.  For example, when applying for a new car.  In the reviews on CASCO in Ingosstrakh, customers complain that the insurer is not fulfilling its obligations.  For example, it refuses to provide an emergency commissioner in case of a serious accident, even if this service was originally prescribed in the contract.  As a result, the driver has to independently collect all the necessary certificates and documents, in addition, the repair repair is delayed for too long.  All this leads to a large number of negative reviews about insurance at Ingosstrakh. </p><p>  Many are attracted by the opportunity to issue the necessary policy via the Internet.  However, this procedure is new, difficulties still arise, due to which customers write negative reviews about the Ingosstrakh insurance company.  The policy issued electronically, they can not get for a long time.  In reviews on hull insurance in Ingosstrakh, users note that they are faced with a similar problem in this case.  Not even a hotline call helps.  The customer reviews of Ingosstrakh contain information that all emerging issues have to be solved independently. </p><p>  Recently, the company has been actively promoting the opportunity to take out voluntary health insurance.  As a result, in this case too, one has to face unpleasant feedback on payments at Ingosstrakh.  Moreover, the problem is banal incompetence, when employees make mistakes, for example, because of not updated databases.  Then there are negative reviews about Ingosstrakh.  The insurance company inevitably loses its customers. </p>
