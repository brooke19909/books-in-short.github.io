A lot of historical evidence of contemporaries has been preserved about it, but the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù of Thucydides is the most significant work among them.  Most of the comedies of Aristophanes, in which some generals and events are ridiculed, was written during this period. </p><p>  Athens and Sparta - two strong city-states - were allies during the Greco-Persian wars (499-449 BC).  Following the retreat of the Persians, Athens strengthened its influence not only in the Aegean basin and the Black Sea region, but also sought dominance throughout Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peloponnesian war" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/68555.jpg" width="295"></div>

    <p>  Historians believe that the Peloponnesian war broke out because of Sparta's fear of the growing power of Athens, which more and more isolated their competitors.  Both states were influential and could ignore the old rules of infantry combat.  Supported by nearly 200,000 Helots working in the farms of Massenia and Laconia, the Spartans fielded hoplites with excellent military training.  They were well known for their courage, hand-to-hand fighting skills and the invention of an offensive strategy called phalanx formation.  This innovative tactic proved to be very successful during the <span>battles at the Marathon</span> in 490 BC and at the Plateaus in 479 BC, after which the wars of Ancient Greece ended in victory over the Persians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the Persian retreat, Athens did not stop using triremes, on the contrary, they significantly increased their fleet.  Raised in tribute to vassal city-states located on the islands and shores of the <span>Aegean Sea, the</span> policy became a kind of ‚Äúgood police‚Äù, controlling its subordinate allies.  Over the following decades, he gained great influence in the union (or Delos Symmachy, since the main governing body was on the island of Delos). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wars of Ancient Greece" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/68553.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <p>  Other states participating in the alliance were completely dependent on Athens and were limited only to cash contributions.  Gradually, the general treasury began to be wasted exclusively on Athenian projects, and not on protecting the Ionian and Aegean seas from potential invaders in the person of pirates and the same Persians.  Pericles generally transferred the treasury from Delos to Athens, the money began to be used to finance the extensive construction undertaken by him, in particular, the Parthenon. </p><p>  Sparta watched with concern as the states that were part of the alliance lost control of their ships, and Athens turned into a maritime empire.  Increasing their power, they were able to challenge the Lacedaemonians, known as the Spartans, the leaders of another alliance, which for a long time remained the only main military force in Greece.  Sparta with its allies, with the exception of Corinth, was able to fight ground forces.  But it was a truly invincible army.  Thus, both powers could not conduct decisive battles and end the dispute "in one day." </p><p>  Peloponnesian war <strong> </strong>  started <strong> </strong>  due to several specific actions on the part of Athens, as a result of which the allies of Sparta suffered.  The Athenian fleet prevented Corinth from forming a colony in Kerkyra, in addition, the empire undertook economic sanctions against Megar, which could be fatal for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peloponnesian war" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4583/68554.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <p>  The Peloponnesian war, which began in 431 BC, lasted a total of 27 years, with a six-year truce somewhere in the middle of this period, and ended with the surrender of Athens in 404 <span>BC.</span>  One of the long-term causes of the defeat of the state is called an unforeseen outbreak of the plague in 430, in which Pericles and at least a quarter of citizens died.  Almost three decades of constant struggle led the empire to bankruptcy; forces were exhausted and demoralized. </p><p>  The Peloponnesian war ended with the cessation of the existence of the Athenian sea power.  Sparta and the allies turned into a pan-Greek organization, imposing universally oligarchic reigns. </p>
