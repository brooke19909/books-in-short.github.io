Own part of the total capital represents the net assets of the company or organization. </p><p>  The equity of the enterprise includes various sources of resources: authorized, reserve, <span>additional capital.</span>  In addition, it includes retained earnings, separate special purpose funds and other reserves.  In addition to <span>its own funds</span> include all gratuitous receipts and subsidies allocated by the state. </p><p>  The amount of the <span>authorized capital is</span> prescribed in the charter and other constituent documents of a legal entity.  Additional - this is all property contributed by the founders in excess of the charter capital, as well as the amounts remaining as a result of the revaluation of the property, and other income.  The reserve is allocated from profit to cover possible losses and losses. </p><p>  The main source of accumulation of <span>property of the enterprise</span> is retained earnings remaining from gross profit after payment of taxes to the budget and deductions for other claims. </p><p>  Special purpose funds represent net profit, which is directed to the expansion of the enterprise, industrial development, as well as social events. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other reserves mean reserves created in connection with the expected large expenses, which are included in the cost, as well as all distribution costs. </p><p>  The equity of the enterprise is divided into two key components - it is invested and accumulated capital. </p><p>  Invested part - funds invested by the founders (owners) in the enterprise.  It includes the <span>nominal value of</span> shares (ordinary and preferred) and additionally paid assets.  This also includes values ‚Äã‚Äãreceived free of charge from various sources. </p><p>  In the balance sheet, part of the invested funds is reflected as authorized capital, part as additional (received share premium), part as additional (free or transferred property) or social fund. </p><p>  Accumulated part - funds created in excess of initially advanced by the owners.  This part is reflected in the articles arising from the distribution of net profit (these are retained earnings, reserve capital, and other similar items). </p><p>  The equity of the enterprise has the following positive features: </p><ul><li>  ease of attraction (it depends on the owners and does not require coordination with other business entities); </li><li>  high profit generating opportunities (does not require payment of loan interest); </li><li>  ensuring the financial stability of the organization in the long term and reducing the risk of bankruptcy). </li></ul><p>  However, it also has disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  limited volume of fundraising; </li><li>  high price in comparison with borrowed sources; </li><li>  unused probability of increased profitability due to borrowed funds. </li></ul>

    <p>  In general, an enterprise using exclusively equity capital is the most financially stable, but the pace of its development is restrained due to the non-use of the opportunities for profit growth for funds invested in fixed assets of the enterprise. </p>
