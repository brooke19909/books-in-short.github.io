Recreation and fishing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A picturesque place for recreation and fishing - Sukhodolskoye Lake - is located in the Priozersky District, 95 km from St. Petersburg.  It is located in the north of the Karelian Isthmus and is part of the large lake-river system of Vuoks. </p><p>  The uniqueness of this place lies not only in the beautiful area, clear water and sandy beaches, but also in the natural archaeological site located here - a complex of ancient stones, which are cult sanctuaries. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Until 1950, the lake had a different name - Suvanto (or Suvanto-j√§rvi).  It flowed not into Ladoga, but directly into the river.  Vuoksa.  On the eastern side of the lake was the path from Vyborg to Korela (now Priozersk), which was called Vuoksinsky.  Since people had to drag ships between these two lakes through the isthmus, a traffic jam formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sukhodolsky lake" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/467753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to historical data, in the 16th century.  the city of Volochek Svansky was located here, where many merchants who actively used the drag lived.  In 1741, local residents decided to dig a canal in order to discharge water into Ladoga through it.  As a result of these efforts, and also not without the help of <span>weather events,</span> Sukhodolskoe Lake and Ladoga significantly approached each other (the bridge between them was 50 m.). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1818, during heavy spring rains, the water in the lakes rose, eroding the meadows and fields.  But the strongest storm that washed the remainder of the sandy land put the last point in this matter.  So another river appeared - Taipaleen-yoki, which is famous for its rapids. </p><h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  Sukhodolskoe Lake is famous for a wide variety of fauna.  Here, fishermen can easily catch bream, ruff, perch and pike.  There are also roach and burbot, bream and hive.  Sometimes water can please the presence of pike perch, ide, sabrefish, elk, dace, whitefish and grayling.  Trout is very rare, but its fishing is prohibited. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Many anglerfish consider Lake Sukhodolskoye to be the most fishing spot.  Fishing here pleases with a variety of catch.  Caught both from the boat and from the shore.  This is possible due to the presence of sharp dumps, which create good conditions for throwing spinning and fishing rods to great depths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukhodolskoe lake rest" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/467751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The best places for fishing from the shore are: </p><ul><li>  mouth of the duct (radius 100 m); </li><li>  cape, which is located opposite the duct; </li><li>  The coast of the lake, located at a <span>distance of 300 m</span> north of the railway station "Losevo". </li></ul><p>  It must be remembered that there is a fairly strong current, so it is recommended to use only special gear.  In this place, fishermen will be pleased with the catch of ide and bream, roach and bream.  Bait also sometimes goes on live bait. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake Sukhodolskoe fishing" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/467752.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for fishing on a boat, it is produced at a considerable depth.  The best gear for such fishing would be a ring and a feeder.  As bait, worms and maggots are used, which are excellent for sabrefish and bream weighing 200-800 gr.  Also, fishermen use a fishing rod with an ordinary float, on which you can catch bream up to 3 kg in deep piles.  The most favorable time for this is May-October, and especially the middle and end of summer.  In early spring, using a fishing rod, you can catch dace and whitefish.  For pike fishing, fishermen prefer the eastern and middle parts of Sukhodolsky Lake.  Large pikes weighing 2-4 kg come across here.  Quite often on the shallows you can find roach, sabrefish and even trout. </p><h2>  Winter fishing on the lake </h2><p>  If in summer perch is extremely rare, and not very large, then in winter it will delight any fisherman.  At great depths (3-5 m), it is caught on a spinner or mormyshka.  Also at this time of year at a 5-meter depths is a large roach.  But the most impressive catch for fishermen is provided by burbot, for which Sukhodolskoye Lake is an excellent habitat.  Unfortunately, bream is very difficult to catch in the winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers sukhodolskoe lake" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/467750.jpg" width="600"></div>
