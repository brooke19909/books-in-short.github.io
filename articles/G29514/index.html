    <p>  Many positive comments relate to the location of the hotel.  Those who do not want to go to urban equipped beach areas can visit the wild free beach located near the hotel.  It is also sandy, with a gentle entrance to the sea.  Despite the fact that there is no entertainment and the corresponding equipment on its territory, you can perfectly sunbathe and swim here. </p><p>  Many vacationers in their reviews note excellent Arabic cuisine.  A plus is the presence of a diet menu.  The attendants, who have knowledge of the Russian language, are also not neglected, which facilitates communication during the holidays.  No complaints about the rooms.  All are decorated in a contemporary style.  The designer skillfully tried to make each room special.  All rooms have superb furnishings. </p><p>  Not without claims.  So, not everyone likes the lack of their own beach, and the nearest recreation area is completely not equipped.  Therefore, you have to sunbathe, sitting on a beach mat or bath towel.  There are vacationers who complain of poor soundproofing in the rooms, which makes it difficult to fully relax in the evening, when all the guests gather in their rooms and discuss the day spent.  Nevertheless, there are much more positive comments. </p>
