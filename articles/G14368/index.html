    <h2>  How to get to Adler airport from Sochi by car? </h2><p>  If you have rented a car and want to drive it famously to the terminal of the air harbor, you should first of all take into account the congestion of the tracks.  The distance itself is not so enormous.  Between Sochi and the airport, the length of roads is thirty-one kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But you should not hope that you will overcome this distance in half an hour.  First you need to get out of Sochi.  This is best done by driving along Telman Street.  Turning left onto Vinogradnaya, you will reach the junction and the E97 highway.  You will very quickly drive onto the A147 road, which runs along the sea.  She will lead you to the village of Adler. </p><p>  But you are still out of place.  You are not interested in the village; you need to know how to get to Adler Airport from Sochi.  Having seen the exit to the left onto A148, we turn and move to the Aviation.  The name of the street itself indicates that we have almost arrived.  We follow the road signs that lead us directly to the terminals of the air harbor.  On the road, if you are lucky and there are no traffic jams, you will spend 36 to 40 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Adler airport from Sochi by car" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1707860.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  By taxi </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to Adler Airport from Sochi is by taxi.  The resort has many services.  After calling the dispatcher, the car will arrive at the address you have indicated within ten minutes.  It‚Äôs better to call a reliable Qiwi taxi.  This service has fixed prices, and a shuttle can be ordered online. </p><p>  In the fleet of "Kiwi taxi" there are cars of various classes, from "Economy" to representative.  Of course, the fare depends on this.  Day and night rates also apply.  In any case, a trip along the Sochi ‚Äì Airport route will cost you no less than 1,500 rubles.  But, if you are afraid of being late for the flight, it is better to sacrifice this amount.  Dashing drivers will drive you to the terminals in half an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to adler airport from sochi by bus" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1707854.jpg" width="488"></div>

From Sochi bus station you can leave by bus number 105.  The traffic schedule is quite tight, because in addition to the bus, minibuses No. 105K also run.  The latter go only to Adler Airport.  The bus route was extended to the Rosa Khutor GLK. </p><p>  The fare on route number 105 is seventy rubles.  The first bus leaves the airport at six in the morning, and the last at half past eleven.  Minibuses ply much more often, but finish work at twenty minutes past ten in the evening.  In the afternoon, the bus has to wait a long time - up to 35 minutes.  In the evening, the interval between them is an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport train station sochi how to get" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1707856.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sochi as a transit point </h2><p>  Sometimes there are situations when a tourist arrives at Adler airport in order to quickly get from Sochi railway station, and from there to resorts located north of the city.  How to be such transit travelers?  After all, they are interested in the route Adler Airport - Sochi Railway Station.  How to get from one point to another as quickly and inexpensively as possible? </p><p>  There are two options: a direct bus and a high-speed train "Swallow".  By the way, if you are interested in the ski resort village of Krasnaya Polyana, then a very comfortable Sky Bus is added to these two types of transport.  What needs to be done to get from the airport to <span>Sochi railway station</span> by bus?  Leaving the terminal, find the stop of route No. 124.  A ticket costs seventy rubles and is purchased from the driver.  These buses do not run at night. </p><h2>  "Swallow" </h2><p>  Earlier, the Aeroexpress express train ran from the air harbor to the resort.  He left the Sochi railway station, and arrived at the station near the terminals of the hub.  But since the spring of 2013, this route has ceased to operate.  How to get to Adler airport from Sochi now? </p><p>  Today, this express train was replaced by a high-speed train "Swallow".  It takes about an hour to get there.  Why is the journey by rail longer than by bus?  Just because the train calls at Adler station, and this is a hook.  On the way, "Swallow" makes only a few stops - in Krasnaya Polyana, Matsesta and Khost.  The ticket price depends on the distance and comfort level of the selected car.  Traveling by the second class on the route Sochi - the airport will cost two hundred and fifty-five rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from adler airport to sochi" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1707857.jpg" width="600"></div>
