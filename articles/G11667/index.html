    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The hotel business is a specific industry in which everything cannot be perfect.  Reviews of tourists highlight the following shortcomings in the work of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are incredibly slow; </li><li>  ashtrays do not change <span>in smoking areas</span> ;  it‚Äôs very bad that the room does not have a large mirror to evaluate its full-height appearance; </li><li>  often there are times when the waiters do not consider it necessary to bring change, automatically leaving it to themselves as a tip; </li><li>  if you need an iron, you have to run after the maid or pay for this service in the laundry room; </li><li>  very poor soundproofing, and therefore noise is heard from the street and from neighboring rooms; </li><li>  the rooms are not cleaned thoroughly enough, and therefore you can often find the "goodies" that have remained from previous guests; </li><li>  heating works very poorly, and therefore in the winter you just freeze here;  the rooms are cramped; </li><li>  windows of some rooms overlook the courtyard, where the view is not very beautiful - garbage and construction; </li><li>  the procedure for checking the number before leaving is not very pleasant (everything can be done more delicately); </li><li>  in rooms located on the upper floors, very low pressure of hot water; </li><li>  poor ventilation in the toilet; </li><li>  inflated prices in the restaurant; </li><li>  in the bathrooms of double rooms, cosmetics and bath accessories are provided for only one (though, upon request, everyone informs). </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The hotel business is endless competition, and therefore each hotel seeks to take its place in the sun.  The Continental Hotel is positioning itself as a luxury hotel for sophisticated guests.  It is worth noting that the types of services in the hotel are the most numerous, and therefore each of the guests will find something to fill their leisure with.  Nevertheless, this hotel is quite expensive.  This is due not only to the luxurious design, but also to the fact that the hotel is located in the very center of the city.  With all this, the hotel staff should be a little quick. </p>
