These apartments are very desirable for many, therefore, in case of an error, it will not work to change them - other guests will already live in them.  In general, numbers in any case need to be reserved in advance.  The hotel is popular, so by the beginning of the holiday season almost all dates will be busy. </p><p>  In general, this is a very cozy and good hotel, where tourists from Russia and the UK come mainly.  If you want to enjoy excellent service, delicious food, the sea, as well as plunge into the active nightlife of Greece, you should go here.  As many assure, you will not have to regret your choice. </p>
