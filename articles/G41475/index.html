    <h2>  Barut Kemer Resort 5 * (Kemer): negative reviews </h2><p>  Even five-star hotels are not immune from some interruptions in work, which can affect the quality of leisure travelers.  So, if we talk about such an institution as Barut Kemer 5 *, reviews indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  repair and furniture in the rooms are already quite "tired"; </li><li>  most of the outlets in the rooms are shattered, and therefore pose a danger to vacationers; </li><li>  you have to take a seat on the beach before breakfast, otherwise you won‚Äôt get free sun loungers (in addition, they are very close to each other, which causes some inconvenience); </li><li>  even if the hotel is half empty, early check-in will not be possible without payment; </li><li>  sometimes maids forget to fill the minibar; </li><li>  in some rooms absolutely does not catch wifi; </li><li>  a lot of additional paid services (moreover, the need to pay is reported not in advance, but in fact); </li><li>  the hotel territory is small, and therefore there is no place for walking here; </li><li>  if you book a standard room, the hotel staff obsessively offer to upgrade the category for an additional fee (for some reason they are very offended by the refusal); </li><li>  if you stay in rooms located next to the main restaurant, you will constantly smell food from the kitchen. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Based on traveler reviews, we can conclude that the Barut Kemer Resort 5 * hotel is one of the best in Kemer.  At first glance, guests are amazed at the flowering area, architectural design and landscape design, as well as the interior decoration of the hall.  Even though the furniture in the lobby (and throughout the hotel) is a bit shabby, the view is quite presentable.  Communication with the reception staff can spoil the impression a bit (many call this the weak link of the hotel).  If you are ready for additional paid services to be imposed on you, you can calmly react to this situation and do not spoil your mood. </p><p>  The work of the staff deserves all praise.  You won‚Äôt even notice when the maids will clean your room.  Bartenders and waiters also work lightning fast.  Once you sit down at a table, you will immediately receive an order, and after a few minutes you can enjoy delicious dishes.  By the way, cooks are willing to make contact, and therefore you can express them your special wishes.  As for the food in the main restaurant, it is incredibly varied and delicious.  Despite the fact that trying all the dishes is simply impossible, their range is constantly changing. </p><p>  As for the entertainment program, it can not be called very diverse and rich.  If you are determined to take part in sporting events, then you will not have to get bored here, but as for the disco and evening shows, they are not the brightest.  All lovers of fun expect night trips to Kemer's clubs.  Nevertheless, the animation team is very nice.  It can be seen that the guys are trying their best (probably, there are too few of them for so many vacationers).  Animators will become for you real friends and interesting interlocutors. </p>
