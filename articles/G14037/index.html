One of them is Tsvetaev Ivan Vladimirovich.  His biography tells that he was a great Russian historian, philosopher, art critic and archaeologist, recognized not only in his homeland, but throughout Europe.  It was he who created the Museum of Fine Arts, located at the Imperial University of Moscow. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev grew up in a very poor and modest family of a village priest.  The story of his life begins with the village of Drozdovo, where he was born in the spring of 1847. In addition to him, his parents had six more children, but three of them died in infancy. </p>

The priest instilled in his children from a young age a love of God, so Ivan went to receive his primary education in a religious school located in the city of Shuya, where he studied for six years.  After that he moved to Vladimir Seminary, where he mastered perfectly the Hebrew, Latin and Ancient Greek languages.

    <h2>  How was the exposition created? </h2><p>  At the same university, he still held the post of cabinet superintendent, in which various antiquities and fine art were kept.  At that moment there were only fifteen plaster casts and a small collection of books.  Periodically, the collection was replenished with private donations and was located in the old rooms of the inactive hospital building.  Just from this place the Russian scientist and historian decided to make a real museum.  Then, for this exposition, Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev built a separate building with general funds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, this famous cultural institution located in the capital of Russia, stores many exhibits presented in the form of copies of first-class monuments, and students and other visitors learn how to correctly perceive sculpture using their examples.  This collection is also currently supported by private entrepreneurs. </p>

    <h2>  Second wife </h2><p>  Left alone with two children in his arms, Ivan decided to marry again and got married a year after the death of his first wife.  His new lover was <span>Maria Alexandrovna,</span> who wore the name Maine as a girl.  The woman lost her mother when she was in her infancy, so she was raised by one father, who in all respects was a remarkable person.  Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev loved his father-in-law and came to him with daily visits in order to share his thoughts about the museum. </p><p>  Maria, like his first wife, was an artistic person and knew several languages.  But this did not prevent her from being the closest associate and constant adviser to her husband in all his affairs and endeavors.  In this marriage, Ivan had two daughters - Marina and Anastasia.  Both of them were creative personalities, so they became famous writers. </p><p>  In 1903, Mary was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis - tuberculosis, from which she died three years later, leaving her husband with two minor daughters. </p><h2>  Bright memory </h2><p>  Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev survived his second wife for seven years.  Photos of his house, where he lived with his family, show that there is now a museum dedicated to the life of this creative family. </p>
