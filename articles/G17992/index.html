Actors after the release of the picture on the screen became real stars, and the beautiful cinema story still pleases the hearts of millions of viewers.  Recall today those who starred in this film. </p><h2>  The main character </h2><p>  This young man drove him crazy with his beauty; he was beautiful as the Greek god Apollo.  His name is Ichthyander.  From the first shots, the actor became the idol of the girls of the USSR.  Who played the role of a young dolphin man? </p><p>  Vladimir Korenev - actor (Amphibian Man is his most famous role) - was very young when he was invited to work in the cinema.  He did not know much, but his natural charm and beauty helped him.  On the set of the film, the actor tried to do without stuntmen, starred in difficult scenes on land and in water. </p><p>  Glory came immediately after the premiere of the film in 1962.  More than in any picture, the young actor failed to play like that.  His filmography in the 70-80 years.  extensive, but there were mostly episodic roles.  Kornev at that time began to pay more attention to theatrical works. </p><p>  Since the 2000s, the actor again began acting in modern cinema, playing the age-related roles of handsome elderly people. </p>

    <h2>  The first success of the beautiful Guttiere </h2><p>  Many Soviet viewers were impressed by the film Amphibian Man, the actors of this film still remember working with love and tenderness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Great success came to the actress, who played a major role.  She was the daughter of the famous singer and actor Vertinsky - Anastasia.  The girl was only 16 years old.  However, she was a written beauty, like her mother Lydia.  Later, the actress evaluated her work in this movie very condescendingly, indicating that she had a lot of teenage naivety and angularity.  However, those who were on the set with Vertinsky testified that the young actress devoted herself to work, diving into the sea along with experienced swimmers and was not afraid of any danger. </p>

    <h2>  Chief villain </h2><p>  A melodrama is impossible without villains, albeit fearless, screen, but still cruel, vengeful and ready to destroy the happiness of the main characters.  Such a hero was the image created by Mikhail Kozakov. </p><p>  The audience remembered all the actors of the movie "Amphibian Man", even such as the formidable Pedro Zurito, who became Guttiere's fianc√©. </p><p>  The actor himself with brilliance managed to play his purely negative image.  But even as a villain, Kazakov was very charming and also liked by women.  What to say!  The film turned out great, despite the fact that not all roles were positive. </p>

    <h2>  Amphibian Man: Supporting Actors </h2><p>  In addition to the images of the three main characters <span>(a couple in love</span> and one villain), the film has many bold creative works. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Nikolay Simonov</span> brilliantly coped with the role of an old professor, the father of a wonderful youth dolphin.  The professor serves science with all his heart and cannot conspire with people who have neither honor nor conscience. </p><p>  <span>Anatoly Smiranin</span> also brilliantly played the role of the father of the main character - the old sailor, who, because of poverty, is forced to give his beloved daughter to marry a rich man with a dubious reputation. </p><p>  <span>Vladlen Davydov</span> played the role of a young journalist, unrequitedly in love with the beautiful main character.  And although the girl does not share his feelings, most likely she will share his life and her fate with him, because this young journalist is unusually honest, noble and brave. </p>

    <p>  The film "Amphibian Man" has glorified itself to many, the actors and roles played by these people have forever inscribed themselves in the history of Russian cinema. </p><p>  In the film there are several very small, but memorable acting works.  Such, for example, is the work of actor <span>Stanislav Chekan,</span> who played the role of the guard Carlos, it was he who was the youth dolphin to escape from prison.  No less expressive is the role of a little girl from a zucchini singing a provocative song about sailors and sea devils.  This role was played by the young actress Nina Bolshakova. </p><p>  The film still has a lot of decent acting.  The filmmakers took care of this.  And it is not without reason that the picture ‚ÄúAmphibian Man‚Äù gained such fame in the USSR and beyond, the actors of this film attract the attention of the audience with their beauty, youth, charm and professional ability to transform. </p><p>  Such pictures do not die, and new generations of viewers find in them what they like: a touching story, an opportunity to relax with one‚Äôs soul, the joy of watching a kind and wonderful, albeit slightly naive, love story. </p>
