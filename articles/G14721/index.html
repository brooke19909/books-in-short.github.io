    <h2>  Budva </h2><p>  Choosing Montenegro resorts on the sea for relaxation, the vast majority of people stay in Budva.

    <h2>  Becici </h2><p>  Becici is a small resort village located just four kilometers from Budva.  From the tourist capital, you can walk here along the picturesque coastal promenade.  In Becici there is a beach with a length of about two kilometers, which in 1935 was recognized as the most beautiful beach in Europe.  Thus, even in those days, people admired magnificent Montenegro.  Hotels by the sea in this place are among the most luxurious in the whole country.  Here are the fashionable hotel complexes Queen of Montenegro and Splendid.  It is interesting that world-famous show business stars like to stay at the last hotel.  So, among the guests of ‚ÄúSplendid‚Äù there were Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Madonna, musicians from the group ‚ÄúThe Rolling Stones‚Äù and other celebrities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sveti Stefan </h2><p>  Looking at the resorts of Montenegro on the sea, willy-nilly pay attention to Sveti Stefan.  Photos of this island-hotel crown most of all Montenegro's tourist avenues.  This mini-resort, connected to the land by a narrow isthmus, belongs to a private company, and only guests can use its infrastructure.  Sveti Stefan is one of the most expensive hotels in Montenegro.  The island has preserved a lot of ancient buildings and structures, which inside were decorated in a modern style.  On the mainland, the city of Sveti Stefan itself is located, where everyone can find a hotel or apartment in accordance with their budget. </p>

    <h2>  Petrovac </h2><p>  Petrovac is a small resort town located 17 kilometers from Budva.  It is famous for its clean air, due to the fact that it is surrounded by conifers and olive groves.  There are two beautiful beaches: one sandy and the other pebble.  In general, despite the fact that this town has everything you need for life and relaxation, as well as a host of hotels for every taste, Petrovac is one of the quietest towns on the Montenegrin coast. </p><h2>  Bar </h2><p>  This city is one of the largest settlements on the Montenegrin coast of the Adriatic Sea.  There is a large port of international importance, and there is also a parking for yachts that can accommodate a thousand boats.  A passenger ferry departs regularly from Bar to Albania and Italy.  In general, it is a very modern city.  And life here does not freeze even in the winter season (unlike most other coastal settlements).  There are also historical sights here: Stary Grad with a mass of medieval buildings and structures, as well as the world's oldest <span>olive tree,</span> whose age exceeds two thousand years.  The beaches in the Bar are mostly pebble.  They differ in a gentle entry into the water, making it comfortable to relax with small children. </p><h2>  Kotor Bay </h2><p>  Montenegro resorts on the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis region include the following cities: Kotor, Tivat, Herceg Novi, Igalo, Perast and Risan.  This part of the country is characterized by picturesque nature and an abundance of historical and cultural monuments.  We offer a closer look at the main resorts in the region. </p>

    <h2>  Herceg Novi </h2><p>  This city is the largest settlement in the Bay of Kotor.  In addition, it is considered the most suitable both for life and for a beach holiday in this region.  So, the beaches here are very clean and well equipped.  They are divided into two types: pebble and platforms.  In addition, Herceg Novi has a lot of restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and hotels for every taste.  A large number of historical monuments are also concentrated here. </p><h2>  Igalo </h2><p>  Noteworthy are the sanatoriums of Montenegro on the sea, in particular, the Simo Milosevic Institute, located in Igalo.  This settlement is located seven kilometers from Herceg Novi.  The local medical center specializes in spinal problems and is very popular among Europeans. </p><h2>  Kotor </h2><p>  This city is a real <span>open-air museum.</span>  No wonder its ancient part was taken under the protection of UNESCO.  Kotor is surrounded by high mountains on one side and the sea on the other.  Many architectural monuments are concentrated here, among which one can distinguish the longest fortress wall in Europe.  This city is mainly visited for sightseeing purposes.  As for the beaches, there are few of them here, and the water is not as clean as in other areas of the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Tivat </h2><p>  This city has the only international airport on the coast.  Therefore, with a high degree of probability your plane to Montenegro will land in this city.  Tivat is also famous thanks to the huge marina built on its territory several years ago and the luxurious residential complex Porto Montenegro.  The city has a lot of boutiques, shops, cafes, bars and restaurants.  A beach holiday here is very modest.  For these purposes, only a narrow coastal strip with pebble or concrete coating is reserved. </p><h2>  Ulcinj </h2><p>  The Ulcinj Riviera is represented by only one city - Ulcinj.  This settlement is located in the very south of Montenegro, near the border with Albania.  Ulcinj is famous for its ecology, since there is not a single factory or factory within a radius of one hundred kilometers from the city.  Near this city is the world famous sandy Great Beach, whose length is 13 kilometers. </p><h2>  Montenegro resorts on the sea: prices, reviews </h2><p>  As for the cost of living on the coast of the amazing country of Montenegro, it varies in a very wide range.  So, if it‚Äôs not important for you to live in a hotel on the first line with a magnificent view of the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> then even at the peak of the season (July-August) you can easily find a place to live at a cost of 15-20 euros per day.  The upper limit of the price is practically unlimited and can reach several thousand euros per night. </p><p>  As you can see, there are the most diverse resorts of Montenegro on the sea.  Reviews about them are also very controversial.  However, when going on vacation, you should first clearly define what you want from the place where you plan to spend several days of the long-awaited vacation.  So, for example, going to the sea with a small child or an elderly mother and at the same time choosing a hotel in Budva, located in the city center, then you should not complain about the noise from bars and discos.  Or, planning a youth vacation and settling in a quiet Perast, you should not complain afterwards about the lack of entertainment in Montenegro as a whole. </p>
