Under this name, a number of characters are present in Greek mythology and history. </p><p>  One of them is Lycurgus of Sparta, the legislator to whom the ancient writers who dominated Sparta for several centuries have been credited with the political system. </p><h2>  Ancient deity </h2><p>  The information that has come down to us about the life of Lycurgus of Sparta, although numerous, is often quite contradictory.  Therefore, there are several theories of its origin.  Some authors generally believe that the name Lycurgus meant a very ancient, forgotten deity.  Initially, he was revered as a guardian of law and law.  And when famous lawmakers appeared in other Greek policies, in Sparta this god was transformed in the minds of people into a human legislator. </p><h2>  Real person </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bust of Lycurgus" class="if uuid-3122563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122563.jpg"></div><p>  But there is another opinion according to which this person was historical, enjoying divine honors, although his activity was embellished by fiction in folk tradition.  The origin of Lycurgus of Spartan is not known for certain.  But, according to many ancient authors, this man belonged to the royal family.  There is conflicting information about the life time and activities of Lycurgus of Sparta.  Their years are difficult to establish, but, as a rule, we are talking about 9-8 centuries BC.  e. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Plutarch, Herodotus, like other authors, give different lists of Spartan kings, according to which the legendary legislator came from the Euripontides dynasty.  He is considered as the uncle of the king Eunom, and as his grandson, and as a son.  The researchers explain such difficulties in genealogy by the fact that the Spartans had remnants of polyandry, in which two brothers could have one common wife. </p><h2>  Start of activity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.galleryofthemasters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heir to the throne" class="if uuid-3122547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122547.jpg"></div><p>  According to one version, after the death of his older brother Polydect, who was the king of Sparta, Lycurgus was in the role of the guardian of his little son Harilay.  According to Herodotus, the latter was called Leobot.  Enemies and enemies have accused the future legislator of wanting to usurp power. </p><p>  To avoid the consequences of their machinations, he went on a long journey before Harilay reached adulthood, leaving Sparta.  For a long time he lived on the island of Crete, where he studied the state system, which he later transferred to Sparta. </p><p>  There he met the poet Falet, who was well versed in matters of law.  Lycurgus also traveled to Egypt and the Greek cities of Asia Minor to study their laws and culture.  Returning to his homeland, suffering from troubles, at the request of his fellow countrymen, he began to carry out reforms of the state system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Favorite of the gods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shorthistory.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument in Brussels" class="if uuid-3122550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122550.jpg"></div><p>  As stated in the biographies of Lycurgus of Sparta, he enjoyed the support of the Delphic oracle.  The Pythia called him the favorite of the gods, saying that he is more a god than a human being.  The priestess of Apollo predicted that the laws that would be given to them by her people would be the best in the world.  Encouraged by such a prediction, Lycurgus decided to proceed with the transformation. </p><p>  One day he appeared in a popular assembly.  He was accompanied by thirty armed men who belonged to the most notable citizens of Sparta.  In all likelihood, these could be the elders of thirty clans ‚Äî the Dorian people consisted of them. </p><p>  At first Harilay suspected that Lycurgus was encroaching on his life, and fled, hiding in the temple of Pallas.  But then he became convinced that his uncle was not plotting anything against him, and began to help him. </p><h2>  Laws of Lycurgus of Spartan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.geni.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lawmaker Lycurgus" class="if uuid-3122570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122570.jpg"></div><p>  The ancient Greeks, and especially the Spartans, were inclined to attribute all the regulations that concerned the private and public life of Sparta to the reforms of Lycurgus.  Of the previous government bodies, he retained only the posts of two kings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main institutions introduced were the following: </p><ol><li>  The Council, consisting of 30 elders, which was called "gerusia".  It was the highest authority in the country.  It included citizens from the age of 60, who, together with the two kings, discussed and resolved all matters.  The kings were also members of gerusia.  They stood at the head of the army in wartime and were ministers of religious cults. </li><li>  The popular assembly - appella - adopted and rejected the decision of the council, electing geronts and other officials.  Consisted of those over 30 years old.  In the event of adverse decisions, it could be dissolved by Georgia.  It was collected once a month. </li><li>  The college, which included five ephors, elected for one year.  She exercised supreme control over the course of affairs in the state, possessing great power.  Eforians could convene gerusia and apella, led foreign policy, performed the functions of judges, monitored the implementation of laws.  They had the right to annul the decisions of the kings. </li></ol><h2>  Other innovations </h2><p>  And Lycurgus is attributed the adoption of such measures as: </p><ul><li>  division of all land into separate plots; </li><li>  the introduction of the Spartiates of a military organization; </li><li>  the establishment of severe discipline in the education of youth; </li><li>  participation in dinners at the common table; </li><li>  fight against displays of luxury. </li></ul><p>  According to the second of the laws of Lycurgus of Sparta, all land was completely divided between citizens, so that the distinction between the rich and the poor would be destroyed forever.  The entire Laconia now consisted of 30 thousand fields, and the lands located around Sparta - of 9 thousand. At the same time, each field had dimensions that could ensure the wealth of the family living on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spartan warriors" class="if uuid-3122557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122557.jpg"></div><p>  The Spartian community was turned into a military camp.  Its members obeyed strict discipline, all of them were obliged to carry out military service.  From 7 to 20 years, the boys were in public education, studying military affairs, accustomed to endurance, cunning, strict discipline.  From the age of 20, the Spartians became full members of the community.  Until the age of 60, they were required to serve in the army. </p><p>  Adults were supposed to participate in sissitiy - so-called public meals.  This helped to maintain the spirit of collectivism, and also weaned from luxury.  And also Spartan Lycurgus, according to legend, took silver and gold coins out of circulation and replaced them with heavy casings of iron, which contributed to their depreciation. </p><p>  And also the strictest ban was imposed: on luxury goods - on their production and consumption;  for the importation of any goods from other countries into Sparta. </p><h2>  Results of the reforms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hexapolis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycurgus Spartan" class="if uuid-3122569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122569.jpg"></div><p>  If the task is given: "Give a description of the Spartan laws of Lycurgus," then we can rely on the opinion of Greek philosophers, which is as follows. </p><p>  On the one hand, they praised his reforms, noting that they: </p><ul><li>  protect the state from unrest; </li><li>  serve as the rule of law; </li><li>  keep the people in strictness and obedience to the authorities. </li></ul><p>  On the other hand, shortcomings of laws were noted.  They led to the fact that: </p><ul><li>  the state was based on courage, and not on reason; </li><li>  gymnastics, the development of physical strength were valued higher than education; </li><li>  personal life was completely suppressed; </li><li>  there was no development of individual drives and abilities; </li><li>  each Spartan became only a member of the state organism, living according to his precepts; </li><li>  personal freedom was completely absorbed by the state, which was a military organization of the sovereign class. </li></ul><p>  The result of this was that immobility soon began to be observed in Sparta, and her life froze. </p><h2>  Justification for innovations </h2><p>  It should be noted that the Spartan institutions, which are attributed to the reforms of Lycurgus, aimed to give the Dorian tribe strength and cohesion. </p><p>  This was necessary for them so that they could in Laconia keep the conquered tribes in obedience, as well as seize primacy over other Greek states.  This required the awakening and strengthening of feelings of national unity among Spartan citizens. </p><p>  What contributed to the introduction of a solid state order;  the establishment of the same way of life, different from that led by other classes;  connection of this estate in one locality;  the exaltation of his military strength by strictly consistent discipline. </p><h2>  End of life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fragment of the monument" class="if uuid-3122561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3122561.jpg"></div><p>  After the reforms, the legislator Lycurgus of Sparta, having convened a popular assembly, announced that he was again going to Delphi.  He decided to ask the oracle about the success of his laws.  He took an oath from the kings and members of the gerusia that they would keep these laws before he returned to Sparta. </p><p>  Having made a sacrifice to Apollo, Lycurgus asked the oracle and in response he heard that his laws were good, that Sparta would be powerful, while its inhabitants would observe them.  The legislator sent a messenger to the homeland with this prophecy.  After that, he himself died.  One version tells that this happened in Elis, another calls Kirr the place of his death. </p><p>  There is a third, according to which Lycurgus ended his earthly journey on the island of Crete, starving himself to starvation.  So he did in order to preserve the laws he introduced.  Before his death, he bequeathed to burn his body, throwing ashes into the sea. </p><p>  Thus, he made sure that his remains could not be transported to Sparta, and its inhabitants could not be exempted from their oath and change the laws of Lycurgus.  In his homeland, they built a temple and gave honors, like a deity. </p>
