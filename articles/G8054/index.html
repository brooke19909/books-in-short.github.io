    <p>  Russian coins are divided by face value: from 10 kopecks to 25 rubles, as well as by the number of copies issued. </p><p>  Money made in large batches, which are found in any financial transactions, have no differences and are stamped according to one pattern, but in circulation there are commemorative coins of 2 rubles and other cash that differ from ordinary patterns.  The main difference can be seen on the back side, where instead of the "eagle" is placed a commemorative image of a city, person or event. </p><p>  Coins made on the occasion of significant dates, events or people mostly have obvious differences that can be easily noticed, but in some cases the differences are not so pronounced, and ordinary people miss expensive 2-year-old commemorative coins, giving fabulous amounts to the wrong hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why issue jubilee coins </h2>

    <p>  The bulk of the issued small-denominated money is not of great financial value, and all the significance is only to remind the inhabitants of the country that Russia is a truly great country that has achieved great success, showing its power to the whole world. </p><p>  Since 1997, the Russian Mint has issued more than 500 items, among which coins are not with small changes in the form of engravings, but with large drawings in honor of memorable events. </p><p>  Rare coins are interesting not so much in value as in the pattern depicted on them, which is made not just as an inscription, but as an image of the moment or person in whose honor the money is issued. </p><h2>  Commemorative coins of 2 rubles 2000 of release </h2>

    <p>  In 2000, money in denominations of 2 rubles in the anniversary series was issued by Moscow and St. Petersburg mints, but each of them was engaged in stamping individual series ordered specifically for him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The St. Petersburg <span>Mint</span> released the following list: commemorative coins of 2 rubles dedicated to Leningrad, Novorossiysk and Stalingrad.  <span>The Moscow court</span> was charged 2 rubles with views of Tula, Murmansk, Moscow and Smolensk. </p><p>  Solemn money of 2000 was made in honor of hero cities, and the design was carried out in such a way that events and moments that enabled the city to become a hero were stamped on coins. </p><p>  For example, Stalingrad gained great importance due to the rebuff of the fascist army and thereby rightfully earned the name of the hero city, and the mint minted 2 rubles with a picture of the battle against the background of destroyed buildings. </p><p>  Just 2-ruble jubilee coins were issued 10 million pieces, and the release date is May 4.  But, of course, it is impossible to stamp out such a quantity of copies in one day, and preparation began in advance. </p><h2>  The cost of anniversary coins of 2000 </h2><p>  The cost of any coins of the jubilee circulation depends on many factors, but the most important thing is the circulation of the issue.  However, in this case, the price of 2 rubles in 2000 may be affected not by the circulation, but by the condition of the coins.  Those items that are rarely seen in circulation are not very interesting for collectors in connection with their attrition.  However, if someone keeps the jubilee coins of Russia 2 rubles in good condition, you can sell them at a price of 100 to 150 rubles. </p><p>  In the event that 2 rubles have some defects, for example scratches, then it will be possible to sell it only to the numismatist who has been looking for this particular copy for a long time and cannot find it.  Then it will turn out to realize the coin at a reduced cost - about 3-5 times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The only fact that can cheer those who keep the commemorative coins of 2 rubles is the time, which will increase the cost of each copy several times, and our grandchildren will be able to sell this money for a rather impressive amount. </p><h2>  Anniversary coin 2 rubles 2012 </h2>

    <p>  The next batch of jubilee money was released in 2012, and the money was directed to the production of coins on a military theme. </p><p>  Commemorative coins of 2 rubles in 2012 were issued in 16 different versions: </p><ol><li>  Field Marshal Barclay de Tolly. </li><li>  General Wittgenstein. </li><li>  General Bagration. </li><li>  Head Captain Durova. </li><li>  General Bennigsen </li><li>  General Davydov. </li><li>  General Ermolov. </li><li>  General Dokhturov. </li><li>  General Kutaisov. </li><li>  General Platov. </li><li>  The organizer of the partisans Kozhina. </li><li>  General Miloradovich. </li><li>  General Raevsky. </li><li>  General Ostarman-Tolstoy. </li><li>  General Alexander 1. </li><li>  General Kutuzov. </li></ol><p>  Commemorative coins of this series on the reverse side have a distinct portrait of a general or other commander, as well as an inscription with his name to increase recognition. </p><h2>  The cost of anniversary coins of 2012 release </h2><p>  Money of small cash, issued in 2012, does not have a lot of value.  To sell such a coin for a large reward will not work.  However, if there is a great desire to realize a jubilee coin, then first you need to make sure its perfect condition. </p><p>  The numismatist, who agreed to buy such an instance, will carefully consider it in order to get the perfect coin, and ordinary (jammed) coins today continue to be in circulation and have already worn out. </p><p>  The cost of the ideal version of the 2012 anniversary coin is about 30, plus or minus 10 rubles, but this is only in the case of its pristine condition, and if there are frayed, then you need to wait for better times. </p><h2>  Two-ruble coins of Gagarin </h2>

    <p>  Any resident of the country is proud that Russia (at that time the USSR) went around the USA in the space race and became the first country to send a man into outer space.  In honor of the anniversary of this important event for the whole country and each individual resident, the mints were instructed to issue a new series of coins with the image of a hero, their circulation amounted to 20 million pieces. </p><p>  Due to the large number of coins issued, each of them does not have a high value, however, the significance of this event proves the value that the Gagarin commemorative coin of 2 rubles represents not only for numismatists, but also for ordinary consumers. </p><p>  The jubilee coin of the first cosmonaut looks like the usual 2 rubles, but if you turn it upside down (with an eagle), you can see that there is a stamped portrait of Gagarin on the background of a flying star, the date is April 12, 61 and a large signature of the pilot himself. </p><p>  The price category of these coins varies greatly due to the fact that the entire issued quantity was distributed between the St. Petersburg and Moscow mints.  However, on some copies there is no manufacturer‚Äôs signature at all, and their cost varies from 800 to 3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Commemorative precious metal coins </h2>

    <p>  Various commemorative coins are issued periodically, which are stamped in memory of events or people who influenced the course of events, but there are not just limited copies, but units issued from precious metals. </p><p>  Naturally, the limited nature of such series makes the numismatists begin a real hunt, however, the owners of these coins are in no hurry to tell everyone about their amazing find and carefully hide this information.  Nonetheless, precious metal coins (gold and silver) are valued at fabulous amounts. </p><p>  There are a rather large number of gold and <span>silver coins</span> in limited editions, but the cost of 1 copy can be tens, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of rubles, which already indicates the financial value of these and does not allow simple numismatists to enrich the collection with such a model.  For example: a gold coin with a face value of 50 rubles in 2014, issued in honor of M. Yu. Lermontov, whose value is about 25 thousand rubles, or 100 rubles, issued in honor of the victory over the Nazis in the Battle of Stalingrad, whose value is 108 thousand rubles.  However, it is worth remembering that there are only a few of them. </p><p>  There are many other examples of small-scale money of 5, 10, 50 rubles, but the price of this element can be more than a million.  For example, a coin of 1,000 rubles issued in honor of the history of money circulation costs 1,550,000 rubles. </p>
