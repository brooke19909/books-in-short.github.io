An ideal idea for a walk would be a family trip to the park or forest belt.  After such adventures, kids bring home a lot of natural materials that should not be thrown away right away.  What can be made from chestnut at home will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be made from chestnut" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/332391.jpg" width="386"></div>

    <h2>  The benefits of collecting natural materials </h2><p>  If children make crafts from chestnuts with their own hands, they develop <span>fine motor skills</span> very quickly <span>,</span> and their flexibility and tenacity are enhanced.  Such activities will help to discipline the child and to educate in him creative skills and a sense of beauty.  Games with natural materials bring children and parents together.  If there is no free time for full communication, such joint gatherings will help the child cope with complex feelings. </p><p>  Before studying what can be made from chestnut, it is worth preparing material for future crafts.  To collect fruits, it is worth taking a small plastic bag with you, and you need to choose still soft, only fallen copies.  They are much easier to hole with a needle or cut with a knife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself chestnuts" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/332390.jpg?1392171409344" width="319"></div>

The chestnuts will need to be sorted by size and supplemented with other natural materials, such as twigs, pebbles, dry berries.  Matches, toothpicks, cocktail tubes and a sharp knife are also useful.  Raw fruits are excellently cut, and the child can be entrusted with stringing them on a strong thread to create amazingly beautiful beads.  If the collected chestnuts have become solid, you can stand them in water for 24 hours and then hold them in wet tissue for about a day.  To fasten the fruits, use strong threads, fishing line, matches, toothpicks or ordinary plasticine.  When thinking about what can be made of chestnut, most parents immediately choose complex, impressive works, such as baskets, complex figures or whole rugs.  For children, it will be much more useful if you first try out some simple model. </p><h2>  What can be made of chestnut quickly? </h2><p>  A very simple option would be a long caterpillar, assembled from fruits of approximately equal size and decorated with plasticine parts.  A child can string chestnuts himself and blind his eyes to a new toy.  For kids older than 4-5 years old, you can advise making a horse.  This will require several prepared fruits, an awl (for making holes), strong thick threads, matches or suitable twigs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY chestnut crafts" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/332392.jpg?1392171443553" width="379"></div>

    <p>  The body and head are made of large chestnuts, which need to be fastened together with matches or toothpicks.  Legs are made from strong twigs, and the mane and tail can be cut from durable woolen threads.  Holes are made in the marked places with an awl and all the details are collected in a nice little horse.  The mane can simply be glued so as not to suffer with fixing each bundle of threads.  In such a simple way, you can take your favorite child for half an hour or an hour, and also learn something new by yourself. </p>
