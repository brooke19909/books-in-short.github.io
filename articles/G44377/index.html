So, what can Kemer offer (photos, reviews and information are presented below)? </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Kemer is a famous Turkish beach resort located on the Mediterranean coast.  Until 1910, there were only a few poor villages on its territory that constantly suffered from seasonal debris flow from the mountains.  The situation has changed dramatically after the construction of protective structures in the form of a stone belt.  He gave the name to the future resort, which began to develop rapidly from the beginning of the 1990s.  Since that time, thousands of Russians have visited Kemer hotels, reviews of which are rarely negative. </p><p>  Today at this resort you can find accommodation options for every taste and budget, therefore it is one of the most affordable places for a beach holiday in Turkey. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Holidays in Kemer (reviews see below) are attractive primarily because most hotels operate on the all-inclusive system so beloved by Russians.  Moreover, the resort has options for both youth and family vacations.  In the latter case, however, tourists should know that Kemer beaches are pebble.  This fact makes them not the best place to relax with kids.  At the same time, some hotels have loose sandy beaches, however, pebbles still begin at the water's edge, which is a source of potential danger to children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  3 star Kemer hotels </h2><p>  In confirmation of the above about the democratic nature of this resort, one can cite as an example many hotels from the "3 stars" category, which offer quite comfortable holidays at low prices.  For example, positive comments can be heard at the Garden Rose Hotel, which is located 200 meters from the beach near the village of Chamyuva. </p><p>  In addition, those who are interested in Turkey, Kemer, hotels "3 stars" (read the reviews below), it makes sense to pay attention to the hotel Ring Beach.  Its guests are always satisfied with the level of service and rooms, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich starts from 21 square meters.  There are restaurants, a conference room, bars, two swimming pools, <span>water slides, a</span> children's paddling pool, a jacuzzi, an amphitheater, a sauna, massage, a Turkish steam bath, a gym, a tennis court and billiards.  All this, according to most vacationers, allows you to classify Ring Beach as a category of four, not three stars. </p><p>  Good options are also Residence Rivero and Belle Vue (Kemer 3).  Reviews indicate an excellent level of service, excellent cuisine and proximity to the sea. </p><p>  Budget holidays can also be organized in the following hotels: </p><p>  - Sailor's Park Hotel.  This place enjoys the reputation of the best hotel for senior citizens, as there is a quiet cozy atmosphere, but there is no children's animation, so families with children rarely go there.  Among the pluses, tourists also note diet food, the friendliness of the staff and their own orange garden.  In addition, most vacationers are delighted with the gorgeous mountain views that open from the windows of most rooms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - Larissa Akman Park.  It is a good choice to organize a holiday in Kemer.  Reviews indicate that Larissa Akman Park is a good place for lovers of a relaxing time away from noisy youth companies.  The hotel has a small but beautifully landscaped area.  The only drawback that most vacationers note is the lack of meat dishes on the menu and the poor assortment of fruits offered. </p><p>  - Queen Mary.  The hotel is located in the center of Kemer, 250 meters from a public pebble beach with convenient access to the sea.  It operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Meals: three meals a day (buffet).

All these requirements meet the hotels in the resort of Kemer (4 stars).  Reviews of tourists usually indicate as their main advantage proximity to the sea, delicious cuisine and vast territory.  The latter circumstance is connected with the fact that most of these hotels were built at a time when Kemer was just becoming a resort, so the land there was cheap, and developers could afford large-scale construction. </p><p>  More specifically, for example, Golden Lotus (Kemer) is an excellent choice.  Reviews of tourists indicate that there you can have a wonderful rest with kids of any age.  It is located just 150 meters from the beach and offers its guests a variety of activities, including water. </p><p>  When considering Kemer 4 hotels, reviews of which vary, among the most successful holiday options are also usually called Gelidonya, Armas Beach and Eldar Resort.

    <p>  The Kemer hotels are also a good option: </p><p>  - <span>Sherwood Greenwood Resort.</span>  <span>The hotel</span> is very popular with young people who come to rest in Kemer.  Reviews suggest that there is excellent animation and cuisine that suits even people who consider themselves to be gourmets.  Among the advantages of the hotel, one can also note the presence of Russian-speaking staff.  The hotel is well suited for family vacations, even despite the fact that many tourists do not recommend choosing Kemer for families with children.  Reviews indicate that this is not the case with Sherwood Greenwood Resort, especially when it comes to schoolchildren.  The kids like the mini-disco and mini-club, where various competitions and outdoor games are organized for them. </p><p>  - <span>Ambassador Plaza</span> Hotel.  The hotel is located only 75 meters from the beach, and at the same time, the city center can be reached on foot within 5-7 minutes.  It is a relatively quiet and comfortable place with excellent cuisine.  In addition, it is within walking distance from the yacht parking and the luxurious Moonlight Park.  The reviews also indicate the presence of a convenient ramp for entering the water on the beach and the fact that they do not serve alcohol there, so you can safely sunbathe and splash into the sea, without fear that your vacation will be spoiled by an undesirable neighborhood. </p><p>  - Magic Dream.  Despite the claimed 4 stars, many tourists believe that this is, rather, an option for a solid ‚ÄúC grade‚Äù.  But even this does not detract from the merits of Magic Dream.  In particular, vacationers note that this hotel is distinguished by good service, cleanliness of rooms and territory, as well as a good location.  After all, it is located just a few minutes from the city center!  However, sometimes you can hear negative reviews.  First of all, they relate to the lack of entertainment, which, however, is more than offset by the presence of numerous nightclubs, bars and discos within walking distance of the complex.  In addition, it‚Äôs not so bad when you return to your room in the evening to relax and not toss and turn in bed to the sounds coming from the midnight disco by the pool, which is located directly under your windows. </p><p>  - Elite Life.  This is a suburban hotel, which is located 5 km from Kemer, just 80 m from the beach.  It offers tourists a sauna, a water slide, a restaurant, three bars, an adult and a children's pool, a massage parlor, a hammam, a beauty salon, a cinema, and a gym.  Elite Life was renovated in 2014.  As a result, new furniture, plumbing, TVs and air conditioners were installed there.  According to tourists who have already used the services of the Elite Life Hotel, its staff does its job well and is helpful with customers.  As for the shortcomings, guests usually note a meager assortment of fruits and a predominance of dishes with soya meat substitutes.  At the same time, they praise the work of bakers who delight guests with a variety of delicious pastries, including traditional Turkish confectionery products, known throughout the world.  Thus, this hotel is one of the best, based on value for money. </p><p>  - Paloma Beach.  The hotel is among the suburban and operates on an all-inclusive basis.  It is an excellent option for those who are looking for a cozy and quiet place for families.  In addition, tourists from Western Europe usually choose it, so there is less risk of stumbling upon a not sober compatriot, which many Russians consider Paloma Beach to be among the indisputable advantages.  Reviews also indicate excellent cuisine, which is dominated by meat dishes, which is not typical for Kemer hotels.  A lot of praise can be heard at the famous fish restaurant Paloma Beach, where they are allowed only by appointment and offer to try delicious and freshest seafood. </p>

    <h2>  Imperial Sunland, Kemer: reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is very popular among all categories of vacationers.  Judging by the reviews, Kemera resort guests are especially delighted with the well-groomed vast territory and the presence of an underground gallery that leads directly to the beach.  Tourists also note very tasty cuisine in the relatively inexpensive thematic restaurants ‚ÄúImperial Sunland‚Äù and the spaciousness of the rooms with a modern interior design.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As for the shortcomings, the main one, according to most guests, is the careless cleaning of the premises, as well as not the best quality of service and an unpredictable attitude of the staff towards the guests. </font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Turkey, Kemer, hotels: catering reviews </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many of the Russian tourists going on vacation to hot countries hope to enjoy plenty of fresh fruits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kemer will not disappoint in this regard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reviews of tourists indicate that in local hotels, regardless of category, excellent cuisine and a large selection of tropical fruits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there is one big drawback. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is associated with the lack of real meat in the menu, since the meat dishes leave the impression of being made from soy, and it is impossible to order, for example, chicken.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Excursions in Kemer </font></font></h2><p> Almost all resort hotels at the request of customers can help with organizing interesting excursions to local attractions.  For example, the ruins of Phaselis, an ancient city surrounded by the majestic trees of the natural park, are of great interest to tourists.  There is an ancient amphitheater and fortress walls, cobbled streets with the remains of houses and public buildings, which are more than one thousand years old.  It is worth visiting Olympos, founded in the second century AD, to see the incredibly beautiful Beldibi cave complex, and also to climb the fiery mountain Yanartash, which rises above the town of Cirali. </p>
