    <h2>  Modes </h2><p>  Available, as already mentioned, 4 modes.  Among them: intensive, IVF program, "3 in 1" mode and a short wash.  The first allows you to clean even the most contaminated dishes with dried food.  The cycle lasts 130 minutes.  A short wash is necessary in order to quickly wash lightly soiled dishes.  The main thing is that there should not be particles of starch on it.  The IVF program is needed if the dishes are practically uncontaminated. </p><p>  Then what is the difference between this mode and the previous one?  The fact that, working in this mode, the machine can cope with starch.  The cycle lasts 160 minutes.  The "3 in 1" mode, as a rule, is considered everyday by many owners.  Thanks to him, you can cope with both complex pollution and lungs.  The cycle time is 160 minutes.  It should be noted that each of the modes works with the drying function, except for a short wash. </p><h2>  Hansa ZIM 636 EH </h2><p>  This model - the <span>built-in</span> Hansa <span>dishwasher</span> (good reviews about it) works with 14 sets of dishes.  It has 6 programs, electronic type control, received a child lock and leakage protection.  Has a delayed start option. </p>
