This bank offers its customers a huge range of services.  If you wish, you can get a loan or a credit card, get a mortgage and much more.  Also, many are interested in <span>Sberbank's</span> accumulative <span>deposits for individuals.</span>  But before you start using this product, you should choose the most profitable and convenient.  You also need to clarify the conditions and interest rates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank's name" class="if uuid-3166264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166264.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose the most profitable contribution: reviews </h2><p>  Any offer of the bank is designed for the target audience.  This means that each person can choose the tariff that will be most convenient for him.  Clients who have already opened a funded deposit at Sberbank give mixed reviews.  Most recommend a thorough study of all conditions.  For example, you can open an non-refillable account and firmly believe that it is permissible to report amounts to it during the term of the contract.  It should be borne in mind that the rate is mainly on non-renewable options, but the inability to add to the deferred funds still some part of many repels the bank from such an offer. </p><p>  Also in the reviews note that it is necessary to clarify the rate and the ability to withdraw funds through an ATM.  It is more convenient for someone to open an accumulative deposit in Sberbank by depositing the entire amount at once and not touching it until the contract expires.  Others prefer to be able to use the funds deposited.  Therefore, before contacting a financial institution, it‚Äôs worth several times to think about choosing a more interesting product for yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sberbank savings deposits for individuals: design features </h2><p>  In order to start using this product, you need to contact an employee of a financial institution and provide him with a Russian passport.  After this, a contract is concluded.  Users recommend that you carefully study it.  Perhaps in the document the client will see the features of the conditions that seem to him unprofitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetaxguys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pig in hand" class="if uuid-3166258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166258.jpg"></div><p>  You can send an application for opening such an account via the Internet.  To do this, just log in to your personal account and find the appropriate section.  However, this method is suitable for those who are already cooperating with the bank.  For example, if a person has a debit card or other products of a financial institution. </p><p>  After signing all the papers on the citizen, an account is opened to which funds are deposited.  The terms of use of the savings deposit in Sberbank directly depend on the selected tariff. </p><h2>  "Happy year" </h2><p>  This offer is advantageous in that you can deposit not only rubles, but also foreign currency.  But the condition for opening such a deposit is that the minimum amount should be at least 150 thousand rubles or 3 thousand US dollars or euros.  If rubles are used, then the storage period of funds is 9 months at 10%.  When using the currency, the cumulative interest on a deposit at Sberbank will be 3.1% (for dollars) or 2% (euros).  A foreign currency deposit is made for a longer period, namely from 10 to 18 months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúSave‚Äù </h2><p>  This offer can be called classic.  In this case, you can also use both the ruble account and open for foreign currency.  It is worth noting that this savings deposit in Sberbank can not be replenished.  It is also unacceptable to withdraw funds from the account before the expiration of the period specified in the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3166261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166261.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantage is that you can open a deposit with only one thousand rubles, 100 euros or dollars.  But such contributions are usually rarely made by anyone, since they bring too little profit.  According to users, it will be most beneficial to deposit from 100 to 400 thousand rubles for a period of 3 years.  In this case, the benefit will be 8.44% per year.  There is also capitalization for this proposal.  This means that the percentage can be increased to 9.07%. </p><p>  When storing US dollars or euros, a rate of 2.22% and 1.17%, respectively, is provided. </p><h2>  "Replenish" </h2><p>  This is a replenished savings deposit in Sberbank.  It is in demand, since in this case it is possible to keep the down payment as well as to periodically report the funds.  The term for opening such a deposit is from 3 months to 3 years and depends on the wishes of the client.  You can make a deposit in national currency, the amount of which should be more than one thousand rubles.  If the client wishes, he has the right to deposit foreign currency.  In this case, the minimum contribution amount is 100 dollars or euros.  The interest rate will be 2.07% or 1.07%. </p><p>  Many note that this savings contribution of Sberbank of Russia is also convenient in that it can be replenished by bank transfer.  There are no restrictions.  This means that for such operations it is not necessary to leave the house.  Everything can be done over the Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cin.ba" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-3166262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166262.jpg"></div><p>  Also, this tariff implies capitalization, due to which the annual amount will be 8.07%.  The client may refuse this service.  In this case, he will receive interest on a monthly basis.  Other conditions are no different from the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù tariff plan. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúManage‚Äù </h2><p>  This tariff is provided for those who may require money on deposit.  To open an account, you need to deposit at least 30 thousand rubles into it.  With capitalization, the maximum possible percentage will be 7.31%.  This is less than when using other tariffs.  But do not forget that in this case, the client can partially use the finances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="navva.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money in hand" class="if uuid-3166266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166266.jpg"></div><p>  As in other cases, when opening such a deposit, you can make dollars or euros.  The amount of currency must be at least 1,000. If a dollar deposit is opened, the rate will be 1.8%, for an account in euros - 0.86%. </p><h2>  "Pension" </h2><p>  When considering savings accounts and deposits of Sberbank, it is worth paying attention to this tariff.  It is suitable for pensioners who are willing to make payments from the state on their deposit.  An investment can last up to 3 years.  At the same time, older clients can both withdraw money and replenish the deposit.  If the capitalization service is activated, then for the year from such a deposit you can get 3.67%. </p><h2>  "Multicurrency" </h2><p>  According to this proposal, the client is not obliged to choose in which currency the deposit will be opened.  He has the right to make several deposits at once.  It is very comfortable.  If we talk about interest rates, then on the ruble account you can get up to 6.88% per annum.  When opening a deposit in dollars, a rate of 1.78% is assumed.  For making a euro, the client receives up to 0.91% per year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bitsonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two ATMs" class="if uuid-3166265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166265.jpg"></div><p>  Deposits can be opened for 1-2 years.  At the same time, they can be replenished without problems.  But it is worth paying attention that this tariff does not imply withdrawing funds before the expiration of the contract. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúJust 7%‚Äù </h2><p>  This is another interesting offer from Sberbank.  In this case, the deposit is opened for a period of 5 months, provided that at least 100,000 rubles are paid.  During this time, money cannot be withdrawn or deposited.  The interest rate will be 7%.  With this option, capitalization is not foreseen.  If the client decides to terminate the agreement ahead of schedule, then in this case the income rate will decrease to 0.01%.  Therefore, before opening such an account, you should weigh your financial situation several times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank logo" class="if uuid-3166263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166263.jpg"></div><p>  Also in Sberbank you can open a standard savings account.  It also includes the storage of interest.  In this case, the client makes any amount that can be withdrawn.  It is allowed to replenish the account.  It is very comfortable.  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the possibility of early termination of the contract and making less profit.  However, the rates with such a contribution are not the highest.  For example, a client receives from 1.5 to 2.3% per annum on a ruble account.  If we are talking about US dollars or euros, then the percentage will be from 0.1 to 0.4.  An account can be opened indefinitely, so no serious restrictions are provided. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Bank deposits allow you to make an annual profit due to the fact that the money is stored in a financial institution.  If a person has savings that he does not plan to spend yet, then a deposit can be a great way to increase this amount.  Sberbank is a time-tested organization, so millions of citizens trust it with their finances. </p>
