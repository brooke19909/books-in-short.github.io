There may be several reasons for this.  But if the device is no more than 5 years old, as a rule, the sources of the problem are commonplace and you can fix them without the help of a wizard.  If the refrigerator does not turn on, this article will describe the causes and solutions. </p><h2>  Where to start the repair? </h2><p>  As a rule, the master, when he arrives on a call, first turns on the device in the network and looks at the light bulb: it is on or not.  With this, it is worth starting when carrying out self-repair. </p><p>  If the light does not light, this may be due to a lack of current.  Accordingly, the cause must be sought in its source. </p><p>  Procedure: </p><ol><li>  Unplug the refrigerator. </li><li>  Inspect the outlet.  If no visible defects are found, check for current in it with an <span>indicator screwdriver.</span> </li><li>  If the outlet is working, it is necessary to check the wire and plug of the device itself.  If there are visible tears, it is best to change the cord completely, and not cut and twist it with electrical tape, such a repair does not meet safety requirements.  If the cord is not visually damaged, it must be called with a multimeter and replaced if necessary. </li></ol><h2>  Network instability </h2><p>  There may be a problem in the power source even if the light in the refrigerator is on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the refrigerator does not turn on" class="if uuid-1399704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399704.jpg?1541445470"></div><p>  Modern refrigerators, both imported and domestic, are designed for a certain voltage in the network, which may differ from what is actually supplied.  In case of differences or inconsistencies, such units operate intermittently.  Power surges can occur even if a neighbor carries out repairs using an electric drill.  To dampen sudden changes in the network, it is best to connect expensive equipment through voltage regulators.  This will maintain the correct operability of the device and increase its service life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thermostat malfunction </h2><p>  Damage to the temperature control system is one of the common failures in such equipment.  With this breakdown, the refrigerator does not ‚Äúclick‚Äù, that is, there are no attempts by the compressor to start and start working. </p><p>  Modern refrigerators have two temperature control systems: a thermostat in mechanical models and a sensor in digital refrigerators.  In simple terms, as soon as the temperature begins to rise in the <span>freezer</span> , a signal is sent to the device, which causes the refrigerator engine to start. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the refrigerator turns on and off" class="if uuid-1399706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399706.jpg?1541445470"></div><p>  It is not difficult to check the temperature regulator - it is connected by a terminal and there are only two wires.  Usually the sensor is located next to the light bulb, in one unit.  Disconnect the wires and short them.  If the compressor starts working from this action, the cause of the malfunction is found.  Fixing it is simple enough.  You must buy in a specialized store a part that is out of order.  It is best to come with an old component to precisely select the right model.  The average price is about 1,500 rubles.  Replace a failed element with a new one.  It is only worth remembering that all repair work can only be carried out with the device turned off from the network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The refrigerator does not turn on after defrosting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the refrigerator turns on immediately" class="if uuid-1399707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399707.jpg?1541445470"></div><p>  A similar malfunction can occur after the standard procedure.  It may be that the defrosting process took place as usual: after the shutdown, the appliance was washed and dried, but when it was connected to the network, it did not freeze, although all the sensors are turned on and indicate operability.  There are several likely causes for this situation: </p><ol><li>  A freon leak is a methane-based refrigerant: it is it that creates the cold in the unit.  If a depressurization of the system occurs, the compressor starts to chase air for nothing and can easily fail from overheating.  Most often, a leak occurs due to mechanical damage. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="refrigerator compressor does not turn on" class="if uuid-1399708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399708.jpg?1541445470"></div></li><li>  The cooling system is clogged, so Freon simply can not circulate freely.  This is a consequence of defrosting and subsequent cleaning and washing.  To eliminate it, you need to clean all the tubes, change the filter.  You should not undertake this work yourself, it is better to contact the service center and call a professional foreman at home.  Since for such repairs you will need special equipment - a compressor pump. </li></ol><p>  Another reason, quite common, is the breakdown of the compressor, which is considered the "heart" of the device and is intended for circulation of freon.  And here, too, without the help of a specialist can not do. </p><h2>  Compressor out of order </h2><p>  If the light in the refrigeration equipment is on, while characteristic clicks are heard, and the refrigerator does not turn on, then almost always the reason is in the compressor.  It is difficult to independently verify and diagnose this failure without experience.  Therefore, to identify a problem, it is best to call a qualified technician who will diagnose the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the refrigerator turns on and off immediately" class="if uuid-1399705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399705.jpg?1541445470"></div><p>  If the refrigerator turns on and off almost immediately, the compressor may also be the cause.  Most likely, there was a short circuit in the inter-turn winding.  Therefore, the compressor operates in high mode and heats up very much.  At this moment, a protective relay is activated, and the refrigerator turns on immediately.  In modern models, the compressor is a non-separable part, so you have to change it completely.  Often such repairs are impractical, and it is more profitable to buy a new refrigerator. </p><h2>  Start-up relay failed </h2><p>  This is a common cause of failure, which does not turn on the compressor of the refrigerator.  This part is responsible for starting the motor when it receives a signal from the thermostat.  If the relay is broken, it must be replaced.  This is not an expensive part that you can replace yourself. </p><h2>  Control module malfunctioning </h2><p>  If everything described above during the diagnosis was not confirmed, then most likely the control module in the refrigerator failed - a kind of device brain.  This can happen even with a completely new technique, since the voltage in modern networks leaves much to be desired and even a slight jump can cause a breakdown.  Typical behavior of the device: the refrigerator turns on and off immediately, because the signals to the compressor arrive in a random mode.  In this case, the electronic board must be replaced. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="refrigerator does not turn on reasons" class="if uuid-1399710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1399710.jpg?1541445470"></div><p>  But it is worth noting that for any reason of failure, when the refrigerator does not turn on and the consumer is little versed in this technique, it is better to call a qualified craftsman.  The professional has the necessary equipment, will make the necessary diagnostics and repair the unit.  It will be much simpler and cheaper, since the layman can simply spend time and extra money on the purchase of unnecessary parts. </p>
