You no longer have to stand in line and withdraw cash from your account, you can simply insert the card into a special terminal.  Now, the developers have made it possible to pay for purchases from a mobile phone.  For each smartphone manufacturer, certain conditions must be met.  To learn how to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card, it is recommended to read the article to the end. </p><h2>  What is Apple Pay? </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most convenient payment system in the world, developed by Apple, to pay for purchases using contactless payments.  It is suitable for use with both credit and debit cards.  Which devices support Apple Pay?  You can pay for purchases from the iPhone, starting with version 6, including iPhone SE.  Also, before that, you need to make sure that the device is updated to iOS 9 and above.  Using Apple Pay is completely free and safe.  When you add a plastic card, an account number is created on the device.  He is unique.  For payment, the mobile payment system uses the device account number instead of the credit or debit card number. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is Apple Pay?" class="if uuid-2931723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2931723.jpg"></div><h2>  Application setup </h2><p>  How to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card through the application?  To do this, go to the App Store.  Next, you need to find and download the Wallet program on your iPhone.  It is specially designed to store all data.  Open the application and add a bank card by clicking the plus sign on top.  The program will offer to scan data using the phone‚Äôs camera or enter it manually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wallet app" class="if uuid-2931737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2931737.jpg"></div><p>  If you are a user of the Sberbank Online application, there is a special icon opposite the cards that you can use to pay via Apple Pay.

The bank will send a message with the code necessary to pass the check.  After authorization, you can pay for purchases in the store or online services using an iPhone. </p><p>  The first card you add to Apple Pay is automatically used by default.  To select another, you need to go to the "Settings" section of the Wallet application on the iPhone.  After adding the card, you can use it as usual, as before. </p><h2>  Instruction for use </h2><p>  How to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card?" class="if uuid-2931725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2931725.jpg"></div><p>  To pay using Touch ID, you must perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  On the locked phone, press the Home button twice. </li><li>  Select the required card from the list. </li><li>  Place your finger on the Touch ID fingerprint scanner or enter a password. </li><li>  Bring the phone to the contactless reader at the checkout. </li><li>  At this point, the data will be read and the purchase will be paid. </li></ol><p>  If you are the owner of later versions of smartphones, for example iPhone X, you can also use contactless payments, but without having to put your finger on it.  How to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card using Face ID?  Procedure: </p><ol><li>  To use the default card in the Wallet app, double-click the side button. </li><li>  Look at your iPhone for authentication. </li><li>  Instead of the previous step, you can enter a password. </li><li>  Bring the top of the iPhone to a special terminal for contactless payments. </li></ol><p>  After a successful operation, a notification will be sent to your phone with the amount, date and place of transaction. </p><p>  Also, for contactless payment on an unlocked iPhone, you can immediately go to the Wallet application, select the required card, put your finger on the Touch ID and bring the gadget to the terminal. </p><h2>  Places of application </h2><p>  Where and how to pay with an iPhone instead of a bank card?  You can use Apple Pay all over the world, where a contactless data reading system is installed.  In addition to shops, supermarkets, you can pay for purchases on the Internet.

This technology is very simple and convenient.  With its help, users of iPhones can pay almost anywhere in the world.  Now there is no need to carry plastic cards with you all the time, remember a pin code or fill out all the data every time you pay in online stores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inverse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application setup" class="if uuid-2931728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2931728.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to convenience and mobility, contactless payment technology is safe.  When using Apple Pay, merchants, cashiers in the store, and other people will never see your name, card number, or security code. </p><p>  Another undoubted advantage in using Apple Pay is that in order to pay with an iPhone, you do not need to connect to the Internet.  All data is stored in the phone itself.  A significant drawback is the impossibility of making a payment if the gadget is empty and there is no card at hand. </p><h2>  Some features </h2><p>  In case of loss of the card tied to Apple Pay, you must contact the bank office or call the hotline and block it.  After that, for some time it will become unavailable for payment via Apple Pay.  You can delete data from the Wallet app yourself. </p><p>  Also, after payment you can make a refund if for any reason the purchased goods did not fit.  These steps are the same as if you paid directly through a plastic card without using a phone.  To make a refund, it is recommended to present the check and the device from which the purchase was made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to pay with an iPhone without a credit card?" class="if uuid-2931720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2931720.jpg"></div><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  This method of payment can be used not only by users of iPhones.  Other mobile payment services have been developed for other devices: Google Pay and Samsung Pay.  They can be used on Android phones and Samsung gadgets, respectively. </p>
