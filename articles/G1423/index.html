  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The city of Talitsa is a small settlement with great potential and interesting history.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the right bank of the Pyshma River, 219 kilometers from Yekaterinburg is the city of Talitsa.  This is a small but cozy town, where about 16 thousand people live.  The total occupied area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement is 4459 square kilometers, with mostly wooden buildings. </p><p>  The climate is continental, in January the average temperature is ‚Äì17 degrees, and in July +17. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The village began to form at the beginning of the XVIII century.  There are beautiful fertile lands, so distillery was opened.  After the private cookery began to bring good income, the state became interested in the enterprise.  And already by the 70th year of the 18th century, the empress had launched a state-owned enterprise here, which constantly passed from hand to hand, then was private, then again returned to state ownership. </p><p>  In the XIX century, a railway station opens, and the village grows.  In the war period (in 1942), the village becomes the city of Talitsa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voda.molodostivivat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of the national park" class="if uuid-2258978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2258978.jpg"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The village is located among the forests.  There is also a national park ‚ÄúPrypyshminsky Bor‚Äù, with vast areas of pine forests.  In the protected area you can find many unique animals and birds.  The park was created in 1993, it occupies almost 49 thousand hectares.  There is practically no undergrowth in the forest, mainly lichens.  There are also many mushrooms and berries.  The park has a freshwater lake Gurino.  This is a zoological and hydrological natural monument. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The park has developed ecological routes for visitors, passing through which you can not only see the pine trees and the unique dune-hilly relief, but also collect lingonberries, cranberries and mushrooms. </p><h2>  Balneological resort area </h2><p>  Not far from the city of Talitsa, near the river in the coniferous forest, there is the Mayan health resort.  Talitskaya water, which is the basis for medical procedures, has a unique composition and is equal to the waters of Essentuki and Staraya Rusa. </p><p>  The resort has a children's department.  The complex is open all year.  Indications for spa treatment: </p><ul><li>  gastrointestinal tract diseases; </li><li>  pathology of the nervous system; </li><li>  kidney and liver disease; </li><li>  a number of skin diseases; </li><li>  respiratory problems. </li></ul><p>  On the basis of the complex, you can undergo treatment with <span>sapropelic mud</span> extracted from Lake Moltaeva.  They give a striking therapeutic effect for problems with the musculoskeletal system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sanatoriirf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Regional sanatorium" class="if uuid-2258991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2258991.jpg"></div><h2>  Forest School and Arboretum </h2><p>  As early as 1896, in the city of Talitsa, Sverdlovsk Region, a lower forest school was opened on the basis of the forestry of the same name.  The inspirer and creator of the school was Vronsky S.G., who came here as a forester of the 1st category, after graduating from the St. Petersburg Forest Institute.  All the worries and troubles of organizing the school fell on the shoulders of this man and he successfully dealt with them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the same period, in addition to the erection of the school building, a plant nursery was broken.  It was created for acclimatization and breeding of new plants imported from other countries.  It was at its base that a modern arboretum appeared. </p><p>  Already in 1975, the park-arboretum of the city of Talitsa was given the status of "Natural Monument".  And in 2001, the plant nursery was included in the list of specially protected objects.  However, in the same year, the forestry technical school (previously a forest school) abandoned the park, as a result of which it was transferred to the administration of the city district. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nashural.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://nashural.ru/article/istoriya-urala/petropavlovskij-hram-v-talitse-hram-schastlivoj-sudby/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Happy church" class="if uuid-2258959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2258959.jpg"></div><h2>  Holy places </h2><p>  On the territory of the city of Talitsa of the Sverdlovsk region at the address: Urga street, 19 is the church of Peter and Paul.  Estimated date of its construction: 1805-1807.  This temple has never, during the period of its existence, closed the doors to parishioners, even during the years of persecution. </p><p>  The structure of the church is not distinguished by exquisite decoration and even, for an unknown reason, it does not stand on a hill, as is customary in Orthodoxy.  But at this temple the first public library in the city was created, some valuable copies of books have survived to this day. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.012712" data-lng="63.71914760000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/0/4/704.png"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Naturally, as in any other city, there is a local history museum in Talitsa that will tell about the history of the appearance of the village.  The museum presents an exposition telling about the peoples who inhabited these territories earlier, before the advent of the modern settlement. </p><p>  Also in the city is a museum dedicated to Nikolai Kuznetsov.  This is a Hero of the USSR, a scout. </p><h2>  Neo-Russian structure </h2><p>  Few tourists come without a photo from the city of Talitsa, Sverdlovsk Region, which depicts the noble estate of Poklevsky-Kozell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prousadbi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor of Poklevsky-Cosell" class="if uuid-2258965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2258965.jpg"></div><p>  This house was erected in 1890 at the highest place in the city.  From the balcony of the estate it was possible to see the whole city before, but now a chic view closes the five-story residential building.  This family is still remembered and the locals are very grateful to it. </p><p>  Poklevsky-Cosell engaged in charity work, facilitated the opening of two gymnasiums in Talitsa (for girls and boys), opened 2 theaters, and to treat the local population, they discharged doctors from the capital.  If there was a lean year, the family opened a dining room for the poor.  However, all good deeds cannot be counted. </p>
