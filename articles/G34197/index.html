    <p>  The first <span>natural zones of the</span> Earth were identified by V. Dokuchaev in 1898.  The scientist believed that living conditions (including climate, amount of water, topography), as well as flora and fauna on a certain territory of the planet are closely interconnected.  That is why they must be studied as a whole, paying attention to mutual influence.  Dokuchaev was the first to formulate the law of geographical zonality. </p><p>  Today it is believed that the natural zone is a complex with its own landscape, which is formed under the influence of climate, as well as the distribution of moisture and heat.  In addition, this kind of territory is characterized by its own vegetation, unique wildlife and soil type. </p><p>  It is interesting that the climatic zones of the world and natural zones are closely interconnected, since it is under the influence of the external environment that the corresponding conditions for the existence of living organisms are formed. </p><p>  <span>Equatorial forests are</span> characterized by a humid and hot climate.  The territories are predominantly located in the Amazon basin (South America), as well as in Africa, on both sides of <span>the Congo River.</span>  This natural zone is also present in Australia and some islands of Oceania. </p><p>  Equatorial forests are characterized by diverse vegetation and rich wildlife.  A large amount of precipitation and a constant warm temperature creates ideal conditions for the formation of the jungle.  A lot of interesting animals live here on trees, including monkeys, sloths, <span>flying foxes.</span>  The world of birds is also diverse - here you can see several varieties of parrots, <span>birds of paradise</span> and hummingbirds.  By the way, it is on the territory of the equatorial forest that the largest snake in the world, the anaconda, is found. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Variably humid forests are natural zones of the Earth that are characterized by seasonal changes in weather.  It produces warm, humid and cool periods.  In most cases, such forests are located in the tropical climate zone. </p><p>  Temperate forests - most of them occupy the territories of North America and Eurasia.  Here, the annual seasonality of the weather, which is characteristic of a temperate climate, is clearly highlighted.  Forests can be both broad-leaved and mixed.  The most characteristic plants of this zone are the following: maple, oak, birch and linden.  As for the fauna, bears, wolves, moose, lynxes, and sometimes sables and martens live in these territories. </p><p>  Savannahs are natural zones of the Earth that are located in the tropical, subtropical and subequatorial climatic zones.  They occupy vast territories in Africa, Australia, Central and South America.  The vegetation is represented mainly by artisanal or grassy forms - from the trees here you can see only baobab, acacia and eucalyptus.  Typical animals are zebras, giraffes, elephants and ostriches. </p><p>  Steppes are characterized by a dry climate and minimal rainfall.  That is why only grassy representatives of the plant world live here.  The American prairies are home to llamas, coyotes, jaguars, bison, and armadillos.  As for the steppes of Eurasia, the situation here is slightly different - the animal world is represented mainly by rodents. </p><p>  Deserts are located in different climatic zones.  The only common feature is the scarce amount of annual precipitation and a large temperature amplitude (for example, during the day the temperature can be 40 degrees, and at night only 15).  Accordingly, the flora and fauna are not so rich here.  Only those organisms that have adapted to withstand the lack of water and food for a long time live in the desert. </p><p>  The polar deserts are another interesting area, which also has a minimal amount of rainfall.  Such areas are located near the Arctic Circle.  Interestingly, almost half a year day reigns here, and the next six months - impenetrable night.  The most characteristic representatives of the fauna are the polar bear, seal, penguins. </p><p>  As you can see, the natural zones of the Earth are very different from each other.  Each of them has its own unique characteristics. </p>
