It has the status of the center of the region of the same name, inhabited by people a few millennia before the advent of our era. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  According to information from written sources and the results of archaeological excavations, the Russians in Pechora appeared at the dawn of the second millennium A.D.  e.  The information about that period that has come down to our days suggests that most of these people were Novgorodians. </p><p>  Ust-Tsilma also appeared thanks to the efforts of a resident of Novgorod Ivan Lastka.  In 1542, he was granted a royal certificate, which allowed him to dispose of the territories along the banks of the Pechora.  Soon Pinezheans and Mezenets joined the Swallow.  For them, the Zilma basin has long played the role of a fishing site.  At first, cattle breeding and agriculture did not have much significance in the life of the local population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilm mouth" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460436.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to archaeologists, a unique ancient document was found - "Payress".  It is in it that the first mention of Ust-Tsilma is located. </p><h2>  New time </h2><p>  The Pechora region began to become more and more interested in immigrants in the 17-18 centuries.  This process is associated with the schism of the Church, as a result of which the adherents of the old faith were forced to flee persecution in the unfavorable northern region.  Ust-Tsilma became the home for many Muscovites, Novgorodians, and Pomeranians.  Thus, the settlement turned out to be the center of the Pechora Old Believers in the northeastern lands of the European part of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the Old Believers came to Pechora, they tried to isolate themselves from their closest neighbors - the Nenets and Komi-Izhents, in order to preserve their religious culture.  The result of a multi-stage process was a unique ethnic group with a unique dialect, special features of life and culture, as well as with other differences that allow it to be separated from other peoples. </p><p>  At the end of the eighteenth century, Ust-Tsilma gains the status of an important economic center of Pechora.  The village had strong permanent trade relations with Arkhangelsk, Veliky Ustyug, Cherdynsky Krai, Pinega and Ust-Sysolsky. </p><p>  According to a note by Ermilov (a provincial official from the retinue of Prince Golitsyn), at the end of the nineteenth century there were 1,100 buildings and 4,000 souls in the settlement in question.  Thus, the village, both in terms of population and area, was larger than any city in the Arkhangelsk province.  In May 1891, Ust-Tsilma became the center of a large Pechora district. </p><h2>  Latest time </h2><p>  At the beginning of 1911, the Pechora Agricultural Experimental Station was opened in Ust-Tsilma, which became the first research institution in the <span>North of the European</span> part of the RSFSR.  The basis for it was the data obtained as a result of comprehensive expeditionary surveys of the region in 1902-1910.  They were conducted by A.V. Zhuravsky, who later became the first director of this station.  It functioned until 1957.  Thanks to the activities of this institution, a scientific thought was formed in the region on the issues of feed production and animal husbandry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ust Tsilma photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In July 1929, the Ust-Tsilemsky district became part of the Komi ASSR.  The difficult conditions of the North, the lack of a road network and the remoteness from industrial centers had the formation of industries and households in the harsh region. </p><p>  On January 1, 1932, Ust-Tsilma (Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) became the seat of the Pechora Shipping Company.  In addition, the settlement was declared the center of the river fleet of the region.  Soon, not far from the village, the airport was officially opened.  Ust-Tsilma is located one kilometer from the ‚Äúair gate‚Äù.  The size of the runway is 1332 by 32 meters. </p><p>  The construction of the first large industrial enterprise - a suede factory - began in 1930. Two years later, production began on it.  In the 30s of the twentieth century, logging became one of the main industries of the region.  The Ust-Tsilemsky timber industry enterprise was created in 1933. Since then, its production tasks have been increasing.  So, in 1940-1941.  almost one hundred thousand cubic meters of wood was harvested. </p><h2>  Agricultural industry </h2><p>  As already noted, the conditions in the Ust-Tsilemsky district are harsh.  Despite this, the agricultural industry has always been one of the leading.  So, in the 1980s, the Polar Territory provided 11% of the country with milk and 9% with meat.  Currently, the Ust-Tsilemsky district is a region in which innovation is intertwined with antiquity. </p>

    <h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  In the area under consideration, there are <span>fuel and energy resources</span> and a complex of non-metallic mineral raw materials, including <span>precious metals,</span> bauxite ores and diamonds.  Industrial development is still constrained by the remoteness from economic centers and the lack of a regular transport network.  Nevertheless, there are prospects for further development, and all thanks to the wealth of mineral resources. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Local media </h2><p>  How can I find out what the village of Ust-Tsilma lives for?  Krasnaya Pechora is the first newspaper of regional and city significance in the Komi Republic.  The pilot number was released on October 10, 1920.  For the land, almost devoid of communications, destroyed by the civil and World War I, this was a very significant event.  The chief editor was twenty-year-old Alexander Zaboev.  An ambitious young man even initiated the dispatch of "Red Pechora" to Lenin.  Vladimir Ilyich conveyed words of gratitude for the work to the editorial office.  The leader of the world proletariat wished the "Red Pechora" to become a symbol of the heyday of a harsh land, its liberation from ruin, ignorance and darkness.  Moral support from the capital helped the new periodical to find a unique character and thoroughly get on its feet. </p><h2>  Famous holiday </h2><p>  The village of Ust-Tsilma is transformed annually in July.  ‚ÄúGorka‚Äù - a spring-summer ritual celebration, which received the status of a republican in 2004 - is a source of fun and good mood not only for local residents, but also for tourists.  It consists of two components - dancing and driving.  The latter, in turn, is represented by six figures - ‚ÄúPillars‚Äù, ‚ÄúReins‚Äù, ‚ÄúScourge‚Äù, ‚ÄúCircle‚Äù, ‚ÄúSide to side‚Äù and ‚ÄúSquare‚Äù.  The square dance square consists of eleven figures - Barino, Yablochko, Chastooshka, Krakowyak, Seni, Polka, Marusenka, Along Pavement Street, Pas de Span and Kamarinskaya ". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mouth tsilma hill" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460437.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In July 2012, the holiday was especially magnificent, as the village celebrated its 470th anniversary. </p><h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  In 2009, the development of the coat of arms of Ust-Tsilma began in the Union of Heraldists of Russia.  This happened thanks to the application of the village administration.  The background of the coat of arms is azure.  It has a narrow belt formed of three black and three yellow squares.  They alternate among themselves.  Three black and yellow squares are placed at an angle inside them, and each of them has a red crutch pattern.  A silver beaver is placed above the belt, holding a bunch of sedge in the front legs of the same color.  Below is a curved salmon beating with a tail.  The fish is painted silver. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  On the territory of the Ust-Tsilemsky district there are more than seventy cultural and historical monuments.  About twenty places in the village keep the memory of wonderful people and important events that influenced the development of the region.  They are living witnesses of the past and help to recreate the atmosphere of a particular historical period.  Many monuments are associated with the heroism of their ancestors and the many wars that fell to this harsh land. </p><h2>  Copper and silver mines </h2><p>  This monument is one of the oldest in the area.  Ore was discovered on Zilma in 1428.  Currently, at the place where metal was previously mined, you can see five pits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukhta Ust Tsilma" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460448.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Veliky Pozhensky monastery </h2><p>  At the dawn of the eighteenth century, the Old Believers' Skete arose on the Great Pozhna.  It was formed by representatives of the Mezen peasantry and immigrants from Vyga.  Thanks to <span>this monastery,</span> Pechora was supplied with Old Believer literature.  The schismatic hermits led a similar way to the peasant way of life: they were engaged in uprooting forests under the fields and clearing reaping from shrubs.  Life was hard and hungry.  Today these lands are occupied by the village, however, they are still known as the place of self-immolation of the Pechora Old Believers.  As a result of those sad events, 86 people died. </p><h2>  Monument to A.V. Zhuravsky and the Museum </h2><p>  This outstanding researcher made a valuable contribution to the development of the <span>Bolshezemelskaya tundra</span> and actively participated in the process of identifying agricultural development opportunities in this region.  The sculptural composition ‚ÄúAndrei Zhuravsky‚Äù appeared in Ust-Tsilma in October 1981.  Its author - V. A. Rohin - is a Syktyvkar sculptor who portrayed a scientist walking through the taiga of Pritimanye.  The composition is made of wood (larch). </p><p>  Organized by Zhuravsky in 1905, the Zoological Station became an outpost of the development of science in the north of the country.  In memory of the scientist's merits, his house was moved (thereby saved) to Ust-Tsilmu.  Currently, the building has opened a historical and memorial museum to them.  Zhuravsky. </p><h2>  Commemorative sign </h2><p>  This sign was made by the sculptor Pylaev in 1985.  It is intended to preserve the memory of the tract from Arkhangelsk to Ust-Tsilma, the construction of which was completed at the end of the nineteenth century.  This road was the only link to the big world.  On it went carts with various goods and products.  In addition, political exiles who were dying right along the way were often driven along the highway.  Since then they say that this road is strewn with bones. </p><h2>  Monument to Batman </h2><p>  It was opened in 1983 with the aim of preserving the memory of Vasily Foteevich Batmanov, who actively participated in the establishment of Soviet power in Komi.  One of the streets of the village is also named after him. </p><h2>  Mass grave </h2><p>  It contains 22 (according to other sources 23) warriors killed by the White Guards in 1918-1920.  Initially, the monument was wooden.  The reconstruction of the <span>mass grave</span> was carried out in 1967, as a result of which fifteen obelisks and a brick monument appeared.  During the next reconstruction, the central obelisk was replaced with a sculpture of a mourning mother. </p><h2>  House-Museum of M. A. Babikov - Hero of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Makar Andreevich was born on July 31, 1921 in the village of Ust-Tsilma (photos of the settlement are presented in the article).  Since 1940 he served in the navy.  For the battle during the seizure of the port, Seisin Babikov was awarded the highest rank.  Then, together with the detachment, he managed to break through behind enemy lines, capture the bridge over the river, destroy more than fifty enemy soldiers and six vehicles, as well as cut off the Nazis' retreat routes and hold their positions for more than eighteen hours. </p><p>  Currently, there is a positive tendency to increase the role of historical and cultural monuments in the process of patriotic education of the younger generation. </p><h2>  Ust-Tsilma: how to get there? </h2><p>  In spring and autumn, the village is often cut off from the outside world due to ice drifts and ice freezing.  During this period, the air transport helps on the route ‚ÄúSyktyvkar - Ust-Tsilma‚Äù, but a one-way ticket costs three and a half thousand rubles, which not everyone can afford.  When thawing, helicopters are assigned to Izhma and Pechora. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ust Tsilma how to get" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460450.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  The rest of the time, buses run to the Irael station twice a day.  Autotravel lovers should keep in mind that in summer the road on the section between Ukhta and Iraq becomes almost impassable.  Her condition improves significantly only in winter. </p><p>  The distance from Moscow to the described village is 2313 kilometers, the length of the Ukhta-Ust-Tsilma route is 362 km. </p><h2>  Actual problem </h2><p>  Due to the annual summer shallowing on <span>the Pechora River, the</span> ferry sometimes stops walking.  Ust-Tsilma is simply cut off from the outside world - to deliver passengers, food, building materials, etc.  becomes nothing.  Villagers get to the other side in an eight-seat boat provided by a private carrier.  As for trucks and trucks, they stand in anticipation of an improvement on both sides of Pechora. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mouth of tsilma komi" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/460438.jpg" width="600"></div>
