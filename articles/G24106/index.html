    <h2>  A little information </h2><p>  For a long time in its place was a village with a private sector and well-groomed alleys.  Today it is a resort area with two streets (District and Island).  The main part of the preserved and existing hotels is located along the District Ring.  The coastline extends here. </p><p>  The land received its name due to the fact that its entire territory is buried in vegetation, fruit trees and <span>berry bushes.</span>  In some clearings you can see a blackberry.  Willow, sedge and tall poplars grow everywhere.  The green island (Rostov-on-Don) needs reconstruction, now its streets are broken, and paths with alleys are littered with trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, the best transport for moving around the territory is a bicycle.  Despite some abandonment and low population, Rostovites are still drawn here.  Especially this piece of land is very popular in the summer.  It organizes picnics, mass bathing and festivities on the Don coast.  In season, the entire coast is littered with tents and cars. </p><p>  And this is understandable - tourists seek solitude with nature.  And those who are afraid of the ‚Äúwild‚Äù vacation can settle in boarding houses, and children can be identified in a recreation camp.  All institutions are fenced and are guarded around the clock.  Comfortable conditions and multifaceted leisure will be offered by each recreation center.  The green island conquers at first sight and entails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation green island" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/462571.jpg" width="543"></div>

    <h2>  Anomalous Zone - Myth or Reality </h2><p>  Speaking flattering words about this picturesque corner of Rostov, it is impossible not to mention the mystical side, which haunts the townspeople.  Many mysterious and mysterious legends, inventions and fairy tales go around this place.  Green Island (Rostov-on-Don) excites and scares the minds of people. </p><p>  Probably no one will remember exactly when exactly this small piece of land became an anomalous zone.  Rumors and unsubstantiated arguments haunted the island even before we learned about UFOs and <span>flying saucers.</span>  If you believe the information sources, then almost every second resident of the city observed an unusual radiance over the island, and some saw dark figures moving along the trees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An unthinkable number of eerie stories and fables were invented about Green Island (Rostov-on-Don).  According to esotericists and psychics, this land is a kind of portal to another space.  Others claim that previously there was a secret laboratory where terrible experiments were carried out.  However, all these mystical gossips are not officially confirmed, so trusting them or not is an individual matter. </p><p>  From real mysticism, there are only ‚Äúevil‚Äù mosquitoes and flies, as well as intertwined trees, which in the dark resemble ghostly silhouettes.  Somewhat frightening look swampy lowlands with protruding snags.  No matter what legends are composed and conveyed to society, the townspeople still prefer a country vacation.  The green island is an opportunity to break out of the ‚Äúpaws‚Äù of a bustling metropolis and find solitude with nature.  By the way, anyone can get here by pontoon bridge. </p><h2>  Holidays on the Green Island - what to do? </h2>
