And good.  There are also desserts and fruits, though in less quantity than main dishes.  But this is not a problem, because there is an excellent supermarket nearby, in which reasonable prices for all goods.  But everything is always fresh. </p><p>  Every evening, the restaurant has its own theme.  They serve barbecue, Italian dishes, fish, seafood.  Drinks are included in dinner only if guests have paid for the all-inclusive service.  Another nuance (it can not be attributed to the minuses, since it is conditional) is the absence of cereals.

However, there is no shortage of hot chocolate, water, coffee and tea either. </p><p>  In general, no one will remain hungry here.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Finally - a few words about what Aegean Blue Hotel receives 4 * reviews.  Mostly they are positive.  Naturally, first of all, guests pay attention to prices.  They are very modest here.  And in Crete, this hotel is one of the most successful in terms of combining price and quality. </p><p>  They also talk about staff.  People here are attentive and pleasant.  Room cleaning - every day.  Timely replace linen and towels.  And the whole hotel is very clean.  Pools are regularly cleaned, so swimming in them is pleasant and safe.  The territory is also well-groomed - all in greenery and flowers. </p><p>  Many say that, even despite the check-in rule at 14:00, guests can wear wristbands here earlier.  Here, if possible, go forward.  What can not but rejoice.  Even if other guests have not yet vacated the room (accordingly, it is not ready for check-in), guests can be invited to go to breakfast.  You can also leave things in a locker room and go to the beach.  Also a good option. </p><p>  Even guests are pleased to note the fact that each room has a separate entrance.  So one gets the feeling that this is not an apartment in the hotel, but its own nature house. </p><p>  And here are some of the best beaches in Crete.  If you travel around the island and look at others, you can understand this. </p><p>  There is practically no animation, with the exception of the rare "Cretan evenings."  Very interesting and fascinating performances.  However, other shows are not needed here. </p><p>  The hotel is focused on families with children, so if you need a budget room for a vacation with kids near the sea, you should go here. </p>
