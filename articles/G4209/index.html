It would seem that the resolution is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high, and that‚Äôs it.  This is the standard HD - it displays the image in high quality.  But not so simple.  It turns out there are two ways to display the image.  The first one is interlaced.  And the second is progressive.  It is by comparing their strengths and weaknesses that the conclusion will be made about which is better: 1080i or 1080p. </p>

    <h2>  Brief Background </h2><p>  A certification program called HD Ready was officially launched in Western Europe back in early 2005.  Even then, it was conditionally divided into two types.  The first one is the one that comes with the ‚Äúand‚Äù index.  It is tied to analog standards, which today are almost completely supplanted by digital technology.  The second (with the index "p") is maximally focused on supporting the latter.  Already only on the basis of this, we can conclude that it is better - 1080i or 1080p. </p><h2>  1080i standard </h2><p>  We describe the technical characteristics of each of the standards, which will give a reasoned answer to the question of which is better: 1080i or 1080p.  Let's start with the first one.  This is one of the possible options for displaying images with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  At the same time, such a device plays video in the format of ‚ÄúFull HCH‚Äù.  The image refresh rate on such a screen can be 50 or 60 Hz.  It is installed by software settings.  A picture is formed in two measures.  At the first stage, even lines are output, and then - odd lines.  The human eye does not notice this.  But the image itself is not quite high quality.  You could even say blurry.  The cost of such a TV or monitor will be lower.  The main plus in this case is a reduced video stream: with this technology, it is reduced by 2 times.  Accordingly, the schematic and technical solutions are simplified, which affects the lower cost of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  1080p standard </h2><p>  To decide which is better to choose - 1080i or 1080p - we will deal with the characteristics of the second standard.  The resolution of the matrix in this case is similar - 1920x1080.  In addition to the refresh frequencies (50 and 60 Hz), there is also support - 24 Hz.  But the image is displayed in one cycle.  Therefore, the picture is much better.  But the price in this case will be higher. </p>

    <h2>  Compare </h2><p>  Having ascertained the technical features and comparing them, you can decide what will be more appropriate to purchase, which of the two standards has a TV: 1080i?  1080p?  The difference between these formats seems to be not significant.  The image resolution is the same - 1920 pixels wide and 1080 high.  The image refresh rate in both cases is identical.  It can be 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the software settings.  Additionally, in the standard 1080p there is an image output with a frequency of 24 Hz.  It is designed to play movies in certain formats.  The key difference is how the image is formed.  In the format with the ‚Äúand‚Äù index, the picture is obtained by phasing the lines.  A similar principle was used on older analogue TVs and monitors.  Previously, this method of withdrawal had a very negative effect on human vision.  Now, due to more modern technologies, this effect is minimized.  But still, the real resolution, which is processed per clock, is reduced.  The actual video format is as follows: 1920 by 540. But 1080p updates the entire picture.  That is, we get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù resolution of 1920 by 1080. In fact, this is full-fledged Full HD.  These are the main features of the 1080i, 1080p formats.  The differences between them are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The standard with the index "p" supports video output with a frequency of 24 Hz.  This allows you to view some non-standard files in proper quality. </li><li>  The same index ‚Äúp‚Äù in one cycle completely updates the image on the screen.  And 1080i will have to spend two iterations to complete the same operation. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget about the cost of the device.  In the case of 1080p, it will be 10-20 percent higher. </p>

    <h2>  What's better </h2><p>  Now let's summarize and decide on which is better: 1080i or 1080p?  Of course, the second one will have a higher price in any case, but from the standpoint of quality it will be better.  The picture is clear, it is often updated, less eye strain - these are the advantages that predetermine such a choice.  And full support for non-standard video files will also not be superfluous.  Do not forget that 1080p can also work in the ‚Äúand‚Äù mode.  To do this, just adjust the software settings of the device.  But in the opposite direction this can not be done.  Still, technically, half-frames cannot be converted into a whole frame.  And this is exactly how the image is formed in this case.  And one more important nuance.  So far, 1080p is not widely used for broadcasting, but the future lies with it.  It is the matter of time.  Soon, most of the television channels will broadcast in this format.  Then it will be possible to fully experience all its advantages.  The images in the broadcast signal and on the TV screen will be in the same format, and you can believe the picture quality will be really the best. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Within the framework of this material, an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the two main standards for image formation on a monitor or TV screen was carried out.  Knowing these nuances, it will be easy to make a choice between hd 1080p or hd 1080i.  But at the same time we do not forget about the cost, which in this matter does not play the last role.  In any case, the recommendations set forth in this article will allow you to choose exactly the device that will best suit your needs. </p>
