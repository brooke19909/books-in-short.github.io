Moreover, these failures occur regardless of the life of the device.  For example, sometimes the TV does not turn on.  When you try to turn it on, various indicators blink again, and the relay also clicks.  There may be other "symptoms."  Let's look at why TVs refuse to work and what needs to be done in such a situation. </p><h2>  Common causes of malfunctions </h2><p>  This problem can occur for a variety of reasons.  It happens that the LEDs blink as usual, but the TV still does not want to start.  Also, the indicator lights up in red, but the device cannot be controlled from the remote control and does not turn on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung TV does not turn on" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589455.jpg" width="600"></div>  Often the TV does not turn on both from the remote control and from the button.  On the case, the indicator does not light.  Another symptom is that inside the case, something clicks, buzzes.  The device makes various, sometimes quite strange sounds, but still does not turn on.

    <h2>  Indicators blink </h2><p>  If they blink on the case, it means that the device independently carries out diagnostics and will soon find out the cause of the problem.  Often on different models, you can observe that the lamp or <span>LED flashes a</span> certain number of times.  So he reports a specific error.  Part of the codes for them can be found in the instruction manual.  TV manufacturers such as Sony, Philips, Panasonic and others have a self-diagnosis function.  The central processor receives data from the main devices and units via data buses.  If a faulty node is detected, the processor will block the enable command.  Therefore, if the Philips TV does not turn on, but the indicator flashes, you need to read the error and decrypt it.  Then you can try to fix the problem.  Also, a similar symptom manifests itself when the TV-panel acts as a computer monitor.  If the PC <span>goes</span> into <span>sleep mode</span> or turns off, then when you press the power button on the remote control, the LCD panel will blink a few times with the LED. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The indicators are always on. </h2><p>  A luminous diode informs the user that the device‚Äôs power supply normally receives supply voltage.  What to do if the TV does not turn on and does not respond to signals from the control panel?  The first is to try turning it on using the buttons on the TV itself.  Perhaps the malfunction is due to incorrect operation of the remote control or some errors associated with it.  But the TV itself is not to blame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV does not turn on lg" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589454.jpg" width="600"></div>  If the LG TV does not turn on and similar symptoms are observed, then the whole point is a ceramic resistance of 4.7 kOhm.  It is located near the processor - this is a cliff.  Replacing the resistor will help restore the device.  You can take several actions.  The first step is to check whether the batteries in the remote control are working and the contacts are not oxidized.  Next, check the infrared emitter and its integrity.  Then the buttons are diagnosed.  They can stick, which is why the panel does not respond to commands.  If the Samsung TV does not turn on, but the indicator is on, then the reason must be sought in the electronic components.  Something provoked a change in the properties of the capacitors, so the power supply can no longer provide the device with a normal start-up.  The only caveat - determining the location of this malfunction will take some time. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV does not turn on" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589456.jpg" width="400"></div>  Also, experts recommend disassembling the control panel and clean it from the inside.  They often accumulate dust.  This does not affect the operation of the device in the best way.  If the remote control was filled with coffee, beer or any other liquid and can no longer work, then it is easier to buy a new one.  If the LCD TV does not turn on after pressing the buttons on the control panel, then there are only two possible options why this happened.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  This is one of the possible reasons.  The TV in this case may make attempts to start, but after just a few seconds the screen goes blank or completely stops responding to all attempts to start it.  The main and most popular cause of this problem is power outages in the home network.  The power system in modern TVs loves stable and high-quality voltage.  The most effective way to help solve this problem is to completely turn off the device.  This can be done by pulling the plug from the outlet.  After a while, the device will recover.  If there are constant problems with voltages, then the best solution is to turn on the TV through stabilizers, uninterruptible power supplies, or at least through standard line filters.  But best of all, if you want to avoid such problems, turn off the panel when leaving the house.  Then you will not be wondering "why the TV does not turn on." </p><h2>  CPU malfunctions </h2><p>  Modern TV panels are equipped with a huge amount of control electronics.  Schematically, they are small PCs with a separate CPU that controls all the important processors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV does not turn on" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589457.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, if you look at the circuit diagram of an LED TV, you can see that the control voltage to the LED diode comes through the Stand-by contact and through the transistor.  If there is a short circuit, the TV will not turn on.  Then you can not do without contacting the specialists in the service center.  Of course, if you have the knowledge and the necessary skills, you can try to fix the problem yourself.  However, the trouble is that in the public domain there are no electrical circuits for televisions.  And without them, fixing the panel is very difficult.

    <h2>  TV does not turn on, indicators do not light </h2><p>  These symptoms are directly or indirectly associated with a lack of electrical power.  If the lamp simply burned out, then the device would function as usual (no indication).  If this happens, then do not panic.  First, you need to exclude all possible malfunctions that are corrected independently.  But there are situations more complicated.  For example, the LG TV does not turn on, and the problem lies in the open of the fuse resistor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips TV doesn't turn on" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589458.jpg" width="600"></div>  Through these resistors, a voltage of +12 V is supplied to the circuit. After replacing the element, the TV works in normal mode.

    <h2>  No voltage at the outlet </h2><p>  Sometimes, circuit breakers in switchboards are silently shut off.  There are malfunctions in the outlet itself.  This is diagnosed using an indicator or a multimeter.  If there is no power, check the machine.  If it doesn‚Äôt help, change the outlet. </p><h2>  Extension cord defective </h2><p>  This is a common reason why the TV does not turn on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the TV does not turn on" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589459.jpg" width="425"></div>  You can check it simply - if the device is working from the outlet, but does not want to start through the extension cord, then the problem is clearly in the wire.

    <h2>  Incorrect mode selection </h2><p>  It often happens that a person accidentally or intentionally chooses the wrong modes of operation of the device.  In this case, the TV may turn off and not turn on or go into sleep mode.  In this case, resetting to factory settings will help. </p><h2>  Malfunctions of electronic elements </h2><p>  As already noted above, if the Philips TV does not turn on, this is due to defective electronic components.  For example, for some reason, resistors or capacitors burned out.  The actual problem is fuses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD TV does not turn on" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1589460.jpg" width="600"></div>  Diagnosis and repair of such malfunctions is best left to professionals.  Self repair can be very expensive.  If the Philips TV does not turn on, this is due to a broken capacitor in the power supply.  As a result, 13 V is supplied to the circuit instead of the required 18.5.  This is often the cause of the breakdown.  Without the necessary knowledge to identify this problem yourself is very difficult - this is the work of service engineers.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV does not turn on (and this applies to any brands), this does not mean that it is broken forever.  It can be revived using simple methods.  But if the problem is in capacitors or a resistor, without proper experience, you should not take up repairs. </p>
