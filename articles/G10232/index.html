    <p>  On the street Radio is one of the most beautiful areas of the city - LCD "Green Forest" in Zelenograd.  These are 14 <span>monolithic-brick houses,</span> which differ from each other in the number of floors and location.  The microdistrict is located near the Kryukovsky forestry.

"Green Bor" (Zelenograd) is somewhat autonomous from the rest of the city, so there is no fatigue from city activity and noise. </p><h2>  Infrastructure in the residential complex "Green Forest" </h2>
