    <p>  The smartphone works in second and third generation cellular networks.  In the first case, at two frequencies, in the second - at three.  Data transmission in the international network is carried out using the HSPA + standard.  Simultaneous use of two SIM cards is supported.  The device‚Äôs battery is rated at 2540 milliamps per hour.  Dimensions in all three planes are 140.8 by 71.6 by 9.6 millimeters.  In this case, the mass is 155.5 grams.  If we talk about color designs, then initially the device was presented in titanium and gold versions.  Now added white. </p><p>  Smartphone LG Max X155, reviews of which quickly spread around the World Wide Web, has a display with a diagonal of five inches.  At a density of 196 dots per inch.  The operating system of the Android family version 5.0 is installed in advance.

There is a small set of additional features. </p><p>  Smartphone LG Max X155 Gold, reviews about which are not the best, is capable of reproducing a considerable number of audio file formats.  These are already standard MP3 and WAV.  Video is played in MP4 and 3GP formats.  A 3.5 mm standard jack is provided for connecting wired headphones.  The set of communication capabilities is not impressive.  All that is needed for ordinary work is present.  Wi-Fi operates in the b, g and n bands.

    <p>  The LG Max X155 Titan smartphone, reviews of which can be found in this article, was born in 2015.  By the way, this device has various names that are assigned to it depending on the region of sales.  In the CIS countries, the device is nevertheless known by the name under which we present it now.  It has a big name.  It's about the word Max.  But at the same time, it gives the buyer not so many opportunities.  We can say a minimum of opportunities with a maximum of money.  And why it happened, we will discuss. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance Features </h2>

    <p>  LG Max X155, reviews of which will be given at the end of the article, is made of plastic.  Its back cover has a small embossed pattern for greater ‚Äúperseverance‚Äù in the hands of the user.  This solution can be called truly practical.  Now on the lid will not be visible stains and fingerprints.  And if they are, then a little.  The device does not tend to slip out of the hands. </p><h2>  About processor </h2>

    <p>  It is unlikely that it will be possible to call the model we are observing today.  If only in comparison with other, less productive devices.  But for its price category, LG does not demonstrate the best parameters, no matter who says anything about this.  Four cores that operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz, an unknown graphics accelerator - that's what is inside the device.  Repeatedly conducted synthetic tests.  The performance level shows that the ‚ÄúMali-400 MP‚Äù is installed here as a video chip.  The role of the chipset is played by MediaTech MT6582. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To view pages on the Internet, unhindered surfing in it and gatherings on social networks, however, such "hardware" will be enough.  For this, a fairly good performance is provided.  But if you are looking for a phone that can run and use ‚Äúheavy‚Äù programs and toys, then this model is clearly not for you.  Shots in games will shamelessly sink.  And after all, it is far from always possible to lower the quality of graphics.  This will already be a noticeable problem.  And to refuse some visual effects in favor of speed sometimes, oh, I don‚Äôt feel like it. </p><h2>  About memory </h2>

    <p>  For user needs, 8 gigabytes of memory are available, as the specifications state.  But we all know very well that operating systems take a certain amount for themselves.  That is why in fact about 4 GB of free space remains.  It is impossible to install applications on a memory card, this feature was not taken into account by designers of mobile architecture.  This should be considered if there is a question about buying a device.  The fact is that if you are going to use the free space on your phone specifically for installing applications, then serious problems will arise.  Constantly have to get out, removing one game and setting another in its place.  The memory in the phone can be increased by using an external drive up to 32 gigabytes in size.  However, it will be possible to use this place only for storing multimedia files.  RAM is presented in the amount of one gigabyte. </p><h2>  About battery life </h2>

    <p>  A lithium-ion battery, rated at 2540 milliamps per hour, is installed here as a power source.  For this smartphone, this is enough.  Probably, the feature is the iron "stuffing" installed in the smartphone.  She is not picky, and she spends energy carefully.  In fact, the display does not have the best resolution, and the processor is not as strong as it might seem.  Thanks to this, you can use the new product from LG throughout the day.  In this case, the user will soon cease to pay attention to the level of charge, get used to the fact that it lasts for a day or two. </p><p>  And this despite the fact that it can be actively used for surfing the Web.  Another thing is if the user starts to run games.  But with them the device will sit down rather quickly, since the hardware will strain to a large extent.  This can be felt with the help of tactile contact: the smartphone will heat up significantly.  Thus, under intense loads, the device can withstand one to two days of operation.  Less active users will be able to squeeze out of it twice as much. </p><h2>  About cameras </h2>

    <p>  In general, the main camera module is equipped with an automatic focus function on the subject.  However, it does not differ in special quality.  It doesn‚Äôt work very well.  A more or less good result, clear, not blurry, can only be obtained with a long hover or after creating from three to five consecutive shots.  Well, if things are so bad already with focus, let's try to imagine how things are with the details.  But in fact it is very, very bad.  Yes, of course, you can scan a QR code.  However, you can forget about creating high-quality images and good "oneself" for social networks.  Sometimes it seems that there are not five megapixels in general, but even less. </p><p>  Similar things are happening in the camera settings area.  The interface is not even simple - it is poor.  Minimum settings, minimum possibilities.  The only thing that somehow saves the situation in this area is a virtual flash for the front camera.  Its role is played by the screen, shortly before creating a picture, including white backlight.  There is a feature called ‚ÄúGesture Shooting‚Äù.  However, its presence is unlikely to correct a minimal set of settings.  In general, here we are dealing with a camera, which can be suitable for conversations via video, but it will not be the best option for portrait shooting. </p><h2>  About display </h2><p>  The subject of our review is equipped with a five-inch screen.  It displays the image as FWVGA.  Obviously, it cannot boast of a good resolution: 854 by 480 pixels.  Logically, pixel density is just as bad.  The manufacturer decided to save even more.  Usually because: ‚ÄúWhy do we need Super AMOLED?  Let's install IPS, it's a state employee! ‚Äù  What is here?  ‚ÄúWhy do we need IPS?  Let's install the matrix even cheaper! ‚Äù  And here it is simply useless to say that this is a budget decision. </p><p>  Yes, there are some positive aspects.  Of course, within the segment.  So, here is a good color rendering.  The colors are not faded, although it is a little happy.  There is a good supply of brightness to make it convenient to work with the phone in sunlight.  However, all this is crossed out by low resolution, poor viewing angles, the absence of <span>an oleophobic coating</span> (due to which fingerprints stick) and additional protection.  Scratch the screen without a film?  Yes Easy! </p><h2>  About communications and sound </h2><p>  The set of communication capabilities is not very rich.  Rather, everything is standard.  All the same bluetooth version 4.0, navigation via GPS and A-GPS, even two SIM cards of Micro standard, modules for working in cellular networks of the second and third generations and, of course, Wi-Fi standards b, g, n.  Well, where without him today?  The speaker is also standard.  It does not differ much in volume, but it cannot be called quiet either.  Noises in conversational dynamics are absent.  Headphones work fine. </p><h2>  LG Max X155 Titan.  Customer reviews </h2><p>  It's time to summarize everything that was said earlier, and find out the opinions of people who purchased this phone.  As they all note, the price tag was overpriced, and the device did not live up to the expectations placed on it by deceived users.  Although the question immediately arises about where they looked when they bought it. </p><p>  Nevertheless, many people who purchased the device note that it does not have strengths.  Today, even within the budget segment, it loses significantly to its closest competitors in almost all respects.  And where he does not lose, he just fights on equal terms.  He lacks productivity, photographic features, design flavors in order to somehow hook potential buyers.  The operating system ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 5.0 does not save the situation.  She cannot do this alone.  People who bought this smartphone say that repeating their mistake should only be done if you want to brag to others about the opportunity to purchase a branded rather than a Chinese device. </p>
