    <h2>  Afghanistan </h2><p>  Graduation of Pavel Grachev at the Academy.  MV Frunze coincided with the beginning of the last local war in the history of the USSR.  The promising young commander, who had high expectations, was immediately sent to Afghanistan, where he spent the next three years.  During this period, he continues his career growth, and after returning to his homeland, he is prematurely awarded the rank of colonel. </p><h2>  1985-1991 </h2><p>  The second mission of Pavel Grachev to Afghanistan ends with the withdrawal of a limited contingent of Soviet troops, which included the one hundred and third guards airborne division under his command. </p><p>  To commemorate the merits of the military leader during the military operations in May 1988, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  Following the old adage, ‚ÄúLive and learn,‚Äù Grachev Pavel Sergeevich again goes to study and enters the General Staff Military Academy, after which he is appointed to the post of deputy and then <span>commander of the</span> USSR <span>Airborne</span> Forces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Going to the Yeltsin team </h2><p>  The turning point in the biography of Grachev was the <span>August putsch,</span> after which he repeatedly had to make important political decisions.  In particular, he, along with <span>Marshal Shaposhnikov,</span> as well as generals Gromov and Achalov, refused to obey the GKChP and ordered his subordinates to take the White House under protection.  Upon the return of M. Gorbachev from the Crimean Foros, Grachev was appointed first deputy <span>minister of defense of the USSR,</span> and a few days later he was awarded the rank of colonel general. </p><p>  The career growth of the military leader did not stop there.  In particular, in May 1992, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree according to which Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev was appointed Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, a photo of which has repeatedly appeared on the pages of newspapers in connection with operations in local conflict zones in the territory of the former USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Chechen War </h2><p>  Disputes about the role played by Pavel Grachev (Hero of the Soviet Union) during the events in the Caucasus in the first half of the 90s still do not subside.  In particular, he was subjected to fierce criticism, since in June 1992 he ordered to transfer to Dzhokhar Dudaev half of all weapons belonging to the Russian army, which was stored on the territory of Chechnya.  According to Grachev, the ammunition could not be taken out anyway.  However, the fact remains, and after only two and a half years, these weapons were used against Russian soldiers. </p><p>  At the same time, in 1994, Grachev did not manage to avoid a conflict with Yeltsin, who considered that a week was enough time to gather military force and enter Chechnya.  An experienced commander tried to persuade the president that it was too short, but they did not listen to him.  Pavel Sergeyevich even met with the leaders of the so-called Ichkeria in Chechnya before the Russian troops entered their territory, but, unfortunately, this did not produce any results. </p>

    <p>  The military leader resigned at the age of 59 and engaged in social activities.  Prior to that, he was actually betrayed by Yeltsin - in accordance with the election arrangements of the latter with General <span>A. Lebed.</span> </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Throughout his life, Pavel Grachev had a reliable rear.  His wife, Lyubov Alekseevna, knew with him all the hardships of the fate of an officer‚Äôs wife, with her eternal journeys and exhausting expectations of her husband from dangerous business trips.  In addition, there were many rumors about her husband‚Äôs infidelity, but Lyubov Alekseevna did not believe them, and Pavel Sergeevich Grachev always remained her only love. </p><p>  The family of the military leader suffered the loss of her beloved husband and father, who died in September 2012 at the age of 64. </p>
