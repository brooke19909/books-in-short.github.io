    <p>  Lev Yakovlevich Rokhlin was born on June 6, 1947 in Kazakhstan.  Mother raised the future general, as well as his three brothers, alone.  Rokhlin‚Äôs father was detained for political reasons shortly after the birth of his son.  In the 10th year of Leo‚Äôs life, the Rokhlin family moved to Tashkent.  It was there that the future famous general spent his youth. </p><p>  Starting from school, Rokhlin was distinguished by high academic performance and efficiency.  This allowed him to get a <span>gold medal.</span>  The future general received further education at the Higher Combined Arms Command School of Tashkent, and higher <span>military education</span> at the Academy named after  Frunze, as well as at the Academy under the General Staff. </p><p>  Having received the combined-arms qualification, the young officer refused the required leave and immediately went to the service.  By distribution, he fell into a group of Soviet troops in East Germany.  The service threw Rokhlin from the Arctic to the Turkestan district. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  From 1982 to 1984, the future general Rokhlin served in Afghanistan.  He began as commander of a regiment, but in the second year of service he had a division under his command.  Personally participated in the battles and was seriously injured several times.  Nevertheless, the command decided that he could not cope with one military operation and, as a result, in 1983 he was removed from his post and was appointed deputy commander of a motorized rifle regiment.  But for perfect service, less than a year later, General <span>Lev Rokhlin is</span> reinstated in his previous position. </p><p>  The end of 1994 - the beginning of 1995 fell to the service in the region of Chechnya.  He headed a separate corps on the territory of the republic, participated in a number of operations to capture the regions of Grozny and in campaigns organized for negotiations with militants.  Having numerous awards received over the years of service, General Rokhlin refused the title ‚ÄúHero of the Russian Federation‚Äù for participating in the battles in Grozny. </p>

    <p>  Not stopping there, he begins work on his political career.  Already in 1995, he was elected to the State Duma of the second convocation.  In 1996, General Rokhlin joined the <span>political party</span> Our Home is Russia.  This tandem brought him the post of <span>chairman of the State Duma</span> on defense. </p><p>  September 1997 was a turning point in the career of a general.  He makes a fatal decision to create his own political party.  This was one of the strongest opposition leaders of the time, who was worried about the fate of the army and the country as a whole.  However, the conversations of Rokhlin‚Äôs colleagues and colleagues that a coup was being prepared in his person in order to remove the president of Russia Boris Yeltsin from office, led to Rokhlin being removed from his post. </p><p>  On the night of July 3, 1998, a politician died from a <span>gunshot wound</span> in a country house located in the suburbs.  The indictment was brought against his wife, Tamara, but it is not known who killed General Rokhlin. </p><p>  As a result of lengthy litigation, Tamara Rokhlina, who refuses to plead guilty, was sentenced to 4 years probation and to 2.5 years of probation. </p><p>  Some facts regarding the life and death of the general remain open to question.  Whether he wanted to make a coup, who killed L. Ya. Rokhlin and for what purpose - this worries the inhabitants of Russia to this day. </p><p>  A monument to General Rokhlin was erected in the Prionezhsky district of the Republic of Karelia.  For all the time he has earned more than one fair award, celebrating his courage and selfless service for the good of his homeland. </p>
