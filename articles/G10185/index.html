    <p>  <strong>Who is the first ruler of Egypt?</strong> </p><p>  In the history of this country, the names of gods and pharaohs are sometimes intertwined.  For example, according to legend, the first ruler of Egypt after his death began to be considered one of the most revered gods in this country.  Therefore, it is sometimes very difficult for historians to figure out which of them is historical and which is a mythological person.  Starting from the Pre-Dynastic period, it becomes possible to name the names of specific rulers.  Nevertheless, in the most reliable sources describing Ancient Egypt, the rulers, or rather the first dynasty, originate from Menes, who rules the whole country.  His reign dates back to 4 millennium BC.  The sources also have evidence of the pharaohs Namer and Aga, but scientists </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient egypt rulers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/270175.jpg" width="224"></div>  tend to think that the first was Menes.  Since its days over 3 millennia, all the rulers of Egypt, including Cleopatra, have been recognizable.  During this period, the country was ruled by pharaohs from 33 dynasties, it is impossible to give an exact figure in this case, it is also very difficult to determine the dates of their reign.  By the way, according to local customs, regardless of the sex of the lord, whether it be a woman or a man, he was called a pharaoh.  The most famous of the rulers, of course, was Hatshepsut.

Next to them on the hierarchical ladder was the class of educated bureaucracy: nobles, priests and civil servants.  Below them was the estate of ordinary people engaged in agriculture.  The first country in which Pharaoh was considered the son of God is Ancient Egypt.  The ruler was perceived by his subordinates as the embodied <span>god-falcon Horus</span> (Horus) - the son of Osiris. </p><p>  <strong>Rituals</strong> </p><p>  After one of the pharaohs was dying, his successor was to reliably bury the previous pharaoh.  Because, according to legend, the <span>god Horus</span> fought with his uncle, the fratricide Killer, in order to return the throne of his father.  Sometimes the heir was crowned during the life of his father.  In this case, he became co-ruler of the current pharaoh.  The inaccuracies in historical calculations that are conducted around Ancient Egypt are due to the fact that it did not exist dating.  The chronology was conducted according to the dates of the reign of the pharaohs of the country called Ancient Egypt.  The rulers demanded that their priests keep a special record for this.  However, in view of the fact that there were co-rulers, there was a confusion that cannot be understood to this day. </p><p>  <strong>The power of Pharaoh</strong> </p><p>  By modern standards, the ruler of Ancient Egypt can be called an absolute monarch, because he was both the supreme commander of the troops and the supreme </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt rulers list" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/270185.jpg" width="600"></div>  the priest, and the head of administration, therefore, the <span>absolute monarchy</span> first appeared in the <span>African country of</span> Ancient Egypt.  The rulers in it were taken by the people as divine beings.  They were worshiped and believed in their powerful and supernatural power.
