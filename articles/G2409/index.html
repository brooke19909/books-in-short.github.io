    <h2>  Navy guy from the Ukrainian village </h2><p>  <span>The future hero of Sevastopol was born on January 10, 1828 in the village of Ometintsy, located on the territory of the current Vinnitsa region of Ukraine.</span>  <span>His parents were serfs.</span>  <span>As for the nationality of Sailor Cats, historians have no consensus on this issue, but many of them believe that he was Russian.</span> </p><p>  <span>Upon reaching the statutory age, Peter was appointed to the recruits and, serving his military duty, served as a sailor in the Black Sea Fleet.</span>  <span>As part of the crew of the battleship “Yagudiil”, he participated in the hostilities from the first days of the Crimean War.</span>  <span>When, in 1854, the almost two-year blockade of Sevastopol began, the sailor Koshka, among other crew members, was sent ashore, where he joined the defenders of the fortress.</span> </p><p>  <span>Fighting on a battery commanded by Lieutenant A.M.</span>  <span>Perekomsky, Pyotr Markovich was distinguished by outstanding courage and resourcefulness.</span>  <span>He showed these qualities especially vividly in reconnaissance and in capturing prisoners.</span>  <span>It is known that as a volunteer he participated 18 times in sorties into the territory captured by the enemy, and more than once alone he carried out the tasks.</span>  <span>Legends circulated about his heroism, bordering on recklessness.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Nightmare of the invaders </h2><p>  <span>Sailor Peter Koshka often had to carry out various sabotage missions in the territory occupied by the enemy.</span>  <span>No one could compare with him in the ability to silently "remove" the sentry or get the "language".</span>  <span>They told, for example, that somehow during military operations, he managed to capture three enemy soldiers with only one knife in his hands.</span>  <span>Another time, getting close to the enemy’s trenches, he dug out of the ground, and under heavy fire dragged the body of a Russian sapper, killed by enemies, and blasphemously buried waist-deep into the ground.</span> </p><p>  <span>And the story about how once the sailor Cat, penetrated the French camp and, having stolen a beef leg from their kitchen boiler, delivered it to his hungry comrades, seems absolutely incredible.</span>  <span>There was also a case when he stole an enemy horse, and did this only to sell, donate the proceeds to a monument to another hero of Sevastopol - the sailor Ignatius Shevchenko.</span> </p><h2>  Deserved Glory </h2><p>  <span>The command appreciated the heroism of Peter Markovich and, in early 1855, he was awarded the “Insignia of the Military Order” - an award established for the lower ranks and corresponding to the Order of St. George, that is, the George Cross.</span>  <span>Then the sailor Cat was promoted to non-commissioned officer and became a quartermaster.</span>  <span>During 1855, he was twice wounded, but both times returned to duty thanks to the art of the famous Russian surgeon N.I.</span>  <span>Pirogov, who was also among the defenders of Sevastopol.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Despite the fact that it was just a gift and also of a purely religious nature, the Cat carried it on his chest over his uniform, as a reward.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Short peaceful life </h2><p>  <span>In 1856, when the war was over, a decree of the new emperor Alexander II was issued, according to which every month spent by the defenders in the besieged city, was counted by him for a year of experience.</span>  <span>As a result, Pyotr Markovich received the right to be fired, which he did not fail to take advantage of.</span>  <span>At the end of the year, he left the army and left to reside in his native village, however, according to the law, Koshka was to remain in reserve for another 15 years.</span> </p><p>  <span>Returning to a peaceful life, yesterday's sailor engaged in ordinary village labor and soon married a local peasant woman who, after a while, gave birth to his son.</span>  <span>Local authorities, having heard about the heroic past of their peasant, often entrusted him with the protection of convoys bound for the <span>ports of Odessa,</span> Nikolaev and Kherson.</span>  <span>This was a very important task, since dashing people on Russian roads have never been translated.</span> </p><h2>  In the Baltic Fleet </h2><p>  <span>However, in 1863, fate was pleased to again send the St. George Knight to the warship.</span>  <span>This time, the occasion was the uprising that seized the Kingdom of Poland, which was under the jurisdiction of the Russian emperor.</span>  <span>Since by that time Pyotr Markovich was still in the reserve, he was again called up for the fleet, but not the Black Sea, but the Baltic.</span> </p>

    <h2>  The end of life, the beginning of immortality </h2><p>  <span>Pyotr Markovich died early when he was barely 54 years old, but he did it exactly as befits a hero.</span>  <span>In the winter of 1882, he threw himself into a wormwood, saving two girls who had failed in her.</span>  <span>As a result, the lives of children were out of danger, and he fell ill from hypothermia and, having lain unconscious for several days, died <span>on February 25.</span></span>  <span>He was buried in a village cemetery, subsequently liquidated.</span>  <span>The grave of the hero was not preserved.</span> </p><p>  <span>Having passed away, the famous St. George Knight became a symbol of selfless service to the motherland.</span>  <span>The monument to the sailor Cat was erected in Sevastopol, during the defense of which, he covered himself with unfading glory.</span>  <span>Also, the street adjacent to the Mamaev Kurgan was named after him.</span>  <span>In addition, the hero's busts adorn the Walk of Fame and museum complexes in various cities of the country.</span> </p><p>  <span>As already mentioned above, the image of the hero inspired many famous Russian writers who dedicated him both small stories and large literary works.</span>  <span>Perhaps most fully presented in the book "Cat Sailor", written by historian and writer K.K.</span>  <span>Golokhvostovym and out of print in 1895, but reprinted in our time.</span> </p>

Koshka, and at the same time, reveals the true meaning of one well-known winged expression.</span>  <span>They say that once during a visit by Admiral V.A.</span>  <span>Kornilov fighting positions, an enemy grenade fell at his feet.</span>  <span>Nearby Pyotr Markovich was not taken aback and, grabbing it, threw it into a cauldron with boiling porridge, which caused the wick to go out, and the explosion did not follow.</span>  <span>The admiral warmly thanked the resourceful sailor, after which he answered him with a phrase that became winged: "A good word - and it’s nice for the Cat."</span> </p>
