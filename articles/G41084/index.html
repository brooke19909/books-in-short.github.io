    <p>  The most interesting and demanded is the art of origami ("folded paper") - it is folded, not cut.  The ability to make an origami rose out of paper without scissors and glue is called the art of a single sheet.  The birthplace of this kind of needlework is Japan, not China, as some say.  Origami, given that it arose immediately after the invention of paper, has an interesting and long history.  For a very long time, expensive paper, which was strictly forbidden to tear, was the property of a religious Japanese cult.  And not only because the words ‚Äúpaper‚Äù and ‚Äúgod‚Äù in the Japanese language have the same root.  In any case, the monks brought this art to perfection, created an excellent school that absorbed even elements of the philosophy of Buddhism.  Nowadays, an increasing number of people are fond of the art of origami.  Rose, whatever you say, is a symbol of all that is beautiful, she could not help becoming one of the main objects of creativity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Numerous manufacturing options </h2><p>  There are a lot of options for making roses - from the simplest to the complex, which involves mastering the origami technique.  However, step-by-step instructions have been created that can greatly facilitate this process.  You can do needlework with your child, especially since this type of handicraft, like many others, develops spatial and <span>logical thinking</span> in children <span>.</span>  A rose made using the origami technique is simply beautiful.  It should be remembered that this type of <span>Japanese needlework</span> is called "the whole sheet art."  And although it is much more difficult to make a flower without resorting to scissors, it‚Äôs still worth a try. </p>

    <h2>  The simplest example of an origami rose </h2><p>  Now the market of tools and handicraft items is vast, a huge selection is offered for every taste.  For origami, you only need paper, and its options are endless.  <span>Roses from corrugated</span> paper are very beautiful, there are schemes of this flower and from shiny wrapping paper.  If you slightly depart from the strict rules of classical origami, a rose, trimmed in some places with scissors, decorated with spangles, with a stick and leaves inserted, turns into a wonderful gift, the value of which increases with the fact that he made it with his own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can give the following example of how to make an origami flower from paper.  Schemes (a rose is no exception) in this case will be a square sheet of paper with a spiral drawn on it.  To get started, you can take a sheet from a school notebook.  By combining two adjacent sides and cutting off the resulting single residue, you can make a square.  Having laid it out, we start with a pencil from the middle of any side of the sheet, draw a spiral with a height of 1.5-2 cm. Inside we leave a patch, which will serve as the basis in the future.  When a certain skill comes, the line can be drawn not in a straight line, but in the form of zigzags resembling the tops of a petal.  The length of the zigzags themselves can be varied: in the center of the rose - less, towards the end - more. </p>

    <p>  It should be borne in mind that the middle of the flower will be exactly the end of the spiral that starts from the side of the leaf.  Then we cut along the drawn line, whether it is oblique or straight, paper, resulting in a kind of strip 60-70 cm long. If there is already a certain dexterity, and one edge of the strip is made in zigzags, then they can be bent using the same scissors.  Now you can begin to twist this paper tape, either wrapping it on a pencil, or forming a seal inside, on which subsequent petals will be wound.  This should be done fairly tightly, slightly pressing the bud with your fingers.  Having finished winding, we will tuck a patch under the future flower, which remained in the middle of a sheet of paper, making the bottom of the plant out of it.  We put the flower on the table.  The rose is blooming.  You can give her freedom, but you can fix the petals.  Now glue the bottom edge of the flower to the bottom.  You can spread the petals, giving the flower a natural look.  This is the easiest way to make origami rose. </p><h2>  Time-Assigned Concessions </h2><p>  The final clip of the plant is a concession to time, because real origami products were attached during the manufacturing process. </p><p>  Having mastered the basic techniques, you can move on to more complex products.  At the beginning of the paper sheet is folded as many times as necessary for the manufacture of the desired product.  The folds are fixed with a fingernail or something solid, because it is on them that the "sculpting" of the rose will occur.  Then on them begins the design of the product.  The work itself is incredibly fascinating, but familiarization with a foreign, ancient art makes it also informative.  The choice of various paper, scissors and glue makes modern origami art more democratic. </p>
