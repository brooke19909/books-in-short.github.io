Interesting inventions of mankind</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Human thought can go so far that it is hard to imagine.  The most unexpected discoveries and inventions can completely change the world, turn it upside down, affect every person on the planet.  The most interesting inventions we will consider in this article. </p><h2>  Language and numbers </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the language can be called the most useful and interesting invention of all time.  Now it is difficult to imagine that some couple of thousand years ago it did not exist.  Of course, there were certain generally accepted gestures and sounds to denote certain objects or phenomena, but there were no words for metaphysical concepts, for what cannot be seen.  Therefore, the language can be partly called one of the engines of progress.  The same can be said about the numbers, without which we can not imagine our lives. </p><h2>  Alcohol </h2><p>  Some, of course, will say that alcohol has little relation to inventions, but a lot of useful and remarkable things have happened thanks to alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting inventions" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/744739.jpg" width="600"></div>  Despite the fact that now there is not so much good from him, in the Middle Ages he was a real salvation.  Indeed, in those troubled times, clean water was a rarity, and people had to drink <span>low-alcohol drinks in</span> order, firstly, not to get infected, and secondly, to slightly increase their immunity so that it could withstand viruses and bacteria.  Interesting inventions of mankind can take this form.

This applies, first of all, to printing, which was a huge breakthrough on the path to civilization, because before that, any work had to be simply rewritten by hand, which stimulated the broad development of literacy.  The first printing machine was created by the German inventor Guttenberg in the middle of the 15th century.  Very soon he became popular. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Initially, after the invention of the Internet, no one could even think that only a few decades later it would gain such popularity and would be used everywhere on the <span>globe.</span>  Moreover, at first the Network had completely different tasks. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting inventions of mankind" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/744741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Internet was used only for very serious research and military purposes, and soon after personal computers became more or less accessible, it spread around the world.  In a matter of years, the number of Web users has reached an incredible amount.  Today, a third of people on the planet have access to the Internet. </p><h2>  <span>Interesting inventions</span> at home </h2><p>  Of course, most high-tech gadgets and sophisticated devices cannot be done at home, but there are useful and simple things that even a child can handle.  For example, if necessary, you can make real gunpowder.  Do-it-yourself interesting inventions will require some materials.  So, to make gunpowder, it is necessary to prepare coal, sulfur and saltpeter.  All components must be crushed and mixed in a proportion of 18:17:65 percent, respectively.  Just do not forget about security! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  3D printer </h2><p>  <span>This invention</span> appeared recently, but has already managed to make a lot of noise.  At first, various trifles and household items were made on it, but with the development of technology, the 3D printer began to save human lives.  Now progress has reached the point that in this way it is already possible to create the <span>internal organs of a person,</span> which is so needed by people who need transplantation. </p>

    <h2>  Vacuum cleaner robot </h2><p>  Although this invention may not be as popular as the aforementioned ones, who said that interesting inventions cannot just be useful in everyday life?  A robot vacuum cleaner is not just a way to save time cleaning your home.  Due to the fact that most modern models are able not only to vacuum, but also to clean the floor, such a device can be an excellent assistant for people suffering from allergies. </p><h2>  Hydrogen tram </h2><p>  A breakthrough in the search for environmentally friendly fuels has already been made.  The first tram was created in China, which does not pollute the world around, because it runs on hydrogen.  Such a tram can travel a hundred kilometers without refueling, despite the fact that it is designed for almost four hundred people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="most interesting inventions" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/744742.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Transparent toaster and hot knife </h2><p>  This is another <span>useful invention</span> for those who don't like burnt toasts.  Such interesting inventions not only pleasantly improve life, but also help to save a little time, which is especially valuable in the morning.  About the same thing can be said about the heated knife.  If you suddenly need to spread bread with butter, which doesn‚Äôt like to be evenly placed on the sandwich, just use a hot knife, which, along the way, will slightly warm the butter to the desired state. </p><h2>  Something else? </h2><p>  Of course, dozens of new inventions appear in the world every day, sometimes incredibly strange and of little use.  But interesting inventions continue to excite the minds of successful scientists and beyond. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself interesting inventions" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/744740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Constantly incredible things constantly appear on store shelves.  They love to create such masterpieces in Japan.  For example, quite often on the streets of this state you can find vending machines that sell second-hand clothes.  Despite such a strange device, the level of development of robotics in Japan is at the highest level in the world.  Here you can meet robots created for a variety of purposes. </p><p>  Even though many different discoveries have already been made, we continue to hope that new things and devices will be invented that will make our lives a little nicer and easier.  Who knows, maybe soon a new, super-powerful train will be created, and it will be possible to get to work not in an hour, but in five minutes.  After all, such ordinary things for a modern person used to seem something surprising and not likely.  But this is still only in the future, and in the present it remains for us to use the things already created, the wisdom that scientists, researchers and random inventors have been accumulating for centuries. </p>
