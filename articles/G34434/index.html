Quick way</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any household appliances needs to be cleaned and maintained.  Even a <span>microwave.</span>  Cleaning the latter is still a task, because fat growths are not so easy to remove.  They tightly eat into the walls of the chamber, and scrubbing them is terribly inconvenient.  However, there are several ways to help clean the microwave with minimal effort.  They will help to cope even with a very dirty microwave.  Cleaning will no longer be hard labor.  And now we will consider these very methods. </p><h2>  Microwave Cleaning Options </h2><p>  How to clean the microwave inside?  The quick way is not a myth at all.  Any of them requires a certain amount of time.  But with these methods, everything will be much faster than just manually tearing the camera.  However, the point is not to reduce cleaning time, but to put a minimum of effort and get the highest quality result.  The following methods are available for cleaning the microwave chamber from fat accumulation: </p><ol><li>  Steam cleaning. </li><li>  Cleaning with soapy water. </li><li>  Soda cleaning. </li><li>  Eliminate fat with vinegar. </li><li>  The use of citric acid. </li><li>  Shine with orange peels. </li><li>  Cleaning with lemon. </li><li>  Use dishwashing detergent. </li></ol><p>  All of the above options help to achieve an almost perfect result.  However, it is worth noting that far from all the methods described in this material are suitable for regular use if the inner chamber of the microwave oven is coated with enamel.  For example, vinegar or citric acid have a destructive effect on an enamel coating.  However, we turn to a detailed consideration of all of the above methods.  And the first option is with steam cleaning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="crystalcattle.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cleaning with vinegar" class="if uuid-3025850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025850.jpg"></div><h2>  Steam cleaning </h2><p>  Many modern microwave ovens are equipped with a steam cleaning chamber.  But even if there is no such function, you can create it yourself.  Steam microwave cleaning is good if the dirt is not too scary.  If we are dealing with old pollution, then no steam will help here.  In any case, cleaning the furnace with steam (at least in the first stage) will not hurt.  What is needed for this?  Nothing at all: </p><ul><li>  a bowl of water (approximately 250 milliliters); </li><li>  microwave; </li><li>  wet sponge or cloth. </li></ul><p>  And you need to do the following.  Place a bowl of water in the microwave (cleaning will be done later), turn on the microwave oven at maximum power and set the timer for five minutes.  After this, the bowl must be removed and wiped the chamber walls with a damp sponge or cloth.  The principle is that steam will slightly dissolve the fat deposits, and they can easily be erased with a regular sponge.  But only if the accumulation is not old.  Then such a feint will succeed.  If the fat layer is too old, then it's time to move on to the next method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cleaningrva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cleaning soda" class="if uuid-3025856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025856.jpg"></div><h2>  Cleaning with soapy water </h2><p>  This method does not involve desperate hand cleaning.  And this is another answer to the question of how to clean the microwave inside.  The quick way is that the pairs of soapy solution will bring the old fat to the desired condition, and then it can easily be removed.  What you need to clean the microwave in this way: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  a container with soapy water (250 milliliters); </li><li>  microwave; </li><li>  sponge or wet towel. </li></ul><p>  You need to do the following: put the bowl with the solution in the microwave and turn it on for five minutes at maximum power.  During operation, the microwave vapor of the solution is absorbed into the fat and make it supple.  Then turn off the microwave and wait until the camera cools down.  We take a sponge (or a wet towel) in our hands and wipe the inner chamber with light movements.  In this way, fat can be easily removed even from hard to reach places.  But what to do if the microwave is very advanced?  Have to resort to more radical methods.  For example, such as microwave cleaning with soda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hirerush.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="steam microwave cleaning" class="if uuid-3025897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025897.jpg"></div><h2>  Soda Cleaning </h2><p>  This option must be used very carefully.  The fact is that soda has a pronounced abrasive property.  This means that there is a very high risk of damage to the enamel on the surface being cleaned.  Therefore, it is recommended to use not pure soda on the sponge, but its solution.  You need to make a sort of soda bath for the microwave.  Soda cleaning is easy.  Here's what you need for this: </p><ul><li>  a bowl (or some other container) with a solution of soda (the ratio does not matter); </li><li>  microwave; </li><li>  sponge (moistened). </li></ul><p>  The algorithm of action is as follows.  First you need to put the bowl in the microwave and turn it on at full power for about ten minutes.  During this time, vapors of soda should be well absorbed in the fat and make it jelly-like.  After that, take out the bowl, wait until the camera cools down, and wipe it with a damp sponge.  Especially rubbing is not worth it, since fat saturated with soda vapor acquires abrasive properties.  Enamel may be damaged.  There is another good option - cleaning the microwave with vinegar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vinegar Cleaning </h2><p>  This cleaning option removes even old fat growths with a 100% guarantee, but it is even more dangerous than the previous one.  Vinegar is too "vigorous" and negatively affects the enamel.  And if there is no enamel, then you can use it without any fear.  And then the microwave will always be clean.  It has one more feature: vinegar completely discourages an unpleasant smell, which inevitably appears with prolonged use of a microwave oven.  What is needed to carry out the cleaning process: </p><ul><li>  vinegar solution (0.5 liters of water per 50 grams of vinegar); </li><li>  wide capacity that fits in the oven; </li><li>  the microwave itself; </li><li>  wet sponge or cloth. </li></ul><p>  There are several options for removing fat from the walls of the microwave.  Cleaning with the first option consists in simply wiping with a solution of the chamber wall and leaving it for about 10 minutes. Then all fat (and solution) should be removed.  The second option is as follows.  You need to place the container with the solution in the microwave and steam the camera at maximum power for five or ten minutes.  After that, remove the solution and fat from the walls of the chamber with a sponge.  The second option is much more effective. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the microwave inside the quick way" class="if uuid-3025847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025847.jpg"></div><h2>  Purification with Citric Acid </h2><p>  Citric acid is another good microwave cleaner.  It works on the principle of soda, but is much safer than the latter.  Citric acid does not have an abrasive effect and does not affect enamel.  And cleans old fat no worse than soda or vinegar.  But citric acid has another feature: it corrodes some enameled surfaces.  But this is only if you overdo it with cleaning.  To eliminate fat you will need the following: </p><ul><li>  citric acid solution (50 grams per half liter of water); </li><li>  a wide bowl (or other container); </li><li>  the microwave oven itself; </li><li>  wet sponge or cloth. </li></ul><p>  You need to put the container with the solution in the microwave and turn it on for ten minutes at maximum power.  Then you need to wait until the walls of the chamber have cooled down (and the container itself).  We take the container out of the chamber and wipe the walls with a damp sponge or cloth.  Now we have a clean microwave.  Cleaning in this way helps to get rid of old growths of fat.  But the bad smell will remain.  If you need to eliminate it, then there is another way. </p><h2>  Orange Peel Cleaning </h2><p>  Means for cleaning microwave from fat can be very different.  But hardly anyone expected that ordinary orange peels could be useful in this case.  With their help, you can not only clean the microwave oven of dirt, but also achieve complete removal of unpleasant odors from the furnace chamber.  Many of the above methods lacked this.  What you need to clean: </p><ul><li>  orange peels; </li><li>  water tank (wide); </li><li>  the microwave itself; </li><li>  wet sponge or cloth. </li></ul><p>  The algorithm of action is as follows.  You need to put orange peels in a container of water.  Then put the container in the microwave and warm at maximum power for five minutes.  Then you need to let the crusts stand in the microwave chamber for another half hour with the door closed.  Then we take out the container and wipe it with a sponge or napkin.  And it turns out a clean and fragrant microwave.  If you don‚Äôt have orange peels on hand, here‚Äôs another way.  Also using the power of citrus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shefinds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cleaning with lemon" class="if uuid-3025867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025867.jpg"></div><h2>  Lemon Cleaning </h2><p>  Cleaning the microwave with lemon also helps to get rid of the strongest dirt and bad smell.  Lemon juice has a pronounced disinfecting property.  It perfectly kills mold, fungus and various bacteria.  Therefore, it is recommended to use it.  Since lemon is a natural product, it does not affect the enamel state of the microwave oven chamber.  For cleaning you will need: </p><ul><li>  two medium-sized lemons; </li><li>  water (0.5 liters); </li><li>  wide capacity; </li><li>  microwave; </li><li>  wet sponge or cloth. </li></ul><p>  You need to do the following.  Pour water into the container and squeeze the juice of all two lemons into it.  The remains of citrus fruits are also placed in a container.  We put the bowl with the resulting mixture in the microwave and heat it at maximum power for five minutes.  Let the containers stand for another half an hour.  Then we take out the solution from the chamber and wipe its walls with a damp sponge or cloth.  Enjoy the stunning aroma.  This option is the most effective and safe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oursimpleandmeaningfullife.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cleaning" class="if uuid-3025835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025835.jpg"></div><h2>  Cleaning with dishwashing detergent </h2><p>  An excellent eco-friendly microwave cleaner is the usual dishwashing liquid.  For cleaning microwave ovens, options such as Fairy or Dosya are great.  Other means can also be used.  Many of them not only dissolve fat, but also eliminate the unpleasant odor, which is also very good.  What will be required to carry out cleaning in this way?  The set is rather modest: </p><ul><li>  dishwashing liquid; </li><li>  sponge; </li><li>  microwave. </li></ul><p>  You need to do the following.  We take a sponge and drip Fairy on it to the size of an ordinary coin.  Then we foam it on a sponge.  Put the sponge in the microwave and turn on at minimum power for five minutes.  If you use the maximum, then the sponge will simply melt.  And so the pairs of detergent will settle on the walls with fat and dissolve it.  Then you just need to wipe the walls with another sponge.  Then, when the camera cools down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave cleaner" class="if uuid-3025878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3025878.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  There are several ways to clean your microwave.  Cleaning using one of them is no different from normal.  Only a person does not have to rub the walls to pain in the hands.  Most preferred are steam and orange peel (or lemon) peeling. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Means for cleaning the microwave of fat are very many.  They save time and effort.  However, some of them should be treated with caution.  For example, using soda or vinegar to remove complex contaminants can damage the enamel of the microwave oven chamber (if any).  The safest options are citrus fruits, steam or dishwashing detergents.  In principle, any of the above methods will help keep the microwave in perfect condition.  The user's task is to choose the right one for him. </p>
