    <h2>  The unique miracle of nature </h2><p>  A large pearl in the worldwide necklace of lakes is this ‚Äúglorious sea, sacred Baikal‚Äù.  Beauty, purity of water, uniqueness and greatness cause admiration: ‚ÄúHow beautiful you are, our father Baikal!‚Äù  Hundreds of poems are dedicated to the lake.  The purity of its waters is associated with the concepts of holiness and good deeds: "Baikal inspires and live, and create, intelligent, bright, to erect everything ..." </p><p>  Not enough epithets to admire the lake.  Its beauty and grandeur give rise to a special atmosphere that carries only positive emotions and in itself has healing properties.  Crystal purity of water (in winter, transparency reaches 40 m) and air are healing. </p><h2>  Gift to locals </h2><p>  Of course, it is a sin not to use such generosity of nature, if not for medicinal purposes, then at least for rehabilitation.  70 km from the lake is one of the largest cities in Siberia, Irkutsk, with a population of more than 600,000 people.  By the way, locals prefer to rest in the midst of the local beauties of nature.  There are other rather large settlements in the Baikal region, whose inhabitants love their legendary lake.  Naturally, civilized places of rest could not have arisen on its shores.  <span>Tents are tents,</span> and the cultural pastime is also not without charms.  Gradually, villages located directly on the shores began to turn into resorts not only of local importance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Common Transformation History </h2>

For example, the village of Enkhaluk, whose recreation facilities are known far beyond Siberia, is famous for these indicators.  Belonging to the Kabansky district of the Republic of Buryatia, the village is located 170 km from the capital Ulan-Ude and 430 km from Irkutsk.

    <p>  The history of the transformation of the coastal village into a resort is trivial: two streets, with cows grazing nearby, are gradually built up with houses and turn into the first recreation center (in this case, the Buryatnefteprodukt camp site), which is gradually gaining fame.  Hotels are being built, infrastructure is being created - in fact, a village is appearing, to the original name of which the word New Enkhaluk is added. </p><h2>  There would be no happiness ... </h2><p>  Welcome to Enhaluk!  <span>The recreation centers of the</span> southeastern territory of Lake Baikal, thanks to the village, have become very widely known.  Of course, the Internet greatly contributed to his fame in his day.  Oral stories reached the ears for a long time.  The modern village is in an amazing place - nearby, literally within walking distance, 6 km, the Gulf of Proval.  He is famous for the fact that in 1862, as a result of a 10-magnitude earthquake, the Tsagan steppe descended along with the Gulf of Old Sor and formed a shallow, well-heated dip in the summer months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Serenity and high service </h2>

Recreation facilities are mainly located in the latter.  The name of the resort itself is conducive to goodness - it came from the local word "enhe", which means "quiet, calm."  Most importantly, the mighty Baikal in this place is fully consistent with this characteristic.  In advertisements it is called ‚Äúpacified and serene‚Äù, which cannot but serve as an additional incentive to visit these places.

    <p>  The special charm of the southeast coast in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village is that the entire coast is golden beaches, which, combined with warm waters, make the Enkhaluk oasis irresistible.  Recreation facilities, such as Tatyana, Teremki, Enkhaluk and others, with their service that meets all modern requirements, bring the village well-deserved fame. </p><h2>  One of the pearls of Baikal </h2>

    <p>  The range of services provided is very wide - from fairly modest conditions to respectable (with the all-inclusive system) vacation spots. </p><p>  Choice and transport accessibility put recreation centers in Enkhaluk out of competition.  The popularity of these places is so high that there are no local residents left: all land plots have long been sold out, and the population of the village is made up only of vacationers. </p><p>  Many bases operate year-round.  Winter in these places has its incomparable charm, and it is on Lake Baikal that winter sports are very developed.  So there is never a deserted New Enkhaluk.  Recreation centers are filled in summer and winter.  The fact that the village is located on the territory of the Enkhaluksky Nature Reserve, famous for its rich flora and fauna, some of which are listed in the Red Book (osprey, cranes and white-tailed eagle), also adds charm to this place. </p><h2>  Base "Enkhaluk" as a business card </h2><p>  Among the abundance of resort centers, it is she who is the most noticeable - <span>the recreation center on Lake Baikal</span> "Enkhaluk."  And again, one cannot refrain from the epithet ‚Äúunique‚Äù.  Is it not a one-of-a-kind vacation spent in a triple Mongolian felt yurt, furnished with taste and equipped with all necessary amenities?  But back to civilization. </p><p>  The modern two-story building, designed for 29 beds, offers single and double rooms of the category "luxury" and "junior suite".  Summer vacations can be spent in elegant, cozy, well-equipped houses (of which there are 9 pieces), which are a wooden campsite.  On the territory of the base there is absolutely everything that the words ‚Äúcomfortable and elite rest‚Äù mean. </p><p>  A restaurant with 80 seats deserves special enthusiastic words.  And he is famous not only for omul ‚Äúon the horns‚Äù.  A pier with all kinds of watercraft, a Russian bathhouse and sports fields - all this (plus local zest of the ‚ÄúZimovye‚Äù corner type) makes the rest at this base attractive and desirable. </p><h2>  Tribute to tourism lovers </h2>

    <p>  Other advantages and original features may be tempting holidaymakers "Teremki".  Enkhaluk, in this case Old Enkhaluk, attracts primarily not by novelty, but by tradition.  On the territory there is a tent camp, wooden houses, designed for two or more guests.  In some ways, it resembles numerous departmental Soviet camp sites, dozens of which existed on the banks of any reservoirs.  But the towers of the eponymous base are very picturesque, these are not typical houses. </p><p>  They are made of environmentally friendly material - Baikal pine.  In addition, the territory of the base has a magnificent Russian bathhouse and other delights of modern civilization, for example, bicycle rental.  Base "Teremki" with affordable prices is more suitable for lovers of active tourist vacations.  About 14 routes to the protected areas of Lake Baikal operate, for example, along the taiga path to the White Rock or to the taiga spring.  Here you can fully enjoy a fairly well-equipped vacation, and the delights of the wild. </p>
