One of them is ‚ÄúRaven Stone‚Äù with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã9.5 hectares, and the second is ‚ÄúVorgolskoye‚Äù (31 ha).  These two sites are located in a canyon-like valley.  The Vorgolsky rocks alternately frame either the right or the left slope, creating charming outcrops on the bends of the river.  Everyone who has ever been here, notes that the Vorgolsky mountains and surroundings look simply amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vorgolsky rocks" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/458452.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Land characteristics </h2><p>  It is worth noting that such mountain landscapes are completely uncharacteristic of the Russian Plain.  Due to the special climate, the Vorgola Valley has become a refuge for many rare plant species that are more characteristic of the Caucasus and the Alps.  Here, for example, one can find mountain ferns (Robert's rodent, worm and hairy bone), high floristic diversity (more than 457 types of higher plants), rare plant species (Podolian shivereka, Alaunsky cotoneaster, pulled peppermint, fluffy currants, etc. )  These tracts are of great value, so they were taken under protection.  In particular, they are part of <span>the Galichya Gora Nature Reserve.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The unearthly splendor of the rocks </h2><p>  Vorgolsky rocks (Lipetsk region) are located on both banks of the river at an altitude of 40-50 meters.  The rocky shores stretch upstream several kilometers from the village of Nizhny Vorgol, forming a picturesque canyon-like valley, which is surrounded by greenery in warm time.  The legendary Vorgol caves are also located here.  The smallest rock cave ‚ÄúSmoked Stone‚Äù, which is cut by a crack, is considered the largest.  According to legend, this "scar" at the cliff appeared from the blow of the heroic sword.  By the way, the Vorgolsky rocks are fraught with many more unsolved secrets.  This region has preserved the traces of such great conquerors as Tamerlan, Batu, Mamai and others. </p><p>  At the foot of this stone formation there is an entrance to the cave.  Many old-timers say that the labyrinths inside the cave stretch for 3-5 kilometers, and several half-filled passages lead into its deep dungeon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vorgolsky rocks how to get there" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/458455.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Raven Stone </h2><p>  <span>This rock</span> is located on the right bank of the Vorgol River, its area is 9.5 hectares.  Visually, it seems that the mountain is covered with huge slabs of limestone.  From top to bottom, it is cut by a gorge, at the bottom of which there is an entrance to the cave.  Inside it there is an 8-meter corridor that leads deep into the cliffs.  It constantly narrows and on the 40th meter completely turns into a narrow mink. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Worgol Valley </h2><p>  The height of individual rocks in the valley reaches 20-25 meters - these are Fox, Big Kichy, Ravens and Smoked stones.  Vorgolsky rocks are a shelter for 7 species of fern, lichens, oak groves and lime trees.  At the foot of the cliffs are splendid meadows. </p><p>  The world of fauna here is also quite diverse.  In this region there <span>is a brazhnik butterfly,</span> as well as several species of bumblebees: reddish, steppe and moss, gray.  Wild bees live here - the Tartar halikta and the Andren mountain, their area is the Caucasus, the Urals, Western Europe.

    <h2>  How to get from Moscow by car </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the unique Vorgolsky rocks are located in the Lipetsk region 10 km from the regional center of Yelets.  To get to these amazing places from Moscow, you first need to go to Voronezh (360 km) along <span>the M4 highway.</span>  You get to Yelets, and after the traffic police post you need to drive about 1.5 km and turn right onto the "Key of Life".  Further, the road will lie through the railway lines, and after moving you need to go along the asphalt, after 1 km there will be a sign N. Vorgol-Dernovka.  This is what you need in Dernivka (that is, to the right).  You can get to the village of Dernivka on an <span>asphalt road.</span>  We move the power station, which will be on the left, and drive into the first left after it. </p><p>  After entering the village, you will see a shop on the right and a stop on the left, then drive along the asphalt to the fork and run into the second bus stop.  From here we turn left onto a dirt road.  We fall into a wide field and drive straight along the same primer.  After about a kilometer you will see a right turn.  It leads to a small career, and to the right of it there will be a platform above the rocks.  Having traveled a little more than a kilometer along the riverbank, you will run into a dead end.  This will be the final destination of your destination. </p><h2>  Vorgolsky rocks: how to get from Voronezh </h2><p>  If you go to the rocks from Voronezh, then first you need to get to Yelets, cross the bridge over the river.  Pine, then there will be another bridge across the railway.  After you pass it, at the intersection, turn left onto the "Keys of Life" (about 1.6 km from the railway bridge).  And then we follow in the same direction as mentioned above. </p><h2>  Railway transport </h2><p>  From Moscow to Yelets can be reached by train in 8-9 hours.  In the district center, we go to the bus station number 1, we take a bus to Dernovka.  Upon reaching the village, the main thing you will now need to see the Vorgolsky rocks is a map.  With its help, finding the mountains will not be difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Worgol rocks" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/458450.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who has seen live the Vorgolsky rocks (whose photos are really mesmerizing) do not regret a bit about their trip.  On the contrary, this place is calling to visit here again and again.  When you come here, all these rocks resemble fabulous giants and dragons.  And if you stand on the edge of the mountain, it seems that a light wind will catch you now and take you far, far along the river and the tops of the trees. </p><p>  To see such amazing landscapes in Central Russia is like getting into some other world.  When you go to the mountains, from a distance they are completely invisible.  Around the steppe, and then suddenly a sharp precipice, an emerald river murmurs quietly below.  And a little higher rise snow-white cliffs.  It seems that you are somewhere in the Caucasus or in the Crimea, but not in the territory of the Russian Plain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Worgol rocks photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/458451.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climbing festival </h2><p>  Climbing fans have long been chosen by the Vorgol mountains.  It even hosts the annual festival organized by the Russian Climbing Federation, the authorities of the Lipetsk Region, and several other organizations.

During the festival, participants live in tents, cook dinner together and sing with a guitar. </p><h2>  A wonder among the plains </h2><p>  According to many travelers, the Vorgolsky Mountains are not only a very picturesque area, where many <span>relic plants</span> and animals have been preserved, but also a place with a unique energy.  In this area, people begin to feel peace, tranquility and an incredible charge of vivacity.  To see the mesmerizing panorama from the top of the rocks, to visit the <span>karst caves,</span> where there are traces of the culture of the ancient Slavic peoples, is simply an indescribable pleasure.  These mountainous formations are like an oasis among endless plains, steppes and meadows.  It seems like they are sprouting from the ground right in front of you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dace vorgolsky rocks" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/458454.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  However, to see firsthand these amazing landscapes, you first need to come to Yelets (the Vorgolsky rocks are only 10 km from this district center), and from it you will have to get directly to the mountains themselves.  Such a trip will cause some inconvenience, but we assure you: it is worth it.  Have a nice trip! </p>
