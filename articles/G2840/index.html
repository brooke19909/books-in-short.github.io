    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  You can truly consider the hotel "Negresco" in Nice to be truly legendary.  History, interior, service - these and many other parameters determine its popularity.  Nevertheless, there were some negative aspects that were reflected in the negative reviews of the guests: </p><ul><li>  as for a five-star hotel, breakfasts are quite modest and not very tasty; </li><li>  the rooms practically do not catch wireless Internet; </li><li>  for such a lot of money I would like an individual approach to guests; </li><li>  the number of towels does not meet the standards; </li><li>  the rooms do not have electric kettles; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that check-in starts after three in the afternoon; </li><li>  on the veranda there is quite old metal furniture, which is in poor condition and does not quite correspond to the general style of the hotel; </li><li>  the rooms are quite old air conditioners that are difficult to control (it is almost impossible to adjust the temperature); </li><li>  a slightly musty smell in the corridors; </li><li>  do not really trust the promises about the view from the windows to the sea, because, in fact, only a small strip is visible; </li><li>  Of course, the interior of the bathrooms is quite interesting, but very impractical; </li><li>  the rooms have virtually no space for extra beds or cots; </li><li>  despite the high status of the hotel, cosmetics in the bathroom are of very mediocre quality; </li><li>  when you check in, you often have problems with your reservation; </li><li>  it is better not to order a taxi through the hotel services, because you have to wait a very long time and pay much more; </li><li>  drinking water in the room only upon check-in (although maybe later the maids forget to bring it); </li><li>  it is strange that in the rooms of a five-star hotel there are no cotton pads, no sticks, no toothbrushes, no shower caps and other hygiene items; </li><li>  many rooms have faulty door handles (of course, it is clear that the hotel is old, but it is worth periodically making repairs); </li><li>  poor sound insulation between rooms; </li><li>  in many wooden objects, screws and nails stick out, and therefore there is a great risk of injury or damage to clothing; </li><li>  there is a lot of mold on the walls in the bathroom; </li><li>  employees do not help bring suitcases to the room; </li><li>  The hotel has no Russian-speaking staff. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel "Negresco" in the very center of Nice is a pathos institution in which you can feel like a crowned person.  A distinctive feature of this institution can be considered a luxurious setting, which exactly repeats the interior characteristic of medieval France.  In addition, in the entire hotel there are a lot of genuine works of fine art, as well as valuable antique interior items.  Nevertheless, if you are not a fan of antiquity, then the hotel may seem somewhat uncomfortable to you. </p><p>  Many are interested in the question of whether it is possible to see the hotel "Negresco" for tourists.  Of course, because this is one of the main points of any excursion.  This building carries cultural and historical value that the French want to share with travelers.  Of course, the rooms are unlikely to be shown to you, but you can familiarize yourself with the salons, halls and other rooms that perform the museum function.  And, of course, you will enjoy visiting restaurants that are among the best in Nice. </p>
