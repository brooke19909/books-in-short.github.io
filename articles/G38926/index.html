    <h2>  Family apartments </h2><p>  And such rooms the hotel has Anastasia 4 *.  Family apartments are slightly more standards than 3 square meters.  m. However, this is just enough to accommodate an extra bed in the form of a sofa bed, designed for the third guest.  The price of a weekly stay on the all-inclusive system is <span>125-130 tons</span> .  for two, and 165-175 for three.  Rooms with sea views will be more expensive by 10-15 tons.  As in the previous case. </p><p>  Most will have to give to those guests who decide to stay in a family apartment with sea views and the right to visit the water park.  Three guests will have to pay 230,000 rubles per week (approximately 76 thousand rubles each).  But, however, when you take into account the "stardom" of the hotel and the fact that the declared price includes 9 percent VAT, the cost ceases to seem high.  Moreover, summer tariffs are given as an example.  And out of season the Anastasia Hotel offers much more favorable prices. </p>
