Almost all European countries took part in it, she left millions of human victims after herself.  The decisive point in this war was the treaty called the Peace of Westphalia.  Its results were of crucial importance for all further European history.  It was concluded on October 15 and 24, 1648 after lengthy negotiations, which lasted from 1644 and could not satisfy the conditions of all participants. </p><h2>  <span>Westphalian world</span> 1648 </h2><p>  He combined the Munster and Osnabruck peace treaties concluded this year in Westphalia.  In the city of M√ºnster, negotiations were held with representatives of Catholicism, and in Osnabruck, with the Protestant side.  Sometimes the Treaty of Westphalia also includes a treaty concluded on January 30 of that year by Spain and the United Provinces of the Netherlands, which ended the Eighty Years War, since the researchers consider the struggle between these states to be part of the Thirty Years. </p><h2>  What were the combined treaties? </h2><p>  The Osnabrueck Treaty was an agreement concluded between the <span>Roman emperor,</span> Sweden and its allies. </p>

    <p>  Muenster, however, the Roman Empire signed with France and those countries that supported it (they included Holland, Venice, Savoy, Hungary).  It was these two states that took such an active part in the fate of a large part of Europe because in the third and most important, crucial period of the Thirty Years War they contributed to the shattering of the forces of the Romans, which contributed to their fragmentation in the future.  The Westphalian world mainly denoted provisions that determined territorial changes, political structure and religious characteristics in the Holy Roman Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The results of the 30-year war </h2><p>  What ended the confrontation of countries?  Under the terms of the Westphalian peace, Spain recognized the independence of the Netherlands.  Also, according to this document, the countries that won the Thirty Years War - France and Sweden, were appointed guarantors of peace.  These powerful powers controlled the operation of the signed treaty, and without their consent they could not change a single article.  Thus, the whole of Europe was reliably protected from any global changes, which could entail a threat to the security of many countries.  And since, thanks to the <span>terms of the treaty, the</span> German emperor was powerless, the remaining strong powers could not be afraid of his influence.  The Westphalian world contributed to significant territorial redrawings, primarily in favor of the victorious powers of France and Sweden. </p>

This state, having begun its liberation war against Catholic Spain as a rebellion, received international recognition in 1648.

    <h2>  What did the countries that won the war get? </h2><p>  According to the decision taken at the signing of the Peace of Westphalia, the empire paid Sweden an indemnity of 5 million thalers.  In addition, she left the island of R√ºgen, Western Pomerania and part of the East (along with Stettin), the city of Wismar, the bishopric of Verdun and the archbishopric of Bremen (the city of Bremen itself was not included there). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sweden also got the mouths of many navigable rivers in northern Germany.

The new possessions after the signing of the agreement and the increased influence of the country helped her to further occupy a hegemonic position in Europe.

    <p>  The German principalities of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Braunschweig-Luneburg and Brandenburg, which supported the victorious countries, also gained advantages - they were able to expand their holdings as a result of the accession of secularized bishoprics and monasteries.  As a result of this treaty, Luiz was annexed to Saxony, and Upper Palatinate became part of Bavaria.  Elector Brandeburg also received in his possession vast lands on which Prussia was later formed. </p><h2>  What brought this world to the Germans? </h2><p>  The conditions of the Westphalian peace were such that the German emperor lost a significant amount of his former rights.  At the same time, the German princes became independent from the Roman ruler and were able to pursue an independent foreign and domestic policy.  For example, they could participate in decision-making regarding the outbreak of war and the conclusion of peace, their department had to determine the amount of taxes, and in many respects, the adoption of laws in the Roman Empire depended on them. </p>

The only thing that was not available to them was the conclusion of alliances with other powers against the ruler of the Roman Empire.  Speaking in modern language, after the signing of this treaty, specific German princes became subjects of international law and could take an active part in the political life of Europe.  Strengthening their positions contributed to the formation of the federal structure of modern Germany.

    <h2>  Religious life after 1648 </h2><p>  As for the religious sphere, Catholics, Calvinists and Lutherans were equalized in rights as a result of the Westphalian peace in Germany, and the <span>secularization of church lands</span> that was carried out in the 1920s was legalized.  From now on, the electors could not determine their religious affiliation for their subjects.  In addition, under the terms of the Westphalian peace, Spain recognized the independence of Holland.  Recall that the liberation movement in this country began with a speech against Catholic Spain.  In fact, this treaty legitimized the political fragmentation of Germany, ending on this the imperial history of this power. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the Westphalian world significantly increased the power of France, saving it from its main rival, Spain, which claimed the first role among all European states. </p><p>  Another important function of this treaty, which historians speak of: it was the basis for all subsequent European agreements until the 18th century, when the French <span>bourgeois revolution</span> took place <span>.</span>  Under the terms of the Westphalian peace, Spain recognized the independence of the Northern Netherlands.  The Swiss Union also received international legal recognition. </p><h2>  The value of the Westphalian world </h2><p>  Thus, this treaty is called the event that laid the foundation for the modern world order, which provides for the presence in the world of national states and the operation of certain principles of international law.  The principle of political equilibrium was probably formed precisely as a result of the emergence of the provisions of the Peace of Westphalia.  The tradition of solving complex territorial, legal, religious problems in the relations of two or more states with the help of the intervention of other strong and influential European powers has appeared precisely since then. </p><h2>  The significance of the 30-year war for shaping the current legal system </h2><p>  The concept of the ‚ÄúWestphalian system‚Äù, which refers to the field of world law and appeared after 1648, means ensuring the sovereignty of any state in its legal territory.  Until the nineteenth century, the rules of the treaty and the conditions of the Westphalian world largely determined the laws of the <span>Holy Roman Empire.</span> </p>

True, many scientists find certain shortcomings in the provisions according to which, after signing the contract, the inhabitants of Germany should have lived.  So, they were forced to practice the religion chosen by the ruler, that is, in fact, there was still no freedom of religion.  But, despite all the shortcomings, the Westphalian world was indeed the first (and successful) attempt to create a system of international law.
