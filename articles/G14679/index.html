    <p>  As already mentioned, the Paphiessa Hotel and Apt consists of 6 buildings with a total of 110 rooms.  The apartments are available in the following classes: </p><p>  - Standart room; <br>  - Studio number; <br>  - Onebedroom apartments. </p><p>  Each room has a small balcony, apartments of a more expensive category have their own terrace.  Paphiessa Hotel Apartments is a middle class hotel, it cannot afford new equipment, so all the furniture is a bit old, but the apartments are systematically cleaned and try to maintain cleanliness.  Each room has its own bathroom, hairdryers and towels.  There is also air conditioning, satellite TV with many channels, a small refrigerator and a safe (for a fee).  This room may have pool views (rooms <span>at Paphiessa Hotel and Hotel Apts 3</span> standard room) or mountains.  The superior apartments have a small, private kitchen, so you can buy groceries in the store and save on meals in a restaurant or cafe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rooms are non-smoking, but the hotel has designated smoking areas.  Internet access is available only in the hotel lobby, there is no Network in the rooms. </p><p>  Paphiessa Hotel Apartments <span>(Cyprus, Paphos)</span> is a great option for a budget holiday, tourists will definitely like it. </p><h2>  Location Reviews </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel is strictly on schedule.  Whenever you arrive in the morning, you will be settled at two in the afternoon.  You can pass the waiting time by exploring local attractions. </p><p>  Even if the room is not booked in advance, the hotel is trying to provide its guests with only the best apartments available. </p><p>  A special coloring is already felt in the corridor, where there are carpets on the floor, which today can be seen with grandmothers on the walls.  But this does not spoil the atmosphere.  On the walls of the floors you can see plain paintings with strange plots.  Some of them even open, but inside there is a void. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Paphiessa Hotel Apartments is designed for a budget holiday, so the quality of the rooms here is appropriate.  Nevertheless, the rooms are spacious, many have balconies.  The rooms are in need of repair, but the decor creates a pleasant atmosphere of coziness.  A special role in the interior is created by magnificent wooden furniture combined with antique curtains. </p><p>  It is better to warn about your preferences regarding sleeping places, otherwise you may get a room where two single beds will be moved together. </p><p>  Of the bath accessories, only soap is available, the rest must be taken with you. </p><p>  Get ready for cats in the room and in the dining room.  There are a lot of them in the district, but they are harmless.  There are practically no insects. </p><p>  The air conditioner is old, sometimes out of order, but free.  Alternatively, you can use a fan, but again, it is not in all rooms.  A safe is available for a fee. </p><p>  The rooms have a small old TV, which even shows the Russian channel.  But in Cyprus, watching television is a crime when there are so many interesting things around. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2>

    <p>  Guests who prefer a relaxing holiday can take <span>evening walks</span> along the Paphos promenade with many shops and cafes.  The hotel infrastructure is well thought out.  The noise from the bar to the rooms is practically not heard. </p><p>  The hotel has a nice pool.  Opposite the complex is a wonderful sports center with a large water area.  Classes cost 5 euros. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The road to the beach takes about 20 minutes walking through the busy quarter.  You should not spend too much money to live on the first line.  In Cyprus, this is simply pointless.  All beaches are municipal, equipped equally well with sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><p>  The closest to Paphiessa Hotel 3 is the beach, adjacent to the Alexander Hotel Complex.  The coastal zone is clean, the entrance to the water is gentle.  The sea is sometimes cooler than elsewhere. </p><p>  The staff is a separate article in the hotel comments.  The Paphiessa Hotel complex is no exception. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Hotel staff for the most part try to please the guests as they can.  But you can also encounter a biased attitude towards tourists who do not speak English.  This is expressed in looks, gestures, intonation. </p><p>  The owners of the hotel are nice people, but if they notice arrogance on the part of the guests, then the latter will have to endure their entire rude attitude to themselves.  Perhaps this is justified, as some tourists behave obscenely. </p><p>  If you remain human to the end, then your attitude towards you will be human. </p><h2>  Holiday Tips </h2>

    <ol><li>  Bringing a boiler with you can save a lot on food.  The room has the ability to store food and even cook dinners.  The nearest supermarket prices are reasonable. </li><li>  The cafe has huge portions.  Side dishes, bread and sauces are also free.  One serving is enough to fill two adults.  Prices in almost all establishments are the same.  The most expensive dishes, consisting of 25 components, cost only 30 euros.  But even 2 people can‚Äôt eat it.  You can safely take children with you or ask the rest to take with you.  In local cafes, this practice is encouraged. </li><li>  To explore local attractions, it is better to purchase a bus pass and go around all the interesting places on it.  So you can significantly save on excursions, the cost of which is on average 30 - 40 euros per person.  There are tours for 350 euros, but all this can be visited almost for free, but on your own. </li></ol><p>  Cyprus is an unusually fabulous island, which is accessible even for tourists with a small income.  The hotels here are only for overnight, it is better to spend your time not on burning money in local bars, but on interesting trips to amazing places.  Therefore, the Paphiessa Hotel 3 is a great option for those who like to save money.  Nevertheless, there are good living conditions, varied food and a wide range of additional services.  This hotel complex is ideal for those who prefer a relaxing holiday with family and close friends.  Youth here may be bored. </p>
