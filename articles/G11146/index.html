    <h2>  Cultural and historical significance of the city </h2><p>  At the confluence of Kotorosli and the Volga in the 11th century, a fortress was erected, which was supposed to protect the approaches to Rostov the Great.  The walls of the Spassky Monastery became witnesses of the fierce and selfless battles of Russian soldiers with the Horde invaders.  The militia of Minin and Pozharsky flocked to the city for the liberation of Moscow.  Here, in Yaroslavl, one of the lists of "Words about Igor's Regiment", a pearl of the literature of Ancient Russia, was discovered.  The name of this great city located on the Volga is also associated with many biographical facts from the life of the great cultural figures of our country: F.G.  Volkov, director, actor and playwright, N.A.  Nekrasov, dear poet of the Russian heart, L.N.  Trefolev, poet-democrat, A.M.  The guardian, sculptor L.V.  Sobinov, singer, A.I.  Savrasov, the artist.  Let us look into the distant past of our country, where chronicles coexist with many legends and folk traditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did Yaroslavl come about? </h2><p>  The history of the city of Yaroslavl is rooted in antiquity.  This city starts from the place that is still called Strelka.  In Russian toponymy this word is often found.  So called the long braid, the cape at the confluence of two rivers.  It was here, on the arrow formed by the confluence of the Kotorosli River, and also on the arm of Kotorosli, which runs along the bottom of the Medveditsky ravine, the first settlement of local residents arose. </p><p>  As a result of archaeological excavations on Strelka, traces of the Meryansky village were discovered, from which the history of the city of Yaroslavl begins.  One of the legends about how this city originated has something in common with data collected by archaeologists.  It is called "The Legend of the City of Yaroslavl."  This legend has come down to us in the notes of Samuel Mislavsky, the Rostov archbishop. </p><p>  Such is the story about the city of Yaroslavl, or rather, its background.  About how it was founded, read below. </p><h2>  The ancient legend of the bear </h2>

    <p>  The history of the coat of arms of the city of Yaroslavl is as follows.  It depicts a bear.  This forest owner is one of the main characters in the ancient legend of how this city originated.  The history of the city of Yaroslavl is closely connected with this animal.  In “The Tale ...” one can read that when, after establishing tribute from the inhabitants of the Medvezhy Ugol, Yaroslav the Wise came again to these places from Rostov, the inhabitants sent him a “beast of the beast and dogs”.  But the prince defeated the beast.  Local residents were afraid of the power of Yaroslav the Wise and fell down in front of him.  This story is especially loved by children when they tell them how Yaroslavl came about.  A brief history of the city for children must include this legend. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As you know, many peoples who had a cult of the bear had a peculiar taboo - a ban on calling his name.  About the bear always said "old man", "beast", "master".  Echoes of this phenomenon in some places are found today, of course, only in the form of folk traditions. </p><h2>  Bear corner and the emergence of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  In the Yaroslavl region, we also have information about the cult of this beast in ethnographic, archaeological material.  Let us recall at least <span>the Medveditsa River</span> (which is the left tributary of the Volga) and the ancient settlement located here, called the "Bear City".  The horror that gripped the inhabitants of the Bear Corner at the death of the sacred animal was truly great. </p>

    <p>  In one form or another, the legend about the deed of Yaroslav the Wise existed, most likely, in antiquity.  That is how our ancestors imagined what the history of the city began with. </p><p>  Yaroslavl ... A summary of the legend about this city, founded by Yaroslav the Wise, was passed from parents to children.  It was reflected in the old coat of arms of the city, the earliest image of which dates back to the 17th century.  Prince Yaroslav, of course, was not content only with a victory over a bear, a symbol of the independence of this place.  In order to gain a foothold on the important waterway from Rostov, he founded the city on the modern Strelka, reminiscent in plan of an equilateral triangle.  Such is the history of the formation of the city of Yaroslavl. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Versions about the foundation of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  When did this momentous event happen?  This is perhaps one of the most controversial and complex issues that marked the history of the city of Yaroslavl.  Most often, the foundation of the city is associated with the events of 1024.  Yaroslav the Wise, who was embroiled in a feud with his brother Mstislav in the south, was forced to take up the affairs of the land of Suzdal.  This marked the beginning of further events, as a result of which the city was formed. </p><p>  There is also another point of view about how the history of the city of Yaroslavl began.  Briefly outline its essence.  Yaroslavl, according to some researchers, was supposed to be founded by the prince no later than 1010 years.  According to this version, the legend relates the events that took place in the Bear Corner to the time when Yaroslav was the Rostov prince.  The foundation of the fortress near Kotorosli, the navigable river, could be dictated by the strengthening of princely power in the Rostov land. </p><h2>  The first mention of the city in the annals </h2><p>  By 1071, the first mention in the annals of such a city as Yaroslavl.  A brief history of the city for children or adults should include the story that on the banks of the Volga (northeast of Russia) at this time a smerdy uprising led by the Magi began.  In the annals you can find a detailed record of how the local peasants spoke, led by "two wise men from Yaroslavl."  The prince's squad crushed this rebellion. </p><h2>  The origin of the name "Yaroslavl" </h2><p>  We see that the connection of this city with the name of its founder, Yaroslav the Wise, is obvious.  Subsequently, this figure became the great Kiev prince.  The name structure is pretty simple.  Even a child can be explained what Yaroslavl means.  The history of the city for children (a brief summary of this article may become its basis) should be told in simple language, but at the same time fascinating.  Without delving into linguistic analysis, a child can simply be told that "Yaroslavl" means "Yaroslav city." </p><h2>  Chopped city </h2><p>  In the 13th century, the history of the city of Yaroslavl, summarized in this article, was noted by another important event.  Prince Konstantin Vsevolodovich in 1215 laid the "chambers" on Strelka - the princely court, as well as the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin, the first stone church.  One of the most ancient monasteries in North-Eastern Russia - Spaso-Preobrazhensky (which was also called simply Spassky) appeared in the city.  Yaroslavl initially was, like most other <span>cities of Ancient Russia, a</span> wooden chopped fortress.  Therefore, the oldest part of it located on Strelka was called for a long time the Chopped City. </p><p>  Nowadays, the name of the church built in 1695 - Nikola Rubleny city, otherwise - the church of Nikola Rubleny, reminds of this poetic old name.  According to some researchers, the name "Chopped City" was fixed relatively late due to the opposition to the Earth City in the 16th century.  In 1463, Yaroslavl entered the Russian state.  The history of the city for children, the brief content of which can be expanded by adding the curious information from this article, does not necessarily have to contain all historical details.  It will be enough to say that the further economic development of the city and the growth of its territory began after this event. </p><p>  Yaroslavl already in the 16th century surrounds its posad with a deep outer moat and a high earthen rampart.  The name "Earth City" comes from here.  Here we can mention the existence of a parallel with Moscow, where in ancient times there was also the Earth City.  In present Yaroslavl there is also Red Square, a photo of which is presented below. </p>

    <p>  The administrative center of the city, which is noteworthy, until the end of the 18th century was on the territory of Chopped City.  After that, the so-called regular plan of Yaroslavl arose, according to which the center was moved to Ilyinsky Square (later renamed Sovetskaya). </p><h2>  City street names </h2><p>  One fact cannot be overlooked when describing the city of Yaroslavl.  History, its sights - all this is very interesting.  However, the names themselves associated with this place are no less curious.  As you know, Yaroslavl is one of the most ancient cities of Russia with a long history, natural features.  But, looking at the map of the city today, we will not meet many imaginative, ancient names.  The street names are as follows: Revolutionary, Sovetsky Lane, Deputatskaya, Pervomaiskaya, Cooperative, School, etc. However, there are also names associated with the history of this city: Melny Lane, City Val, Nekrasova, Yamskaya, Suzdalskaya, Sailor's Descent, etc. </p><h2>  Trefolev Street in Yaroslavl </h2><p>  We will tell briefly about one street that can be found by visiting the city of Yaroslavl, the history, sights and legends of which we are interested.  On a modern map there is a street Trefoleva.  Yaroslavl in her title immortalized the memory of the poet-democrat who lived here, - L.N.  Trefolev (1843-1905).  He was also a good translator, historian, editor.  Many of his poems became folk songs.  This, for example, "Song of the Kamarin peasant", "Dubinushka" and others. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl - the city in which Nekrasov was born </h2><p>  Literary, poetic Yaroslavl - this is primarily Nekrasov.  In fact, Yaroslavl is the birthplace of this great Russian poet.  He was brought by a three-year-old child to the village of Greshnevo (now called Nekrasovo), the family estate of his father, located near Yaroslavl.  Nekrasov at the age of 11 entered the local gymnasium.  The child will certainly be interested to know that this great poet lived in a city like Yaroslavl.  For this reason, the history of the city for children should include brief biographical information from its life. </p><p>  The poet, in his mature years, did not lose touch with his homeland.  He often came to Greshnevo for the summer, and also acquired a manor in the village of Karabikha in 1861.  In this estate he lived annually for almost 14 years for several months and wrote his best works.  The area in which this village is located is associated with historical events.  In the second quarter of the 15th century, during the internecine war, it was here that battles were fought between Vasily the Dark, the Prince of Moscow, and <span>Dmitry Shemyaka, the</span> Prince of Galicia, for the great reign.  In 1435, the troops of Shemyaki were defeated in the battle near the Karabitova mountain (a hill near Karabiha). </p><h2>  Historical events associated with the Transfiguration Monastery </h2>

    <p>  The name of the city of Yaroslavl for literary historians, as well as for every Russian person, is connected with one more fact.  We mentioned at the beginning of the article that the Transfiguration Monastery is one of the oldest in Russia.  He is known to many for the events of domestic history.  For example, a religious school was created here, the first in northeastern Russia, which had a large library for that time, consisting of a thousand manuscript books.  Also outside the walls of the Spassky Monastery in 1571, Ivan the Terrible himself found shelter when the troops of Devlet Giray, the Crimean Khan, approached Moscow.  In addition, the walls of this monastery were able to withstand in the spring of 1609 a heavy 23-day siege during the struggle with the Polish invaders.  And in <span>1612,</span> on July 27, the <span>people's militia</span> led by Minin and Pozharsky left here for a decisive battle with the enemies settled in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  However, one fact from his history is especially expensive.  The list of "Words about Igor’s Regiment", a great monument of ancient Russian literature, was kept in the sacristy of this particular monastery.  Count Musin-Pushkin in 1795 bought a number of valuable manuscripts from Joel Bykovsky, a former archimandrite.  The collector found among them a list of "Words ...". </p><p>  We have already talked about the library of the spiritual school located in the Spassky Monastery.  Both the library and the school itself were transferred to Rostov in 1214.  Her treasures, unfortunately, were burned during a fire in this city.  Perhaps it was in this library that the manuscript of the Word was stored, with which a list was made in the 16th century, which was later acquired by Musin-Pushkin. </p><h2>  A.K.  Savrasov - another famous resident of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  Many interesting facts from the biography of figures of Russian culture are associated with the city of Yaroslavl.  Not many probably know that it is here that A.K.  Savrasov, a great artist, worked on his painting "Rooks Have Arrived" (as well as on many other works).  He spent in Yaroslavl, it would seem, very little time - several months of winter and spring of 1870-1871.  However, it was this period of creativity that turned out to be very fruitful for the artist.  In Yaroslavl, he painted such famous paintings as The Grave on the Volga, The Spill of the Volga over Yaroslavl, and The Volga.  It was also created several sketches of the famous "Rooks".  One of the first was written on the then outskirts of the city, called the Vole.  The Vladimir Church served as the backdrop for the tree on which the rooks nested. </p><h2>  The battle with the Tatars that took place on Tugovaya Hill </h2><p>  The threat of the invasion of the Horde did not bypass the Yaroslavl principality.  Enemies burned the city, and Vsevolod, the first Yaroslavl prince, died during a battle on the City River, which the Russians lost.  But the city did not give up.  Its inhabitants in 1257 revolted.  Yaroslavl, according to legend, met a Tatar detachment behind Kotorosl.  Here, under the leadership of Prince Konstantin, a battle took place on a small hill, which later became known as Tugovaya Gora.  Although the locals fought bravely, the forces this time turned out to be unequal.  Directly on the battlefield, on Tugovaya Hill, Russian soldiers were buried.  Popular rumor subsequently began to associate the name of the mountain with this battle.  According to legend, women came to the hill for a long time after the battle in order to mourn the fallen, to "poke" them.  Allegedly, this became the basis of the name. </p><p>  However, these events are not documented.  Chronicles of the battle with the Tatars are silent, and the reign in Yaroslavl of Constantine can be established only indirectly. </p><h2>  Sights of Yaroslavl </h2>
