  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone Sony Ericsson W200i: description, specifications, test, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, it will not be possible to feel a lack in the range of mobile devices.  Every year the market is replenished with new models.  However, in this article I want to nostalgic and review the Sony Ericsson W200i.  It was released ten years ago. </p><p>  At the start of sales, the device confidently took a leading position in the segment of expensive devices.  Connoisseurs of the brand watched as the W200i model changed value over the entire period of time until it was released.  Sudden jumps both up and down were not noticed.  The price of $ 200 affected demand: it kept it at a moderate level. </p><p>  According to users, this model was released by the manufacturer to expand the range.  There is always strong competition in the mobile device market, so developers have to look for fresh ideas and new solutions.  Not for nothing that some buyers noted a certain similarity with the K310i and K320i, manufactured under the brand Sony Ericsson.  This indicates that the W200i cannot be called a separate product.  The developers used only small changes in the system "stuffing" and finalized the styling.  Phones differ from each other in color and some functionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson w200i" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  <span>Sony Ericsson W200i</span> pleased buyers with a wide range of color options: black with a splash of red (Rhythm Black) and blue (Mono Blue), white with orange accents (Pulse White) and graphite (Aquatic White), pink with a fringing of contrasting silver (Sweet Pink) and Gray.  The chip of this model was a combination of representatives of the palette.  For example, in the black version, the entire body is made in one color scheme.  On models of blue and red colors there was a Walkman inscription indicating that the device belongs to the music class, autonomous player control keys, a joystick backlight and a trademark in the lower part of the case, which is located immediately below the keyboard. </p><p>  As for the white version, the distribution of colors in it was somewhat different.  The main color is used for the front and rear panels.  Accents in the form of other representatives are located on the side faces, uniting in a kind of frame.  In order to make the design look complete, we also used an insert on the rear panel, placing it in the lower part of the case.  It is on it that you can see the green and white company logo. </p><p>  Sony Ericsson W200i was made of plastic.  The dimensions of the case, according to users, are optimally selected.  At a height of 101 mm, the width of the phone was 44 mm.  The thickness is quite rather big - 18 mm, however in 2007 such an indicator was within the normal range.  In their reviews, the owners respond positively to the quality of the assembly.  The phone is rugged and reliable.  If you look from the side, you can see that the designers decided to abandon the standard solutions by choosing the shape of a parallelogram for the case.  Thanks to this, the Sony Ericsson phone looks quite original. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front panel is equipped with all the necessary elements.  Of course, this is the screen above which the speaker is displayed, and the company logo.  Below it is a control panel consisting of five buttons.  To arrange the latter, the manufacturer chose the shape of a horizontally elongated oval.  We will talk about the numeric keypad below. </p><p>  On the back cover there is a hole for the output speaker.  It is made in the form of a semicircle.  A camera lens is displayed next to it.  Below is the name of the company, under which the logo flaunts. </p><p>  On the side faces there is a ‚Äúswing‚Äù volume (right) and a player button (left).  A standalone button for controlling the camera is not provided.  On the left side, the designers installed a slot for a memory card.  It is covered with a plastic plug, which has the inscription M2.  The bottom end is used to accommodate the Fast Port type connector for the charger, it is also intended for connecting a headset, there is also a microphone hole.  The power button is located on the opposite side of the case.  Near it there is an infrared port.  For those who prefer to carry the phone on a cord or strap, a hole for mounting is provided on the upper end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Ericsson phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715066.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  What display is used to play graphic information on the Sony Ericsson W200i?  The screen is small, its diagonal is only 1.8 ∫.  It is unnecessary to speak about image clarity.  Resolution 160 √ó 128 px does not give high quality.  Color rendering is limited to only 65 thousand shades.  The encoding of one pixel uses 16 bits of memory. </p><p>  The display is made using UBC technology.  Unfortunately, it does not provide high image quality.  In the sun, the screen fades greatly, graininess is visible to the naked eye.  The picture looks unrealistic, the color saturation is weak. </p><p>  The screen size is enough to display 6 lines of information text and 2 service ones.  There is also always a panel with battery and mobile network signal levels.  It is located at the top of the display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson w200i battery" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715068.jpg" width="451"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Sony Ericsson phone is controlled via a keypad.  The manufacturer did not apply innovative ideas, repeating the concept of past models.  The keyboard consists of two blocks.  The first is soft keys.  The phone is controlled by two paired buttons and a joystick for five positions.  The digital unit consists of four rows in which three buttons are combined.  They are removed from each other at a certain distance, which greatly facilitates the process of dialing a number or text.  Pressing feels pretty good, since each button has a hard move.  According to users, this is very convenient.  There are comments on the design of the joystick.  It is small in size, so managing it is not very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="games for sony ericsson w200i" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715069.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Which battery is installed on the Sony Ericsson W200i?  Autonomous operation is provided by a BST-36 lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity is 750 mAh.  What is the owner‚Äôs battery life?  After testing, the following results were published.  In order for the phone to work up to 3 days, you need not exceed the talk time - 2.5 hours is permissible, data transfer via infrared - no more than 30 MB, listening to music - 2 hours through the headset and 20 minutes.  through the speaker, application activation - 30 min. </p><h2>  Sony Ericsson W200i: memory features </h2><p>  In order for the user to be able to store all kinds of software on the phone, the manufacturer has provided a special memory storage.  In this model, the size of the ROM is 27 MB.  Such a volume is not enough for full-fledged work.  In order to expand the capabilities of the phone there is a slot for Memory Stick Micro M2.  If the owners will use a memory card, they will be able to install applications, music, photos with almost no restrictions, since it provides 2 GB of storage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson w200i specifications" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715070.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  What optics are used on the Sony Ericsson W200i?  The price in this issue is not an indicator.  Given that in 2015 it was possible to purchase a phone for 2500-3000 rubles, the camera is not very high.  It is made on the basis of a 0.3-megapixel matrix.  Photo sizes - 640 √ó 480 px.  The quality is low.  Pictures are fuzzy, poor color reproduction.  When working with the camera, you can enlarge the image 4 times.  However, according to users, the quality is significantly reduced.  Using the camera, you can shoot video.  Its maximum resolution is 176 √ó 144 px. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson w200i price" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715071.jpg" width="461"></div>

    <h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The inscription on the Sony Ericsson W200i Walkman case indicates the use of a proprietary music player.  In this model, its second version is installed.  According to connoisseurs of the brand, it is practically no different from the previous ones.  But the sound quality, on the contrary, has improved significantly.  The developers have increased the reproduction of low frequencies.  An indisputable advantage is the easy control of the player.  It is carried out using an autonomous button located on the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ericsson w200i screen" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1715086.jpg" width="424"></div>

    <h2>  Menus and applications </h2><p>  The menu consists of 12 main points.  Most of them are standard.  You can select PlayNow - a service that is used to download music tracks, and Walkman - the original player.  The organizer provides all the necessary services, such as synchronization, code memo, tasks, and others. </p><p>  Games for Sony Ericsson W200i are developed taking into account the characteristics of the screen, so QuadraPop (a type of Tetris) and Treasure Towers are available to the user. </p>
