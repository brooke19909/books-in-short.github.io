    <p>  The distribution of water in Africa is closely related to climatic conditions and topography.  Approximately half of the entire continent belongs to the areas of internal flow.  This is mainly due to the fact that the territory receives very little rainfall.  Those areas, which are characterized by their large volume, are distinguished by a widely developed water network.  Thus, the rivers of Africa are distributed unevenly across the mainland. </p><p>  The total annual flow on the continent is about 5390 cubic meters.  In this indicator, Africa is inferior to South America and Asia.  In accordance with the basin area, <span>wastewater</span> volume <span>,</span> length, many rivers of Africa are considered the largest in the world. </p><p>  The distribution of runoff, as well as the water network, depends on various climatic factors, features of the relief, rocks in a particular area.  Many rivers in Africa, not reaching the ocean, end in the inland hollows.  The water network on almost the entire continent has rainwater supply.  The exception is rivers and other water bodies of <span>deserts and semi-deserts.</span>  In these areas, stocks are enriched by wastewater. </p><p>  The East African Plateau acts as a watershed.  In this regard, almost the entire stock goes to the <span>Atlantic Ocean.</span>  The rivers of Africa are distinguished by the presence of a large number of waterfalls and rapids; they are practically unsuitable for navigation.  However, they also have significant hydropower reserves. </p><p>  In the regions of the <span>equatorial belt,</span> African rivers are quite full-flowing all year, forming a fairly dense river network.  In subequatorial belts, they are full-flowing only during the rainy seasons.  In dry tropical areas there are practically no surface water bodies.  But artesian pools are common in these areas.  On the territory of the mainland, you can also find dry channels.  They are filled with water after occasional rains.  For rivers in the subtropical zone, a rise in water level is characteristic of the rainy season.  While on the Mediterranean coast this happens in the winter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The largest rivers on the mainland are the Zambezi, Niger, Zaire (Congo). </p><p>  The latter is considered the most full of all.  In addition, Congo ranks second on the continent in length after the Nile.  The length of Zaire is 4320 kilometers.  Its basin is second only to the Amazon in area and volume.  Congo crosses the equator in two places and is full of water throughout the year.  It flows along the ledges in the plateaus, in connection with which there are many waterfalls and rapids.  The largest tributaries are the following: Kasai, Ubangi, Lukuga.  Congo flows into the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  <span>The longest river</span> on the mainland is the Nile.  In addition, it has the largest length in the world.  The length of the Nile River is 6671 kilometers.  The basin area is 2870 thousand square kilometers.  In the upper reaches, the Nile rushes down the gorges.  Many waterfalls and rapids form here.  On flat terrain, the current is quite calm and slow;  in this territory the river is called the White Nile.  The largest right tributary flows from the <span>Ethiopian Highlands</span> .  Near the city of Khartoum, the White Nile and its tributary, the Blue Nile, merge.  The channel becomes twice as wide. </p><p>  The Nile crosses the Sahara without any tributaries here.  Falling into the Mediterranean Sea, forms a delta. </p><p>  The largest river flowing into the Indian Ocean in Africa is Zambezi.  Its length is 2660 kilometers.  <span>Victoria Falls,</span> one of the largest in the world, is located on this river.  It has a width of one thousand eight hundred and a height of one hundred twenty meters. </p><p>  The third largest area on the continent is the Niger River.  In the upper and lower channels, it is distinguished by a large number of waterfalls and rapids.  In the middle reaches, Niger is a flat river.  A significant part of its course crosses rather arid regions. </p>
