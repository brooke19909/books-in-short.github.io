The south of Italy is world famous for its outstanding architecture, and the eastern region of Puglia is no exception.  Many structures are of interest not only for original designs.  Buildings, the purpose of which remains a big mystery for posterity, become the subject of discussion by tourists and the object of many years of research by scientists. </p><h2>  Bari: Attractions of the Middle Ages </h2><p>  The capital of the region is famous for its religious monuments.  <span>The Basilica of St.</span> Nicholas with the streaming relics of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, the church of St. Sabine are the main attractions of the ancient city.  Around Bari are medieval historical monuments, which tourists come from all over the world to admire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castel del monte" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1310021.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most famous building is the castle of Castell del Monte, named the most mysterious building in Europe.  A regular octagon, literally saturated with symbolism, raises the minds of specialists. </p><h2>  Contradictory identity of the owner of the castle </h2><p>  To understand the architectural features of the capital structure, you need to get acquainted with its owner - a man ambiguous and evoking different feelings among historians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The controversial personality of the <span>Holy Roman Emperor</span> Frederick II Hohenstaufen caused a lot of controversy and opinions.  It is known that his cruelty and thirst for power knew no bounds.  For lack of religious feelings, he was excommunicated, which did not prevent him from winning the Crusade. </p><p>  The emperor who returned Jerusalem to the Christian world was considered a very educated person.  The surviving old document describes the decree of Frederick II on the beginning of large-scale construction of the castle near the monastery of Santa Maria del Monte.  On a high hill, work began in early 1240, lasting about ten years. </p><h2>  The fate of the historical monument </h2><p>  It is believed that the emperor himself took part in the development of the grandiose project of Castell del Monte, but no documentary evidence of his residence in his brainchild was found.  After the death of the crowned lady, the castle was inherited by the sons, but after some time it was abandoned and served as a shelter for local shepherds.  After repeated acts of vandalism in 1876, he was taken under state protection. </p><p>  There is a legend that the emperor did not die in 1250, but simply disappeared from the whole world, planning to reform the church and establish peace on earth. </p><h2>  Riddles that have no answers yet </h2><p>  Not all scientists agree with the start date of the construction of Castell del Monte.  Serious financial difficulties were known in 1239, due to which the construction of other fortresses in the empire was suspended.  This is one of the first puzzles that experts still work on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second, concerning the true purpose of the monumental structure, torments all historian researchers.  There is an official version, according to which the building was originally built as a residence for the emperor fond of falconry.  However, the spiral staircases inside the lock are twisted to the left, counterclockwise, in a completely different direction from what was accepted.  In the huge room there is not even a hint of rooms for supplies, servants, stables, and the interior is too luxurious for a hunting lodge. </p><h2>  Castle or something else? </h2><p>  Located on a high hill, the octagon, at the corners of which there are towers, is not like the other castles.  It has no obligatory drawbridge, rampart and moat, and the main entrance is made in the form of a portal of a Gothic temple facing east. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south of italy" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1310020.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The architectural creation, which is a two-story structure with a flat roof, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1999. </p><h2>  Symbolism of the Eight </h2><p>  The octagonal construction plan, located in the city of Bari, whose sights are known throughout the world, made the building famous.  Despite the fact that the building looks intimidating, it was never a defensive structure.  Eight trapezoidal rooms on the first floor, not intended for receiving guests, and the same number of rooms on the second, corner towers with eight faces are full of surprises.  The symbolic number is repeated in architectural details a huge number of times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari sights" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1310022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The marble courtyard, symbolizing the Holy Grail, was once located in the courtyard.  Needless to say, he had an octagonal shape.  And under it were water tanks, combined into a special hydraulic system - the oldest sewer of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  The interior of Castell del Monte is surprising: all its details continue the theme of the figure eight - a symbolic figure of infinity, considered a transition from earth to sky. </p><h2>  Calendar and sundial </h2><p>  The main feature of a historical monument is its ability to show time.  The first floor is a kind of calendar that counts time.  Direct sunlight penetrates into each room on the second floor twice a day throughout the year (for rooms on the ground floor this is true only in the summer), turning the building into a giant sundial. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castel del monte stone crown of apulia" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1310028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At noon of the autumnal equinox, the massive walls of the castle cast a shadow that is equal to the length of the patio.  Gradually, it lengthens until it ‚Äúfits‚Äù the entire structure. </p><h2>  A place for occult rituals? </h2><p>  The kingdom of geometry, numerology, all kinds of secret signs, most likely, served as a meeting place for the societies conducting occult rites, or an astronomical observatory in which they engaged in alchemy.  The retinue of Frederick II included the famous astrologer and magician Michele Skoto, whose name Dante mentioned in his work, describing the hell of sorcerers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle castell del monte" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1310023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The construction of the Castell del Monte did not go without the influence of the Templars.  The stone crown of Puglia, as the mysterious masterpiece of world architecture is also called, was the material embodiment of esoteric, astronomical and mathematical knowledge. </p><h2>  Secret Citadel </h2><p>  The national monument is loved by tourists who admire the original stone work, which has no analogues.  Travelers who come to the south of Italy will certainly visit the legendary castle, the image of which is minted by the government on small coins.  The majestic building is in no hurry to reveal all the secrets, but it is even more interesting to look into the citadel of secret knowledge. </p>
