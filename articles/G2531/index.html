Children willingly repeat the dance's movements after him, guess his riddles and perform various tasks.  And if a buffoon is in the retinue of Santa Claus at the New Year's carnival, then, of course, he is given one of the most important things - driving round dances around the Christmas tree.  That is why the costume of this character must be impeccable, so that the enthusiastic looks of young guests shone for a long time from memories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself buffoon costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/718856.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <p>  This article will describe the process of creating an outfit for this hero, starting with the development of patterns and ending with sewing ribbons and shiny sequins.  So, how do you sew a buffoon costume with your own hands and what is needed for this? </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  When it comes to sewing, first of all, of course, it is necessary to prepare not only <span>sewing accessories,</span> but also equipment: a machine and, if possible, an overlock.  Many novice craftswomen sometimes forget about the necessary correspondence of the needle and the canvas, which leads to unpleasant consequences, such as tightened seams, holes or holes in the material.  Why is it a sewing machine?  Because without it, it is possible to sew a buffoon costume with your own hands, but it will take much more time.  In addition, it is unlikely to be able to make all the seams perfectly smooth by hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buffoon costume for children" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/719304.jpg" width="270"></div>

There are two options for cutting: by clothing and by standards.  And the one and the other method is not very difficult to implement, but will have to try. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buffoon costume pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/718859.jpg" width="348"></div>

    <h2>  Clothing pattern </h2><p>  To reshape a <span>pattern template</span> from ready-made clothes, you will need a T-shirt and <span>sweatpants.</span>  Moreover, regardless of whether the buffoon is a child‚Äôs or an adult‚Äôs costume.  The clothes are laid out on a flat surface, covered with a film on top and with the help of a pen or marker they are drawn around the contour and all the seams on things are drawn.  After all the manipulations, it remains only to cut out the details from the film, reshoot them on the material, add allowances for the seams and cut out. </p><h2>  Shirt pattern by standards </h2><p>  The second option is a bit more complicated and will require some calculations to get a beautiful buffoon costume.  The pattern is built on the basis of measurements taken: chest, waist, hips, shoulder width, sleeve length, leg and shirt.  So, two rectangles are drawn on the film.  One with a shirt length and the width of the larger of the measured girths, divided in half, and the second as a sleeve, and a width equal to the double depth of the armhole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself buffoon costume patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/718854.jpg" width="375"></div>

After the shoulder seams to the edges, bevel 1.5 cm and, not reaching the perpendicular lines of about 5 cm, draw down the armhole for the sleeve.  Then they start working on a rectangle to build a sleeve, where the height is the length and the width is the measure taken along the cut of the armhole.  To the wrist, the sleeve can not be narrowed, but the okat is slightly rounded, cutting off the corners in the armpits. </p><h2>  <span>Pattern bloomers</span> by the standards </h2><p>  Wide bloomers - a must-have item, which should include a buffoon costume.  The pattern of this garment is constructed as follows: </p><ul><li>  first you need to draw two rectangles, where the length is equal to the length of the trousers, and the width is a quarter of the hips +8 cm and plus 10 cm; </li><li>  on the drawings, on one side they lower down to measure the depth of the seat (it is removed while sitting on a stool from the waist line to the stool on the thigh), on a smaller rectangle this value is reduced by 4 cm; </li><li>  from the obtained points to the side of the rectangle in the larger drawing add 4 cm, on the smaller -1 cm and draw new edges of the part, reducing additions to the knee line; </li><li>  then proceed to the middle seam and the bow of the trousers, where on the top of the rectangle inwards the details recede 4 cm and fall to the seat line, rounding the middle seam, not reaching the end point of about 4 cm. </li></ul><p>  After all the manipulations, you get the most primitive pants pattern, according to which you can sew trousers.  They fit perfectly into a buffoon costume.  Children's and adult outfits are not much different from each other, and therefore this construction option is suitable for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buffoon costume adult" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/718855.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  How to make an interesting buffoon costume with your own hands?  Patterns are half the battle, the main thing is to choose the right material that sets the mood for everything along.  Glitter fabrics such as satin, supplex or velor are great for this purpose.  The last two should not cause problems at all, since the slices can be left without treatment, and the ability of the fabric to stretch will scrape away possible flaws in the cut. </p><p>  What color should a buffoon suit be?  An adult and a child will easily answer this question, because everyone knows that the outfit of this hero must have a lot of bright colors.  Yellow, red, green, orange, blue and pink - all these colors can be combined in this outfit among themselves.  It can be patches on a suit, frills, inserted into the seams, or just cut details sewn from paintings of different colors. </p><h2>  Finishing and costume details </h2><p>  An integral part of any outfit is accessories.  For a buffoon, this is a cap with bells, as well as beautiful lace <span>cuffs on the sleeves</span> and an angular collar with bell pendants.  A buffoon costume for a girl can be made with narrow knit pants and a multi-colored tutu skirt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buffoon costume for girls" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/718857.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Harem pants and wide sleeves of a suit are collected below on an elastic band.  To give along charm and zest, the gum is sewn so that after it there is still fabric that will be collected by a beautiful frill.  Along the edge of this frill, a ribbon with sequins will fit perfectly, which will add shine along.  It can also be sewn on the chest of a shirt, laying out any <span>geometric pattern</span> or simple vertical stripes. </p><h2>  How to sew a hat? </h2><p>  To sew a cap of buffoon, you need to take a measure of head circumference, then draw a rectangle on the film with a width equal to half the measure and a height of about 40 cm for a child and 50 for an adult.  Next, stepping back from about 15 cm from the bottom, they draw future horns of the cap diverging from the middle.  The entire hat will need to be duplicated in thick tulle, and the horns also in synthetic winterizer so that they stick out well.  You will also need to make a lining in such a hat so that tulle does not prick its forehead.  Difficulties should not arise here, you just need to carve out two more of the same details from any fabric, only cut their horns at a height of about 16 cm from the bottom of the cap. </p>
