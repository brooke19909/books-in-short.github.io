    <p>  The PSP game console is very popular among fans of computer games as well as moviegoers who prefer this mobile device to watch TV shows.  But sometimes, in order for the device to play new games and fix minor flaws, it becomes necessary to change the firmware. </p><p>  Before installing the firmware on the PSP, it is worth clarifying what it is.  Firmware is called device software.  At PSP, it is a symbiosis of user programs, BIOS, and the operating system.  They are of three types: official (recorded by the manufacturer), modified (they are also called ‚Äúcustom‚Äù) and virtual.  On official firmware, only licensed programs and disks work, on custom firmware - modified firmware, you can run images of games downloaded from torrents on PSP. </p><p>  Since it is sometimes necessary to install firmware on a PSP due to the impossibility of acquiring new licensed discs with games, you have to resort to the help of custom programs created by amateur enthusiasts.  Virtual firmware is a type of modified firmware.  They are placed on devices that are not suitable for custom.  The inconvenience in their use is that they often have to be reinstalled on the PSP, since they fly off after it is turned off. </p><p>  Before changing the firmware, you need to find out the version that is on your console.  Information can be found in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù item, from which you need to go to ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù and ‚ÄúSystem Information‚Äù.  The names of the modified firmware differ from the official ones by the presence of their endings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are four ways to install the firmware on the PSP: it can be downloaded via Wi-Fi using the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù menu and network update;  using a computer, from the Internet, using PlayStation 3 for this purpose. It is possible to run it from UMD, because the game will not work on firmware that is lower than on its disk. </p><p>  To replace the firmware with a PSP, you need a stitched battery, charged at least 75%, and a specially formatted memory card.  The so-called pandora kit.  For all this, before installing the firmware on the PSP, you will need a second device with custom firmware already installed on it.  You will need the Pandora installer downloaded from the torrent to the version of the firmware that you need.  After completing the installation, you must exit the USB mode and remove the card. </p><p>  Let's say the console has official firmware 5.03 on the <span>PSP 3008.</span> It can be changed in two stages to a modified version.  It is recommended to those who are interested in how to install firmware on the PSP 3008, first of all, choose the necessary version.  It is best to stay on the Prometeus 5.03 firmware, which has proven itself on the good side.  You must enter HEN mode. </p><p>  Delete the folder called ‚Äúpicture‚Äù from the device‚Äôs <span>memory</span> card and unzip the archive with LMAO to its root. Then, go to the ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù menu.  From it to the ‚ÄúMemory Card‚Äù and LMAO. When the PSP 3008 freezes, the attempt should be repeated.  If all the actions were carried out correctly, the green screen will turn on and the device will reboot in HEN mode.  This will launch hombrew, allowing the installation of Prometeus 5.03 firmware.  The folder with the firmware must be uploaded to the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù folder on the PSP.  Re-flash the device from the "Game" menu, then go to the memory card.  To start the installation process, you need to click "X".  If the first time you manage to switch the console to HEN mode, the whole process will take only a few minutes. </p><p>  In cases where the console has an unsolicited motherboard and there is no possibility of installing modified ones, it is important to know <span>how to install</span> official firmware on the PSP.  For this, an earlier version is suitable - 5.03, which is already easy to download custom options.  So you can get around the restrictions that dictate the latest official versions, and expand the capabilities of the game console. </p>
