One of them, the most popular, says that an artifact is any item that has been exposed to human impact and found during excavations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="artifact is" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/223030.jpg" width="600"></div>  All kinds of utensils and ancient jewelry, tools and the remains of ancient dwellings - all these are artifacts on which our history was built.  Of course, the theory of the <span>origin of man has</span> grown not only in historical finds.  Thanks to Darwin and his theory, all kinds of ... environmental scientists (biologists, archaeologists and others like them) built a relatively logical history of how monkeys became <span>intelligent people.</span>  However, in recent times a great number of artifacts have been committed (or declassified) that either do not fit into the teachings of Darwinism, or completely refute it.  From this point of view, the second meaning of the term ‚Äúartifact‚Äù becomes clearer: it is a phenomenon, object or process, the appearance of which is currently impossible for natural reasons.  Unclear?  Well, let's get some examples. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="artifacts found" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/223028.jpg" width="300"></div>

Artifacts Refuting Darwin's Theory </p><p>  So, Darwinism has long been the only (apart from religious) official theory.  According to her, about 400-250 thousand years ago, people learned how to make digging sticks and other most primitive tools.  It seemed that all found artifacts confirmed this theory.  But ... In South Africa, miners accidentally discovered several areas during operation.  Some of them are all-metal, corrugated, round, interspersed with white matter unknown to science.  Other shapes resemble discs, the middle of which is filled with sponge material.  Scientists using the latest techniques have determined the age of the balls: about 3 billion (!!!) years.  Balls and spheres - artifact.  This is undeniable.  But they point out that the theory of Darwinism on which our science is built is not true.  In other words, from the point of view of traditional science, these objects cannot exist, because a person in those days had not yet appeared.  But spheres do exist.  Moreover, they still continue to be mined from the rocks near the city of Klerksdorp.  Hundreds of stone balls are found all over the world (from 200 BC to 1500 AD).  In Peru, <span>Ica stones</span> painted with images of dinosaurs were found.  And in India there is a metal pole (he is 1600 years old) made of iron of such purity that modern science cannot achieve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddles history artifacts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/223032.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <p>  Thousands of such artifacts, which cannot be, from the point of view of modern science.  All of them belong to those times when, according to Darwinists, a person either did not exist at all, or he was not much different from monkeys.  Giant skulls, a skeleton of a horse about 3 meters tall, found in Kabarda, the remains of people with outstretched heads - all this makes us wonder: have we simplified the story of our birth too much by believing Darwin? </p><p>  Shocking artifact: it's not fiction </p><p>  There are not only inexplicable, but literally shocking artifacts.  So, during excavations in Baghdad, a battery was found that was born 2,000 years earlier than Volt came up with it.  In California, geologists have discovered a <span>spark plug,</span> which is 500 thousand years old.  Naturally, both the battery and the candle are made of other, unusual materials.  But the principle is the same!  And there are <span>gold chains</span> and watches found deep in the coal seams, the remains of unknown, but complex devices dating back millions of years and hundreds of other unexpected objects.  Each such find is an artifact that makes you think that humanity did not develop at all as Darwin imagined. </p>
