Firstly, it is the security of the transaction.  One of the reliable places to buy foreign currency is Sberbank.  But the course at this financial institution is not particularly attractive.  To exchange dollars for rubles in Sberbank both profitably and safely, you need to know about some of the nuances of a currency transaction.  Our article will answer some typical questions that arise during conversion. </p><h2>  How to exchange dollars for rubles in Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vistanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exchange rubles to dollars at Sberbank rate" class="if uuid-2969151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2969151.jpg"></div><p>  The reasons for buying a currency can be different.  Most often, the procedure has to be carried out without market analysis and special preparation.  As a rule, these are small amounts that do not require a declaration.  Sberbank offers several exchange options.  All of them are different and shareware.  The choice of the method will not affect the intra-bank rate in any way, so it is advisable to review and calculate it in advance.  But do not forget that cross-rates are set daily, so watch it better on the day of exchange (the rate does not change during the day). </p><p>  In Sberbank, currency transactions can only be carried out by an identified or authorized (if the action is performed online) person.  If for any reason there is no desire to formally ‚Äúshine‚Äù with dollars, then you will have to refuse the legal conversion procedure.  In addition to a passport, no other documents are required for the sale of foreign currency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Online Currency Exchange Calculator </h2><p>  Modern technologies allow you to perform a number of actions without leaving your home.  As you know, the Central Bank daily sets the exchange rate.  All Russian banks set their internal rate, which differs slightly and depends on regional specifics.  Before weekends or holidays, banks lay all possible risks in the course.  It is much more profitable to change the currency on a weekday. </p><p>  Before you exchange rubles for dollars at the exchange rate (or vice versa) at Sberbank, you need to ask the price.  Make it convenient through an online calculator.  You can find it on the official website of the bank or simply drive it into the search bar ‚ÄúSberbank Online Calculator‚Äù.  The program works very simply.  To find out how many rubles you can get for a certain amount of dollars, you must perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  In the "Conversion" section, the amount of the exchange currency and the exchange unit should be entered in the appropriate columns. </li><li>  At the bottom of the page, click "Show." </li><li>  The system will instantly produce a result. </li></ul><p>  Quotes are set once a day.  If, after counting on a calculator, everything suits you, you can immediately go to Sberbank Online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="android4all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does it cost to change the dollar into rubles Sberbank" class="if uuid-2969168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2969168.jpg"></div><h2>  Exchange through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  If there is no time or desire to go somewhere, then you can exchange currency using the Internet.  Any financial transaction is quick and easy to do on the official website or through the organization‚Äôs application.  Before you learn how to exchange dollars for rubles in Sberbank, you need to open 2 accounts in US and Russian currencies.  This can be done both online and in offices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sale and purchase of currency is carried out at the rate at the time of application.  Therefore, it must be served immediately before the operation.  It is performed as follows: </p><ul><li>  After authorization, they go to Sberbank online and find the ‚ÄúCurrency Exchange‚Äù button. </li><li>  Open the tab with a dollar account from which the conversion will be carried out. </li><li>  Indicate the ruble account to which funds will be received. </li><li>  Enter the required amount and click "Buy." </li><li>  After 1-2 minutes, a transaction confirmation code will be sent to the phone number (it must be registered and tied to a bank account).  It is entered in the appropriate column.  After a few minutes, funds are credited to the specified account. </li></ul><h2>  Automated Payment Systems </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailysabah.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change 100 dollars to rubles at Sberbank" class="if uuid-2969159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2969159.jpg"></div><p>  ATMs almost completely replace the operator in financial institutions.  Through them perform a variety of operations, including conversion.  Currency exchange at the Sberbank ATM can be made at any convenient time of the day without presenting a passport.  Another advantage of this method is that you can not doubt the authenticity of the banknotes issued by the terminal. </p><p>  An exchange can be made only with a VISA or Mastercard payment system card.  For cardholders of MIR or Maestro payment systems, you need to find another way to convert.  The disadvantages include the fact that often the terminal does not have the required amount.  It should also be borne in mind that the limit on cash transactions is 15 thousand rubles per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can exchange dollars for rubles through any Sberbank ATM, but to purchase any foreign currency you need to find a special ATM with the inscription on the ‚ÄúCurrency exchange‚Äù case.  The list of places where such terminals are installed is on the official website of the bank. </p><h2>  Exchange at bank branches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettyimages.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to exchange dollars for rubles in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2969149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2969149.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way is to exchange money at the offices of a financial institution.  Unfortunately, conversion is far from being possible in all branches.  Several years ago, due to the inexpediency of exchanging money in places where such a service is in low demand, this function was banned.  Such banking units include branches on the pages, in villages. </p><p>  To exchange rubles for dollars at the Sberbank exchange rate, you must have a passport with you.  While waiting in line, you can familiarize yourself with the course - it is presented on the scoreboard in almost every department.  The convenience of this method is that the employee can perform several operations at once, and some of them only he can perform.  In the bank you can get the following services: </p><ul><li>  Exchange one currency for another (it can be money of any state) without opening an account. </li><li>  The employee, at the request of the client, can issue part of the funds in cash, and put the rest into the indicated account. </li><li>  Exchange banknotes for a larger or smaller denomination. </li></ul><p>  The department can exchange large amounts.  Often, more profitable courses are offered for such operations. </p><h2>  Fee and restrictions </h2><p>  There are a number of rules related to currency exchange transactions.  Before exchanging dollars for rubles at Sberbank, you need to familiarize yourself with them: </p><ul><li>  When exchanging up to 15 thousand rubles, a passport is sufficient for identification.  Above - you must additionally provide the TIN, citizenship, contacts (phone, email). </li><li>  When exchanging banknotes of one country for currency, another commission is not taken.  The bank is already laying it in the difference between the selling rate and the buying rate. </li><li>  When exchanging banknotes of another state for its own currency, a commission fee of 5% is charged. </li><li>  For the exchange or purchase of a damaged bill, Sberbank will take a 10% commission. </li><li>  The total amount of exchange money should not exceed 1 million rubles per day, and the number of transfers should not exceed two million. </li><li>  When exchanging more than 150 thousand rubles, a commission of 3-5% of the convertible amount is charged. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="russia-travel-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on currency exchange in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2971156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2971156.jpg"></div><h2>  What currency can be exchanged at Sberbank </h2><p>  The most popular and therefore demanded foreign banknotes are the dollar and the euro.  They are the cash currency of Sberbank.  In addition to the dollar and the euro, you can always buy or sell the pound sterling, Japanese yen or Swiss francs.  This can be done in certain divisions of the bank.  There are about 560 of them (a detailed full list is presented on the site). </p><p>  If you need to exchange the Australian, Canadian or Singaporean dollars, Norwegian, Czech or Swedish kronas, as well as the national currencies of Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Poland, you should specify in which department you can perform this operation.  On the official page of a financial institution, a list of branches is presented where there is a cash currency of these types. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the exchange rate of all currencies changes almost every day, so it is difficult to give reliable numbers.  According to the latest data, it was possible to sell 1 dollar in Sberbank for 66.37 rubles, and 1 euro for 75.19 rubles.  When buying 1 dollar, it was necessary to give 69.47 rubles, and 1 euro - 78, 66 rubles. </p><h2>  Recommendations of specialists </h2><p>  To make the conversion safe and profitable, it is not enough to know how much it costs to exchange dollars for rubles in Sberbank.  Experts recommend listening to these tips: </p><ul><li>  Before you buy or sell currency, it is worth looking at the information on courses on the Internet.  Since the online exchanger does not need to spend money on the physical delivery of funds to the office and pay employees, the rate in the Internet banking can be more profitable. </li><li>  Based on long-term observations, experts advise buying currency at the beginning of the year and in October.  During these periods, the ruble is overvalued, and the currency is cheap. </li><li>  If there is no urgent need to buy currency during a period of sharp jumps, it is better to refrain from such an operation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettyimages.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to exchange rubles for dollars in Sberbank rate" class="if uuid-2971154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2971154.jpg"></div><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Often in the pursuit of profit, people come across scammers.  They can be in the office under the guise of customers and offer their services to exchange tired people in line.  Such offers should be ignored, otherwise you may lose your funds. </p><p>  Exchange currency online is only necessary on the official websites of the institution.  Typically, scammers' web pages differ from the real ones, for example, in an overly profitable course.  At the slightest doubt, it is better to call the bank on a multi-channel telephone and dispel or confirm the concerns. </p><p>  It is necessary to save all documents after conversion.  They can come in handy at the tax office when filling out a tax return. </p><h2>  Reviews on currency exchange in Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Office" class="if uuid-2969189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2969189.jpg"></div><p>  On the Internet, there are rarely clients who profitably convert money in one of the oldest financial institutions in Russia.  Basically, these are people whose work is directly related to finances, so they are well versed in the intricacies.  Some customers are unhappy that one thing is stated, but in fact they see another.  So, it annoys many that even in order to exchange $ 100 for rubles in Sberbank, you need a passport.  It is necessary to sign a bunch of papers.  If the bill is washed, it is considered damaged.  She can be accepted, but at a very low price.  In some departments, you may encounter the fact that employees do not want to accept small bills (5, 10, 20 euros or 1 dollar). </p><p>  Despite the fact that the bank introduced an electronic queue, the actual one did not decrease from this. </p><p>  The only plus of the exchange at Sberbank is the security of any operation.  Exchange takes place at the declared rate and without hidden fees. </p>
