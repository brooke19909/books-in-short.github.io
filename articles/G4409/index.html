Demand for them has always been kept at a high level.  This is explained by excellent quality and a long service life.  After all, even at present, many still have models of the old model, released in the period 2003-2010.  One such instance is the Nokia 1110i.  It appeared on sale in 2006. It is amazing that even after ten years it works fine.  An important feature of such phones is the battery.  Unlike devices of other brands, even with active use, it holds a charge of at least five days. </p><p>  Of course, if you compare the <span>Nokia 1110i</span> with modern gadgets, then it is significantly inferior in equipment, but not in quality.  The model is positioned as a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, but you can be 100% sure of it even after falling from a sufficient height.  But new smartphones after this are unlikely to turn on, not to mention cracks on the screen and other unpleasant moments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1110i" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1501101.jpg" width="411"></div>

In the device with the index 1110i, it is hidden behind the back cover.  It is fixed tightly enough.  Opening the lock is extremely simple by pressing a special button.  Battery standby time is approximately 15-18 days.  Even with a minimal mobile signal, it is impossible to discharge it in 72 hours.  The battery model is Nokia BL-5CA.  Its capacity is 900 mAh.  Due to the fact that it is lithium-ion, various problems, such as bloating or fire, are completely excluded.  In just 1.5 hours, the battery gains full charge.  The device is connected to a 220 V network. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Due to the fact that this phone is already ten years old, there are a lot of reviews about it.  It is worth noting that they are all positive.  Users did not find any flaws.  The only thing that can be attributed to the minuses is the lack of a calendar and erasing information on the buttons after several years of operation. </p><p>  But there were a lot of advantages.  First of all, Nokia 1110i is a reliable, time-tested phone.  Many users claim that even after falling into the water, the device works without interruptions.  The connection catches perfectly, the volume of the speaker and microphone is very high.  Even if the phone is in the bag, the ringtone is clearly audible.  Speech is legible.  The buttons are convenient, you can dial SMS with one hand.  The case is not slippery, fits perfectly in any pocket of a shirt, trousers.  You can quickly change the boring design using removable panels.  The image on the display is clear, easy to read.  The font can be set in three sizes: standard, small and large.  In standby mode, the clock and date are displayed on the screen. </p><p>  In a word, the Nokia 1110i is the best phone for making calls and writing SMS.  All customers confirm that the battery lasts at least 7 days.  Using the speakerphone is easy, just during a conversation just press the right function key (immediately below the screen).  Also a significant advantage is the presence of a "black list" and the option "speed dial". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1110i battery" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1501115.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  Nokia's 1110i is a low-end mobile phone.  In 2007, its cost was about $ 65.  Currently, the phone can only be purchased in the secondary market.  This device is functionally limited, it is used only for making calls and sending text messages.  Ideal for people who are constantly on the road, as the battery lasts for a long time.  The design and equipment, of course, are already outdated, but it can be used as an additional phone. </p>
