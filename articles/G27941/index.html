    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This modern complex immersed in greenery cannot be overlooked.  Cronwell Platamon Resort, by the way, is located in Pieria.  And to be more precise, in Platamonas, which is a cozy resort village located on the shores of the Aegean Sea.  The highlight of it is that from here you can see Olympus from anywhere. </p><p>  The hotel itself is in close proximity to the sea.  The complex has its own private sandy beach with convenient sunsets.  Moreover, there are separate ones, both for adults and for children.  And also on the territory of the hotel is a fruit garden.  You could even say otherwise.  If you take a walk here, it will become clear - this hotel itself is located in a huge orchard. </p><p>  The only negative is the airport is far away.  Macedonia International Airport, located in Thessaloniki, is 155 kilometers away.  But in Platamonas itself it is very quiet and picturesque - nothing will hinder a relaxing holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Cronwell Platamon Resort provides all the amenities and services that guests need for a carefree holiday.  It offers free private parking and Wi-Fi, a tour desk, a conference room with a meeting room and a small business center and a 24-hour reception. </p><p>  Guests can also use the shuttle service, delivery of drinks and food, as well as a left-luggage office.  If you need something else, you can contact the administrators for help.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  If you pay attention to the 5 * reviews left about your vacation at Cronwell Platamon Resort, you can understand that this hotel is what it is presented in all the best descriptions.  Guests who were here confirm this fact. </p><p>  However, there are also negative reviews.  The hotel is good, but not for those people who want to relax in silence.  A lot of tourists with children come here, so you don‚Äôt have to wait for peace.  Unless, of course, come here in winter.  When the prices are an order of magnitude lower, the hotel is half empty, as most vacations take place in summer.  Water in the sea is also much cleaner.  But it‚Äôs cooler, not everyone will bathe, since in January-February its temperature here is 13-15 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The hotel has wonderful staff.  Daily cleaning, and it can be ordered at a certain time by contacting the reception.  Constantly reporting fresh towels and changing clothes.  Beach is also there, but under the signature.  And here everyone speaks Russian - this fact is noted with pleasure by almost every tourist. </p><p>  In general, Cronwell Platamon is a good hotel for a good rest.  Tourists who want entertainment, high-quality and delicious food, as well as the sea, will definitely like it here.  Only if you want to relax here in the summer, it is better to use early booking.  The hotel is popular, so by the beginning of the season there are practically no free rooms. </p>
