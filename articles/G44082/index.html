    <p>  It all depends on what exactly we are talking about - which particular part of the <span>island of Koh Chang.</span>  Its beaches - gorgeous, beautiful, snow-white, with sand creaking like snow in a movie, are located mainly in the west of the resort.  Here, of course, many hotels have been built here, there is an excellent infrastructure, there are cafes, restaurants, entertainment and everything that your heart desires.  But the east of the island is almost deserted, the beaches here are rocky and even rocky, although there are secluded sandy bays.  But here it is amazingly beautiful nature and famous waterfalls. </p><p>  In the north of the island there are several villages where mainly locals live.  The port and piers work there, where tourists come by ferry.  The best beaches of Koh Chang are in the west of the island, and that is where most vacationers rush.  The most popular one is the beach <span>of white sand.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best beaches in ko chang" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/282825.jpg" width="450"></div>  It is closest to one of the piers, so it‚Äôs easiest and easiest to get to those who leave the pier.  Here, tourists are offered a full range of ordinary Thai pleasures - from massage to night markets, shops like Seven Ileven and even go-go shows.  A huge range of hotels, including cheap bungalows, and boutique villas on the beach.  The beach itself is huge, and even in high season there are not many people here.  In addition, almost all of them accumulate in its central part, and if you move away or drive off to the north or south, you will find yourself in a real desert.  At the same time, the White Sand is located near the main village of the island of Koh Chang.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beaches further south have their own specifics.  "Pearl" is good for sunbathing, but you can swim there only in special shoes, otherwise you will get hurt.  However, the landscapes, and especially the sunsets, in these places are so incredibly wonderful that living in local hotels is more expensive.  Maybe because in the evening this beach, where people come from other places during the day, becomes empty, and you are left alone with tropical nature.  The same can be said about the neighboring coast of Chai Chet.  It is sandy, and by sunset completely deserted.  However, shops, markets, bars and even a supermarket are here for tourists. </p>

Beaches suitable for toddlers are, first of all, the already mentioned White Sand and Klong Prao.  The last coast has a shallow entrance to the water, and swimming here is very safe.  In the north of the beach, a great place for lovers of solitude, in the south - a lot of entertainment.  Especially the guests of the <span>island</span> like the <span>fire</span> show.  And on the neighboring beach of Kai Bei - a paradise for relaxation.  Here are the best massage parlors in the resort.  Young people like Bai Lan and Lonely Beach: in these places there are a lot of parties, discos are organized in the water, and they even hold Full Moon Pati, like on Koh Phangan.

    <p>  And what are the most interesting beaches of <span>Koh Chang?</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists are called in the first place Bang Bao and Long Beach.  Both are like Goa resorts.  People live here for many months, mainly hippies and rastamans, as well as those who rent out their homes somewhere in prosperous Europe and work in isolation, renting a house.  There is Bang Bao and a traditional Thai village on stilts.  To get here, especially to Long Beach, is quite problematic and expensive, but here there is a special atmosphere, sincere company and everywhere you can hear the sounds of reggae and hip-hop. </p>
