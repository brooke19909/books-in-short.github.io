This is one of the most beautiful places not only in the UK, but throughout Europe.  In addition, the island is interesting for its architectural monuments. </p><h2>  Isle of Skye: photos and description </h2><p>  Skye is an island in the western part of Scotland.  Geographically, it belongs to the Inner Hebrides archipelago, and administratively - to the Highland area.  Isle of Skye is the second largest off the coast of Great Britain.  Its total area: 1656 sq.  km  The length and width of the Isle of Skye are 80 and 42 kilometers, respectively. </p><p>  The terrain here is hilly, and the highest point reaches a height of 993 meters.  The sky above the island is almost always covered with gray clouds.  The local climate is characterized by high humidity and frequent precipitation. </p><p>  About 10 thousand people live on Skye.  Many of them speak a special language - Scottish Gaelic.  Students and linguists from all over the world come to the island to study it. </p><p>  There are two ways to get to the Isle of Skye.  Only one bridge connects it to the mainland (if you can call it Britain), near the town of Kyle of Lokolsh.  Sky can also be reached by ferry, which runs between the villages of Mullay and Armadale.  The length of the crossing is 7 kilometers.  There is an airport near Broadford, but there is no regular passenger service with it. </p><p>  The island is mentioned several times in popular Harry Potter novels.  So, according to the book, the Hebrides black dragon lives here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Isle of Skye: attractions and interesting places </h2><p>  The pearl of Scotland, a reserve of natural, pristine natural beauty.

    <p>  Dunvegan Castle is very interesting from an architectural point of view, because several historical styles can be traced in it.  Around the fortress there is a wonderful park with flower beds, ponds, waterfalls and openwork bridges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Magic bridge </h2><p>  This popular tourist attraction is close to Dunvegan Castle.  A miniature arched bridge made of large boulders is thrown over a small stream near the A850 highway. </p><p>  One of the local legends is associated with this bridge.  So, one of the representatives of the Makloud dynasty, Jan Kiar, was allegedly married to a fairy.  They had a son, but a year later the fairy-wife was summoned back to her magical land.  Ian fell in love with his wife and did not want to let her go.  But the fairy still soared into the sky and flew away to her people, leaving Yana a flap of the finest silk.  ‚ÄúThree times he will save you in difficult times,‚Äù she managed to say goodbye.  All this happened just on the bridge, later called the Magic. </p><p>  By the way, the fairy presented flap was used twice in history.  Now it is stored in Dunvegan Castle. </p><h2>  Fairy Pools </h2><p>  A charming, heavenly place on the island of Skye - Fairy Pools.  This is a whole complex of waterfalls and cascades formed by a water stream flowing down from the mountains.  The attraction is located in the southern part of the island, near the Glenn Brittle forest (3 km. From the coast). </p>

    <p>  Waterfalls are surrounded on all sides by picturesque rocky ledges.  The water here is clear and clean.  It is best to come here after heavy rains when the Fairy Pools become especially stormy and full-flowing. </p><p>  An interesting point: a curious photograph of this marvelous natural corner of Skye ‚Äúwalks‚Äù on the Internet.  But in the picture, Fairy Pools are surrounded by bright purple trees.  Many tourists who come here, for a long time trying to find these unusual plants on the ground.  In fact, purple trees are nothing more than a Photoshop trick. </p><h2>  Cuirang Plateau </h2><p>  Cuirang Plateau is another picturesque place of Skye, located in the far north of the island.  This is a grand plateau with sharp rocky peaks, deep depressions and colorful meadows.  The whole area is generously rugged with hiking trails.  A walk here will be very impressive and informative. </p>

    <p>  The plateau began to form at the end of the ice age and is an actively collapsing mass of solidified lava.  Here you can see many outlandish geological formations.  For example, the Prison ledge, which resembles a massive medieval fortress, or the sharp 37-meter-high Igla rock.  From anywhere in Cuiranga, the traveler sees landscapes of incredible beauty. </p>
