    <h2>  Negative reviews about the hotel Atlant (Adler) </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects of living in this hotel, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the staff is somehow indifferent and cold not only to the guests, but also to their work in general; </li><li>  the rooms really lack safes; </li><li>  huge lines are always created at breakfast, and very little is laid out (it is not enough for everyone); </li><li>  if you book a room at a promotional price, then be prepared for the fact that on the spot they will demand money from you even for swimming in the pool; </li><li>  poor insulation, due to which everything that happens on the street, as well as in neighboring rooms, is audible; </li><li>  constant inconsistencies with the information indicated on the reservation service (they can be accommodated in a room of a different category, as well as request money for free parking); </li><li>  as for a resort hotel, breakfasts start very early (at 8 a.m.); </li><li>  the rooms located above the third floor do not have wireless Internet; </li><li>  A cosmetic kit in the bathroom is provided only on the day of arrival, after which the maids do not replenish it. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Speaking about the Atlant Hotel, first of all I would like to note its location.  From here it is a stone's throw from the sea, to the bus stop, and from a large number of infrastructure facilities.  Also, the design of a hotel with a claim for luxury cannot go unnoticed.  Nevertheless, the service spoils the whole impression.  It all starts with the unfriendly and cold attitude of the staff.  Even if there are any problems, then there is no desire to seek help.  It is also worth paying attention to such details as room service and lack of food for breakfast.  Attempts by staff to demand money for services that are indicated on the reservation service as free are also unpleasant. </p>
