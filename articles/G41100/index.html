    <p>  Already almost the entire world of high technology has captured the fashion for touch displays.  Now almost every player or cell phone has a touchscreen, and the general scope of this display technology is much more significant.  Now on the market there are different types of touch screens, the operation of which depends on what technology they use. </p><p>  <span>The touch screen</span> is a device oriented to input and output information through a <span>touch</span> sensitive display.  On the screens of modern devices, not only images are shown, but also there are opportunities to interact with him.  Initially, such a connection was provided through the usual buttons for all, then a different type of manipulator appeared, called a mouse, which greatly facilitated the process.  This device requires a horizontal surface, which is very inconvenient when using a mobile phone.  Here the addition to the regular screen in the form of a touchscreen came in handy.  The sensor element is not a screen at all, it is an additional device that is placed outside on top of the display, while it protects and is intended to enter coordinates by touching the input device or finger.  There are various types of touch screens.  It is worth considering them in more detail. </p><p>  Types of touch screens and their use in electronic devices </p><p>  Initially, the touchscreen technology was used for handheld computers, but at the moment it has received much wider application, from players to cameras.  Since such a control mechanism is very convenient, it is used for modern ATMs, tablet terminals, various electronic directories and other devices.  Touch screen technology is very convenient in cases where you need instant access to the managed device without any preparation and with maximum interactivity: the controls change depending on which function is activated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Types of touch screens: capacitive, resistive, projection-capacitive and others (less popular).  In addition to these types, there are also infrared and matrix displays, but their accuracy is so low that their scope is completely limited. </p><p>  Resistive Touch Screens </p><p>  The simplest devices are precisely these displays.  Such a panel includes a conductive substrate and a plastic membrane, which have a certain resistance.  When pressing the membrane, it closes with the substrate, which forces the conductive electronics to respond to the resistance that arose between the edges of these elements, calculating after that the coordinates of the point that was pressed.  Such screens are very simple in design, they are cheap, and also have excellent resistance to pollution.  The main advantage of this type of sensor is that it is sensitive to all kinds of touch.  The disadvantage is high sensitivity to mechanical damage, which requires the use of a special <span>protective film.</span>  Such panels work well at low temperatures. </p><p>  The capacitive sensor technology works in a completely different way.  Here, the principle is taken that a large-capacity object can conduct electric current.  An electrically conductive layer is applied to the glass, and an alternating voltage is applied to all four corners.  When you touch the screen with a grounded object of greater power, current leakage occurs.  The control electronics detect these leaks by determining the coordinates. </p><p>  This article briefly and clearly described the main types of touch screens that have gained the most popularity. </p>
