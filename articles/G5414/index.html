His father was a judicial attorney and protestant, and his mother a Catholic.  Edmund decided to connect his life with jurisprudence.  In 1750, he moved to London and entered the school of barristers (lawyers). </p><h2>  The beginning of literary activity </h2><p>  Over time, Burke lost interest in his profession.  In addition, he did not return to Dublin.  Ireland did not like the young man for his provincialism.  Remaining in London, he devoted himself to literature. </p><p>  The first work, In Defense of the Natural Society, appeared in 1756.  This work was a parody of the work of the recently deceased English <span>political philosopher</span> Henry Bolingbroke and was presented as his essay.  The first books that Burke Edmund wrote are practically unknown to posterity and do not represent anything interesting.  These experiments were important for the creative growth of the author himself. </p>

    <h2>  Confession </h2><p>  Burke's first serious work was "A Philosophical Study of the Origin of Our Ideas for High and Fine."  After the publication of this work in 1757, the author was attracted by the most eminent thinkers of that era: Lessing, Kant and Didro.  <span>Burke Edmund has</span> gained a recognized reputation among writers.  In addition, the study allowed him to begin his own political career. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another major success of the writer in those years was the magazine "Annual Register".  Burke Edmund served as editor in chief, and Robert Dodsley became the publisher.  In the years 1758-1765.  the Irishman wrote many articles in this edition that became an important part of his creative heritage.  Especially a lot in the "Annual Register" Burke printed materials on history.  However, he never admitted that he worked in the journal, and published articles anonymously. </p><h2>  Political career </h2><p>  In 1759, Burke entered the public service.  For a while, he almost abandoned his literary activity, since it brought almost no money.  Two years before, Bork Edmund married Jane Nugent.  The couple had two sons.  The issue of finance has become more acute than ever.  As a result, Burke became the personal secretary of the diplomat William Hamilton.  Working with him, the writer gained important political experience. </p><p>  In 1765, Burke quarreled with Hamilton and became unemployed.  <span>Dublin, Ireland,</span> years spent in London as a writer, work as a secretary - all this is a thing of the past.  Now it was necessary to start everything from scratch.  Difficulties did not frighten the journalist who was left without income.  At the end of the year, he ended up in the House of Commons, having been elected through Wendover County. </p>

    <h2>  Member of parliament </h2><p>  The main patron of Burke in parliament was the Marquis of Rockingham, in 1765-1766.  serving as prime minister.  When he resigned and became the head of the opposition of the new government, it was his prot√©g√©, who left Hamilton, who became the main mouthpiece of an influential politician in the highest power circles.  Parliament immediately drew attention to such a rare and talented speaker as Edmund Burke.  The writer's books soon remained in the shadow of his public appearances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A member of the House of Commons possessed captivating eloquence.  In parliament, his previous writing skills came in handy.  Burke himself prepared his many reports and speeches to the Lords.  He was able to generalize colossal masses of information and operate with disparate facts.  The Thinker was a member of parliament for nearly 28 years, and all these years he remained a popular and sought-after speaker who was listened with bated breath. </p>

    <h2>  Pamphleteer </h2><p>  Burke wrote not only philosophical books.  His pen belonged to pamphlets, which were written specifically for the Whig party.  So, in 1770, "Thoughts on the reason for the current discontent" were published.  In this document, the author gave his definition of the party as an instrument of politics and gave arguments in favor of protecting its government.  The pamphlet was critical.  Burke condemned the king's close associates, determining his position on a variety of issues. </p><p>  In 1774, Burke was elected to the <span>House of Commons</span> from Bristol - then the second most important city in England.  In parliament, a politician began to defend the interests of local merchants and industrialists.  The break with the Bristol people occurred after the writer began to advocate a policy of reconciliation with Irish Catholics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ideology of conservatism" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1271910.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  American question </h2><p>  In the 1770s, Burke wrote a lot about America.  He also devoted his rebellious colonists to his public speeches in parliament.  At that time, this question worried all Britons.  In 1774, the speech ‚ÄúOn Taxation in America‚Äù was delivered and published; in 1775, ‚ÄúReconciliation with the Colonies‚Äù. </p><p>  Burke looked at the problem in terms of conservatism and pragmatism.  He wanted by any means possible to achieve the preservation of the colonies within the British Empire.  Therefore, he was a supporter of a policy of compromise.  The parliamentarian believed that in order to find a common language with the Americans, it is necessary to carefully study its inner life, and only based on this knowledge to build their position.  Burke proposed lowering taxes on trade with America, since only such a policy would save at least some income, while otherwise Great Britain would simply lose its colonies.  There was a very small group of lords in parliament, speaking from the same position as Burke.  The history of relations between the mother country and the colonies showed that he was right. </p>

    <h2>  Burke and the French Revolution </h2><p>  In 1789, a <span>revolution</span> began <span>in France.</span>  At its first stage, the majority of the inhabitants of Great Britain supported the discontented Bourbons.  Events in Paris were closely watched by Edmund Burke.  ‚ÄúReflections on the Revolution in France‚Äù is his book, which appeared in 1790 and reflected the views of the thinker on the situation in this state.  In a 400-page pamphlet, the author described in detail the main principles and patterns of events in a neighboring country.  Burke wrote his book primarily for compatriots.  With its help, he hoped to warn the British against solidarity with the revolutionary masses in France.  In "Reflections" most clearly in the work of Burke reflected his ideology of conservatism. </p><p>  The writer believed that the revolution is dangerous because of its excessive attachment to theory.  Dissatisfied in France spoke of abstract rights, preferring them to traditional established state institutions.  Burke was not only a conservative.  He believed in the classical ideas of Aristotle and Christian theologians, believing that the ideal society should be built on them.  In Reflections, the politician criticized the theory of the Enlightenment that man can penetrate into any secrets of being with the help of his mind.  The ideologists of the French Revolution were for him inexperienced statesmen, who knew how only to speculate on the interests of society. </p>

    <h2>  Meaning of ‚ÄúReflections‚Äù </h2><p>  ‚ÄúReflections on the Revolution in France‚Äù became Burke‚Äôs most important work as a political thinker.  Immediately after the publication of the book, the book became the subject of wide public discussion.  She was praised, criticized, but no one could remain indifferent to what was written.  Burke's previous philosophical books were also popular, but it was the pamphlet about the revolution that got into the most painful European nerve.  All residents of the Old World understood that a new era was coming when civil society, with the help of revolution, could change undesirable power.  This phenomenon was diametrically opposed, which was reflected in the work of the writer. </p><p>  The book carried a hunch of disaster.  The revolution really led to a long crisis and numerous Napoleonic wars in Europe.  The pamphlet has also become an example of perfect command of the English literary language.  Writers such as Matthew Arnold, Leslie Stephen, and William Hazlit unanimously considered Burke to be an unsurpassed master of prose, and Reflections the most significant manifestation of his talent. </p>

    <h2>  Last years </h2><p>  After the publication of Reflections, Burke‚Äôs life went downhill.  Due to ideological differences with his colleagues, he was isolated in the Whig party.  In 1794, the politician resigned, and his son Richard died a few months later.  Burke was disturbed by events in Ireland, where a radical national movement was growing. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Great Britain began a war with revolutionary France.  After the campaign dragged on, peaceful sentiment reigned in London.  The government wanted to compromise with the Directory.  Burke, although he was not a politician and did not have authority, continued to publicly speak and write.  He was a supporter of war to a victorious end and opposed any peace with the revolutionaries.  In 1795, the publicist began work on the series Letters on Peace with the Regents.  Two of them were written.  The third Burke did not have time to finish.  He died on July 9, 1797. </p>
