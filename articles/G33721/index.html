    <p>  Here are some ways: </p><ol><li>  By bus.  Suitable routes are number 29 (departing from the city center) and any other routes going in the direction of Alushta, Gurzuf, Simferopol (the departure point is the bus station).  Cost: fifteen to twenty rubles. </li><li>  By trolleybus.  In this case, all route numbers will work, but most often trolleybus number 2 runs. The ticket price is about ten rubles, and the duration of the trip is no more than fifteen minutes. </li><li>  Minibus taxi number 74 (runs only in summer). </li></ol><p>  Choosing one plan or another, how to get to the Massandra Palace from Yalta, it should be remembered that public transport will not take you to the castle itself, but to the Upper Massandra Park stop, from which you will have to go up for about half an hour along an <span>asphalt road.</span>  Therefore, it may be convenient for you to use the services of private taxi drivers who drive their passengers as close to the sights as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can get to the Massandra Palace (Yalta) from Alushta.  To do this, use the shuttle bus Alushta - Simferopol or a trolleybus, following in the same direction.  The journey will take about forty minutes by bus and a little more than an hour by trolley.  The fare is fifty and twenty rubles, respectively. </p><p>  There are other ways.  For example, you can go to the Massandra Palace through the forest.  The path between the trees is well trodden and comfortable.  You will have to go no more than a kilometer, and this walk will surely bring you pleasure: forest coolness, pleasant shade, picturesque landscapes ... </p><p>  In order to take a walk, you need to take a bus with route number 3, 44 or 100 (which go from the center of Yalta or the bus station) and get to the stop ‚Äúst.  Stakhanovskaya. ‚Äù  This method of travel is not as expensive as the previous ones (about fifteen rubles), not as long (only twenty minutes in transport) and more comfortable. </p><p>  What is the history of the Massandra Palace (Yalta) and how is it remarkable? </p><h2>  Royal history of the building </h2><p>  The erection of the Massandra Palace in Yalta took place in several stages. </p><p>  The first stage of construction ended in 1882, when, on the orders of the landowner Prince Vorontsov, a pretty beautiful house was built, made in the strict style of a knight's castle.  The project was developed by the French architect Etienne Bouchard. </p><p>  A few years after the death of the owner, the house was purchased for the current emperor Alexander Alexandrovich and rebuilt according to the drawings of the German architect Maximilian Egorovich Mesmacher.  The second phase of construction began in 1892 and lasted about ten years. </p><p>  According to the new project, the third floor was added, and the building itself was richly decorated and decorated, turning into a magnificent tower from a fairy tale. </p>

    <p>  Since then, the palace became the residence of the Romanov emperors.  True, Nicholas II rarely stayed in it and almost never slept. </p><h2>  Soviet history of construction </h2><p>  After the revolution, the building was used as a hospital for tuberculosis patients for twelve years.  Unfortunately, during this period the palace underwent many negative changes: some decors and sculptures were destroyed. </p><p>  After World War II, the building served the Soviet citizens for several years as an institute of winemaking.  But soon it attracted the attention of the Leader of the peoples and was slightly refitted in accordance with the wishes of Joseph Vissarionovich.  For several decades, the Massandra Palace was the state suburban cottage of the first secretaries of the CPSU Central Committee. </p><h2>  The modern history of the castle </h2><p>  In 1992, the imperial residence was awarded the title of State Ukrainian Museum. </p><p>  And since 2014, the palace has been a Russian museum under the authority of the President of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Palace Description </h2><p>  Although the building changed owners several times and underwent some changes, it nevertheless preserved the incredible atmosphere of magnificence and solemnity of the era of Russian emperors. </p><p>  One of the main exhibits of the museum are the chambers of the Romanovs, which include: </p><ul><li>  king‚Äôs office; </li></ul>
