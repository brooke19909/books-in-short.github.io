Many are interested in whether it is really possible and necessary to get a job in this company.  What are the pros and cons of an employer?  Is he conscientious?  All this must be judged precisely by the real opinions of the workers, and not by the promises of Rosgosstrakh.  Sometimes it happens that the boss talks about some working conditions, but in reality you have to deal with others.  So what about Rosgosstrakh? </p><h2>  Description of Activities </h2><p>  First, pay attention to the activities of the company.  Rosgosstrakh is a large Russian company that offers insurance services to the public.  And in different areas.  Here you can insure your own life, get a medical insurance policy, and also issue a hull or motor third party liability insurance for a vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1508281.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Rosgosstrakh even has a <span>non-state pension fund with it,</span> which is quite popular.  But is it worth contacting this company at all?  What <span>"Rosgosstrakh" employee reviews</span> as an employer earns? </p><h2>  Promises </h2><p>  In general, they are diverse.  Before employment, applicants pay attention mainly to the promises of a potential employer.  What does Rosgosstrakh guarantee? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the main promises, as a rule, there are: </p><ul><li>  official employment; </li><li>  flexible schedule; </li><li>  comfortable working conditions; </li><li>  self-development and career growth; </li><li>  Friendly team; </li><li>  high earnings; </li><li>  full social package; </li><li>  free education. </li></ul><p>  But how promises are true?  Are there any complaints about this employer?  Or can we hope that all promises will be fulfilled in full? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work in Rosgosstrakh employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1508283.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Formality </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh is receiving positive feedback from employees because the company really only offers official employment.  Moreover, according to all established rules.  Unofficial work is not welcome here, it does not occur in principle.  After all, Rosgosstrakh is a large organization with a good reputation among customers.  And violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation is a threat not only to rating, but also to honesty. </p><p>  Upon employment, an official labor contract will be concluded with the employee.  But before him, as a rule, you have <span>to go through an interview,</span> as well as training.  This is a kind of trial period.  If, based on its results, a potential employee agrees to employment, a contract is concluded in the manner prescribed by the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Training </h2><p>  What else stands out work in "Rosgosstrakh"?  Employee reviews are different.  There are good ones, and not so good ones.  But most employees and job seekers emphasize that the organization provides training.  And for free, at the expense of Rosgosstrakh. </p><p>  Although, as many claim, this is no longer like training, but the organization receiving free labor.  The thing is that the training period is not paid.  And if Rosgosstrakh or the applicant refuses to find a job, a person will not receive any money for the time spent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh life reviews of employees" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1508284.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, all this is only speculation.  In any case, before employment, Rosgosstrakh trains its potential employees, acquaints them with the duties and staff. </p><h2>  Career </h2><p>  Some indicate that there is no <span>career growth</span> in the organization as such.  From the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù to get to the leadership team is almost impossible.  But, nevertheless, there are prospects for self-development.  And it pleases.  If you're lucky, then you can really succeed in this company. </p><p>  Jobs at Rosgosstrakh receive positive feedback from employees because the company offers special bonuses for achieving certain successes.  Usually these are bonuses and salary increases.  And if you can prove yourself, you can hope for a raise.  Despite this, usually a strong and fast career growth in the organization is not observed. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  The team is mainly happy too.  Rosgosstrakh <span>reviews employees (Moscow</span> or any other city - it is not so important) earns as an organization in which colleagues are really friendly.  There are some not the most friendly personalities, but such units. </p><p>  It is noted that for normal operation (taking into account some of the company's shortcomings), it is necessary to take root in the team.  It is enough just not to stand out too much among the rest and not to serve the authorities.  Just be an open, friendly and conscientious employee.  Then work at Rosgosstrakh will not be as difficult as it seems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rosgosstrakh bank employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1508282.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  But regarding the work schedule, opinions are not very good.  The thing is that Rosgosstrakh-Bank does not receive the best reviews from employees (like the insurance company) due to the constant flow of customers and the need to stay for overtime work.  Often, he is not rewarded. </p><p>  Although initially the work schedule is really flexible and convenient.  You can not stay overtime, but then the attitude of colleagues and management will change dramatically, and not for the better.  A lot of work is necessary during the rush.  The usual work schedule, on the contrary, is good.  There are no night shifts, you don‚Äôt have to work here for days. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh Life receives mixed reviews from employees for earnings.  It mainly practices <span>"white" salary,</span> which, of course, pleases.  There are also bonuses, bonuses and allowances that help to significantly increase income.  Only now the official income is small.  This leads to the fact that the social package, although it is offered, but the payments are still not high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh employee reviews Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1508280.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, you can earn money here.  Especially if you follow all the rules.  Rosgosstrakh earns employee reviews as an employer who really pays.  Though not so much, but stable and honest. </p><h2>  Guide </h2><p>  Quite a lot of negativity gets the leadership of the organization.  There are many claims to it - and an unfair attitude towards subordinates, and constant deception, and just rudeness.  Standard claims that are addressed to almost any employer.  That is why sometimes you can find "Rosgosstrakh" in the black lists of employers in certain cities. </p><p>  There is really nothing to fear.  It is clear what kind of feedback Rosgosstrakh receives.  In general, this is a good employer.  But for successful employment it is necessary to have willpower, as well as high stress resistance.  And prepare for some injustice on the part of the leadership.  The most common employer, but he has his own advantages, emphasized by employees. </p>
