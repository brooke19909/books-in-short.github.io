  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow metro ring line</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ring line of the metro in the capital is familiar to everyone who has visited Moscow at least once.  The metro is the easiest and most popular way to get to the right address in the capital.  At the same time, using the subway, it is almost impossible to avoid any of the stations of the Ring Line.  After all, it combines almost all railway stations and metro lines directly, and each of its stations can be used by passengers to switch to the other lines they need. </p><h2>  From the history of appearance </h2><p>  There are two versions of how the Ring Line came about.  According to the first of them, it was originally planned to arrange under the ground not a “ring”, but several diametrical lines.  But such an idea was abandoned after the launch of the second stage of the subway.  It turned out that with the implementation of the "diametric" project, passenger traffic loads will be excessively large.  Accordingly, you need something else, that is, the Koltsevaya metro line. </p><p>  Another version of the appearance of the “ring” claims that plans for its construction were present in the original project.  According to this theory, which explains how the Koltsevaya metro line appeared, already during the construction of Smolenskaya, which was open to passengers in 1935, branches were laid for interchange crossings. </p><h2>  When did this line appear? </h2><p>  Marked on the diagrams with a laconic brown color, the line of the “ring” became the fifth branch of the Moscow subway.  Its first sections were launched in 1950, and the project was fully completed only in 1988.  It was then that at "Novoslobodskaya" they opened the transition to the neighboring Mendeleevskaya station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first line metro ring line, that is, its section, opened in the 50th year of the past century, connected the stations: </p><ul><li>  "October", then it was called "Kaluga; </li><li>  “Dobryninskaya”, in the middle of the last century it was called “Serpukhovskaya”; </li><li>  Paveletskaya </li><li>  "Taganskaya". </li></ul><p>  That is, the line covered the southern part of the Garden Ring, but only underground.  The second phase of construction was completed in 1952.  After its discovery, the “ring” was joined by: </p><ul><li>  Komsomolskaya </li><li>  "Peace Avenue"; </li><li>  "Novoslobodskaya"; </li><li>  "Belarusian". </li></ul><p>  The closed “ring” of the third phase of construction was completed in 1954.  She passed through the Kievskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya.  At the same time, technical compartments and a separate depot were equipped on Krasnaya Presnya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old scheme in the subway museum" class="if uuid-3118209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/3118209.jpg"></div><p>  At the time of the announcement of the completion of construction, it was not actually completed.  The Novoslobodskaya station did not have transfer crossings in those years, they were present only on the plans.  That is, although the year of completion of the fifth brown line is considered the 54th, in fact, the work was completed decades later. </p><h2>  What stations are included in this line? </h2><p>  The Koltsevaya Line metro stations are made in a single architectural style.  They represent, on the one hand, an integral ensemble, and on the other, each has its own theme.  Of course, the style in which the lobbies, platforms, passages were decorated is the "Stalinist Empire" prevailing at that time. </p><p>  The "ring" includes: </p><ul><li>  Kievskaya </li><li>  "Park of Culture"; </li><li>  "October"; </li><li>  "Dobryninskaya"; </li><li>  Paveletskaya </li><li>  "Taganskaya"; </li><li>  Kursk </li><li>  Komsomolskaya </li><li>  "Peace Avenue"; </li><li>  "Novoslobodskaya"; </li><li>  "Belarusian"; </li><li>  "Krasnopresnenskaya". </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Platform Station Park Kultury" class="if uuid-3118205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/3118205.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, in the modern metro you can no longer see the former splendor, it remains only in old photographs.  Now, most of the old stations have only fragmentary remnants of what once decorated them. </p>
