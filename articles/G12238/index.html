    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Several magnificent resort areas have sunny Greece.  Crete (Georgioupolis) is one of them.  The village is located in the western part of the island, on the coast of the sea, between two large settlements.  It is located thirty-eight kilometers from the regional center of Chania and twenty-one kilometers from the city of Rethymnon.  The beach, which is located directly in Georgioupolis, stretches along the coast for a distance of about two kilometers.  Here you can find everything you need to relax: <span>beach umbrellas</span> and sunbeds, showers, changing cabins and numerous bars and cafes.  On the beach there is the opportunity to do water sports and even ride a horse.  Seven hundred meters east of the local port, the beach area is divided into two halves by the Perastikos River.  This is a very beautiful place, overgrown with lush vegetation, but the sea here, unfortunately, is cold and unsuitable for swimming. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Several interesting and memorable places are in the village of Georgioupolis.  Crete boasts magnificent architectural monuments.  In a small resort village there are few of them, but their value does not become less significant from this.  First of all, you need to visit the old promenade, paved with smooth pebbles, make a promenade along the fragrant eucalyptus alley, the first trees in which were planted back in the century before last.  Excavations were carried out in the vicinity of Georgioupolis, during which researchers found traces of the Minoan settlements dating back to 1500-1400 BC.  e.  Now there are guided tours for lovers of archeology and history.  In a very picturesque place stands the Church of St. Nicholas.  It is built on sea cliffs, on the very edge of the breakwater, about a hundred meters from the island.  The path to this church lies through a narrow stone path, laid between it and the shore. </p>
