This ethnic group is famous not only for its unusual appearance, but also for its interesting history and traditions.  Today we suggest you take a fascinating journey into the deep regions of the <span>Great Lakes</span> and learn more about how the <span>native American</span> Iroquois lives. </p><h2>  <span>What is the</span> Iroquois <span>League</span> ? </h2><p>  Presumably in 1570, the Iroquois union arose under the name of the Hodenosauni League.  Initially, this formation included 5 tribes: Oneida, Mohawks, Kayuga, Onondaga and Seneca.  Later, in 1770, the Tuscarora tribe expelled from the southern United States (now East Carolina) joined the Hodenosauni League. </p><p>  Due to the close ethnocultural and social contacts of all these groups, <span>the Iroquois Indians</span> appeared <span>.</span>  It is impossible to compile a description of an ethnic group without characterizing the tribes that made up the Hodenosauni League.  Therefore, we dwell on each tribe in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Oneid tribe </h2><p>  Oneida is a tribe from the Iroquois League.  Initially, his descendants lived in upstate New York, and then settled on land in northeast Wisconsin (in the Green Bay area).  ‚ÄúA man of a motionless stone‚Äù - that‚Äôs exactly what every Iroquois Indian who came out of the Oneida tribe calls himself.  The history of this name is connected with local tradition.  According to legend, in the center of the main village of Oneida there was always a large red boulder.  This stone has become an important symbol of the tribe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mohawk tribe </h2><p>  Mohawks (or Mohawks) are a North American tribe of Indians living in eastern New York.  In the Hodenosauni League, this group was called the "guardians of the eastern door."  Today, the Mohawks are the largest tribe in the Iroquois union.  Now they live in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (Canada). </p><p>  The first contacts of the Mohawk tribe with the Europeans took place in 1634, when the Dutch entered the American lands.  Mohawks earlier than other Iroquois began to trade with Europeans. </p><p>  From the Mohawk tribe came such famous personalities as Joseph Brant (an officer in the British Army who distinguished himself during the US Revolutionary War), Kateri Teckwith (saint of the Roman Catholic Church) and Pauline Johnson (famous Canadian actress and writer). </p>

    <h2>  Kayuug tribe </h2><p>  Initially, the Kayuga tribe lived in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Kayuga between the peoples of Seneca and Onondaga.  Today their descendants live in Ontario (Canada) and in the city of Perrisburg (New York, USA). </p><p>  A native of the Kayuga tribe is Harry Farmer - the famous Canadian actor, who became famous thanks to the films "Police Academy" and "Dead Man". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Onondaga tribe </h2><p>  Representatives of the North American Onondaga tribe call themselves "people of the hills."  Initially, the people occupied territories located in the northwest of New York.  But after the US War of Independence, the tribe was expelled from these lands and occupied the areas of Ontario (Canada). </p><p>  It should be noted that in the Hodenosauni League, the Onondaga tribe performed the functions of ‚Äúelder brothers‚Äù, that is, they occupied leading positions in the Union Council. </p><h2>  Seneca tribe </h2><p>  Seneca people call themselves ‚Äúmountain people‚Äù.  Today, this people lives on the shores of Lake Seneca, located south of Ontario, and the Genesee River in New York State.  Seneca originally occupied vast territories from New York to Pennsylvania. </p><h2>  From the history of the tribe </h2><p>  Since the XI century, the Iroquois have occupied a vast territory between the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario.  For a long time they lived surrounded by Algonkin-speaking tribes (Ojibwa, Otava, Algonkin) and waged constant wars for their lands. </p><p>  The Iroquois League maintained the closest contacts with the Dutch.  European merchants bought beaver skins from local tribes and provided them with firearms in return.  After all the beavers in the area between the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario were exterminated, the Dutch pushed the Iroquois to seize new lands.  This led to the beginning of the so-called Beaver Wars.  In 1660, the Iroquois began to raid New France.  The mother country supported its colonies, as a result of which the North American tribes began to suffer defeats.  Meanwhile, British troops captured the Dutch colony New Netherlands, thereby cutting off the Iroquois from their main trading partners. </p><p>  In 1688, the war for the English inheritance between France and Britain began.  In this conflict, the Iroquois sided with the British.  In addition, the North American tribes supported them in the Franco-Indian war.  These two conflicts completely changed the balance of power on the continent.  The Iroquois became completely dependent on the supply of weapons from England. </p>

    <h2>  Iroquois in the War of Independence </h2><p>  In 1775, the US War of Independence began.  In this conflict, on the one hand, Great Britain and loyalists (i.e., loyal to the British government) took part, and on the other, 13 English colonies.  Most Indians during the war defended neutrality.  The Great Council of the Hodenosauni League also initially remained neutral.  However, in 1777, the Iroquois sided with Britain.  The main reason for this was that England was the main supplier of weapons for the North American tribes.  In addition, the colonial authorities forbade their natives to occupy territories west of the Appalachian mountains in order to avoid conflicts with the Indians. </p><p>  After the war ended, Great Britain transferred the land of the Iroquois to US control.  During this period, the Hodenosauni League ceased to exist.  Part of the Iroquois retreated north - to the lands bestowed by the British crown for support in the war.  The other half of the Hodenosauni League tribes remained in New York. </p><h2>  The economy and life of the American Iroquois </h2><p>  So, how did a simple Iroquois Indian live and live?  Features of the culture of North American tribes living in the Great Lakes region were formed under the influence of external factors.  The territories inhabited by the Iroquois actually lay on the crests of the mountains.  These lands were sheltered by dense forests and surrounded by rivers and lakes.  Natural and climatic conditions determined the characteristics of the economy of the North American tribes. </p><p>  The Iroquois lived in large spacious houses - ovachira.  They were rectangular buildings with barrel-shaped roofs. </p>

    <p>  The main agricultural crop of the tribes was maize.  <span>Corn fields</span> occupied vast territories (up to 9 km in radius).  In addition, the Iroquois cultivated beans and pumpkin. </p><p>  Since the 18th century, military and fur trade has been actively developing.  This was due to close contacts and trade with the colonists.  North American tribes supplied Europeans with beaver skins, which were used to make fur hats.  As a rule, agricultural work was exclusively carried out by women. </p><h2>  The political life of the Iroquois </h2><p>  In the <span>political life of the</span> North American tribes, the dominant position was occupied by the Hodenosauni League.  Its members were required to maintain peace among themselves.  The League was headed by the Council of Leaders, consisting of 50 sachems.  Its members were elected by the mothers of the clans.  Council decisions were discussed by each tribe separately, and then a unanimous decision was made.  Each leader could veto a verdict.  The first decisions of the Council were discussed by the Mohawks, then by the Seneca and Oneida, and the last by the Kayuga and Onondaga. </p><p>  All the laws and customs of the Hodenosauni League tribes were recorded in the Book of the Great Law.  It is worth noting that the US Constitution was created on the model of this document. </p>

    <h2>  <span>The social structure of the</span> North American tribes </h2><p>  The main unit of the social structure of the Iroquois was a clan headed by a woman.  Its members had collective ownership of land and <span>agricultural land.</span>  Each clan had a specific clan name.  As a rule, it was associated with the name of the animal.  All women of the clan took an active part in the clan council.  At its meetings, sachems - members of the Council of Leaders - were elected. </p><p>  The composition of the tribes could include from 10 to 3 genera.  So, in Seneca, Onondag and Kayug, there were 8 each, and in Mohoka and Oneida - 3 each. </p><h2>  Appearance of the Iroquois </h2><p>  A typical American Iroquois Indian, whose photo is presented below, contrary to popular belief today, did not wear an Iroquois hairstyle.  Men and tribal leaders, as a rule, completely shaved off their hair.  Only a small ‚Äúscalp lock‚Äù remained. </p><p>  The Iroquois took a warlike appearance only during military campaigns and the most important religious festivals.  Hairstyles, which only slightly resembled today's styling, were worn by the Onondaga tribe.  They completely shaved off their hair, leaving only a small strip in the center of the head, which they then braided into a braid. </p>

    <h2>  Religious beliefs </h2><p>  Initially, the basis of the Iroquois religion was totemism - faith in the supernatural powers of animals.  Animals acted as eponyms of the genus, performed the functions of protection during hostilities, patronized agriculture and hunting.  So, for example, the Mohawks, going to battle, carried with themselves a coat of arms depicting the main totem of the tribe. </p><p>  These cults later acquired industrial significance.  The Iroquois believed that the tribe needed to hunt for its totem animal.  In this regard, the bear cult was especially popular among the North American Indians. </p><p>  In addition, in the religious life of the Iroquois, agricultural cults gained great importance.  The tribes deified and worshiped the land, giving them strength.  Especially popular was the cult of the ‚ÄúThree Sisters-Nurses‚Äù - the main crops (maize, beans and pumpkin). </p><p>  It should be noted that the Iroquois, before other North American tribes, encountered Christian doctrine.  The European religion over time has become an integral part of their lives.  At present, the Iroquois profess Christianity. </p><h2>  Iroquois military art </h2><p>  After the formation of the Hodenosauni League, the military power of previously divided tribes greatly increased.  Before contact with the Europeans, the Iroquois weapons consisted of a bow and arrows, a spear and a club.  In addition, they used wooden shields that protected the warrior's body, head, and legs.  The beginning of lively trade with the Dutch led to changes in the military sphere of life of the North American tribes. </p>

    <p>  Europeans supplied them with firearms and daggers.  However, these novelties did not immediately replace the usual means of defense for the Iroquois (bow and arrows).  The introduction of firearms entailed the abandonment of wooden shields.  Since then, the Iroquois also began to apply a new tactic of warfare - the technique of dispersion across the battlefield. </p><p>  The Iroquois were more advanced in the use of new weapons than other North American tribes.  This was largely facilitated by close trade contacts with Europeans. </p>
