    <p>  As for cleaning, in general, most of the guests were satisfied with its quality.  However, some hotel guests claim that sometimes the maid forgot to vacuum or mop the floors in their apartments.  However, this did not become any serious problem. </p><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  As for the own territory of the five-star hotel complex ‚ÄúRixos Sangate‚Äù, the reviews of which we are considering, then, according to our compatriots, it is very large, green, beautiful and well-groomed.  Many travelers enthusiastically recall the large number of pines that fill the air with a unique aroma.  The hotel has plenty of places for pleasant walks and great photo shoots.  Also during the holiday season, an electric train runs here, on which both children and adults enjoy riding. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel, it suited almost all tourists.  The main advantage of the guests is the fact that the hotel complex is only 40 minutes from the airport.  This especially pleased those who are on vacation with young children. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  In their reviews, many travelers note the excellent work of the administrators at the Rixos Sangate Hotel (Turkey).  So, according to them, customers are very taken care of here.  Therefore, in this hotel complex you will not be doomed to wait for many hours to check in, even if you arrive early in the morning.  By the way, this attitude is not found in all five-star hotels, not to mention the institutions of a lower category.  As noted by some tourists who arrived at the hotel in the morning, they were immediately offered to go to breakfast at a restaurant, and then check into the room prepared for them.  By the way, if you didn‚Äôt like the proposed apartments with something, you can safely report it to the reception.  As a rule, the administrator will offer you to look at a few more available rooms of your category and choose the one that you like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Rixos Sangate in Kemer" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1020915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  As for nutrition, in this regard, most of our compatriots agreed that it is organized here at a very decent level.  However, there were those who claimed that every day in the main restaurant of the hotel complex they cook the same thing.  However, most guests insist that even if this is so, the choice of dishes is so diverse that you can try something new every time and not repeat food for several days in a row.  In addition, there is always the opportunity to visit the √† la carte restaurant and taste the dishes of national Turkish, Italian, Japanese and other cuisines of the world. </p><p>  With a kind word, travelers also recall the numerous cafeterias, coffee houses and bars of the Rixos Sangate Hotel.  So, according to tourists, experienced bartenders work here, who will always be happy to offer you a drink to your taste. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, this point also pleased almost all our compatriots who chose the five-star Rixos Sangate (Turkey) for their summer vacation.  So, according to them, the hotel‚Äôs own beach, although not wide, has a considerable length of about 800 meters.  It has very comfortable sun loungers and tents.  So there is enough space on the beach for everyone.  There are refrigerators with drinks throughout the beach, locker rooms, toilets, as well as bars and snack bars where you can always have a bite to eat.  In addition, children's playgrounds are equipped here.  There is also a pier, a pontoon, the ability to engage in water sports.  In addition, travelers liked the fact that lifeguards are always on duty on the shore, ready to come to the aid of vacationers if necessary. </p><p>  The beach itself is sandy.  The only negative, according to vacationers, is the fact that entering the water is gentle and sandy in only one place.  Usually tourists with children try to take places there.  On the rest of the bottom there are large stones.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend using special shoes so as not to injure their legs when entering the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riksos sangate turkey reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1020914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews of the Rixos Sangate Hotel (Turkey), photos of which can be seen in this article, greatly praise the pools available on its territory.  According to them, they are very large, clean, with spacious sun terraces, equipped with a sufficient number of comfortable sun loungers.  In addition, the hotel has a small water park, where both adult vacationers and children are happy to frolic. </p><p>  Guests who prefer an active lifestyle, were delighted with the sports grounds of the hotel complex.  Especially many praise the beach volleyball courts.  According to them, they saw such pleasant fine sand only on TV.  So sports lovers will have something to do here. </p><p>  Positive feedback from our compatriots was also awarded to the spa center of the hotel complex under consideration.  As guests note, a very wide range of health and beauty treatments are offered here.  Visitors were satisfied with their cost and quality. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, some guests express their regret in their comments that the hotel does not have an amphitheater for adult guests.  Performances by guest artists take place on an improvised stage.  Only those who have previously taken places can comfortably observe what is happening.  But parents with children sometimes had to sit even on the floor.  Therefore, travelers express the hope that the administration of the hotel complex will think about this problem and try to solve it in the near future.  After all, it is not difficult to build an amphitheater, especially since the vast territory of the hotel allows you to do this. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the Turkish hotel "Rixos Sungate 5 *" is just perfect for families with children.

Also on the territory of the hotel complex there is a mini-zoo where kids can enjoy watching rabbits, ducks, pigeons and other inhabitants.  In addition, for young travelers there is also their own amphitheater, where every evening there are entertaining shows designed specifically for children.  So, kids enjoyed attending clown performances, cat shows and many other shows. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Mostly positive impressions were left by our compatriots, judging by their reviews, and about the employees of the hotel complex.  So, tourists say that the staff here are very friendly, attentive, responsible.  Employees always try to solve all arising issues as quickly as possible and help guests in everything.  A big plus for our compatriots is the fact that most hotel workers speak Russian.  So you will not have any communication problems here. </p>
