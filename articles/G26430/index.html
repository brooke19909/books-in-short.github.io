Picturesque Benitses (Corfu) is waiting for tourists!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most northern island of Greece, distinguished by its natural beauty, has been popular with tourists for many years.  It has everything that can satisfy the most demanding traveler: warm sea, gentle sun, many architectural attractions. </p><p>  Many centuries ago, the island was ruled by the Roman state and inherited a pretty resort, which began to develop rapidly from the late 70s of the last century.  The name Benitses (Corfu) is translated as "a corner rich in water."  Indeed, there has never been a shortage of life-giving moisture. </p><h2>  Some facts about the resort </h2><p>  The colorful Benitses (Corfu), whose photo causes an irresistible desire to get to know him, is one of the main tourist centers of Greece.  An ancient settlement, known since antiquity, is located 12 kilometers from the island's capital.  The resort, located between the old harbor and the lush green hills, stretches for several kilometers along the coast.  After the advent of the modern port, built specifically for tourist boats, the appearance of the busy village has changed radically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benitses corfu reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2071225.jpg"></div>
