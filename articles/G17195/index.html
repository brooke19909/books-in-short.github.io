    <h2>  Features of dresses for expecting a miracle </h2><p>  The tastes and preferences of each pregnant woman are very individual.  Some are very happy with the changes in the figure and try to maximize emphasize the appeared roundness.  Others, on the contrary, in every possible way hide their tummy under spacious robes and are embarrassed to wear a tight or short thing. </p><p>  Fashion for pregnant women is a very relative concept, because each figure changes in its own way, it is difficult to predict the size and proportions of changes: some note only the growth of the tummy, while others round off the hips, shoulders, and the chest grows noticeably. </p><p>  Choosing an <span>elegant dress</span> for pregnant women, there are several main nuances, considering which the choice will become more successful: </p><ul><li>  Comfortable length.  There is a category of girls who remain faithful to mini even being in position.  But nevertheless, an elegant dress for a future mother looks much more profitable in a long version, ankle-deep, or in length, covering her knees. </li><li>  Appropriate finish.  Very often elegant dresses are full of a large number of sequins, lace and bows.  It is better for a pregnant woman to avoid such a decor - it will make the overall look too bulky and heavy.  An elegant belt, a small bow or a modest rim will be enough. </li><li>  The right fit.  Pregnancy, of course, adorns women, many of them manage not to gain too much weight and wear outfits from the usual "non-pregnant" life for a long time.  But when a woman with an impressive tummy puts on an elegant dress for pregnant women not in size or an ordinary dress that puffs on her stomach - it looks inappropriate.  Therefore, the cut of the dress should correspond to the gestational age, so that the outfit will sit well. </li></ul>

Also in such models very often there is a girdle, which is located immediately below the chest. </p><p>  Such outfits look great on slender girls and on future mothers with impressive tummies. </p><p>  An elegant dress for pregnant women in the Greek style is most often chosen for summer outlets: models involve open shoulders and a neckline. </p><p>  A great feature of dresses of this kind is that they are suitable for any future mother, regardless of her term and shape. </p><p>  But it is especially worthwhile to pay attention to Greek dresses to expectant mothers who have a very large tummy, who are overweight or swollen.  The peculiarity of the cut of the dress will help to hide all temporary problems with the appearance, and the tenderness and femininity of the baby's expectations can only be emphasized. </p><h2>  Trapezoid or letter A </h2><p>  Another very popular variety of dresses for expectant mothers are dresses, the cut of which is made in the form of a trapeze, and also as an option - it resembles the letter A silhouette. </p><p>  Such dresses gradually expand downward, leaving enough free space for a growing tummy.  But most often, such models are suitable for slim girls who are expecting a small child or expectant mothers for a short time. </p>

But the probability of a successful purchase is significantly reduced. </p><p>  Modern future mothers can use another affordable option and make elegant dresses for pregnant women with their own hands.

    <p>  Choose the pattern of the dress you like: the main thing is to choose the silhouette and model and redraw it.  She will not look different than a dress dress pattern.  For pregnant women, the most important is a successful cut, and the solemnity of the dress can be added with the help of trim, accessories and jewelry. </p><p>  When sewing, it is especially worthwhile to relate to the place for the tummy - if you plan to wear the dress for a long time, then you need to consider the possible increase in volumes. </p><p>  A pregnant woman in an elegant dress that suits her is doubly beautiful.  She not only radiates inner light, tenderness and harmony, but she herself feels beautiful, and from this shines even more! </p>
