    <h2>  Base </h2><p>  The village of Kamyzyak appeared around 1560 as a result of the expansion of the fishing uchug.  In the middle of the XVII century it was granted to princes Kurakin by the Moscow Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.  The first inhabitants of the village were mostly exiled settlers who were engaged in fishing. </p><p>  Due to the convenient location of the village on one of the largest branches of the Volga river delta, the village quickly began to flourish.  In particular, the rich catches of fish allowed the Kurakin to receive huge profits from its sale, and these places even began to be called the “Golden Bottom”. </p><h2>  Stepan Razin </h2><p>  During the heyday <span>of fishing</span> at the Kamyzyak uchug, a wooden church of the Smolensk Mother of God was built, in which the chapel of St.  St. Nicholas the Wonderworker. </p><p>  In 1646, Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich issued a decree according to which the Ivanchug uchug and Trinity hill began to belong to the famous Astrakhan monastery.  The latter was founded in 1568 by Father Superior Kirill, who was specially sent to these parts from Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1670, after the capture of Astrakhan, the famous rebel Stepan Razin arrived in Kamyzyak.  There he assembled a fleet, which in the spring went on a campaign in Persia. </p>

    <h2>  In the XVIII-XIX centuries </h2><p>  In 1722, the great reformer king visited the Kamyzyak River, who was interested in the state of the Volga delta and the prospects for shipping for large vessels. </p><p>  In 1860, a fairway was designed on Sharapovskaya Spit, intended for the free exit of steamboat sea vessels.  For this purpose, it was necessary to remove the stemming in the Kamyzyak River.  After 12 years, a local fishing industry was rented by a certain Mukhanov.  Under him, the gangs from Kamyzyak were moved 20 versts in the direction of the sea, but the population remained in a familiar place. </p><p>  In the 1890s, a 2-year parish school was founded in the village, as well as a rural male one-class and female school. </p><h2>  At the turn of the century </h2><p>  According to the census conducted at the very beginning of the XX century, at that time in Kamyzyak (Astrakhan region) 3066 people lived and there were 520 yards.  Most residents engaged in fishing.  In the village there were 2 churches, a fishing club, a brick factory, one winery and several manufactory and grocery shops, as well as a pharmacy and a first-aid post with one paramedic.  Russians, Tatars and Kazakhs lived in the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In the Soviet period </h2><p>  In 1925, the status of Kamyzyak radically changed.  The Kamyzyaksky district was formed, and the village itself became a district center. </p><p>  By the beginning of 1972, 11,000 people lived in the village.  By a decree of the Presidium of the Armed Forces of the RSFSR in 1973, he received the status of a city of regional subordination.  The villages of Tabola, Zarechnoye, Steep Shores, Azov-Dolgoe, etc., also entered its territory. Thus, the city of Kamyzyak in the Astrakhan Region appeared on the map of the USSR. </p><p>  In just 2 years, its population has grown to 12,700 people.  However, the main industries and economies of the city continued to remain and are still fishing and manufacturing industries. </p><h2>  Modern Kamyzyak (Astrakhan region) </h2><p>  Today, the city is the administrative center of the agricultural region of the same name and is located 35 km from Astrakhan.  In total, about 16,000 people live there.  The area of ​​Kamyzyak is 24 square meters.  km and territorially it is divided into 4 microdistricts (Tabola, Yuzhny, Molodezhny, and Meliorativny). </p><p>  The Kamyzyak index of the Astrakhan region is 416340. The nearest railway station is in Astrakhan. </p>
