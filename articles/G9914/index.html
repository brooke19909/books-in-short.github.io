    <p>  The hotel can be called a relatively young institution, since it was built in 2004 and since then has been hosting many guests every year in its apartments.  The last repair in the hotel was in 2014.  Currently, the complex covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã13 thousand square meters.  The institution is focused on all categories of tourists.  The hotel complex, despite its five-star status, is located on the second line, so vacationers need a little walk to the beach.

    <p>  For vacationers there are several shops with the most necessary goods, there is a beauty salon, hairdresser, hammam, sauna and fitness center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The beach of Timo Resort Hotel 5 * is located across the street from the hotel building.  Its length is not more than 50 meters.  The coast is equipped with accessories for a comfortable stay and has a sand and pebble coating. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Timo Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey), as we have already mentioned, is located in the village of Konakli.  A great advantage of the village is its proximity to Alanya.  Konakli is an ordinary seaside resort village.  Its population does not exceed 30 thousand people.  Most people work in hotels, the rest are engaged in agriculture.  The town has a park and more than 30 hotels, most of which have five stars on the signs.  However, in fairness it is worth noting that you will not find fashionable establishments here, all of them most likely have a fairly average level. </p><p>  But from the point of view of rest, Konakli is a very convenient place, since the village has a bazaar, shopping centers, shops and other infrastructure.  Therefore, going outside the hotel, you will have the opportunity to walk around the resort and buy not only fruits and traditional souvenirs, but also leather things.  Konakli can be considered as a resort from mid-April to October.  The transport connection with Antalya in the village is very well established.  Therefore, in local dolmushi in 15 minutes you can reach the center of the famous city with many attractions and interesting places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timo resort hotel 5 turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2023190.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Konaklƒ± beaches are completely covered with small pebbles, and large boulders are found in the water.  Only in some parts of the coast is sand found.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, specify beach options if they are important to you. </p><p>  The village itself is very nice and clean, so it's nice to walk around.  On Wednesdays, the market tripled in the town.  At the local market you can buy sweets, souvenirs, tea, coffee and other traditional Turkish products.  But there are no special attractions in Konakli, they will have to go to Alanya. </p><h2>  Reviews about Timo Resort Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who rested in it this season.  Timo Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey), according to the spa, is a pretty good complex.  Of course, it cannot be ranked among fashionable establishments.  But he deserves the title of a budget complex.  Many tourists note that the hotel does not reach the level of five stars declared on its sign, but still leave the best reviews about it.  The hotel complex, like many establishments, has its advantages and disadvantages, although in general it makes a good impression. </p><p>  Resort Timo Resort Hotel 5 * is located on the coast.  However, a road and a garden separate the hotel from the beach.  In order to cross the track, a public underground passage is provided.  It is clean and beautiful, but if you are with a small child, you will have to lower and raise the stroller several times a day, which is not very convenient.  By the way, such a transition can also be inconvenient for older people.  Further, for the subway, you need to walk a little through the garden, and you are already on the shore.  In general, the whole journey does not take more than five minutes. </p><p>  The territory of the complex itself is very small, we can say that it is practically nonexistent.  The hotel consists of one six-story building, in front of which is a swimming pool and relaxation area.  The territory is well-groomed and very clean, but there is no place to walk here.  Because there is simply no place.  But behind the hotel‚Äôs fence there are shops, a supermarket, cafes and other infrastructure.  Therefore, leaving the hotel, you can walk around the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timo resort hotel 5 food" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2023214.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The room fund of Timo Resort Hotel 5 *, the reviews of which are given in the article, pleases guests with fresh repairs and good furniture.  The apartments have a standard design, without frills, but at the same time they are in good condition, all the equipment is working properly.  As for the plumbing, it is quite decent, although not new.  Bed linen and towels are clean, without stains and scuffs.  Housekeeping is provided daily.  But regarding its quality, opinions differ.  Some believe that it is quite decent, others remain unhappy, noting that even tips do not have the proper effect on the maids.  Towels are changed every day, and bed linen every other day.  The noise from the animation in the evenings does not cause any particular inconvenience with closed doors and windows, especially since all events end before midnight. </p><p>  In general, the number of rooms can be attributed to the advantages of the institution. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Tours in Timo Resort Hotel 5 * have long been popular among holidaymakers.  Not the last role in this is played by good food at the hotel.  The main restaurant offers a large selection of dishes.  On the tables there is always chicken, turkey and lamb, but the selection of fish dishes is small.  The local chef cooks vegetables, snacks and grilled food perfectly.  The buffet also offers many sweets and desserts.  The concept of nutrition does not include natural fresh, but only drinks like "UPI".  But tourists are satisfied with the quality of local alcohol.  The hotel restaurant is clean, the waiters work very promptly.  During the high season, when the hotel has an influx of tourists, sometimes at lunch or dinner you can see a crowd of tourists.  At such a time, it is better not to come to the beginning of the meal, but a little later.  The rest of the food, according to vacationers, is worthy of all praise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timo resort hotel 5 beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2023225.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Bars are located on site.  They can take not only refreshing drinks, but also delicious snacks, desserts and other sweets.  In principle, in each of them you can have a good snack. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel makes the most pleasant impression on tourists.  This is largely due to a good level of service.  Timo Resort Hotel 5 * - one of those institutions, coming to which it is absolutely not necessary to know English.  Firstly, representatives of the post-Soviet space are resting here, and secondly, almost all the staff speak Russian or understand it, so there can be no language barrier here.  Receptionists work quickly and resettle promptly.  But such trifles as lunch box at an early or late check-out are simply unfamiliar to those on duty.  Unfortunately, this service is not provided.  In general, the entire hotel staff is very nice and welcoming, which creates an additional positive mood. </p><p>  Especially tourists praise the animation team, which works all day.  In the morning, sporting events, water aerobics and much more await guests.  Throughout the day, activists come up with new entertainment.  But at the same time, the animation is completely unobtrusive.  If you do not want to participate in events, then no one will bother you.  No less interesting evening show programs.  Every evening, animators show a fresh interesting show.  They do not forget about the youngest vacationers.  A club with interesting entertainments works for them, and in the evenings, an incendiary disco calls the kids. </p><p>  Thanks to the skillful work of animators, the rest turns into an interesting and fascinating entertainment, filled with fun and positive emotions. </p><p>  The most active guests are offered the opportunity to go to one of the night clubs of Konakli. </p><p>  The hotel has its own private beach.  Although it is small, everyone has enough space on it.  The coast is covered with small pebbles mixed with sand.  Depth in the sea begins quickly enough, so you need to monitor the children.  Under water there are large stones.  In principle, a stay on the beach does not require any special shoes.  But if you are uncomfortable entering small pebbles into the sea, then special beach accessories can be purchased near the hotel.  The coast is equipped with quality canopies, giving a good shadow, and sun loungers.  Hotel staff regularly clean the beach, so you will not see garbage here. </p><p>  Guests note the incredibly convenient location of the complex.  The village center can be reached in a couple of minutes.  There is a stop nearby, making it easy to get to Alanya to see local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timo resort hotel 5 service" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2023226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the hotel reception there is always a representative of a tour operator who can offer sightseeing trips.  Many near the hotel and local guides offering their services. </p><h2>  Alanya Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the village of Konakli, be sure to visit Alanya.  The city is very interesting for historical sights.  His hallmark is the famous Kyzyl-Kul tower.  At one time, it was built by order of the Sultan for defensive purposes.  For several centuries the tower faithfully served the townspeople.  But later she lost her direct purpose and is now a symbol of Alanya.  Currently, an observation deck for guests of the city functions at the top of the tower, and a local museum is located inside the building. </p><p>  No less interesting is the fortress of the city, which dates from the 13th century AD.  It has survived quite well to the present day and has the status of a historical monument. </p><p>  Not far from the center of Alanya is the valley of the mountain river Dim Chai.  A dam was recently built here, as a result of which a reservoir appeared.  Of course, swimming in it is forbidden, but here fish are bred.  And on the coast built cafes and fish restaurants that cook dishes from the freshest catch.  There are always many tourists and locals coming to picnics.  Dim Tea attracts people primarily by the beauty of nature and the opportunity to relax. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in Alanya there are not only historical monuments, but also numerous entertainments.  One of the most popular places for family visits is the amusement park Sialanya.  From the city it can be reached in just twenty minutes. </p><p>  The park has many attractions for visitors of all ages.  Be sure to visit the dolphinarium, which constantly hosts performances by marine life.  The park is so huge that it is not possible to see it all in one day.  But you can ride through its territory, thanks to the "slow river" attraction.  In the middle of the park there is a huge pond, at the bottom of which you can dive and see its inhabitants.  Such entertainment attracts a lot of daredevils. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timo resort hotel 5 room description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2023230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Alanya is a very beautiful and amazing city.  On its stony old streets it‚Äôs just nice to wander.  On the coast you can see caves and grottoes, of which many have survived to this day.  The largest of them were found not so long ago, and this happened quite by accident, during the construction of the port.  Now the caves are open to visitors, you can see real stalactites and stalagmites in them.  It is said that a walk along the underground corridors is especially useful for people suffering from pulmonary diseases. </p><p>  Alanya will appeal to all shopping lovers.  The city has an incredible number of colorful little shops with all kinds of souvenirs and goods.  Walking through them and making pleasant purchases is a real pleasure.  In addition, in Alanya there are large stores with leather, gold and fur products of good quality, so guests of the resort try to buy expensive items here so as not to buy fakes in local markets.  In the city there are entertainment for all categories of tourists - from small to large. </p>
