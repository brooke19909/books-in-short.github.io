  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to turn on your iPhone and start using it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So, you became the happy owner of a brand-new product of the famous "apple" company.  How to turn on the iPhone and how to start using it?  IPhones of all generations are included as standard - using the Power button located at the top right of the phone.  The same button is responsible for locking and unlocking the phone. </p><p>  But even after turning on, using an iPhone is most often impossible.  In order for the device to begin to fully function, it must be activated.  If you bought a phone from one of the major mobile operators such as MTS or Megafon, then it will most likely already be activated.  But if not, then this operation can be done without problems. </p><h4>  Let's step by step how to turn on the iPhone and activate a new phone. </h4><p>  1. Take out your iPhone and cable for the PC from the box. </p><p>  2. Download and install the special iTunes program on the computer. </p><p>  3. Insert the SIM card into the phone, turn it on using the Power button, connect the phone to the computer via the cable that was included. </p><p>  4. Most often, iTunes starts automatically.  If not, run the program manually.  She herself will offer to activate the device.  We confirm the request. </p><p>  5. We leave the iPhone alone and wait for the activation to occur.  While there is no activation, the device displays a pending message.  While the process is underway, you can get acquainted with the capabilities of the device that do not require communication, for example, with a camera, importing photos, menus, etc. </p><p>  6. When activation ends, try calling.  If everything is in order, the phone will dial the number.  This means that the full functionality of your iPhone is turned on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h4>  How to enable iPhone 4s </h4><p>  For this generation of iPhones, the activation process was greatly simplified - it became optional to use a computer. </p><p>  How to turn on iPhone without using iTunes. </p><p>  1. Insert the SIM card, turn on the phone using the "Power" button. </p><p>  2. Choose a familiar interface language: Russian-Russia </p><p>  3. The phone asks if you let him determine the location or not (this will be needed later for using cards, check-ins on Facebook, etc.).  If these functions are needed, then we allow it. </p><p>  4. Next, the iPhone will ask for a WiFi connection.  In principle, this step is optional.  It can be done later, at any time.  We still need the Internet to send information to Apple about the successful activation of the device, and also for the operation of various online services such as iCloud and iTunes Match.  For the same purposes, you can successfully use the mobile Internet of a local operator (3G / GPRS). </p><p>  5. Now the iPhone will register in the network of the mobile operator, receive the necessary settings for MMS, SMS.  If you previously had a different iPhone, they will offer to restore the saved previous data from the backup.  And if the iPhone is new, then you need to select "Set up a new device."  In general, after that the phone can already be used fully.  Further steps are, in principle, optional, but highly desirable. </p><p>  6. Again you need to connect to the Internet and log in using your Apple ID (this is a personal account for all Apple services).  If you don‚Äôt have one, then you need to create a new account - it‚Äôs free and easy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  7. There is an agreement that needs to be accepted (it would be nice to read it first), then turn on (or not turn on) the voice assistant. </p><p>  8. We agree or not that Apple conducts diagnostic reports, click the "Start using" button.  That, in fact, is all. </p><p>  Do not forget also that you can activate iPhone 4s using iTunes. </p><h4>  How to turn on the iPhone if the ‚ÄúOn‚Äù button does not work </h4><p>  If you held the power button for a long time, but the phone doesn‚Äôt have a response, it means that the problem is most likely in the upper loop, where the button is located.  Then the headphone jack, the volume control buttons, and the silent mode switch will have problems. </p><p>  Perhaps the power button failed, equal in height to the body.  It is necessary to check: maybe the fasteners cracked or the screws loose. </p><p>  In any case, if the button does not work, then the phone must be carried to the service.  It is better not to open it yourself. </p><h4>  How to turn on iPhone if it is suspended </h4><p>  To do this, use the forced reboot mode: simultaneously press and hold the On button (at the top) and the Home button (the only round button under the screen) for a long time.  After that, the phone goes off.  If you turn it back on, it will reboot longer than usual, but the problems will automatically be fixed. </p><h4>  How to enable iPhone 3G </h4><p>  On the main page of the screen you need to click "Settings" - "Basic" - "Network".  In the next window, swipe the slider.  Click ‚ÄúEnabled‚Äù next to 3G. </p><p>  When the 3G protocol is used, the information loads faster, but the battery charge is also consumed faster. </p>
