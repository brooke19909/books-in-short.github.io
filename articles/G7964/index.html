Moreover, this person is a representative of either the people or traditions.  For example, the <span>Queen of Great Britain.</span>  In fact, it is the only lever controlling the mechanism called "monarchy."  However, in reality, all decisions taken come from the country's parliament.  At the same time, the queen regularly receives her salary.

    <h2>  Salary of the president as an employee of the state apparatus </h2><p>  In democracies, the situation is slightly different.  As an employee of the <span>state apparatus, the</span> president of a country also receives wages.  Moreover, he fulfills every ruble, peso or rupee, as they say, "from A to Z."  The salary of the president of the Russian Federation or another country is not announced aloud to anyone, however, interested parties can easily find this figure.  For example, in the annual budget.  This document contains such a line as “Costs for the functioning of the head of state”.  From year to year, the budget undergoes changes and amendments, and introduces new articles and lines into its content.  However, this part of the costs is always in the first place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Estimated budget line item </h2><p>  However, the figure, which is located in this line, will only approximately show us the real salary of the head of state.  Why?  Firstly, the annual budget is a kind of business plan in which all items of expenditure are designed for the future and are only approximate.  In compiling this document, analysts rely on concepts such as inflation, crises, the growth of various tax rates, state duties, and so on.  At the same time, it is impossible to predict with absolute accuracy the level of many instruments that affect future expenses.  For example, in 2005, it was planned to spend 4.1 billion rubles on the described article in the annual budget.  In fact, about 5.9 billion rubles were spent. </p><p>  Secondly, the salary of the President of the Russian Federation in this line is only part of it.  “The costs of the functioning of the head of state” also include the costs of his deputies and administration.  In addition to the official salary, the Russian president enjoys numerous privileges.  These include departmental housing, suburban residences, company vehicles, and more. </p><h2>  Comparing countries </h2><p>  In 2009, the British tabloid Financial Times published an article in which it posted the salary figures of the heads of state of different countries.  So, the salary of the president of the Russian Federation (at that time he was Dmitry Medvedev) was an order of magnitude lower than that of his foreign colleagues.  The leader of the list of “powers of this world” was Barack Obama.  His <span>salary per</span> year amounted to 292 thousand euros.  For comparison: Dmitry Medvedev received only a quarter of this amount.  In the same year, the head of state of Russia announced that he would annually report on the amount of his income.  Dmitry Medvedev explained that the well-known and “transparent” salary of the President of the Russian Federation and civil servants is a measure to reduce corruption, which increased during the financial crisis.  Words were not just empty phrases, and for several years now the head of state has regularly reported on his income. </p>
