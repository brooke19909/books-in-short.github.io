Its capital is the city of Saransk.  The village is located on both banks of the Insar River (it is the source of the Volga River).  The city occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 82 thousand square kilometers. </p><p>  Saransk was founded back in 1641.  Today, more than 340 thousand people live here.  Cossacks and Pushkars lived in the city, there were Tatars and Mokshans, so now it is a multinational settlement, which was often rebuilt, even in post-Soviet times. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.1873935" data-lng="45.18379959999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/3/6/1136.png"></div><p>  As in any other settlement, there are many historical places, attractions.  One of these is the Millennium Square in Saransk.  The street is limited to four central: </p><ul><li>  named after Bogdan Khmelnitsky; </li><li>  the name of Leo Tolstoy; </li><li>  Bolshevik; </li><li>  Polezhaeva. </li></ul><p>  The approximate area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is 3 thousand square meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vikos2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University view at night" class="if uuid-2293847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2293847.jpg"></div><h2>  Fountain </h2><p>  This is not just a square, but an entire architectural complex, made in a single architectural style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the middle of the street there is a light and music fountain, whose height is 45 meters.  He was called the ‚ÄúStar of Mordovia‚Äù, because it has the shape of a star of the republic.  This is a solar sign, which is one of the components of the national ornament.  Although it can be viewed exclusively from a bird's eye view. </p><p>  Everyone can take a walk in the fountain taking off their shoes, as the project provides for a pedestrian zone where the water level is about 2-3 centimeters.  And at night a very beautiful event takes place here, the image is transferred to a vertical surface.  This is a truly unique building in Russia. </p><h2>  Environment </h2><p>  Beautiful buildings were reconstructed and erected along the perimeter of Millennium Square in Saransk. </p><p>  First of all, one cannot fail to notice the building of the State University, lined with glass and very reminiscent of the Stalinist buildings.  Around the school, the building of the basketball club, which has a rounded shape, is majestically.  On the Millennium Square in Saransk there is also a sculpture ‚ÄúThe Tree of Life‚Äù. </p><p>  The completely reconstructed building of the Pushkin Library is also located on the street. </p><p>  And in the middle, opposite the library, on the Saransk Millennium Square, the stone of the same name is installed.  It features a map of the republic of the 10th century and the pendant of the Rurikovich.  This is a sign that 1 thousand years ago the Russian Empire and the Mordovian peoples became united. </p><p>  A chic descent, one might say, of a European level, was organized on Lenin Avenue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiantowns.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memorial stone" class="if uuid-2293857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2293857.jpg"></div><h2>  Ogarev Plaza </h2><p>  Shopping and entertainment center overlooks the Millennium Square of Saransk.  This place is a paradise for shopaholics.  Trading pavilions, where the most famous world brands and local manufacturers are located.  In addition to shops, in the center there are many cozy cafes and catering establishments with cuisines of different peoples of the world, where you can go and relax from a long walk around the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the center there is an underground parking, the top of which is decorated with glass domes with a diameter of up to five meters, in which there are retail outlets.  At night, the pavilions are highlighted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asd-sfb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Descent to Lenin Square" class="if uuid-2293855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2293855.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Earlier, at the place where the Millennium Square is located in Saransk, there was a stadium called "Lighting".  It was designed for the reception of 14 thousand guests, had a huge visor over the central stands and an impressive territory of heated lawns.  It was an arena for the games of the local football club Mordovia.  In 2010, the dismantling of the sports and entertainment complex began.  Now all home competitions are held at the Start stadium. </p><p>  The opening of the reconstructed area took place in 2012.  Today, the description of Saransk and the Millennium Square are synonyms.  This is a unique landmark of the highest level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rus.rus4all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird's-eye view" class="if uuid-2293850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2293850.jpg"></div><h2>  Contemporary issues </h2><p>  The main news of the city in 2017 is unattractive sounds on the Millennium Square.  The photo of Saransk is now hard to imagine without this area, however, in the literal sense, it began to crack.  Many citizens associate this with the legendary stadium, on the site of which one of the central squares of the city was erected.  Like, even then all building codes were violated, because the object was erected at the "Stakhanov" pace.  Therefore, the townspeople put a ‚Äúblack‚Äù mark on the square. </p><p>  In fact, cracks were discovered in some parts, which immediately began to be fixed.  Paving slabs are disassembled, faults are eliminated, and again laying of the coating is underway.  It is believed that the builders were in a hurry, they did not try to check the quality certificates for building materials.  As a result, after some 5 years this situation has developed. </p><p>  The authorities are silent as always, business representatives worry about their trading places, and the people are indignant.  But in any case, the square is a modern landmark of the city of Saransk, which tourists come to see. </p>
