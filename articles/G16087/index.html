For beginners, these tips will be the best option for exploring origami.  The rules for creating kusudama are among the simplest basics of origami art.  The Kusudama technique for beginners and more will be shown here.  Even those who have long been familiar with origami can find something new for themselves.  Balls from various parts - this is what Kusudama is, but that is not all.  More details will be described below.  One of the origami trends is Kusudama for beginners.  Her creation will become real magic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Team Origami" class="if uuid-2556339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89868/2556339.jpg"></div><h2>  The origin of Kusudama </h2><p>  Kusudama decoration (from the Japanese language - "healing ball") - a cotton product in the shape of a ball.  It, as a rule, is created by joint stitching of a large number of similar pyramidal modules.  Most often, these are stylized flowers collected from a square paper sheet.  Thanks to these actions, a spherical figure is obtained.  In the same way, all parts can be glued together.  But this is already moving away from the original principles of creating Kusudama.  In some embodiments of the creation of the ball, the importance of attaching the brush to the lower end of the article is present.  In ancient times, the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun used Kusudam for medicinal purposes: they were collected from medicinal herbs and flowers.  Now it is mainly a decoration element. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kusudama balls" class="if uuid-2556336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89868/2556336.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the Kusudama </h2><p>  The art of creating (or stitching) kusudama originated from ancient Japanese traditions.  In those days, it was used with the aim of aromatically fumigating a room with aromas of dried petals of medicinal herbs.  It is likely that the first Kusudamas were healing herbs or plants tied in bunches.  The term itself involves a combination of two Japanese names: kusuri (medicine) and tama (ball).  In our time, Kusudama balls are used as beautiful and unusual gifts, or decoration of an apartment.  Kusudama is considered a significant component of the history of art, in particular the trend of modular art.  Nowadays, the line between these beliefs is erased.  And the healing ball turns into an ordinary decorative ornament. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pwieu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Origami Ball" class="if uuid-2556341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89868/2556341.jpg"></div><h2>  Creators of kusudama </h2><p>  Along with traditional kusudam in the current art, dozens of the latest unique modifications appear every year - blinkers, polyhedra, bouquets and others.  In the society of modular art, similar specialists are more familiar: Tomoko Fuse, Miyuki Kawamura, Mio Tsugawa, Makoto Yamaguchi and Yoshihide Momotani, who arrived from the Land of the Rising Sun;  Meenakshi Mukherjee and Jim Plank, arrived from the United States.  And many others from various countries of the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple Kusudama for beginners.  First steps </h2><p>  Kusudama is one of the types of Japanese art, the main rule of which is to combine similar modules laid out in a certain design from a square sheet of paper.  Usually, the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun created jewelry in which dried herbs or flowers were hidden.  Today, cotton crafts of kusudama are used in the decoration of rooms.  In this guide, you can learn the simplest technique for creating kusudama and learn it step by step.  Even for beginners, the first time they manage to create unique crafts with their own hands. </p><p>  So, we will conduct a master class on creating a simple kusudama for beginners.  In order to create an elementary simplicity craft, you will need: </p><ul><li>  multi-colored paper; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  All sheets of paper should be square and the same size.  This is necessary so that all parts of the future Kusudama, without exception, come out absolutely identical.  The best option is paper squares eight or nine centimeters wide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="probuch.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color origami" class="if uuid-2556348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89868/2556348.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to take the very first sheet of paper and fold it diagonally, after that you need to fold it again in order to appear a second fold line.  It is also necessary to create a pleat, folding the second rectangle once in half.  After that, it is necessary to connect both ends together, forming a large triangle.  Next, the element is formed into a rectangle, and then the assembly is performed along the already prepared lines.  This is necessary so that the external part is combined with the internal. </p><p>  The next step is to fold the corners of the part in the main direction, and then push it in the middle from any angle.  Lower the corners down and lay the element according to the vertical direction.  Bend the remaining space in the same direction, and then hide them inward.  The first piece of crafts is almost ready.  It remains to fold the outer and lower corners to the middle.  And the last step is to deploy large three linear corners in order to give the image of a flower. </p><h2>  Kusudama Technique - Balls for Beginners </h2><p>  If you glue four such parts, the process of creating one of which is described above, you get a flower.  The result will be elegant chrysanthemums, which can then be glued together, trying to give the decoration a ball shape.  In order to create a solid ball, you will need to make 12 identical flowers, consisting of four parts.  It will be more correct to make them out of multi-colored paper.  So the work will look unique and attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kusudama color" class="if uuid-2556346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89868/2556346.jpg"></div><p>  Gluing flowers into a ball is the most difficult step to create to create such an interesting technical decoration.  Therefore, the process should be carried out carefully, spend as little glue as possible. </p><h2>  Create eyelets and brushes </h2><p>  After completing the last steps to create a kusudama, or rather gluing all the parts together, a very small hole can be cut in the upper flower.  A thread of red, pink or any other festive color is easily threaded through it.  From a threaded thread we make a convenient loop.  It will serve as a fixture.  In the same way we cut a hole in the other, lower part of the kusudama.  We also thread the thread, and then another and another.  Until a sufficiently dense skein forms, which will then be cut in half.  From this, a kusudama brush is obtained.  It will not be superfluous to use multi-colored threads in creating a brush. </p>
