  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ecological safety of new buildings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Buying an apartment in a new building is the most common way to purchase housing today.  It promises several undeniable advantages.  Among them, for example, are unconditionally more favorable prices, as well as the possibility of practically free redevelopment of their housing.  Modern technologies, communications, excellent neighbors who buy an apartment only for the purpose of further prosperity of the family are also attached. <noindex>  <span>New buildings Pushkin district</span> </noindex>  replenish constantly.  Therefore, to all of the above advantages, a huge assortment of objects is added.  It will suit every taste, wallet.  In a word, many people like affordable housing in newly built houses.  However, it also requires a careful attitude to itself, a careful choice on the part of new customers.  Including, it is worth paying attention to the environmental safety of each object.  By what parameters should it be determined? </p><h2>  Construction material </h2><p>  The safest until recently was considered a brick.  But today, practically nothing is built from small bricks.  And if they are building, then the brick no longer has a natural composition, it is silicate.  Accordingly, its environmental friendliness is small. </p><p>  A modern replacement for classic clay burnt bricks is foam concrete.  Responsible manufacturers use natural materials to fill it, so the foam concrete is very warm, high-quality.  It replaces several brick rows. </p><h2>  Facade insulation material </h2><p>  The best option is mineral wool.  It is considered a completely natural material.  Mineral wool requires periodic replacement if the house is located in conditions of high humidity, but incombustibility and the absence of harmful artificial substances are considered its indisputable advantage. </p><p>  The most poor-quality composition in terms of environmental friendliness is considered polyurethane.  In its structure, it will resemble tiles for finishing the ceiling, as well as the famous polystyrene, which is put in boxes with something fragile.  In addition to its artificial composition, the material was guilty of the fact that phosgene, one of the most toxic substances for humans, is released during combustion. </p><h2>  External factors </h2><p>  Do not forget that tenants and external factors are to blame for the non-environmental friendliness of some new apartments.  The former use low-quality finishing materials, trying to save on repairs, and the latter may include industrial enterprises, congested highways.  All of them in their own way affect comfort. </p></div></article>
