    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Budget holidays are not without drawbacks, as evidenced by the resort hotel Erkal Resort Hotel 4 * (Kemer, Turkey).  Reviews about this institution contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  if on the day of check-in you did not manage to come to breakfast, lunch or dinner, you will not be fed (you will have to wait for the next meal to be hungry); </li><li>  maids do not put hygienic cosmetics in the bathroom (you need to take them yourself at the reception); </li><li>  in a nearby hotel until late at night music plays loudly that keeps you awake; </li><li>  there is very little vegetation on the territory, and nobody cares for what is available; </li><li>  Wireless Internet is very slow, and its signal is only in the lobby area; </li><li>  plastic glasses in which drinks are served are used repeatedly; </li><li>  on the day of departure, immediately after noon, guests are denied all services, even if you intend to leave in a few hours; </li><li>  family rooms, where they usually sit with young children, open onto a disco; </li><li>  maids do not wash the floors in the room (they only cover the beds and wipe the dust); </li><li>  the pool is small enough, and therefore if all guests want to swim, they are physically not enough space; </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to overcome the busy roadway; </li><li>  the owner is constantly on site and closely monitors guests, which is very annoying; </li><li>  in the corridors they rub the floors with mastic, which gives off a terrible smell; </li><li>  the rooms have dirty curtains with greasy spots; </li><li>  a small assortment of sweets (there are no traditional Turkish desserts on the menu at all); </li><li>  the appearance of the hotel and the list of services provided do not correspond to the information presented on the official website; </li><li>  there is no drinking water in the rooms (you need to independently buy or type from a cooler in the corridor); </li><li>  rarely change bed linen and towels; </li><li>  it is forbidden to bring food and drinks to the beach, but there is no bar where you could buy this; </li><li>  there are no fermented milk products in the restaurant menu; </li><li>  reception staff are not very welcoming guests, which can significantly spoil the first impression of the institution; </li><li>  there is not enough variety in food (the restaurant menu is repeated day by day); </li><li>  the hotel lacks animation (which is why there are most pensioners and vacationers with children); </li><li>  when the guest leaves the room and picks up the key card, all electrical appliances (including the refrigerator) are turned off. </li></ul><p>  This hotel evokes the most diverse experience among travelers.  It is worth noting that the Erkal Resort Hotel 4 * hotel does not fully correspond to its "stardom".  The photo shows a rather modest, but very cozy atmosphere.  If you do not put forward excessive requirements for this hotel, then most likely you will be satisfied with the rest.  Moreover, the prices for accommodation are quite affordable.  This place is suitable for those who spend little time in the room and prefer to spend more time on the beach or on excursions. </p>
