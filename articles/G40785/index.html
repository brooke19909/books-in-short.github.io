The approximate cost is 7 thousand rubles.  Previously, this price category allowed the device to be located among mid-range devices.  To date, this model belongs to numerous "state employees".  The device lacks interesting and convenient features, such as a touch screen and wireless support.  But it is unlikely that the e-book has become worse fulfill their direct responsibilities.  We will talk more about the device later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onyx boox amundsen reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751096.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer along with the device supplies a cable for connecting to a computer and documentation.  Options are more than standard on Onyx Boox Amundsen.  Reviews about it are as neutral as possible.  The manufacturer saved on the charger. </p><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  If earlier the boxes of devices of this manufacturer were interesting and enchanting, now this feature has come to naught.  However, standard packaging is still great as a gift.  In the center of the lid, the buyer will notice a portrait of Royal Amundsen.  It is located in a blue frame.  At the upper and lower ends the box is decorated with unusual stripes.  Above the portrait, the manufacturer placed the name of the device.  It is difficult not to see it, since the size of the font is not small.  Under the image you can see some data from his biography, as well as a short story about why the Norwegian traveler became so famous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the box is the text.  It will allow you to find out the technical characteristics of the electronic book.  It also describes what languages ‚Äã‚Äãand formats the device supports, how comfortable it is to work with it, and performance is also described. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="txt format" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751097.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  External design </h2><p>  The described book is a good example of a really budget device.  The manufacturer abandoned all additional options, leaving only the basic functions.  The buyer will not find in this model either a bluetooth, or a wireless module, or a player.  Cover, backlighting and other features are also missing.  At the same time, the manufacturer took care of a good design solution.  We can say that the budget tool turned out to be really inexpensive, not disgusting potential buyers. </p><p>  The Onyx Boox Amundsen does not include a case, so either buy it right away or treat the display as carefully as possible.  The case is made of plastic.  Some traces sometimes remain on the back surface.  The front too, but they are almost invisible, since the entire front part is occupied by the screen.  Under it you can see the joystick control.  In order to turn on the device, use the button on the top end.  The key, which is located on the left, is responsible for the action menu.  Thanks to her, you can go back, forward, open a book, close it.  Since the screen is non-touch, you have to remember the old days associated with the use of button devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="32 gb memory card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751098.jpg"></div>

Its dimensions are very small: 17 √ó 11.7 √ó 0.8 cm. The device is made in several colors: black, gray and white are available.  The book is easy to hold with one hand, it also fits in your pocket. </p><p>  The assembly was done well, there are no complaints about it.  A connector for connecting a USB cable and a port for an external drive are located at the bottom.  Many consumers are pleasantly surprised that it is possible to work with a memory card. </p><p>  The device operates on a processor whose clock frequency is 1 Hz.  There is not much RAM (512 MB), but it is enough for fast flipping.  Slight braking is noticeable when opening a book, menu.  Consumers do not complain about this, arguing their position by the fact that the main thing in such a device is instant page turning.  Built-in memory is 8 GB.  The space can be increased by using an external drive.  A 32 GB memory card will allow you to work with a large volume of books. </p><p>  Opens over 12 popular text files.  As well as 3-4 image formats.  To open the "PDF" file, you do not have to install any additional software, as it already exists.  Display is fast;  TXT format opens instantly. </p><p>  The e-book works on Android 4.2.  Unfortunately, if you want to change any software, you can use the ability to download installation files directly to the device‚Äôs memory.  The manufacturer did not provide for an integrated store. </p><p>  The device is preinstalled with a standard program for reading books, which is more than logical.  There is a menu "Gallery", a couple of dictionaries and a calculator.  All settings are standard for the operating system, there is nothing new or distinctive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onyx boox amundsen e-book" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751099.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The manufacturer got rid of additional layers of the display when creating Onyx Boox Amundsen.  Reviews about this nuance are positive.  What did it affect?  The perception of pages and contrast has changed for the better, the substrate has become even whiter.  However, many buyers almost do not notice the difference.  The diagonal is 6 inches.  Resolution: 768 √ó 1024 px.  It is convenient to read, eyes do not get tired.  During the process it is easy to quickly increase the font or reduce it.  If you press the joystick, you can call up an additional menu.  It contains options for translator, text selection, transition to any of the pages of the book, choice of display mode, display rotation and auto-scrolling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onyx boox amundsen case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751101.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The book contains a battery with a capacity of 1700 mAh.  The manufacturer promises that the device will have to be charged no more than once a month.  This figure can be considered quite real, since there is no backlight and wireless network. </p><h2>  Positive customer reviews </h2><p>  What do buyers attribute to the positive side?  TXT and PDF formats open as quickly as possible, which facilitates interaction with the device.  The build quality and materials used, low cost, high speed of operation are noticed by all owners.  In addition, there is an easy to use and interesting interface.  The appearance is modest, but it attracts buyers who love minimalism.  Long battery life, the impressive size of the built-in storage and a 32 GB memory card will only improve the experience of interacting with the device.  Positive comments and deserved navigation.  In general, none of the buyers regretted purchasing the device. </p><h2>  Negative customer reviews </h2><p>  Either negative reviews are not written about this model, or they complain about the lack of backlight, wireless module, and other "goodies."  This nuance can be called a distinctive feature of the Onyx Boox Amundsen model.  Reviews sometimes come across too controversial. </p><p>  However, there is no need to talk about the objectivity of such negative comments.  The manufacturer immediately focused on the cheapness of this model due to the rejection of functions that are already familiar to customers.  This does not affect the performance of the main tasks assigned to the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onyx boox amundsen review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1751102.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  If you purchase the Onyx Boox Amundsen book, a review of which is presented in the article, at retail, then you will have to pay no more than 10 thousand rubles for it.  On the Internet, prices are radically different.  This e-book is suitable for those who need a budget device with a minimum set of functions.  If suddenly some format does not open, you can always download an additional program.  The fact that the manufacturer has installed the Android operating system determines the presence of specific advantages.  The device itself has two main advantages: a good and high-quality screen and stable software.  Using this e-book is quick and easy. </p>
