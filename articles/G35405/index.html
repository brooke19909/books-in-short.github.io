After all, they are all very different from each other.  Faces are very simple.  But sometimes on the path of life there is a person from whom it is difficult to take his eyes off. </p><p>  When examining young people, you can see traces of a certain naivety and childish enthusiasm on them.  Representatives of the middle generation show signs of self-confidence or, on the contrary, the prints of a failed life.  But what can be seen on older persons?  They reflect the traces of past defeats and victories, as well as a whole series of long-term human emotions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.physiognomics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="woman with a slight smile" class="if uuid-2394055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/2394055.jpg"></div><h2>  Unusual science </h2><p>  Looking at faces, you can say a lot about people.  After all, their features are always available and an extensive source for obtaining information.  Humanity has even created a separate science about the face - physiognomy.  People who own her skills can tell a lot about a person.  In principle, it is not so difficult.  You just need to compare the information obtained by looking at the person with the existing knowledge.  For someone who has successfully mastered this science, many of those character traits that will appear in the interlocutor during the dialogue will not come as a surprise.  After all, most often his face will tell about it in advance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is physiognomy?  The science of the face, which allows one to determine the qualities and properties of a person by his features, as well as by body shapes.  Translated from the Greek word "physio" means "natural inclinations" or "nature".  The second part of the concept is ‚Äúgnome‚Äù - ‚Äúinsightful‚Äù or ‚Äúknowledgeable‚Äù.  With the help of this art, facial features recognize not only the character of a person, but also his fate. </p><p>  Depending on the profession, physiognomy of the face must be known to some specialists.  This will help them competently fulfill their duties and achieve the highest levels of skill in their business.  Such professions include doctors and lawyers, researchers and lawyers, writers, psychologists, artists, as well as managers engaged in the selection of personnel. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The origins of the physiognomy of the face as a science are rooted in the distant past.  The knowledge gained, similar to the healer secrets, was passed from generation to generation, passing from father to son, from teacher to student.  At the same time, they were preserved in legends and traditions. </p><p>  A little later, similar art arose in the East.  So the Chinese physiognomy of the face appeared.  The healers of ancient civilization classified some concepts of this direction and gave it a systematic look, which gave the right to call it a doctrine.  Moreover, the physiognomy of the face included not only knowledge about its main features, which is taking place at the present time.  She also considered the figure of a man, his gestures and facial expressions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, Western knowledge was different from the Chinese physiognomy of the face.  Over time, the healers of the Middle Kingdom further developed this art.  They have created special treatises that have spread throughout the countries of the East.  They were also brought to Japan.  Of course, it is impossible to say that all the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun are fond of physiognomy of the face.  After all, this is far from the case.  However, the influence of this science is clearly visible in Japanese painting and in the theater, as well as in the production of masks.  It is used in various fields of communication. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yabai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="masks in the store" class="if uuid-2389222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389222.jpg"></div><p>  Those who are interested in this issue are encouraged to read Theodor Schwartz‚Äôs book ‚ÄúReading Faces.‚Äù  Physiognomy".  In it, the author reveals to his reader secrets that hide human faces, and teaches to evaluate the interlocutor even before the conversation begins, and also to determine the temperament and character from the photograph. </p><h2>  Japanese technique </h2><p>  Are physiognomy of the face and character of a person connected?  Japanese researchers are convinced that yes.  And before starting to study facial features, they suggest conditionally dividing it with two horizontal lines.  This will form three zones.  Physiognomy of the face pays considerable attention to the upper of them - the frontal part.  According to it, the researcher can determine the path of life that a person has traveled.  The upper zone serves to obtain information about a person for a period from 15 to 30 years.  If the forehead is perfect, that is, it has the correct shape and healthy color of the skin, then it can be argued about the excellent state of mind and body of the interlocutor. </p><p>  The middle zone starts from the eyebrows and ends with the tip of the nose.  On it you can get information about the life period from 35 to 50 years.  If this site is harmoniously balanced, then it can be argued about the ordering of the psyche of the interlocutor. </p><p>  The lower zone covers the upper lip and jaw, mouth, and chin.  On it you can get information about that period of life, which is in the interval from 51-77 years, as well as about advanced age.  With the correct forms of this zone, experts talk about the balance of character. </p><h2>  Decryption of the received information </h2><p>  <span>How to read a person</span> in the face?  Physiognomy as the art of determining the character traits of the interlocutor is represented by several schools.  Each of them has its own system of positions.  They can be from 99 to 130. To interpret the content of all these positions, and especially their combinations, is a rather complicated procedure.  Anyone who wants to penetrate the secrets of the face using the method of physiognomy, to draw conclusions about the nature of a person, as well as about the quality of a person, has to carefully examine each of these positions. </p><p>  From the book of Theodor Schwartz ‚ÄúWe read faces.  Physiognomy ‚Äù, the reader learns that in addition to examining the three zones on the face, one can also obtain information on the state of the five basic life traits.  Among them are eyebrows and eyes, nose and mouth, as well as ears.  Only after this, while taking into account the shape of the chin and jaws, the features of the facial bones and the general configuration of the face, it will be possible to draw certain conclusions. </p><p>  Consider the basic life features of a person‚Äôs face and the information that they can give about his character. </p><h2>  Eyebrows </h2><p>  How to read a person in the face?  Physiognomy in determining the nature of a person pays great attention to eyebrows.  They are ideal when they are long and wide. </p><p>  Given the proportionality of indicators such as density, shape and color of eyebrows, we can talk about the balance of character, mind and emotions of the interlocutor.  The opposite conclusion can be made with their bristles.  In this case, they talk about obstinacy, stubbornness and uncompromising man. </p><p>  When physiognomy of a person‚Äôs face is used to determine his character, she examines the eyebrows to understand the relationship of the individual with his immediate environment.  If their shape is visually pleasing, then this suggests that a person gets along well with others. </p><p>  There are other examples in physiognomy of the face to determine the characteristics of a person by eyebrow.  If they are thick and at the same time rise sharply upward with their outer ends, then this serves as a clear sign of courage and generosity.  Such a person is simply born for success. </p><p>  If the external tips of the eyebrows fall down, then a person familiar with the physiognomy of the face (see photo below) will conclude that his interlocutor is shy.  Well, if such eyebrows at the same time have such a structure and color that they seem lifeless?  Such a sign will clearly indicate a person‚Äôs exhaustion of internal energy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quickquickslow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shy girl" class="if uuid-2389274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389274.jpg"></div><p>  If your interlocutor is a man and his eyebrows are long, even, and also located on the face with a pleasant skin color, then he can be considered an intellectual.  A woman with such signs is mistaken for a yoke.  Any, even the most unpredictable antics should be expected from her. </p><p>  According to the science of physiognomy, short eyebrows testify to the absurd nature of man.  Bristly and thick will necessarily belong to a person with a "devilish" nature.  And there are vivid examples of this in the physiognomy of the face.  Photo by Sergey Kapitsa is known to many.  This is a brilliant man who had an uncompromising and unshakable character.  And this is indicated by his stiff and <span>wide eyebrows.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="econet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Kapitsa" class="if uuid-2389227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389227.jpg"></div><p>  What else can physiognomy suggest to us?  Connecting heavy eyebrows indicate a desire for dominance.  If they are located on the woman‚Äôs face, then it should be borne in mind that she has a strong character.  Because of this, she will not be able to play the traditional role of a housewife. </p><p>  The nature of a person by physiognomy of the face is determined by the location of the eyebrows.  If they are high, then they are a sign of determination.  If low, then they say the opposite. </p><h2>  Eyes </h2><p>  How can a person‚Äôs character and state of health be determined using physiognomy of a person?  For this, ancient science receives information from the eyes of the interlocutor, which from ancient times people have considered "a mirror of the soul."  It is in them that the state of a person and his experiences are most reflected.  In this regard, in most books that describe the physiognomy of the face, the eyes are called precisely that vital feature with which the whole analysis of the character of the interlocutor begins.  The most complete information can be obtained about those people who are a little over forty years old.  The fact is that, at the indicated age, personality traits are considered stable and change extremely rarely. </p><p>  Anyone who tries to give a classification of the eyes on the move, comes to mind their size.  And she really has a special meaning.  The large eyes of the interlocutor are always associated with a desire for leadership, with courage and with a sensitive soul.  Of the shortcomings of such people can be identified inconstancy.  They are very often the center of attention and get used to it, receiving numerous compliments from fans and admirers.  Such people are unlikely to be attracted to the ongoing relationship and routine of family life.  However, in this case, much still depends on the partner.  He needs to give his half a fairy tale, which should last a lifetime.  According to physiognomy, owners of large eyes become wonderful parents. </p><p>  If their cut is small, then in front of you is a stubborn and closed person.  He is also constant and consistent in literally everything.  One of the biggest disadvantages of such people is their jealousy.  This feeling manifests itself in them both to friends, and to business partners, and to loved ones, and to lovers.  The reason for this, most likely, is a sense of ownership.  And here also there are some striking examples in the physiognomy of the face.  The photo of the American actor and martial artist Stephen Seagal clearly tells us about his small cut of eyes.  In life, the actor is not sociable.  Moreover, in relations with women, he is known as a jealous man and an owner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pajiba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Steven seagal" class="if uuid-2389238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389238.jpg"></div><p>  If the eyes are small and at the same time dark, then they, without a doubt, belong to impressionable and inquisitive people.  Do not confuse them with sunken.  In this case, they will indicate an envious and irritable person.  <span>Squinted eyes</span> also tell a lot about their master.  They talk about his great insight, distrust of others and cunning. </p><p>  Eyes of medium size, not distinguished by a round shape, and even with "crow's feet" near the outer edge, indicate a sound mind and mind.  Such a person is also distinguished by discernment. </p><p>  The natures of refined and refined eyes have an elongated shape.  And if they are large ("cowhide"), then they are a sign of spiritual and bodily weakness.  The same, only deeply sunken eyes indicate weakness of the body. </p><p>  The light blue color of the iris is possessed by a gifted person who has a <span>solid character.</span>  This is indicated by large eyes.  In addition, their owner has an adamant and sensitive soul. </p><p>  Big dark or brown eyes belong to the sensible, loyal and intelligent.  The bright iris speaks of the mind of his master and his timidity. </p><p>  The planting of eyes tells a lot about physiognomy.  If both of them are located on a conventionally drawn horizontal line, then this sign is considered very good.  Male eyes slightly slanted downward indicate decisiveness, while female eyes indicate imprudence and unpredictable actions. </p><p>  A slightly lowered upper eyelid is an indicator of a person's maturity.  It, omitted strongly, in men indicates the depletion of vital energy.  In women, this symptom indicates physiological abnormalities in the body. </p><p>  A slightly swollen lower eyelid gives out the stormy life of its owner and his uncontrolled vicious hobbies. </p><p>  With a wide iris, we can talk about the pleasantness and tranquility of a person.  With a narrow one - about the imbalance of his internal processes, which negatively affects the relationship with people around him. </p><p>  The color of the iris gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe available vitality or their absence.  So, green, brown and black eyes are energetic in people, gray and blue - in sensitive ones.  In shy ones they are light brown. </p><p>  In the Japanese methodology of physiognomy, almost forty types of eyes are distinguished.  Moreover, their classification was made by analogy with animals.  A person whose eyes are similar to the eyes of any beast is credited with the character traits and behavior of his ‚Äúwild relative‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frau-wulf.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="face of a lion" class="if uuid-2389250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389250.jpg"></div><p>  Let's look at a few examples.  So, the eyes of a lion are those that have a large incision and folds on the eyelids.  They, without a doubt, belong to a person who is the undisputed leader.  If the eyes are elongated, and even covered with double eyelids, then there is an association with an elephant.  A similar facial feature most likely belongs to an overweight person whose character is calm.  Eyes are round and have a yellow shine associated with a tiger.  They belong to the brave and courageous.  The wide iris of the eyes resembles a wolf.  And in this case, traits corresponding to this animal are attributed to their owner.  And this is not a complete list of eye types, which is taken into account in Japanese physiognomy. </p><h2>  Nose </h2><p>  This part of the face is also a vivid indicator of the nature of a person.  The nose in the physiognomy of the face, like the eyes, can tell a lot about its owner who has reached the age of 40. </p><p>  Its shape is considered ideal with a rounded tip and decorated wings.  Too big nostrils speak about personality defects of a person. </p><p>  The science of physiognomy does not at all believe that a long nose indicates the curiosity of its owner.  As a rule, it is peculiar to conservatives.  Too long a nose talks about the capricious nature of a genius.  That is, the length of this part of the face most of all indicates a person‚Äôs attitude to life. </p><p>  The owner of a short nose has an open and soft character.  At the same time, he is sociable. </p><p>  What can be said about the owner of a bony nose with a high inflection or with a small hump?  This man is proud, stubborn, but at the same time decisive and even aggressive.  But in general, in physiognomy, the hump is considered a sign of melancholy, frowning, and sadness.  The more it is expressed, the more clearly these qualities are manifested.  At the same time, such people can always find something positive and funny even where, it would seem, there is no reason for fun. </p><p>  A narrow nose usually indicates a workaholic.  These are people who are used to achieving their goals through hard and long work. </p><p>  By the way, in physiognomy, the shape of the nose has different meanings, depending on whether it belongs to a man or a woman.  So, among the representatives of the weak half of humanity, its small size indicates the presence of morbid jealousy.  Small noses in men indicate their narrow circle of interests and that they prefer to take care only of themselves. </p><p>  It is recommended that you take a closer look at those people whose nose wings balance its large and flat back.  One should not follow their flattery and multiple promises.  After all, these are natures cold and prudent. </p><p>  A nose ending in a round tip indicates good character traits of its owner.  It is believed that such people are lucky in life.  However, they are not waiting for her to come lying on the couch.  On the contrary, such people work hard and hard, striving for the heights of success.  In general, they can be spoken of as prosperous personalities. </p><p>  Similar characteristics are possessed by those people whose tip of the nose is large and convex.  It testifies to their readiness for self-sacrifice, warmth and kindness. </p><h2>  Lips </h2><p>  Just like the eyes, a person‚Äôs mouth is considered one of the most attractive parts of his face.  No wonder fashionistas have been striving for more than one millennium to emphasize the beauty of their lips with cosmetics. </p><p>  Analyzes this area and physiognomy of the face.  She considers lips in combination with other characteristics, which allows us to give a complete picture of the personality.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They talk about the nature of a person, his isolation or openness, as well as aspirations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of all the facial features in physiognomy, an analysis of the shape of the lips indicates a person‚Äôs self-esteem and his worldview.</font></font></p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="different lips" class="if uuid-2389256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389256.jpg"></div><p> First of all, it is recommended to pay attention to the size of the mouth, which is compared with other facial features.  This will indicate a person‚Äôs attitude to life.  The larger the mouth, the more active is the person‚Äôs position.  And this applies primarily to career and home.  People with full big lips are aimed at professional growth.  However, here it is necessary that desire coincides with possibilities.  Sometimes the owners of small mouths overtake them in career growth, but at the same time, the latter always have first place in the family and home. </p><p>  Owners of lips of the same fullness, closing at one point, as a rule, are charming and pleasant.  They are responsible, efficient, successful and respected among relatives and colleagues. </p><p>  The small mouth of a person speaks of a lack of vital energy, and also indicates inner loneliness.  Outwardly, such people look prosperous.  They have a family, career growth, etc.  However, internally, they constantly live in their fictional world.  These moments are noticeable to others, taking them for pride.  As a result, they cease to communicate with such a person. </p><p>  Big mouth is a sign of craving for publicity and self-confidence.  People with such lips are used to getting everything they want from life, more quickly and more.  However, they are not able to evaluate their own capabilities and strengths, constantly wasting themselves on trifles.  Negative qualities of such people include nonchalance and temper.  However, they do not get bored, which is the secret of their attractiveness. </p><h2>  Face shape </h2><p>  She is the first to catch the eye when looking at any person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stylegods.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="different face shapes" class="if uuid-2389254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2389254.jpg"></div><p>  The face shape in physiognomy is divided into several types.  Let's consider them in more detail: </p><ol><li>  Oblong.  This face resembles a rectangle in shape.  The width of his forehead and chin is approximately the same.  This type of person is considered aristocratic.  One can say about such a person that he is smart, prudent, has great prudence and sensitivity.  In addition, the holder of an elongated face is purposeful.  He, without any doubt, has the talent of a wonderful organizer. </li><li>  Triangular.  The owner of such a face has a wide and high forehead, a thin nose, protruding cheekbones, a small chin and deep-set eyes.  This man is not caring and cunning.  It is impossible to discover such qualities as attachment and devotion in him.  It is believed that a person with a <span>triangular face is</span> often a traitor or a spy. </li><li>  Trapezoidal.  In its configuration, this type of face is similar to triangular.  It is characterized by a narrowed chin and a wide forehead.  According to physiognomists, such people are artistic, sensitive and intelligent.  Women are overwhelmed with optimism.  They live long, happy, able to create comfort. </li><li>  Square.  A person with such a face is considered courageous, severe and decisive.  Moreover, sometimes he shows the features of heartlessness.  Such people perceive new information with difficulty, and after a long time they ‚Äúdigest‚Äù it. </li><li>  Round.  This type of person indicates the good nature, peacefulness and gentleness of his master.  These people prefer to live in comfort and love a good company.  Because of their determination and often loves physiognomists consider chubby good leaders. </li></ol><h2>  Forehead shape </h2><p>  This detail is also important for determining the character of a person.  If we mentally draw two rays from the bridge of the nose towards the edges of the forehead, then, closing them with a straight line, we get a triangle.  With a large width of the top of this figure, such a person puts the interests of the cause above domestic ones.  He is a faithful friend, always ready to give a helping hand.  The narrow base of the triangle indicates the independence of the character of the owner of such a forehead.  He is lifeless in the family and conflicted in the team. </p>
