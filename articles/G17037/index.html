Usually needlewomen are attracted by the manufacture of jewelry.  Indeed, in this case, the creations created with their own hands can be demonstrated to the whole world, and at the same time they can also decorate themselves.  How to make a polymer clay bracelet, read below. </p><h2>  Sunflowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet sunflowers" class="if uuid-2448526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448526.jpg"></div><p>  To create the jewelry you will need to choose the right base.  If you wish, you can make even circles from polymer clay.  But if you don‚Äôt want to complicate your life, get blanks in a needlework store. </p><p>  How to transform them into a bracelet?  Of polymer clay will need to make a decor.  You can start by making flower petals.  Roll a lot of miniature yellow balls, then flatten them in your fingers and give each workpiece a drop-shaped shape.  In order for the flower to look more expressive in the future, each petal will need to be bent. </p><p>  When this stage of work is completed, proceed to create the leaflets.  They are made by analogy with the petals, but there is no need to bend here. </p><p>  How to fix blanks?  Based on the need to create a sketch with a pencil.  Glue the rhinestone in the center of the sunflower.  Using a hot gun, glue over the shiny pebble with petals.  Draw stems with acrylic and stick leaves on them.  It is advisable to make a bracelet of five decorated circles, but you can do with three.  Connect parts to each other using a chain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Marine bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marine bracelet" class="if uuid-2448538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448538.jpg"></div><p>  For the manufacture of such jewelry you will need a rigid base.  You can take a blank made of leather or wood.  How to make a polymer clay bracelet?  Degrease the workpiece and draw a sketch on it.  These can be images of waves, starfish, shells, fish and pearls.  Now knead in your hands the plastic of a suitable color.  You need to start with the complex and gradually move on to the simple.  We make shells.  We roll the tourniquet, and then twist it into a snail.  We attach a relief to each turn, and the last layer needs to be flattened strongly.  Do not forget to make the shell a florid edge. </p><p>  We make waves.  They also need to be formed from harnesses.  Take a few shades of plastic, similar in tone, and stretch between the colors.  Then roll out the tourniquet.  Cut out from it that part in which there is a smooth transition.  Twist one end of the wave into the snail.  In this way, you need to create all the waves.  Make them of different diameters and lengths, so the bracelet will look more interesting.  White balls rolled from polymer clay or plastic beads will help to complement the decoration. </p><h2>  Harness bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="harness bracelet" class="if uuid-2448545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448545.jpg"></div><p>  There is nothing complicated in making this polymer clay bracelet.  Take the white plastic and roll a long tourniquet out of it.  From paper you need to cut the workpiece.  Decide on the width of the decoration and cut a strip of the desired length.  Now take the tourniquet and begin to lay it on the stencil.  Create fancy zigzags, twist the strip.  But watch that all turns of the tow are smooth.  You should not make large holes between the curled elements, otherwise a feeling of openwork will not be created. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the jewelry is ready, send it to the oven for 5 minutes, then take it out, bend the bracelet so that it takes the shape of a hand, and send it to bake on.  When the product is ready and slightly cooled, it can be toned.  For this purpose, pastel should be used.  Crumble the crayon and rub it into the plastic using a sponge.  To fix the material, use clear varnish. </p><h2>  Birds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kylieparrystudios.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet made of birds" class="if uuid-2448548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448548.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a polymer clay bracelet?  You can make beautiful birds.  They are made very simple.  To make your jewelry look more interesting, you will need to prepare the plastic.  Take two close shades and crush them.  The result should be a mass with divorces.  Do not achieve a uniform result. </p><p>  Birds are made according to this scheme.  A ball rolls, then a strip-tail is drawn from it on one side, and a head is formed on the other.  If there is not enough material on your head, you can add a little.  The beak also extends, and does not stick.  You need to pierce the bird in the middle, making a hole in the stomach and in the back.  Make birds of one size, but different shades.  After firing, it will be necessary to coat the workpieces with varnish and string them on a rope. </p><h2>  Simple bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.atelierlucy.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple bracelet" class="if uuid-2448553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448553.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself bracelets made of polymer clay can make even a child.  You just need to find the right technique.  Take any <span>base for the bracelet.</span>  It is advisable to use wooden, as it is light.  Select a material in one color scheme.  For example, brown, orange, black and white.  Roll thin flagella from plastic.  There should be a lot of blanks.  Using a hot gun, distribute the charred harnesses around the perimeter of the base.  Colors need to be alternated so that the effect of sector breaking is not obtained.  If desired, the product can be varnished. </p><h2>  Bead Bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="balloons with flowers" class="if uuid-2448589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2448589.jpg"></div><p>  Want to create a feminine jewelry?  A photo of the master class of a polymer clay bracelet is presented above.  How to make a decoration?  To create it, you need pink and white plastic.  And also you will need to use something as a basis.  You can take large plastic beads for this purpose.  Let's start making a polymer clay bracelet. </p><p>  The master class will be like this.  Roll out the pink layer and create a lot of small circles using the cap from the handle.  Using an orange stick, you need to bend the workpiece and place it on a plastic base.  Add a flower from five petals.  We decorate the center with a white circle, in the middle of which you need to make a recess.  By analogy, we decorate all the beads.  Flowers should fit tightly so that the base is not visible.  Bake the workpieces, and then assemble them on a string. </p>
