  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A good media player for Android: rating, review, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year the screen sizes of mobile gadgets are increasing.  Now on modern smartphones you can comfortably watch not only photos, but also feature films.  Such structural qualities may not have the best effect on ergonomics, but on long journeys the large screen will be clearly in place. </p><p>  However, some users have certain problems viewing the content.  The fact is that each audio and video format requires specific codecs.  They decode the video.  The Android platform, or rather the specific firmware, has its own specific set of similar codecs that a regular media player has. </p><p>  But not all standard utilities for watching videos and listening to audio have the right tools for playback.  In addition, most players embedded in the platform cannot boast of sensible and flexible functionality.  Therefore, many have to install a good media player for Android separately. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning the owners of set-top boxes running this platform.  Here we see similar problems faced by users of smartphones and tablets.  These are meager features of regular software.  Many users study forums and ratings of media players for TV on Android in search of the best option for their requests. </p><p>  But in this case, third-party applications do not always meet all the requirements.  We will try to deal with this problem in our article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="innov8tiv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good media player for Android" class="if uuid-3078080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078080.jpg"></div><h2>  The best media players </h2><p>  We present to your attention the rating of media players for Android.  It included the most popular products, distinguished by stable operation, efficiency, as well as a large number of positive feedback from users.  All software described below can be found on Google Play, so there should be no problems with testing. </p><p>  Media Player Rating for Android: </p><ol><li>  MX Player </li><li>  VLC for Android. </li><li>  KMPlayer. </li><li>  HD video player. </li><li>  BSPlayer. </li><li>  Plex. </li></ol><p>  Consider each program in more detail. </p><h2>  MX player </h2><p>  Many owners of mobile gadgets when asked which media player is better for Android will immediately say that it is an MX Player.  And they will be right.  The application is really recognized as the best among ordinary users and among the most advanced.  As you know, the latter are very picky about choosing such programs.  Media Player for Android MX Player has almost 7 million downloads.  This is a great indicator. </p><p>  The utility is installed in the standard mode for the platform, so there should not be any difficulties.  After installation, the program will immediately offer to download specific codecs that your processor and related system applications can work with.  The media player for Android supports multi-core video decoding, which can significantly increase the performance of the stream.  When playing content in 4K resolution, this feature will clearly benefit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of MX Player software </h2><p>  This media player for Android is in Russian, so it‚Äôs easy to deal with menus and tools.  The application interface can not be called confusing or complex.  It is also worth noting that many use this media player for Android in TV set-top boxes, where simplicity and intuitive controls are extremely welcome. </p><p>  Most popular commands are executed using gestures.  For example, you can rewind a video with a horizontal swipe, and with a vertical one, increase or decrease the volume.  The application in full volume supports external subtitles, video streaming, as well as stepwise scaling of the picture. </p><p>  This good media player for Android is distributed free of charge, but advertising is sewn into it.  It occasionally occurs during video playback.  You can remove it by touching the banner with your finger.  Users respond very positively about the player and its capabilities.  Many do not pay attention to advertising, content with chic functionality and seamless playback of content. </p><h2>  VLC for Android </h2><p>  Consider a media player taking the second position in the ranking.  VLC media player for Android is a proprietary development from the creators of the product of the same name for personal computers.  The desktop solution showed itself from the most positive side.  The same can be said of the mobile version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videolan.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Media Player for Android TV" class="if uuid-3078076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078076.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, this is a very effective and generally good media player for Android.  On Google Play, the program was downloaded over 1 million times, which is very impressive.  The player allows you to play both audio and video content.  Hardware decoding is also present. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The application interface is simple and intuitive.  All the main tools are located on the main screen, so you don‚Äôt have to wander around the menu. </p><h2>  Features of VLC for Android software </h2><p>  The player also supports the usual swipe - horizontal, vertical and zoom.  Using the sensor, you can scroll the video back and forth, adjust the volume and adjust the display mode.  There is support for external subtitles, there is a separate pretty widget on the desktop for audio content. </p><p>  This simple, understandable and generally good media player for Android is distributed under a free license.  There is practically no advertising here, only sometimes banners pop up indicating other developer products. </p><h2>  Kmplayer </h2><p>  He takes the third line in the ranking.  As in the case of VLC, this is a version ported from desktops to mobile platforms.  The program received a recognizable design, which is similar to similar ones available on a personal computer, as well as extensive functionality.  Judging by the reviews, many users are happy with it.  The application has been installed by more than 300 thousand people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myappsforpc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Media player for TV on Android rating" class="if uuid-3078075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078075.jpg"></div><p>  The media player supports all known formats, including such exotic ones as SRT, SUB, RT and SSA.  The utility is also able to play streaming video.  You can watch the video right while downloading from the Internet. </p><p>  The program supports all popular swipes - horizontal, vertical and scaling.  You can easily rewind the video, add sound or set a comfortable resolution using the sensor.  It is also possible to change the screen orientation without regard to the position of the mobile gadget. </p><h2>  KMPlayer software features </h2><p>  Those who previously used the player of the same name on a personal computer do not experience any problems after switching to the mobile version.  Other users, judging by the reviews, sometimes run into some difficulties.  The fact is that the location of local tools cannot be called intuitive, as was the case with previous utilities.  You have to get used to the menu.  However, there is nothing complicated there.  Users do not experience discomfort after an hour of work. </p><p>  The application is free, but the developer added his own ad code to it.  Pop-up banners cannot be called aggressive.  In addition, they talk about other products of this group: players for virtual reality and professional versions.  The latter comes with more extensive functionality and is completely spared from ad units. </p><h2>  HD video player </h2><p>  By its appearance, the application is very similar to a simple full-time media player for Android.  Many people love the classics and prefer it instead of catchy and sophisticated programs, the design of which sometimes distracts from viewing video content.  In addition, extra chips consume memory, and this is not the best option for owners of budget gadgets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apk-dl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Applications for the Android media player" class="if uuid-3078081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078081.jpg"></div><p>  Here we have a simple player without any serious functional difficulties.  But the clear advantage of this application over full-time counterparts is a rich set of codecs.  If a standard player plays video from case to case, then HD Video Player copes with almost all formats. </p><p>  As for the entry threshold, it is practically absent here.  It is simply impossible to get confused in the application interface.  The entire toolkit (there are not very many) is brought to the main screen and is accessible by the first click. </p><h2>  Features of software HD Video Player </h2><p>  After the first launch, the program automatically scans the drives for video content and carefully sorts it in the library.  Filters can be customized as desired: author, date, size, etc.  During viewing, you can change the volume and scroll through the video using a swipe.  It is also possible to adjust the brightness of the screen specifically for the player. </p><p>  Alas, the streaming video program does not play, and it works mediocre with captions: it does not always see the text, sometimes refuses to perceive it.  Judging by the reviews, users liked this player.  Mostly it is valued for its ‚Äúlightness‚Äù.  Therefore, the application is widely in demand among owners of old and inexpensive mobile gadgets.  According to Google Play statistics, about 300 thousand users installed the program. </p><p>  The product is distributed free of charge, there is no advertising in it.  Some users in their reviews mention the presence of banners, but others claim that they do not notice anything like this. </p><h2>  Bsplayer </h2><p>  The program is also ported from a personal computer to mobile platforms.  The PC version has chic functionality, but the analogue for Android received truncated tools.  But it is enough to solve the tasks posed by ordinary users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appvn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic media player for Android" class="if uuid-3078082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078082.jpg"></div><p>  The application has an impressive list of codecs and plays all popular formats, including SRT, SUB, RT and SSA.  Properly using processor power and RAM, the program quietly works with content in 4K resolution.  Judging by user reviews, they do not notice any friezes and other freezes. </p><p>  Also worth noting is a very convenient library.  After installing the player and subsequent launch, the program scans all available drives and organizes the files according to the user filter.  Thanks to the competent layout, the desired video can be found in seconds. </p><p>  Users in their reviews note that working with the player is a pleasure.  The interface looks extremely attractive, understandable and does not cause unnecessary questions.  In addition, some menu items can be customized (change location, color, design).  In terms of customization, the player is quite flexible.  You can control playback not only with buttons, but also with gestures. </p><h2>  Software Features BSPlayer </h2><p>  The application is capable of performing stream distribution over wireless protocols.  That is, you can transfer watched video over Wi-Fi to other devices, including desktop ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Media Player for Android in Russian" class="if uuid-3078077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078077.jpg"></div><p>  As a small drawback, you can name the system requirements of the utility.  Judging by user reviews, on ultra-budget smartphones and tablets, the player is terribly slow.  Therefore, in this case, you will have to look for other, more ‚Äúlighter‚Äù options. </p><p>  The product comes with a free distribution license, so sometimes an ad pops up while watching a video.  But these banners can not be called aggressive, because they appear rarely and are easily cleaned. </p><h2>  Plex </h2><p>  This media player is an excellent option for budget and weak mobile gadgets, where every byte on the hard disk and a small amount of RAM are counted.  The application works on the principle of streaming.  That is, using a media server on a desktop device, you can view video on a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgetsngaming.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Programs for the media player on Android" class="if uuid-3078078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3078078.jpg"></div><p>  The program is especially in demand on TV set-top boxes, where there is always not enough free space.  For the application to work, you must install the utility of the same name on a personal computer, and then enable synchronization with a mobile device.  Files played on a PC will be broadcast on a smartphone, tablet or set-top box.  Synchronization can be configured both wirelessly and through a USB connection. </p><h2>  Plex software features </h2><p>  All files that can be played are in the library.  It has many filters where you can arrange content in different ways.  The interface of the application itself can not be called complex or incomprehensible.  All the main tools are located on the main screen, and you can control them using gestures: scroll through the clips, adjust the sound and change the resolution. </p><p>  The product is free, so sometimes ads pop up.  She, judging by the user reviews, is not very intrusive.  You can disable it by purchasing a license for the professional version. </p><p>  We reviewed the six most popular media players for Android and told us what users think of their functionality. </p>
