Once burnt in milk, they will continue to blow into the water.  And there is nothing reprehensible in this.  Simply providing interest-based financial resources is based on three principles: urgency, payment and - most importantly - repayment.  If at least one of the conditions is not met, then losses may occur.  Who will like it? <br><br>  Until October 2008, few people were interested in <span>which banks did not check their credit history.</span>  Why?  Because most of them did not.  Money was distributed right and left.  Moreover, the possibility that they will not return back was not very scary to creditors.  But I must say that cases of fraud have occurred quite often.  The serious losses that lenders began to bear, forced the latter to slightly change their strategy. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="banks not checking credit history" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/76110.jpg" width="600"></div>  Today, answering the question of which banks do not check their credit history is not so simple.  Because most of them strive to do it all the same.  Why are they “striving”?  Because without the written permission of the borrower this cannot be done.  It is clear that if he refuses all kinds of checks, then the opinion on the part of the bank will develop accordingly.  Up to failure. <br><br>  Currently, banks that do not check credit history are those whose activities are based on the provision of express loans.  Since everything about everything takes from twenty minutes to an hour, then there is no time for an assessment of solvency.  True, the safety net has not disappeared: the percentage in such programs is twice or even three times higher than in classic ones. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fix credit history" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/76109.jpg" width="280"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fix all</strong> <br><br>  Unfortunately, we all make mistakes.  In some cases, nothing can be returned.  But, for example, you can fix your credit history.  Suppose you didn’t manage to make a monthly payment on time a couple of times.  The usual situation: in the department where you usually did this, turned off the light.  Or the payment through another financial institution went not three days, but five.  In this case, several consumer loans will help, taken and paid on time.  Just pay attention, early repayment of obligations will not positively affect your “karma”. <br><br>  You can also not look for which banks do not check your credit history, but simply make a deposit where the conditions for issuing a mortgage, for example, seem most interesting to you.  What is the connection between these moments?  The fact is that monthly replenishment of your account is an excellent signal for a potential lender.  You drop money into your account for a couple of months and ... you are transferred to the category of disciplined clients.  Easy, right?  Moreover, now you can freely apply for a loan of interest to you.  The likelihood that you will not be denied is high enough.  Of course, we are talking about a request to the banking institution where <span>the deposit</span> was <span>opened.</span>
