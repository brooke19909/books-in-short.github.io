To do this, it is enough to take a loan and pay small amounts on a monthly basis, and the desired has already been purchased, and there is no need to wait long and save money.  There is a logic in these considerations, but before you run and take a loan in the very first bank, where they offer "low interest", it is worth calculating the maximum loan amount.  Then compare the loan offers of various banks and choose the appropriate option. </p><p>  You can start by calculating the maximum amount on the loan calculator that banks offer on their official websites.  They calculate the total loan amount very approximately, but you can focus on it.  At the very least, you can find out the amount that you will count on taking into account your verified income.  On the bank's website you can familiarize yourself with the <span>terms of the loan</span> and current interest rates.  Particular attention should be paid to bank commissions, fines and the need for insurance. </p>

    <p>  If you wondered how to calculate the loan correctly, you will need all this data.  Having taken a certain amount from the bank, you will need to return it with interest.  Interest rates for differentiated cancellation are usually calculated using the following formula: </p><p>  Interest amount = (Debt amount * Annual interest rate) / 100 * 12 </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget to add to this the size of the main debt, as well as all the indicated commissions.  Banks usually impose penalties for late repayment of a loan or repayment with smaller amounts than those indicated in the schedule.  If you are interested in how to calculate a loan, or rather, how much you can request from the bank to the maximum, you can apply the following formula: </p><p>  <strong>SP</strong> <strong>= <strong>P / <strong>(</strong> <strong>t</strong> <strong>+1) *</strong> <strong>annual <span>interest rate on the loan</span> in rubles / <strong>2 * 12 * 100</strong></strong></strong></strong> </p><p>  Where <strong>SP</strong> is the maximum loan amount, P is the borrower's solvency, and t is the loan term in whole months.  Keep in mind that this amount in each bank will change downward depending on the age of the client, length of service, presence of a positive credit history, stability of his income, availability of insurance, dependents, etc.  Customer solvency is calculated using another formula: </p><p>  P = DCH * K * t, where </p><p>  Dh is the average monthly <span>income (net)</span> for 6 months minus all required payments, K is the applicable ratio, and t is the period in months.  Mandatory payments are taxes, alimony and other payments.  For pensioners, a monthly pension is taken as income. </p><p>  For individual entrepreneurs, solvency will be calculated according to a different scheme.  For those who will enter retirement age during the repayment of the loan, solvency will be slightly lower, since the ‚Äúretirement months‚Äù are considered based on the established amount of the minimum pension. </p><p>  <span>An individual approach to each client,</span> in addition to everything else, includes the use of appropriate correction factors in calculating the maximum loan amount. </p><p>  Calculating a loan exactly as they would at a bank is quite difficult.  Therefore, almost all banks strongly recommend visiting a bank inspector and find out all the questions that arise on the spot.  As a rule, even at the first consultation, the loan officer can tell you the real "ceiling" of the loan amount. </p><p>  Before going to the bank, try to soberly assess your capabilities.  Not for nothing that at the very beginning of the article it was proposed to calculate the loan, or rather the amount that will need to be repaid.  Perhaps your desire to get everything at once is not dictated by necessity, but by a simple whim.  To give money is much more difficult than to receive. </p>
