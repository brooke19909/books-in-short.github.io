In roaming, the cost of calls and SMS messages can double or even triple compared to the cost in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe home network.  The only way out of this situation was the invention of the special service ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù.  Several large mobile giants, providing a mobile connection to almost the entire Russian Federation, worked at once to solve this problem.  As a result, an answer was found to the question of how to connect ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù for any of the three major mobile operators - MTS, Beeline and MegaFon. </p>

    <h2>  What is a service? </h2><p>  This option will significantly save money on the balance of your cell phone in the event that you have traveled abroad.  In addition, the service also extends when the client is located within the home network and calls the person outside the home region.  Of particular interest is the answer to the question of how to connect ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù, to those subscribers who regularly fly abroad and maintain communication with foreign partners, being within their region.  It is worth noting that this service is possible for activation regardless of which of the three largest networks the user is a subscriber, but each of them differs in some features specific to it only. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  MTS: features </h2>

    <p>  If you are a subscriber of the Mobile TeleSystems company and decide to activate the Everywhere at Home service, you should be aware of some features related to the network balance.  First of all, it is worth saying that a one-time fee for connecting the option is 30 rubles, which will be removed from the account immediately.  <span>The subscription fee</span> is <span>charged</span> from the subscriber‚Äôs account for each day and amounts to five rubles, and this amount does not depend on whether the user is in the home region or has left Russia.  For many, the conditions offered by the MTS tariff "Everywhere at home" are very beneficial.  Connecting it will not be difficult if you are a subscriber to the network for several months.  The conditions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  The cost of long-distance calls with any operators of the territory of the Russian Federation is 3 rubles per minute. </li><li>  The cost of other options and services does not change, even if your phone is included in MTS roaming.  "Everywhere at home" to connect is not difficult, and regardless of your tariff. </li><li>  If you decide to deactivate the service, no re-payment will be charged. </li></ul><h2>  MTS: how to connect? </h2><p>  If you want to learn about how to connect ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù on your Mobile TeleSystems number, you should consider three possible ways to activate the option: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  dialing a digital combination on your phone * 111 * 3333 # followed by sending a call; </li><li>  use the Internet assistant in your account on the official website; </li><li>  send an SMS message to number 111, which will contain the code 3333 (to remove the service, you should send a message from 03333). </li></ul><h2>  Beeline: features </h2>

    <p>  The main features of the options in this network practically do not differ from similar ones that are present in the MTS network: </p><ul><li>  the cost of the service is 3 rubles per minute, regardless of whether you are in roaming or calling abroad; </li><li>  if you are outside the home region, all incoming calls will be free for you, provided that the Beeline tariff is connected ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù;  how to connect this option will be described in the next section; </li><li>  other services are charged according to the previously established tariff plan. </li></ul><h2>  Beeline: how to connect? </h2><p>  You can get an option on your phone by contacting an operator who will not only answer you a question about how to connect ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù, but will also tell you in detail about all the other features of using this service.  For example, it will warn that a connection is charged a one-time payment of thirty rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect everywhere at home" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13364/429798.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can also try to set up your phone yourself by going to your personal account on the official website, as well as using the command * 111 * 3333 #.

    <h2>  MegaFon: features </h2><p>  Before you learn how to connect ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù on a MegaFon number, it should be noted that in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis mobile connection the service is called somewhat differently - ‚ÄúAll Russia‚Äù, but this does not change the essence.  Moreover, if we talk about the features of the option, they are similar to the two previous networks: a connection costs 30 rubles one-time, and all outgoing calls cost three rubles per minute.  Do not forget about the subscription fee of 5 rubles per day, while if the service was disabled after a day, payment will be charged for an incomplete day in full.  In principle, the cost of the service will vary significantly depending on which branch the MegaFon SIM card was purchased in.  The farther the region is from the capital, the more expensive the option can be, with which you can connect roaming.  You can use MegaFon in Russia ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù at a uniform price, affordable depending on the region. </p><h2>  MegaFon: how to connect? </h2>

Moreover, this tariff was originally created to save money for users who are forced to regularly make calls while roaming or to phones that are outside the home network.  For comparison, we give an example: earlier, any call abroad or from home to home could be at least 9 rubles per minute, so most of the users, upon returning to their home country, went to a big minus on their balance.  The result was an emptied SIM card and complete disappointment in cellular communications as such.  The second half of travelers prefer to deprive themselves of the opportunity to communicate while roaming without making any calls or sending messages.  Thanks to the new service, subscribers of any of the three networks, be it MTS, Beeline or MegaFon, will not have to deprive themselves of the opportunity to communicate with relatives and friends, while being outside their native country.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It is also worth noting the rather low cost of a monthly fee in any of the three networks with the option enabled.  Earlier, the amount of the subscription fee could be 30 rubles a day or more, but now its size has significantly decreased. </p>
