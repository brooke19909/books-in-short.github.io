And now Kemer is considered the largest resort area in the Mediterranean. </p><p>  It is believed that the city got its name because, according to legend, the mythological Chimera lived in its vicinity - a monstrous creature with the head of a lion and the body of a goat. </p><h2>  Kemer Hotels </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After all, not every of our compatriots is able to afford to regularly go to expensive ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  Moreover, tourists, including Russians, always have an irresistible urge to spend their holidays inexpensively, however, in comfort.  In this case, the three-star hotels of Kemer become the optimal choice - a budget vacation option. </p><p>  Therefore, tourists have to choose a long time and with great care, be sure to get acquainted with the reviews left.  Indeed, in comparison with hotels with high ‚Äústar rating‚Äù, the number of rooms in them is worse, and the territory is not large, and food is not always offered ‚Äúvaried‚Äù.  However, before making a choice, you need to understand that you need sun and sea to relax, and it‚Äôs not necessary to take a chic room for a night‚Äôs sleep.  Moreover, for many additional services that guests of four- or five-star hotels sometimes do not even use, you have to unreasonably overpay. </p><p>  With a budget option, you need to pay attention to the location of the hotel.  In addition, many believe that it is more appropriate to choose those hotels, for example, Stone House Hotel Kemer 3 *, which, although there is no animation, but they are located next to those places of the resort where life is in full swing.  In addition, you must definitely look at the date of the last repair. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone House Hotel Kemer 3 reviews" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/587840.jpg" width="408"></div>
