Holidays in Azerbaijan in the mountains</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Azerbaijan is a country connecting two continents with a rich history and beautiful nature.  The state is washed by the waters of the Caspian Sea and has many mountains, which occupy more than half of the entire territory of the country.  These are mountains from the system of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, Talysh mountains.  These places cause indescribable delight and an unforgettable experience of visiting. </p><p>  The country's uniqueness is also that the weather in Azerbaijan is very diverse, which is caused by nine climatic zones out of 11 existing in the world. </p><h2>  Babadag </h2><p>  This peak is located in the east of the Dividing Range near the Karachay River.  The height of this mountain of Azerbaijan is 3,629 meters.  The name from the Iranian or Turkic language can be translated as "great-grandfather" or "grandfather". </p><p>  There is a legend about Babadag that a wise old man was buried on the mountain in the old days.  Now not only climbers, but also pilgrims make the ascent to the top. </p><p>  This is one of the most popular mountains for climbing, the most picturesque is the southern trail.  Its beginning near the village of Chaygovushan.  But the most convenient is the trail starting from the village of Lahic.  On the northern part of the mountain there are two more routes, the longest of which starts from the settlements of Talysh and Derk.  Technically, climbing Badabag is considered quite simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fortytravels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Babadag Azerbaijan" class="if uuid-2556809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556809.jpg"></div><h2>  Shahdag </h2><p>  Ski resort in Azerbaijan.  Unusually, but on this mountain the snow really lies all year round.  A few years ago there was nothing in this area.  Now there are about 20 kilometers of tracks.  The resort is open from December to April.  The height of the slopes is from 1372 to 2525 meters, 7 ski lifts and 4 chairlifts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort has a ski school.  The temperature in these places is from - 5 to - 15 degrees.  The resort is state-owned; there are four hotels here, one of which is a five-star hotel.  From the capital of the state to the resort is only 3 hours drive.  Of the related services is a SPA center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pgimgmt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shahdag resort" class="if uuid-2556812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556812.jpg"></div><h2>  Mount Bazarduzu </h2><p>  This is the <span>highest mountain in</span> Azerbaijan, its height is 4,466 meters.  The name itself in translation means "market square".  In ancient times, they were guided by this mountain when they went to the fair, which was held in the valley of Mount Shahnabad.  And the local Lezgins call it “Horror Mountain”. </p><p>  Bazarduzu is a certain border sign, since the northern and southern slopes belong to different states.  The first ascent to the summit was in 1847, and Alexandrov A. made it, his path ran along the northeast ridge.  In 1993, Ragimov E. climbed the southern ridge, and Asadov Y. - on the southwestern side. </p><p>  Now it is a popular place to climb.  The south side is suitable for beginner climbers, and the north side is already assigned to the highest category of complexity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alaniatv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Bazarduzu" class="if uuid-2556830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556830.jpg"></div><h2>  Talysh mountains </h2><p>  These mountains are located near the border with Iran.  Their total length is 100 kilometers, and they are part of the Elbrus mountain system.  The highest peak is Mount Kamarkukh (2,477 meters above sea level).  By the way, this peak, like the mountains of Joni and Shindan, is considered an extinct volcano.  Locals call her Amard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Very picturesque eastern slope of these mountains, broad-leaved subtropical plants grow here.  And at an altitude of 600 meters, beech, hornbeam and oak trees are already appearing. </p><p>  No less attractive is the highlands covered with meadow and steppe plants.  The western slope is covered mainly by representatives of the xerophytic genus. </p><p>  On the territory of these mountains of Azerbaijan is the Girkan Reserve, where the relict forest of the Tertiary period grows.  More than 190 species of vegetation are represented here, 160 of which grow only in these mountains.  Several species of animals live on the territory of the reserve, such as <span>stone marten,</span> Caucasian lynx, Persian and others. </p><p>  Near the cities of Lankaran, Astara and Masalli, in the mountains there are mineral springs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.writeopinions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Talysh mountains" class="if uuid-2556816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556816.jpg"></div><h2>  Yanar Dag </h2><p>  This is not the most popular object of mountain Azerbaijan, it is not even a mountain, but a hill 116 meters high.  The peculiarity of this place is completely different, under the natural object there are huge deposits of gas, which periodically breaks out.  The flame rises to a height of 3 meters.  Unlike other similar places, there are no mud streams and water bodies, so the fire never goes out. </p><p>  It’s better to come here at night, then a 10 meter wall of fire looks majestic and grandiose.  You need to be prepared that there is always a smell of gas in the area.  The hill is located near the village of Mehemmedi, 25 kilometers from Baku.  By the way, a therapeutic mud volcano is not far away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yanar Dag" class="if uuid-2556818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556818.jpg"></div><h2>  Tufandag </h2><p>  Another <span>ski resort in Azerbaijan.</span>  At the same time it can take up to 3000 people.  Tufandag is located near the city of Gabala, on Mount Tufan.  The highest point is 4,191 meters.  The ski area is naturally located not at the very top, but at a level of 1 to 1.9 thousand meters.  The hotels are even lower, at an altitude of up to 1251 meters.  The longest route is 1920 meters, the total length of all routes is 17 kilometers, with a slope of 25 to 40 degrees.  The resort welcomes guests from December to March. </p><div class="photo" data-original="azerbaijan.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tufandag Resort" class="if uuid-2556821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2556821.jpg"></div><h2>  Geisan and other popular mountain objects of the country </h2><p>  This is a real natural monument.  The height of Mount Geisan is only 250 meters, but there are always a lot of people around it.  Located in the Kazakh district, two kilometers from the river Dzhogazchay.  This mountain of Azerbaijan is a consequence of a volcanic eruption that occurred several thousand years ago.  The name of the mountain is translated as "conqueror of the sky."  On the slopes of a natural site, the remains of an ancient settlement have been preserved.  It is assumed that ancient people gathered at the top of the mountain (it has a flat shape) and celebrated holidays. </p><p>  Beshbarmag is an amazingly shaped mountain that resembles five spread fingers, in principle, this is where the name comes from.  Its height is 1200 meters and it is located near the highway in Baku (north direction).  The mountain is shrouded in many legends.  First of all, Muslim pilgrims come to her, because the shape of the mountain resembles a symbol of believers - the hand of an imam.  And the local population believes that if you climb to the top and make a wish, it will come true.  There is another legend that the prophet Khizyr drank living water precisely on Mount Beshbarmag and after that became immortal.  At the facility, even the remains of medieval settlements have been preserved.  And behind the top, the ruins of the ancient city of Hursangal, which was supposedly built in the III century BC, are preserved.  And in the holy place “Pir Hidir Zinda” pilgrims pray. </p><p>  Kapaz is a whole <span>mountain range</span> with a total length of 34 kilometers.  The highest point is 3066 meters.  Only individual excursions are conducted to this mountain, as the weather in this place of Azerbaijan is very changeable, and until the middle of summer there is snow and very cold water in the springs.  But the most interesting is that in 1138 there was an earthquake.  As a result of which the wreckage of the mountain blocked the source of the Ahsu River and the Semiozeri appeared.  The most significant and visited is Blue Lake, which is located in the center of the arc.  Although the most beautiful is Deer Lake or Maragel. </p><h2>  Qabala </h2><p>  If you want to enjoy the mountain air and the surrounding beauties, it is best to go on vacation to the mountains of Azerbaijan, namely to the city of Gabala.  It is located in the gorge of the mountains Bazar-Yurt and Tufan, in the foothills of the Greater Caucasus.  This is the oldest city in the country; its history is estimated at two millennia.  There are beautiful waterfalls, lakes and rivers, so the second name of the city is “Azerbaijan Switzerland”. </p><p>  There are new buildings and ancient narrow streets.  And for all admirers of Alexander Dumas, there is an excursion tour of the places through which the writer traveled when traveling around the Caucasus.  The district of the city is famous for its centuries-old chestnuts and nuts.  And the rocky ridges will delight the eye every day, especially since there are many trails and interesting routes along narrow gorges to the mountain peaks. </p>
