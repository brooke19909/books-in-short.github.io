In this situation, a detailed comparison of all parameters will help. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  One of the main parameters for comparison, of course, will be the cost of the device.  Value for money is the main parameter to choose. </p><p>  Choosing the best price for Lenovo or Samsung, the first option most often wins.  Devices of the Chinese manufacturer are much cheaper than their Korean competitors.  The difference in value can reach as many as hundreds of dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is better Lenovo or Samsung" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1005285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, such a difference is present when comparing the flagships of these companies.  By purchasing a budget type device, this difference is leveled.  In the budget category, it will be much more difficult to determine which is better - Lenovo or Samsung. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  Comparing smartphones from the category of flagships, it is very difficult to give preference to any particular one.  Since the fillings of the devices of the companies are very similar. </p><p>  Each device has its own zest, and in some parameters outweighs its competitor.  But when considering the big picture, we get shaky equality. </p><p>  Taking the Lenovo Vibe Shot as an example and comparing it with the Galaxy S5, we can come to the conclusion about the advantages and disadvantages of each device.  Samsung is the owner of a processor with four cores, each of which is 2.5 GHz.  At this time, Lenovo has as many as 8 cores, but the frequency is less - 1.7 and 1 GHz.  A similar trend is present in almost all device parameters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  But in the case of the display, it is no longer so difficult to conclude that it is better to Lenovo or Samsung Galaxy.  Undoubtedly, Lenovo screens are significantly inferior to their competitors. </p><p>  Huge Samsung screens with rich colors and the use of modern technology are the best on the market.  Without a doubt, the displays of Lenovo devices are also quite good, but in many respects they do not reach the leader. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The situation with the cameras is rather ambiguous, and it is already more difficult to say which is better - ‚ÄúLenovo‚Äù or ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù.  The phone from the Galaxy line with number five is equipped with a 16 megapixel camera, but Vibe Shot has the same parameter. </p><p>  Although the indicators are almost the same on almost all counts, Samsung looks more profitable due to the best video recording and some small additions. </p><p>  Given that the Korean representative, in addition to displays, has cameras of tremendous quality, competition on almost equal footing can be considered a success. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Having learned the battery capacity, it will not be difficult to conclude that it is better - "Lenovo" or "Samsung". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main disadvantage of almost all phones of the Korean company is the small battery size.  Given the many functions, high-quality screen and powerful filling, a couple thousand MaH capacity looks rather mediocre.  This situation implies an additional purchase of a battery with a much larger volume. </p><p>  Lenovo in this regard, undoubtedly, looks better, because, as a rule, a powerful battery is installed on the device.  Accordingly, the duration of the work is much longer. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Quite often, for the user, in addition to the filling and functionality of the device, its appearance is important.  This is a very important point, because smartphones have already become accustomed to a plain and monotonous design. </p><p>  However, such grayness did not touch Lenovo or Samsung.  Fans of interesting design will be pleased with both the well-developed corporate look of Samsung and the memorable case of most Lenovo devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is better samsung or lenovo smartphone" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1005298.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is difficult to assess which is better - Samsung or Lenovo.  The smartphone of each company has its own advantages.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is the use of metal in the case or additional protection against moisture and dust, each of the device companies will delight the owners with their own highlights.  But the Korean representatives assembly is much more reliable. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Software performance testing can help you figure out which is better - Samsung or Lenovo.  A Korean company‚Äôs smartphone shows significantly better results than Lenovo. </p><p>  Quite strange, given the similarity of the fillings of most models, but Samsung is superior to the competitor in absolutely all respects.  Therefore, we can safely conclude that when working, the Korean device will show itself much better. </p><h2>  Tablets </h2><p>  A similar situation has developed among tablet devices.  Studying the Lenovo or Samsung tablet, which is better in each of them, design and additional features, the user again encounters difficulties in choosing. </p><p>  Each of the companies produces solid devices, however, only having decided on the purpose of buying a tablet, you can begin to compare devices. </p><p>  The interesting design of Lenovo tablets partially alleviates some minor flaws.  For example, a partial change of the android for the device or low performance.  In fact, Lenovo is more suitable for entertainment or working with the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo or Samsung tablet which is better" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1005286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tablets manufactured by the Korean company have impressive performance and are designed specifically to perform complex tasks.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a powerful and demanding game or the launch of several applications - the Korean tablet is able to cope with many things. </p><p>  Significantly smooths the difference in potentials of devices the price of each.  By choosing Lenovo, the buyer will save a significant amount, the difference between the tablets of one class of these companies can be about a hundred dollars. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Decide which is better - "Lenovo" or "Samsung", will have exclusively to the user, given their requests.  After weighing each of the advantages offered by the companies and deciding for what purposes the device is needed, the buyer will definitely find the perfect option. </p>
