How to connect to a TV?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today's young people are not much to surprise in the field of computer games.  They have not bothered with the question of how to connect the Dandy to the TV for a long time, but play on super-powerful computers.  The most realistic graphics, believable characters, incredible musical accompaniment - all this is quite familiar to the modern gamer.  But just a couple of dozen years ago, all this was not, but there was something that won the hearts of millions of people - one of the first consoles - the prefix "Dandy". </p><h2>  A bit from the story of ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù: the game of our childhood </h2><p>  Born before the nineties, they probably remember the hype around the incredibly ‚Äúcool‚Äù console with the logo of the elephant on the panel, which appeared in the early 90's.  Then the game cost incredible money for a Soviet citizen, but this did not stop the developers from making millions in this market. </p><p>  In fact, ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù is the first in the domestic market, but not the first in production.  Nintendo company managed to release dozens of other versions of consoles before, but only ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù was able to win the hearts of domestic gamers.  At that time in Russia there were 4 dealers from the company "Stepler", which carried out the supply.  Unfortunately, this company curtailed its activities by the 94th year. </p><p>  Of course, even now you can find the long-forgotten ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù on the shelves of some stores and on specialized sites, but they are all far from the original, and are nothing more than a fake from China. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cartridges and the most popular games on the "Dandy" </h2><p>  The console and joysticks alone were not of interest without special cartridges, they were the carriers of basic information.  On one such cartridge there could be both one game and 999!  But the most valuable were those in which there were from 3 to 10 different games.  Young people were constantly changing, buying and selling cartridges to each other.  Even in our time, you can meet people who have left whole collections of original and rare games. </p><p>  Thanks to the huge assortment of high-quality and interesting games that were released for the Nes operating system, this console has become so in demand among Russian game lovers.  Immortal creations such as Mortal Kombat, Pakman, Super Mario, Tanks, Adventure Island and many others will forever remain in the memory of people who survived the cult of the nineties. </p>

    <h2>  How to connect the ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù prefix to the latest generation TV? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in recent years, manufacturers have increasingly begun to produce televisions that do not have connectors for component connections, due to the fact that modern receivers have a high-resolution interface. </p><p>  Suppose you decide to plunge into the past and play retro games.  For this purpose, a prefix was purchased, but later it turned out that your TV does not have A / V and SCART outputs.  What to do?  How to connect "Dandy" to a Samsung TV, on which there were no necessary connectors (however, this applies to any brand). </p><p>  It is not easy to get out of this situation, but it is possible.  You have to purchase a special device - A / V to HDMI converter.  Such converters are sold in online stores and on popular Chinese sites. </p>

    <p>  So, before connecting the ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù to the LG TV, make sure that the set-top box is turned off and disconnected from the power.  Next, using the cable with the "tulips", connect the console to the converter.  On the other hand, the converter is connected to the TV using an HDMI cable.  It remains only to insert the cartridge with your favorite game into the console, connect it to the network and turn on the game.  You may need to search for channels to reach the necessary wave. </p>
