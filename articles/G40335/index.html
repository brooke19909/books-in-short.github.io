Water parks are especially popular, but it seems that you can‚Äôt imagine anything new in this area either.  However, the owners of Aquaclub &amp; Hotel Voda can be proud of their project, which attracts more and more vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  On the shore of the Gulf of Finland </h2><p>  A thirty-minute drive from St. Petersburg is the city of Sestroretsk.  This is a resort with healing mud and <span>mineral water,</span> which is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. </p><p>  It is not surprising that it was in Sestroretsk that the Aquaclub &amp; Hotel Voda was built, representing a new type of recreation.  Water rides for children and adults, SPA elements, restaurants and fashionable parties - the club concept is ideal for family or friendly holidays. </p><h2>  Hotel "Water" </h2><p>  Voda Aquaclub Hotel has a small number of rooms, which presents the categories of standard, de luxe and one superior room. </p><p>  According to guests, the main advantage of the hotel is its unusual design.  The minimalistic interior of the rooms is successfully complemented <span>by backlit panels</span> depicting fragments from comics.  Artists and designers seem to provoke you to go beyond the usual things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel water voda aquaclub hotel" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1077978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The guests from the bathrooms with <span>rain showers</span> and lights, which instead of walls are separated from the main space with just a glass partition, experience a slight shock.  However, everyone gets used to the new environment pretty quickly. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Holidays with accommodation in Voda Aquaclub Hotel will be very expensive.  On weekends, you will pay 8,000 rubles for a standard double room, and 12,000 rubles for a de luxe room. </p><p>  In addition to accommodation, the price includes: </p><p>  - breakfast at the Mizu Dry restaurant; </p><p>  - unlimited visits to Aquatrium; </p><p>  - Wi-Fi; </p><p>  - four bottles of drinking water; </p><p>  - taxi ordering; </p><p>  - parking space. </p><p>  Upon request, a cot and a medical kit are available.  Extra bed for an adult costs 4000 rubles, for a child (from 4 to 14 years old) - 3000 rubles. </p><p>  The rooms have everything you need for a good rest: a large TV, air conditioning, a luxurious double bed, a hairdryer, a minibar and a small workplace. </p><h2>  Guest opinions </h2><p>  As we have said, many guests liked the creative design of their rooms.  Transparent showers have long been remembered by couples in love, but guests with children experience some inconvenience. </p><p>  High-quality bedding, comfortable beds and room equipment in general leave a pleasant impression. </p><p>  The ambiguous opinion of the guests was formed regarding the work of the restaurant during breakfast.  A small selection of food on the menu and just one serving of a hot drink (tea or coffee) - such restrictions do not correspond to the declared status of the Voda Hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Voda Aquaclub Hotel is located in the immediate vicinity of the highway (700 meters from the Gulf of Finland), and the noise of the track sometimes causes inconvenience to vacationers.  Travelers agree that you can live in a hotel no more than 2-3 days. </p><h2>  Aquatrium </h2><p>  Still want to know what a Voda aquaclub is?  The basis of the entire complex is a huge pool (area - 600 sq. M) in a room with 12-meter ceilings.  The feeling of a tropical beach is created due to comfortable air temperature (+31 degrees) and water (+30 degrees), and the musical accompaniment changes depending on the time of day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voda aquaclub hotel 3 russia st petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1077985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For maximum relaxation, the pool is equipped with sixteen sun loungers with air massage.  Hydromassage nozzles are also installed around the perimeter.  An unusual experience promises vacationers a visit to a small grotto. </p><p>  And finally, geysers.  In the center of the pool above them are installed handrails with RGB-illumination, which give a kind of feeling of flying. </p><p>  In the thermal zone for vacationers, a cozy <span>Finnish sauna is</span> equipped <span>.</span>  However, much more interesting is the hammam, the design of which is also created using LED backlighting.  Warm steam allows the lungs to breathe freely, opens the pores and saturates the body with moisture.  The gentle temperature and unusual interior attract even the youngest guests of Aquaclub &amp; Hotel Voda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel aquaclub voda sestroretsk russia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1077976.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thrill lovers will definitely appreciate the snow fountain for contrasting ice wipes after visiting two saunas.

    <p>  Separately, it is worth noting the quality of the water in the pool.  The bowl is made of stainless steel, this prevents the formation of rust and any organic compounds.  In addition, the minimum amount of chlorine is used for water purification, which limits the negative impact on the body and ensures the absence of an unpleasant odor.  Every month, the water is tested for quality: the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology in St. Petersburg takes samples and, based on the examination, draws up a conclusion that we are ready to submit to you for review at any time. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  They come to the Voda Aquaclub Hotel in order to relax their body and soul.  According to visitors, the incredible atmosphere created in the water complex is conducive to relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is aqua club voda" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1077982.jpg" width="543"></div>
