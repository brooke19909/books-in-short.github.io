    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  A standard set of accessories in the basic configuration of the <span>Lenovo A316I</span> BLACK.  Reviews highlight only documentation.  In this case, in addition to the usual user manual and warranty card, there are three more descriptions of the device in different languages, one of which is in English.  The stereo headset of this smartphone is an economy class.  She is, and this is where her advantages end.  The sound quality is not very good, but you can listen.  If you are a music lover and love a good sound, then you just can not do without additional costs for high-quality acoustics.  The battery that comes with the kit has a capacity of 1300 milliamps / hours.  Also in the box there is a battery charging adapter and a MicroUSB / USB cord. </p>

    <h2>  Case and management </h2><p>  Only in one color design is this device presented on the market - black.  It is not surprising - this gadget belongs to the class of entry-level devices and here you can feel the savings on everything that is possible.  The case is completely made of plastic, including the front panel.  As a result, the owners of this device cannot do without a protective film.  The back cover has a matte finish on which fingerprints and dirt will not be visible, but the cover will also not be superfluous.  The volume and power buttons are expertly grouped.  The first two are on the right edge of the device.  This allows you to control your smartphone with one hand.  The case is assembled soundly and there are no any backlashes in it.  Under the back cover there are 2 slots for installing SIM cards and one for an external drive.  A battery seat is located a little lower, in which important information about the device is indicated: the name of the model is ‚ÄúLenovo A316I BLACK‚Äù, UACRF, for example (the adaptation region in this case is Ukraine, for Russia this abbreviation is replaced by PCT), serial number, IMEI .  The overall dimensions of this device are as follows: 118 mm by 63 mm.  Its thickness is 12 mm and the weight is only 130 grams.  Excellent performance, as for an entry-level device with such dimensions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Weak processor installed in <span>Lenovo A316I</span> BLACK.  Reviews mark this significant flaw.  In this case, we are talking about MT6572.  It has only 2 ‚ÄúA7‚Äù architecture cores capable of operating in the most intensive mode of operation at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  To launch demanding toys, this is clearly not enough.  But if you like chess, <span>turn-based strategies,</span> or just ‚Äúchasing balls‚Äù, problems should not arise.  For movies, music, and sites, the processing power of this processor is enough.  As a result, this CPU is an excellent solution for undemanding users. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics and screen </h2><p>  Things are much better with the graphics adapter than with the central processor.  In this case, we are talking about the Mali-400MP.  This is a very productive solution that can easily and easily cope with most tasks at the moment.  But to fully reveal its potential does not work on this smartphone model due to a weak central processor.  The screen of this smart phone by today's standards is quite modest - only 4 inches.  Its resolution is 800 by 480 and it is based on a matrix based on TFT technology.  But you can‚Äôt expect more in a budget gadget.  Another nuance is that the touch screen in this model can handle up to two touches simultaneously. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  An interesting situation is obtained with cameras at Lenovo A316I BLACK.  Overview <strong> </strong>  its front panel clearly indicates that there is no camera on it.  That is, to make full-fledged video calls when the interlocutor sees you, and you will not succeed using this device.  You can either turn the screen on yourself to see the person you are talking to, or turn the camera on the back side to your side, but the picture will naturally not be visible.  In general, it turns out that although there is full support for 3rd generation networks, it will not be possible to fully utilize their capabilities using the ‚ÄúA316‚Äù.  The main camera of 2 megapixels, as noted earlier, is displayed on the back side of the smart phone.  The fact that she at 2 megapixels already says a lot.  It is not necessary to expect high-quality pictures or videos from her.  No autofocus, no stabilization system, no backlight.  So it turns out that there is a camera, but what quality is already - the second question. </p>

    <h2>  About memory </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that there are two modifications to this model of smartphone.  The difference is that one of them has the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù at the end of the name, while the other does not.  In the first case, the installed RAM is 512 MB, and the built-in memory is 4 GB.  But the second modification is equipped with 256 MB of internal and RAM.  MicroSD standard memory cards are also supported.  Lenovo A316I BLACK Cell Phone <strong> </strong>  can address 16 GB.  The second modification (without "i") supports external drives with the same amount of memory. </p><h2>  Autonomy and battery </h2><p>  The <span>Lenovo A316I</span> DUAL SIM BLACK smartphone is equipped with a 1300 milliampere / hour battery.  Its capacity is enough for 3-4 days of battery life without recharging the battery.  On the one hand, there are 2 SIM cards at once, which greatly use its capacity.  On the other hand, an energy-efficient processor, a small diagonal of the screen (only 4 inches) and competent optimization by Chinese engineers can allow and work longer on a single charge.  If desired, and a minimum capacity load of 1300 milliamps / hours may be enough in this case, even for a week.  So here at ‚ÄúA316‚Äù things are not so bad. </p>

    <h2>  OS </h2><p>  As noted earlier, there are two modifications to this model of smart phone.  The difference in their name is that one of them has an index ‚Äúi‚Äù, while the other does not.  In addition to the different amounts of memory in them, they also differ in the versions of the operating system.  If the first one has a completely modern ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù installed, which has the version ‚Äú4.2‚Äù, then the second device works under the control of both morally and physically obsolete ‚Äú2.3.6‚Äù.  In the latter case, there may be problems with the installation of some programs.  Therefore, such a purchase does not seem entirely appropriate. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Smart phones of the LENOVO trademark, in addition to the OS itself, have a fairly wide range of pre-installed software.  But in our case, this is not entirely good.  The younger ‚ÄúA316‚Äù has on board 256 MB of RAM and built-in memory, which is immediately occupied by this software.  That is, the user can not do without a memory card.  Although the installed memory is much larger (512 MB and 4 GB respectively) in the smartphone Lenovo A316I BLACK, reviews <strong> </strong>  indicate that this is not enough today.  So without an external drive, and in this case can not do.  Among the preinstalled software, one can distinguish an antivirus, a set of applications from Google and standard utilities (calculator, calendar, etc.).  If you want to uninstall any of this, you just won‚Äôt be able to do this.  Immediately you need to get root-rights, and then only remove unnecessary software.  Another problem is that there may be problems with the firmware in the future after uninstalling. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Something supernatural can not be expected from a device level Lenovo A316I BLACK.  The price for it starts at $ 40.  Cheaper, indeed, nowhere.  Any option that is installed and successfully functioning in it is already a plus.  Like, for example, a camera or speaker system.  Yes, they are, but their technical specifications are not pleasing to the eye.  But still it is in this model of smartphone.  Based on the amount of memory and the version of the installed operating system, it is more preferable to buy a device with the index "i".  He has 2 times more RAM - 512 MB, the built-in storage capacity is 4 GB.  Yes, and OS version 4.2.  In turn, just ‚ÄúA316‚Äù has RAM and 256 MB of internal memory and the version of ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in it is morally and physically outdated - 2.3.6.  Therefore, when choosing a new inexpensive smartphone, it is better to look towards the Lenovo A316I BLACK.  The reviews of the owners of this device only confirm this. </p>
