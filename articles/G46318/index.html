  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the development of programming languages: a brief about everything</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Programming is a time-consuming and complex process, which not everyone can understand.  Machine language consists of many algorithms and <span>machine codes.</span>  And today's computers are such perfect equipment because they are programmed.  And the history of software development would not have been so successful if a special language had not been invented for machines that translate symbolic keywords into machine codes.  Consider how the history of the development of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloped. </p><p>  The first car codes appeared in 1955 by the efforts of IBM developers under the guidance of engineer John Backus.  It was a high-level language called Fortran, not a set of disparate simple commands, but the organization of larger codes, which became known as operators, or algorithmic languages.  To translate them into machine code, translators were invented that convert the algorithms and make it understandable for an electronic computer.  This happens in two ways: interpretation and compilation.  Due to the simplicity of the version, Fortran quickly came into use, and the last of them is today one of the <span>most popular</span> computer <span>programming languages</span> . </p><p>  However, this is not the only car code for cars.  The history of the development of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãcontinues with the creation of Algol algorithms, which are used mainly in the scientific community and have a large number of new concepts.  This event takes place in 1960.  A little later, inquisitive IBM employees came up with the Kobol language, which is focused on use in a business environment and is used to process complex and voluminous information of an economic nature. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the development of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãis continued by Dartsmouth College professors T. Kurtz and J. Kemeny, who developed the well-known BASIC.  It is much simpler than Fortran, and therefore used in <span>personal computers.</span>  It produced an explosion effect, becoming the main set of programming auto codes, and making computers the property of most ordinary users. </p><p>  Ease of use and dialogue features are the main advantages of BASIC.  The disadvantages include the lack of restrictions on programming, which very often confuses them and makes them logically incomprehensible.  Programs compiled with the help of BASIC are slow in nature, because they are not based on compilers, but interpreters. </p><p>  Today, scientists continue to work on improving it and try to bring Pascal closer to the program, which further marked the history of the development of programming languages.  Its creator, by right, is considered a professor at the Zurich Polytechnic University Nicklaus Wirth.  And he gave the name to his invention in honor of Pascal, who is the first designer of the very first computer.  This is one of the easiest and most accessible programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat allows you to write clear and understandable programs. </p><p>  The history of the development of programming would not be complete without the language of Ada, named after the first woman programmer Ada Lovelace, the daughter of <span>George Byron</span> , the famous sweat <span>.</span>  It is a more advanced and universal programming language based on Pascal. </p><p>  The history of software development has in its arsenal many more programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are written for special applications.  For example, in the simulation, Simul, Simcrit and GPSS are used.  To control the equipment, the FORT language is used.  <span>System programs</span> are written in SI.  Databases are created by the Kodasil language.  For learning programming, Logo, Robik, and the <span>algorithmic language</span> A.P. are convenient.  Ershov. </p><p>  The history of the development of programming has not yet been completely written and it is unlikely that this will happen in the near future. </p>
