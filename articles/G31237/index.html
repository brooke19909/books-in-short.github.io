    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's railway Novomoskovsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/855006.jpg"></div>  In the middle of the last century, the city of Novomoskovsk was called Stalinogorsk and belonged to the Moscow region.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a children's railway was put forward by the director of the Moscow-Coal plant, one of the largest production facilities at that time.  The question was immediately relevant, where will the children's railway be located?  Novomoskovsk is a small city, and there was no better place than a park surrounded by residential buildings.  The railway formed a closed ring, the order to begin construction was signed on June 15, 1953.  This is unbelievable, but all work was carried out as soon as possible.  And on December 21 of that year, the grand opening of the children's railway in Novomoskovsk took place.  On the same day the first rolling stock got off the rails and went on a flight.

However, at the beginning of the winter of 1954, the Ministry of Railways of the USSR became interested in the object.  In December, the railway was officially transferred to the Ministry of Railways.  The first season of work with the new management was opened in May 1955, very often it is from this date that the history of the object‚Äôs existence begins to be counted.  At the same time, the official name ‚ÄúSmall Moscow-Kursk-Donbass Railway‚Äù appears, consonant with the name of the main federal railways passing through the city.  However, already in 1961, the ring line in the city park was mentioned in all official documents as the Novomoskovsk children's railway.  Novomoskovsk leads its history under a new name from the same time, in addition, the city was transferred from Moscow to the Tula region.

It was then that the locomotives were replaced by diesel locomotives, in 1971 a functioning TU2-126 diesel locomotive was brought in today.  Reconstructions and minor repairs of the railway track and <span>rolling stock</span> were carried out in subsequent years.  Over time, the number of cars increased from 4 to 9. The platforms, along with all the buildings on them, were also landscaped.  The year 2006 was a landmark in the history of the road, it was then that new cars were brought, and one of them even became a wedding car.  Thanks to this conversion, the attraction began to enjoy incredible popularity among the newlyweds of the city.  Now, the lists of places to visit on the wedding day of many couples must have a children's railway.  Novomoskovsk has gained particular popularity among tourists from all over Russia because of this attraction.
