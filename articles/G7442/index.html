    <h2>  Post-war period </h2><p>  After the war ended, Vasiliev continued to lead the rifle corps. </p><p>  With the onset of the 50s, a conflict erupted between the southern and northern territories in Korea, which grew in the Korean War of 1950-1953.  The reason for the war is the opposition of two ideologies: socialist and capitalist.  The USSR and the USA intervene in hostilities. </p><p>  General Vasilyev helps develop a plan for North Korea‚Äôs attack on South Korea.  Fierce battles have been going on for three years.  Military success smiles at one side or the other.  But in the end, none of the warring parties succeeded in achieving their goals.  To this day, the people of Korea remain artificially divided into two parts - into zones of influence of the USSR and the USA. </p><p>  Starting from the 50s, Vasiliev was appointed adviser to the commander of the Romanian army.  Since 1958, he has served in the GRU of the General Staff as deputy chief.  In 1968 he resigns, lives in Moscow. </p><p>  In 1971, Hero of the Soviet Union Nikolai Alekseevich Vasiliev died.  His grave is located at the Vvedensky cemetery, located in Moscow, in the Lefortovo district.  Initially, foreigners living in the capital were buried on this graveyard.  The cemetery was called German.  But later on it began to bury our compatriots.  And now there are the graves of many prominent personalities of the USSR and Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Vasiliev" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2106563.jpg"></div>
