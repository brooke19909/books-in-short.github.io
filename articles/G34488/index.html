Our states have much in common, and therefore citizens often move from one country to another.  Constant passenger flow generates demand, and demand leads to supply.  You can get from Gomel to Moscow in several traditional ways: using rail, your own car and bus. </p><h2>  Between two cities </h2><p>  The road from one city to another on this stretch is very interesting.  First of all, the path runs through the territories of two states at once.  You can look at the smooth transition after the border and evaluate the welfare of small towns.  The highway from Gomel to Moscow runs through 17 cities.  This provides an excellent opportunity to compare two sovereign states and see more attractions.  This is especially true for those who went on this trip with their own car.  The federal highway goes around the city of military glory - Bryansk, however, you can call at the Partizanskaya Polyana memorial complex, because it will not take much time along the way. </p>

    <p>  Problems with crossing the state border will not arise regardless of the direction of movement.  Of course, it is not necessary to go from Gomel to Moscow in your own car.  You can use the bus or train.  Each of these vehicles has its advantages and disadvantages.  However, only a trip by car can bring a lot of impressions.  The car gives freedom, because its own route passes as the driver wants to pave it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Air transport</span> in this case will not be relevant.  These cities are located close to each other, and the cost of a plane ticket makes the flight irrational.  A road on the ground, by the way, will not take a day.  Of course, in the event that there will be no traffic jams on federal highways, which at least rarely happen.  Flying on a short-range aircraft will take no more than 2 hours, and this is the only plus of air travel along this route. </p><h2>  Railway </h2><p>  The easiest way to get from Gomel to Moscow is by rail.  It is fast, convenient and completely safe.  Tickets are not so expensive, and travel time does not take a day.  The regularity of the train service allows you to accurately determine the arrival time and plan the whole day.  Trains also call in various cities of Russia.  This will not allow the passenger to see the sights, but will provide an opportunity to visit the stations of large Russian cities. </p>

    <p>  The Moscow-Gomel train at some stations stops for more than 15 minutes.  In addition, between these megacities there are both direct trains and transit ones.  For those who want to save money, direct trains are most advantageous.  The fact is that they are fast and not only faster, but also partially formed from seated cars.  Such a car most closely resembles an airplane cabin.  The chairs are soft and comfortable, and they can also be adjusted according to the angle of inclination.  It is much more convenient than seats in buses.  Such cars are without fail equipped with air conditioners and dry closets.  The cost of tickets to these cars is very low, which makes them affordable.  Of course, in such trains there are also ordinary cars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In transit rolling stocks, as a rule, there are no sitting cars.  They more often stop along the route and from this drive slowly.  Tickets are expensive, but there is a choice between different cars.  Most trains have reserved seats, compartment rooms, and CB.  Occasionally there are luxury cars.  All trains have several toilets and the ability to quench thirst and hunger.  In this regard, traveling by train is the most comfortable. </p><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  The most inconvenient and not the cheapest way is a bus ride Gomel - Moscow.  The road, although it does not take much time, will be difficult for those who do not like this type of transport.  There are technical stops on the route.  Most often these are stops for toilet needs and coffee. </p><h2>  Moscow traffic jams </h2><p>  Entering and leaving Moscow may be a big nuisance.  The essence of the problem is the famous Moscow traffic jams.  Once in a congestion, you can stay in it for 5 or 8 hours.  This is especially true for departure from Moscow on weekends.  The traffic situation in the capital is tense, and an unexpected accident can paralyze traffic.  It is best to enter and leave the city at night or in the early morning.  This will avoid traffic jams. </p>

    <h2>  Distance between cities </h2><p>  Gomel is relatively close to Moscow.  The total length of roads between cities is about 660 km.  Different time will be spent on the road depending on the traffic situation and the driving style of the driver.  The length of the railway between settlements is about 567 km.  However, the train runs slower than the car, and the total travel time, taking into account the stops, the longest of which exceeds 20 minutes, will be significant.  However, traffic jams for trains are not a hindrance, so arrival on time is almost guaranteed.  Between Gomel and Moscow, the straight line distance is 580 km. </p>
