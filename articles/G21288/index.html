  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is cargo insurance for?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any self-respecting businessman or entrepreneur will not send the goods just like that and would prefer such an event as cargo insurance.  What is cargo insurance?  This event does everything to make the transportation of goods less secure and reliable.  Freight, not always of course, but it happens that entail some material losses.  For example, damage or spoilage, loss or loss of cargo for some reason.  That is why when transporting goods, cargo insurance against unexpected circumstances is necessary.  Cargo owners with the help of <span>an insurance policy</span> protect their property interests, and cargo insurance is by far the best form for guaranteeing goods. </p><p>  The objectives of this type of insurance are the creation of compulsory compensation for losses to the insured that arise during the transportation procedure for reasons such as loss, loss or damage to the cargo.  Cargo insurance occurs only for those circumstances that are not dependent on the insurance company itself.  Many policyholders claim that these companies are required to bear all the costs of reimbursement, but this is far from the case.  Of course, transport cargo insurance is, of course, a guarantee of reimbursement, but it is completely exempt from payment for reasons of force majeure. </p><p>  There are several types of cargo insurance: </p><ol><li>  For all risks with the responsibility of the insurer; </li><li>  For the death and damage of cargo with the responsibility of the insurer; </li><li>  For a partial accident, but except in the event of a crash, without liability of the insurer. </li></ol><p>  An entrepreneur can independently choose an insurance program, which will depend on that.  What cargo, in what way the transportation will be carried out, and which transportation option will be chosen by him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An event like cargo insurance has its advantages.  Insurance of goods in our time is very profitable, since an insurance policy is a certain document that is a guarantee of compensation for the loss of cargo arising from the transportation and transportation of goods. </p><p>  Also, <span>international transportation</span> has become very popular <span>.</span>  They are implemented in full compliance with international agreements.  And also foreign cargo insurance has become especially popular.  When transporting especially valuable goods, cargo insurance is simply necessary.  And when transporting breakable, fragile or <span>dangerous goods,</span> insurance is highly desirable. </p><p>  Transport companies and insurance companies work closely with each other, and with each year cargo insurance is becoming commonplace.  So, for example, abroad, this insurance has become a mass dependency.  There are many customers here and that is why insurance companies have their own representatives in their circle who are engaged in the acceptance of cargo and monitor its loading and unloading; representatives of insurance companies also assist clients in all matters related to insurance.  Among Russian customers, cargo insurance is not so successful.  Among the entire population of Russia, the first half cooperates with insurance companies for the carriage of goods, and the second refuses to insure the transported goods.  This is due to the fact that Russia has a low culture of cargo insurance and the volume of trade is not very high.  But nevertheless, all insurance companies in Russia offer services directly for cargo insurance.  And it’s better to use this service than to lose a valuable load or even lose your <span>business.</span>  <span>Insurance of</span> any cargo is <span>an industry</span> that is improved every year for further prosperity. </p>
