Metro stepped outside the Moscow Ring Road</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Station "Lermontovsky Prospekt" received the first passengers in the fall of 2013.  She went into operation operating as part of the launch site on the leg between Zhulebino and Vykhino.  For residents of remote areas located in the southeast of the capital, this event was long-awaited.  The great remoteness from the center and the apparent inadequacy of the public transport infrastructure to the required level greatly complicated the lives of the inhabitants of vast residential areas in the Moscow outskirts.  Lermontovsky Prospekt Station is located outside the ring road.  In other words, the metro confidently stepped over the traditional boundaries of the city and made part of Moscow remote areas of the "outback countryside".  This opens up new development prospects for the entire southeast of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lermontovsky Prospekt Station" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/307236.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h3>  <span>Lermontovsky Prospekt Metro</span> Station <span>:</span> Architectural Features </h3><p>  The opening of transport communication, which is so important for the life of the entire district, was long expected and was postponed several times, but today the construction of this radius is continuing further, towards the region.  In a constructive sense, the Lermontovsky Prospekt station is a single-vault shallow-laying space.  The dominant architectural style can be called constructivist minimalism.  The interior space is devoid of any excesses, which provides easy access to trains and unhindered access to the city.  Decorative trim is present only in the upper part of the vault and on the side platform panels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station Lermontovsky Prospekt" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/307235.jpg" width="500"></div>  Exit to the city is carried out on Lermontovsky Prospekt and Khvalynsky Boulevard.  With the arrival of the subway line in this area, it has become much more attractive for investors and home buyers.  The very opening of the Lermontovsky Prospekt station significantly increased the capitalization of residential real estate, which turned out to be in close proximity to it.  In the Vykhino-Zhulebino area, housing construction has intensified significantly.  Realtor structures note an increase in interest in the area where the Lermontovsky Prospekt station is located.  Currently, several large residential complexes are <span>under construction</span> and construction.  The opening of a new metro section had the most positive effect on <span>business activity</span> in the area. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="opening of the station Lermontov Avenue" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/307234.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <h3>  Prospects for the development of the transport system of the southeast </h3><p>  In the near future, the Lermontovsky Prospekt station should become a junction.  This will happen after the commissioning of the new Kozhukhovskaya line, the design process of which continued for a rather long time and was finally successfully completed.  At the moment, it is being actively built.  The line should go into operation after 2015.  This will be another highway connecting the city center with the regions of the east and southeast.  The launch site of the Kozhukhovskaya line includes nine stations and eight stages between them - from Aviamotornaya to Nekrasovskaya.  Station "Kosino" should be the first interchange station for the metro, located behind the Moscow Ring Road. </p>
