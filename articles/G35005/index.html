The etymology is based on the ancient custom of people to mark their land with a rope.  This type of community is mentioned in Russian Truth, an important document of Kievan Rus, as well as in the Croatian Statute, which is an ancient legislative monument of a small area in Croatia (on the Dalmatian coast). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verw this" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/415652.jpg" width="567"></div>

    <h2>  Evolution </h2><p>  Some scholars believe that initially the verw was exclusively a kinship organization, and later, under the influence of various socio-economic factors, it turned into a society based more likely on the principle of neighborhood, i.e.  people belonging to her were united by an exceptionally close place of residence. </p><p>  Scientists who are ardent supporters of the territorial community are especially active in defending their views.  One of the main reasons is that such a group can be called much more progressive, and historians do not want to accept that other peoples were more developed than the inhabitants of Russia.  Since the gang is an association of various social layers of people, over time it underwent various changes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Etymology </h2><p>  Linguists also began to study the origin of this word to provide reliable data on the history of the concept.  It turned out that it was no coincidence that the name of the community was consonant with the word "rope". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="term ver" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/415650.jpg" width="439"></div>

    <p>  This may indicate that such associations were built on the principle of joint residence, since the <span>ancient Slavs</span> and other peoples had the custom of measuring their possessions with the help of cords of a certain length, therefore, it is entirely possible that the concept of ‚Äúverw‚Äù came from here.  The definition of "rope" is preserved in the documents of the <span>Astrakhan province of the</span> XIX century.  Then it was a measure equal to 1850 square fathoms.  They talked about the process of measuring land in such a way: ‚Äúto steal‚Äù and ‚Äúto believe‚Äù. </p><h2>  Russian Truth and the Politsky Statute </h2><p>  As noted above, in various areas, the <span>evolution of this</span> community took place in different ways.  Although it is generally accepted that a verb is an organization based on family ties, the principle of unification has changed over time.  The Russian Truth said that this rural community was not based on blood ties, and the Politsky Statute noted that there was only a weakening of this sign, but some of its elements were still preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verve definition" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/415651.jpg" width="345"></div>

    <p>  Russian Truth describes a <span>social system that is</span> much more developed than the one mentioned in the Politsky Statute.  But this discrepancy is very easily explained.  Separate parts of the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù tell about society of the VIII-XII centuries, while the Politsky Statute describes the system of the XV-XVII centuries. </p><h2>  Mutual responsibility </h2><p>  The Russian Truth says that a verb is a rural association of people living in a large territory.  Despite the fact that members of the community are not tied by blood ties, there is <span>mutual</span> responsibility between them <span>,</span> which obliges each participant to search for a thief and be responsible for the murder according to the law.  There were other functions that the verw had to perform.  They were determined by the authorities. </p><p>  Any kind of community contributed to the development of the social system of ancient society.  Of course, this can be argued for the whole world.  It was an association of people, which is difficult to speak clearly.  It is only clear that the verve was the next link in the development of Russian history and favorably influenced it. </p>
