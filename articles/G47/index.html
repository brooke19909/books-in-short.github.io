    <h2>  History of Aluston Fortress </h2><p>  During the reign of Emperor Justinian I, one of the most attractive structures on the Crimean peninsula, called Aluston, was erected.  The fortress, which has existed for several centuries, has formed a large city around itself.  He received the name Alushta and proudly bears this name to this day.  Unfortunately, by the 21st century only ruins and huge boulders remained from the fortress, but several centuries ago the powerful walls of the building reliably defended their inhabitants. </p><h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  The ruins of the fortress carry important elements of history.  It was here that the clashes of the most severe warriors took place.  Today Aluston is a fortress that is almost invisible at first glance to a simple tourist, but once powerful walls rose several meters and impressed everyone who was nearby with their dimensions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The modern territory of the fortress is filled with residential premises.  The resort peninsula on the seashore often receives a wide variety of visitors from among travelers, so this historical object is gradually overtaking technological progress.  Nevertheless, the most valuable elements of the fortress are preserved and accessible to visitors. </p><h2>  Marina and sailors </h2><p>  Aluston is a fortress on the territory of which a marina recently existed.  Not only seafarers and travelers arrived, but also merchant ships.  From the hills of this building an incredible view of the Alushta valley opened.  During its faithful service, the fortress was considered one of the most powerful and reliable fortifications, despite its small area. </p>
