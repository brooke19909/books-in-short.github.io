  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY crochet socks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The best thing that perfectly heats in the cold season is crocheted socks.  Yes, it‚Äôs for them, not knitting needles!  Many craftswomen have already tried such needlework and were satisfied.  After all, to create crocheted socks, you don‚Äôt need any special skills, only basic knowledge is needed. </p><p>  Of course, for many, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãknitted socks is associated with a set of five knitting needles.  This is usually the case.  But you can make a wonderful warm product without them.  Only 2 pm - and comfortable socks will be ready! </p><p>  Take any scheme you like, yarn - and go ahead, create! </p><h2>  Crochet socks for beginner needlewomen </h2><p>  Everything is very simple!  You only need to be able to knit air loops, double crochet and single crochet posts.  Such knitting is much easier than working with five knitting needles that constantly strive to jump out of the loops.  The process takes a very short time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homemade socks with a cuff" class="if uuid-2699796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699796.jpg"></div><p>  How to crochet socks?  For work you will need a hook number 4 and about 250 g of wool yarn. </p><p>  So, the description of crocheting socks for beginners, step by step. </p><ol><li>  The first step in our work will be a set of five loops for the toe, to close in a ring. </li><li>  In this ring we knit 10 double crochet, close with a half-column. </li><li>  In the next 2 rows we make supplements through 1 column. </li><li>  We knit 16 rows with double crochets. </li></ol><p>  Next, divide all the loops into 2 parts, separating the heel.  It is necessary to connect a chain of air loops, equal in length to the ankle volume, and connect with a half-column with the opposite side.  Knit on this chain and half of the double crochet posts in a circle and upwards - this is a sock elastic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When finished with the cuff, start knitting the heel with single crochet.  To form it, reduce 2 loops in each corner.  So tie 7 rows, pull the last 4 loops with a thread. </p><h2>  Crochet Men's Socks </h2><p>  Let's tie cozy warm little things to ourselves, to children, and also to our man.  Knitting men's socks, in principle, is the same, but still there is some difference. </p><p>  Take yarn and hook number 3. Tie a chain of four loops, close into a ringlet.  Knit, gradually adding loops - you end up with 52 loops.  Next, knit around the circular half-columns of 20 rows. </p><p>  Divide all the loops in half and go back 14 loops.  Now knit a triangular wedge - this is the bottom of the heel, reducing 1 loop on each side before 1 loop remains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Striped sock" class="if uuid-2699790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699790.jpg"></div><p>  On each of the two sides, dial 22 loops and knit in a circle, gradually reducing until 48 loops remain in the work. </p><p>  Next, knit crochet posts, 3 hoist air loops, and cuff, alternating between embossed crochet posts and crochet posts, to the required length. </p><h2>  How to knit socks for children? </h2><p>  For kids, socks can be knitted in just 2 to 3 hours.  Crocheting baby socks for beginners will also be a pretty easy task.  After all, they have a very small size, respectively, and it will be necessary to spend very little energy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Crochet a sock start with a cuff.  We collect 16 air loops, connect in a circle with a half-column. </p><p>  We knit 1 loop - lifting - and round 16 columns without crochets. </p><p>  Thus, we make 34 rows, fold the resulting ‚Äútube‚Äù in half and connect both edges with half-columns. </p><p>  Then we knit in circular rows, vertically there are columns without crochets - 8 rows for the back walls. </p><p>  Now we need to form a heel and knit 18 single crochet stitches for the heel wall.  Turn knitting and knit another row.  So we continue 7 rows. </p><p>  We divide these 18 stitches into 3 segments and knit the first 6 with half-columns, the next 7 with single crochets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baby socks" class="if uuid-2699808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699808.jpg"></div><p>  We pull the thread from two loops, leaving the loops on the hook, stretch the working thread through all 3. Turn and knit 7 single crochet from the next loop from the loop.  Also turn down the second end.  Repeat until the end of all loops. </p><p>  We go round and round in the corner we decrease, knitting one out of two loops. </p><p>  We decrease in each row in the corners.  We continue 6 times. </p><p>  We knit a toe - 23 rows, at the end we will gradually begin to decrease - 4 times in a row to the end.  Fasten and hide the thread inside the sock.  In the same way, tie the second. </p><h2>  The easiest way to knit socks </h2><p>  The most inexperienced craftswoman will surely be able to handle the work of crocheting socks with crochets, as this is very simple.  Work goes in any direction: from top to bottom, and vice versa. </p><p>  Let's go from the cuff. </p><p>  Dial a chain of 23 loops, connect into a ring.  Tie a row of single crochet posts by connecting them with a half-column. </p><p>  1 loop of lifting - and we knit another 34 rows.  Divide in half and mark with colored thread or markers.  We knit to the middle of the single crochet, 1 eyelet for lifting.  Turn the knitting and make 22 columns.  So we repeat 4 rows. </p><p>  Next 12 columns and 1 air loop. </p><p>  We turn and add 6 single crochet, connecting the seventh with the side. </p><p>  Turn over and repeat all the steps.  We close the heel, tying it and making reductions in the corners, where it goes to the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetknitpattern.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishnet socks" class="if uuid-2699799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699799.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to tie the toe to the required length, decreasing on the toe.  Fasten the thread inside the product. </p><h2>  How wonderful are DIY socks? </h2><p>  We can easily purchase any items of our clothing in stores.  And yet we continue to crochet or knit socks.  This is pretty easy to explain. </p><p>  Firstly, no one will have the same socks - they are unique and inimitable! </p><p>  Secondly, they are of high quality.  Creating things for ourselves and our loved ones, we try to do it as best as possible! </p><p>  They are very fashionable - in our time, any knitted thing follows fashion, and there are plenty of models. </p><p>  Knitted socks are very practical, since the yarn is selected according to the season and can either warm or simply decorate, for example, summer openwork. </p>
