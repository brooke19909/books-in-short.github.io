    <p>  The only thing that can overshadow the rest is the lack of Russian-speaking staff.  All entertainment programs are conducted in German, as the hotel is aimed at citizens from Germany.  If you analyze all the reviews left from the opening of the hotel until today, then we can conclude that the institution is being improved.  Here every year the level of service improves, which allows guests of any age to spend their time in excellent conditions. </p>
