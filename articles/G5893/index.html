  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of education in the CIS countries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Higher education problems are a number of difficulties that entrants, students and teachers encounter, as well as a list of shortcomings in the <span>educational system</span> that directly affect <span>the labor market.</span> </p><p>  Today in the <span>CIS countries</span> this problem is very acute.  The transition from one system to another turned out to be painful for almost all areas of life: economic, political, medical, and, including, educational.  Some reforms were undertaken by the authorities of these states, however, most of them were ineffective.  This happened because educational problems were formed under the influence of many factors, and in order to improve the state of this sphere, an integrated approach is needed, which few people are ready to seriously do for various reasons: from lack of interest to elementary inability. </p><p>  The problems of modern education at present are mainly concerned only with the layer of intelligentsia and scientific workers who work directly in this area and feel very acutely all its shortcomings.  There is also a small part of students, graduates, and even less - applicants who have already been affected by educational reforms that are far from ideal and the quality of teaching.  As you know, to solve any problem (even the most difficult) can only those for whom this is really a problem, and since those interested do not have a number of powers, and those who by and large do not need it, have, the educational sphere has been abandoned.  Indeed, sometimes minimal attempts are made to change something in it, but their quality and the general superficial approach suggest that only the appearance of a desire to change something is created. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, we will consider the main problems related to education, which are present in almost every CIS country. </p><p>  <strong>Education Issues: Narrow Specialization</strong> </p><p>  Here we find a contradiction between narrow specialization and a wide range of industries in each profession.  Universities offer a number of specialties, which, in fact, are very vague: psychologists, managers, lawyers, economists, and so on.  The labor market focuses on narrower specializations, but young specialists are not prepared for specific industries and are familiar with them quite distantly due to the predominance of general subjects in the list of studied disciplines.  So, it turns out that the whole world is striving to live in a modern Western manner (the need for specialists of a narrow profile), and educational services are morally obsolete, people with a wide profile of skills are graduating. </p><p>  The <span>problem of choosing a</span> profession can also be attributed here: people of working specialties are sorely lacking, while crowds of lawyers and economists, who are already in surplus, are annually released into the street.  And few make efforts to balance this flow. </p><p>  <strong>Problems of education: economic component</strong> </p><p>  Financing is one of the most painful topics, for sure, not only in the educational sphere.  This manifests itself in the low quality of education, which, unfortunately, many universities can offer.  In capital and large cities, this does not concern so much, but in smaller centers, outflow of specialists regularly occurs due to poor financing.  Basically, the problem lies precisely in low salaries, which force talented people to stop teaching and research and devote themselves to another field. </p><p>  However, some of them still remain, and they are very valuable employees who produce good specialists. </p><p>  <strong>Education Issues: Cultural Trends</strong> </p><p>  Also, at present there is a problem of the cultural development of society.  Under the influence of various factors, most young people are not interested in getting an education; they need material evidence that they have mastered a certain profession, more than knowledge and skills.  This also does not improve the overall educational picture; some propaganda of the value of knowledge and skills that are useful to the whole society is probably necessary.  The media made a great contribution to this: the systematic translation of base values ‚Äã‚Äãand stupid examples of behavior, as well as an infantile attitude to life, realized its educational function in a negative way. </p><p>  Thus, the problems of education are grouped into one global, which is difficult to eliminate, but possible.  At the same time, it is too naive to shift all responsibility to state managers: the problems of society should be solved by the same society, or, at least, with its participation, and not by individual elite groups.  Everyone should take the first step, having formed a conscious attitude to what surrounds him. </p>
