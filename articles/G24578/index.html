    <h2>  Club Hotel Location </h2><p>  The hotel club lurks in the pine forest of the village of Titreengel, from which it is six to the town of Manavgat and seven kilometers to Side.  It is 60 kilometers from the international airport in Antalya. </p><p>  Side is a resort town, chosen by travelers from all over the world.  It is recognized as a major shopping center and open-air museum at the same time.  Tourists come into contact with ancient history, visiting ancient theaters and temples, and purchase worthwhile goods at a bargain price, looking at modern shopping complexes and at the ancient markets of the resort town of Side.

Own spotlessly clean beach, framing the sea with azure waters, is located across the street from the hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The snow-white buildings of the club hotel were erected in 1985.  The last renovation in it was made in 2012.  Guests are accommodated in two four-story buildings and several bungalows surrounded by a beautiful park. </p><p>  The Maya Golf Hotel's garden is carefully monitored: lawn and shrubs are regularly mowed, they look after flower beds and constantly clean.  In the evening twilight, when the lights next to the pools light up, and lanterns flash along the paths and next to the trees, the park turns into a fairy garden. </p><p>  Rare plants and typical palm trees, pomegranate and orange trees are used in the arrangements.  A freshwater pond inhabited by fish and turtles organically blended into the landscape of the park.  Nimble lizards hastily scurry along neat alleys and land turtles slowly move.  In the <span>crowns of the trees</span> , bell-voiced birds found their abode, their restless trills of the day-day are heard in the vicinity of the park. </p>

    <p>  The generous buffet has cold and hot dishes, sweets and pastries, fruits and vegetables.  Trying everything for the first three days, for the fourth guests already know exactly what dishes they liked and what food should no longer be put on their plate.  And the point here is not the poor quality of the dishes, but a specific combination of tastes, enhanced by oriental spices.  What Eastern people eat with enthusiasm is not at all accepted by Europeans. </p><p>  The sand and pebble beach with a moderately steep entrance to the water is simply amazing.  Waves running along the coast, rolling pebbles and blowing grains of sand into the deeps of the sea, and staff diligently sifting sand and leveling it, constantly change the outlines.  In the morning, washed sun loungers stand on a flat and clean sand cover.  The beach bar offers satisfying unpretentious dishes and quench your thirst with delicious drinks. </p><p>  Paradise conditions have been created for children at the Maya Golf Hotel HV2.  Parents' reviews are unequivocal: children are in love with animators who mess around with them day and night.  Thanks to them, children have a ‚Äúwar paint‚Äù on bodies and faces, drawings on T-shirts and other permitted objects, which the fantasy of children and creative guardians managed to capture.  The kids, inspired by the animators, enjoy dancing, enthusiastically embarking on sports, competitions and other entertainments that bring joy. </p><p>  Animation for adults is not a bit behind the children‚Äôs animation.  Respectable uncles and aunts are being pulled here in two counts in the unloved morning exercises, carried out in buildings or on the beach.  They do not even have time to blink an eye, as they already receive water aerobics or tennis lessons, play volleyball or football, participate in contests and quizzes, watch evening performances.  However, by eleven o'clock in the evening all entertainment ends, the hotel is quiet until morning.  Fans of a colorful night's rest, get out of the hotel, go to Side or Manavgat. </p>
