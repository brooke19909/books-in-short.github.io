People around the world are chasing both ancient and modern specimens.  States also support this passion by issuing various commemorative money, for example, in honor of the Olympics or prominent cities.  Depending on the year of manufacture, the number of elements in the series, the mint, their value varies.  No exception were <span>10 ruble coins</span> made of two metals from a series of the most ancient Russian cities. </p><h2>  When did </h2><p>  Anniversary 10 rubles "Ancient cities of Russia" first came into circulation in 2002.  The coin is made of silver-white cupronickel with a gold brass edging with a diameter of 27 mm.  On one side is an image of a certain ancient city.  The issue is still ongoing - the last coin with the city of Gorokhovets was issued in 2018. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Commemorative coins of Russia" class="if uuid-2925066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109919/2925066.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the price of one coin of 10 rubles "Ancient Cities of Russia" differs depending on the circulation, mint and year of issue, as well as its condition (from 50 to 500 rubles).  If until 2007 each copy was produced by its own mint, then until 2009 several copies were produced by both yards.  A full set can be purchased on the Internet or at numismatic markets and fairs, the cost is up to 10,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The circulation of each instance is 5 million coins.  They can also be found in circulation, having received for delivery in stores, public transport or directly at banks.  At the moment, there are images of 39 cities. </p><h2>  Mints </h2><p>  In the Russian Federation, two yards are engaged in minting coins, orders, medals, etc.: St. Petersburg and Moscow.  The place of issue of each coin can be viewed next to its face value. </p><p>  The mint of St. Petersburg is the oldest, so the cost of 10 rubles ‚ÄúAncient Cities of Russia‚Äù issued by it is slightly higher.  His products are of the highest quality, as the best high-tech equipment is used there, as well as invaluable experience accumulated and enhanced since the 18th century.  Peter I, of course, became the founding father. An interesting fact is that in the history of this court there is also the experience of minting coins for other countries, for example, the Netherlands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinsplanet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mint St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2925053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109919/2925053.jpg"></div><p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the tradition of indicating the distinctive sign of a particular mint came into practice.
