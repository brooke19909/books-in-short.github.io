    <h2>  CPU and its features </h2><p>  In September last year, sales of this device started, and it can still be purchased.  It is not necessary to expect high performance from the processor that is installed in it.  But still, things are not so bad in this regard with the <span>Lenovo A850.</span>  Reviews of satisfied owners only convince of this.  It is based on the most common 4-core chip today - it is MTK6582M from the leading developer of such chips, MediaTEC.  The frequency of this CPU can vary in the range from 300 MHz (minimum load on computing resources) and up to 1.3 GHz (peak performance mode).  Also dynamically changes the number of cores involved.  With minimal load, only one computing module is in operation.  But in maximum mode all 4 cores work at once.  But all this is just a theory.  If we go to practice, then on such a hardware, such a resource-intensive game as Asphalt 7 starts without problems.  By the way, it is installed as standard.  So you can evaluate the real level of computing power of this gadget immediately after purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Graphics Accelerator </h2><p>  As a graphic adapter in the smartphone Lenovo Ideaphone A850 400MP2 from the company "Mali" is used.  It harmoniously complements the MTK659M 4-core processor and allows you to fully reveal its potential.  Also, such a decision by Chinese engineers ensures smooth scrolling of the image on the smartphone screen. </p><h2>  Screen and its characteristics </h2><p>  The chip of this device is the screen.  Its diagonal is a record 5.5 inches.  In the initial segment among branded devices, he simply has no competitors.  Its resolution is 960 pixels in length and 540 pixels in width.  The pixel density in this case is 200 PPI.  If you look closely, you can consider the points from which the image is formed.  Display brightness is acceptable.  It is built on the basis of a fairly high-quality IPS matrix.  Viewing angles are close to 180 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Body and ergonomics </h2><p>  Three design options for this smartphone are on sale right away: white, gold and black.  The greatest demand, as you might guess, is the Lenovo A850 BLACK.  It does not get so dirty so much, and the scratches on its surface are not so noticeable.  This is a great solution for those who need a stylish and respectable phone.  But the modifications of Lenovo A850 GOLD and WHITE will appeal to the fairer sex.  In form, this model is a candy bar with touch input.  The entire body of the device is made of glossy plastic.  Therefore, without a protective film and a cover in this case, you just can not do.  They will have to buy extra.  The front panel displays a conversational speaker, a light and proximity sensor, as well as a camera for making video calls.  Below the screen are the buttons "Home", "Menu" and "Back".  Immediately it is worth noting that there is no backlight in them and it will be problematic to work on this device in complete darkness.  The volume buttons are located on the right edge of the smartphone.  In turn, the shutdown button with a 3.5 mm connector is located above the screen.  At the bottom is the MicroUSB jack, which is used to charge the battery or connect to a personal computer.  The main camera and a loud speaker are displayed on the back cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Like every device of this class, two cameras are installed in the <span>Lenovo A850.</span>  Their <span>characteristics</span> are rather modest.  Let's start with the main one, which is displayed on the back of the device.  It is based on a 5 MP matrix.  There is auto focus and LED backlight.  But there is no image stabilization system, and this is a serious drawback.  But with the video, everything is fine, and you can make videos in the quality of ‚ÄúHD‚Äù, that is, with a resolution of 1920 pixels in length and 1080 pixels in width.  The second camera is displayed on the front side of the gadget, and it is based on a 2 megapixel matrix.  Her main task is making video calls, and she copes with this excellently. </p><h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  The memory subsystem of the Lenovo IDEAPHONE A850 is fairly standardly organized.  This is the "classic" 1 GB of RAM standard DDR3.  This volume is quite enough to run most applications, including resource-intensive ones.  Built-in flash memory - 4 GB.  It is broken as follows: 800 MB is the place for installing software, 1.2 GB is occupied by the OS and 2 GB is intended for storing personal data of the user of a smart phone.  As experience shows, this volume is often not enough for comfortable work.  Therefore, you can not do without an external drive format MicroSD.  You can install a card with a maximum capacity of 32 GB in a smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  The boxed version of the device </h2><p>  The <span>Lenovo A850</span> mobile phone in terms of configuration can not boast of something unusual.  Among the documentation there is a multilingual instruction manual and <span>warranty card.</span>  Everything else is standard too: </p><ul><li>  The smartphone itself. </li><li>  2250 milliampere / hour battery. </li><li>  Modest speaker system. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Universal cord with MicroUSB connector.  It can be used both to charge the battery and to exchange information with a PC. </li></ul><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Weak battery at 2250 milliamps / hours for Lenovo A850. <strong> </strong>  The reviews of the owners of this gadget say something completely different.  Its capacity is enough for 2 days of active use of the device.  Given the hardware and diagonal display, this is an excellent indicator today.  Here, most likely, the Lenovo engineers worked hard.  Their merit lies in the fact that this device can function for so long on one battery charge.  If the device is in sleep mode, then the battery life will increase to one week. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  An interesting situation is obtained with the software of the Lenovo A850.  The firmware in the initial state indicates the version of the Android OS with the serial number "4.2.2".  This is the most popular release of this operating system to date.  But it was not installed in a "clean" form, but with a number of add-ons.  To optimize the system interface for the needs of the user, Lenovo Laucher is installed.  It is supplemented by a set of the following utilities: Norton Security antivirus, Evernot messenger, Skype and the AccuWeather weather forecast widget.  An interesting situation on this gadget is with browsers.  There are two of them installed on this smartphone: ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù and ‚ÄúUC browser‚Äù.  Each of them occupies a place in the device‚Äôs memory, and it is impossible to uninstall any of them.  Four excellent toys at once are installed on "A850".  First of all, it is worth highlighting the previously mentioned ‚Äú7th asphalt‚Äù, which is supplemented by Block Break 3, Little Big City and Gameloft Store. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  A rich set of communications at the A850.  Among them are the following: </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi is the primary way to communicate with the global web.  In this case, the speed can reach a phenomenal 150 Mbps.  The most common standards for this wireless method of transmitting information are supported: b, g and n. </li><li>  Bluetooth is a universal method for exchanging data with similar devices.  It is great for transferring music, videos, photos and small text documents. </li><li>  Support for 2nd and 3rd generation networks.  It is possible to install 2 SIM cards at once, but they will work in Stand By mode, that is, if you are talking on one of them, the second will be out of the access zone.  The maximum speed of information transfer in third-generation networks can reach 21 Mbit / s, but with 2G everything is very deplorable.  A maximum of several hundred kilobytes. </li><li>  To determine the location of the device on the ground, you can use a GPS transmitter. </li><li>  Among wired interfaces, MicroUSB can be distinguished, which is used to connect to a PC. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Reviews and CVs </h2><p>  An excellent entry-level smartphone was the <span>Lenovo A850.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> across the internet on related thematic resources indicate this.  A large screen with a diagonal of 5.5 inches, an excellent combination of a central processor and a graphics adapter, a long battery life, a reasonable price of $ 150 - these are the advantages that allow you to stand out from the competition.  Of course, this device also has disadvantages.  First of all, you need to highlight the case, which is completely made of plastic.  Therefore, without a protective film and a cover, the owners of this device simply can not do.  Also, sound quality is far from the best.  And the camera can not boast of outstanding technical characteristics.  But do not forget that the devices of the Lenovo company with the index "A" belong to the budget segment.  Therefore, to expect something supernatural from the same Lenovo A850 BLACK, for example, is not necessary.  This is just an inexpensive and high-quality entry-level smartphone with a large screen size. </p>
