It is located in a very prestigious area called Beldibi.  Despite such a small "star", this hotel stands right on the beach and has a very large territory.  Next to her are many different shops and decent inexpensive cafes.  The hotel is not very new, it consists only of old and new buildings.  But the level of services and comfort in it is not inferior to hotels of a higher category.  So, consider this interesting hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer managed the garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/310631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <strong>Kemer, "Able Garden."</strong>  <strong>general description</strong> </h2><p>  This is a small hotel.  There are only sixty rooms with basic amenities.  Eight more are two-room suites or rooms for families.  Although the rooms are small, they are very clean and tidy.  The view from the windows in the new building is to the sea, and from the old to very beautiful mountains.  The hotel area is very green and beautiful, there is where to walk, including with a child - lawns, swings ... Nearby is a wild beach with picturesque cliffs.  People who really came to rest calmly and relaxed will be completely satisfied.  More active tourists prefer to dilute the sea and sun baths with excursions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <strong>Food and beach</strong> </h2><p>  The hotel has two restaurants, as well as three bars, including one on the beach.  The coast itself is pebble, although there are areas with bulk sand.  But this is not very characteristic for a resort such as Kemer.  ‚ÄúSumela Garden‚Äù provides its guests with the opportunity to swim in two pools, one of which has a children's section.  Everywhere flowers and palm trees.  The hotel has its own pier, there are always enough sun loungers on the beach, and they do not need to be occupied from early morning.  The sea is clear and clean, and if there is a storm, you can always sit with a glass of wine by the pool.  Pebbles are small, walking on it is comfortable.  From the pontoon you can dive if desired.  From the beach you can see beautiful mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel managed garden kemer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/310640.jpg" width="600"></div>
