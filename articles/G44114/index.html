    <p>  The landscape style, popular during the reign of Peter the Great, was partially preserved in the garden.  It turned out to save some trees, whose age is more than one hundred years old.  With the advent of the twentieth century, the garden fell into decay, and during the Great Patriotic War, bomb shelters were organized on the territory of the Pharmaceutical Garden. </p><p>  Only at the end of the twentieth century did the reconstruction of the garden begin.  In addition to reconstructing the greenhouse buildings, plant collections began to replenish. </p><h2>  The variety of plants "Pharmaceutical garden" </h2><p>  The Arboretum Garden Arboretum occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfour hectares and includes several expositions of open ground plants.  These are species of the olive, hydrangea, maples, ferns, creepers, and much more. </p><p>  The attention of visitors is also presented palm, succulent, subtropical greenhouses.  The Palm Greenhouse, organized in 1891, is open to visitors throughout the year.  There is a unique collection of palm trees and other tropical plants.  Many of them are endangered species.  An exhibition of orchids "Tropical Winter" is held annually in the palm greenhouse. </p><p>  Succulents are located on the second floor of the building above the palm greenhouse.  This is one of the largest collections of succulents in Russia.  The subtropical greenhouse is still under reconstruction.  Particular attention should be paid to the collection greenhouse.  It occupies four buildings: tropical, bromeliad, orchid greenhouses. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden of Moscow State University </h2><p>  The garden covers a vast area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 hectares.  The main part of his collection is plants growing in the open.  The arboretum is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 9 hectares.  More than a thousand names of woody plants grow there. </p>

The main activity of the university garden is scientific activity, so free walks in the territory are prohibited.  Sightseeing and thematic excursions are held for garden visitors. </p><h2>  Museum-Reserve Tsaritsyno </h2><p>  The Tsaritsyno Palace and Park Ensemble opened its doors to visitors on September 2, 2007, on Moscow City Day.  The first owner of the estate was the princes of Cantemira.  At that time, it was called the black mud.  It was then that the first greenhouses and orchards were created. </p><p>  Later, Empress Catherine II acquired the property.  She gave the village a new name - Tsaritsyno, ordered to organize a royal residence here and expand the greenhouses.  After the empress, the estate changed several owners, the greenhouse complex in Tsaritsyno was leased for a long time.  By the end of the twentieth century, the complex fell into decay.  Reconstruction began only in 2005. </p>
