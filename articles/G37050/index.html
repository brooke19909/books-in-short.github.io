This requires only desire and patience. </p><p>  Many people like to put origami figures from triangular modules.  Such an activity is so pleasant and fascinating that, as soon as you master one model, you immediately want to collect something else, get new schemes and discover new opportunities.  The origami technique creates a wide variety of crafts, ranging from souvenirs to useful gadgets in everyday life.  Those people who are familiar with folding origami figures can easily create an original origami "Hare".  Such a voluminous bunny will be assembled using the modular origami technique. </p><p>  <span>The modular origami</span> "Hare" will bring you a lot of pleasant minutes.  You will get real pleasure from the result of your work.  The main approaches are standard for all origami work, but there are also new tricks.  We will talk about them in more detail when describing the work. </p><p>  1. In total, our origami "Hare" will consist of 522 triangular modules.  At the same time, only white modules from office paper can be made for work.  If you wish, you can decorate the product by taking 120 color and 402 white triangular modules. <br>  Our origami "Hare" will be dressed in a sweater that can be made plain or striped.  Five rows are going for this part.  Each strip consists of 24 modules. </p><p>  For our model, 24 blue and 48 blue and yellow modules were taken.  We take the first 48 white modules and collect the first rows from them.  Insert the corners of the other two into the pockets of one of the modules.  As a result, the first row is assembled from the modules on the left, and from the ones on the right, the second, respectively.  We connect the next two modules in the same way to the first, collecting a chain, which we close in the ring with the last module. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Assemble the third row, putting on the modules with a checkerboard.  Gently twist the circle, turning it into a bowl.  The first row serves as a stand and is practically not visible from the side. </p><p>  Take 24 modules for the fourth row.  It is best done in blue, fixing them a little higher, pushing the lower end.  This will allow the sweater to "separate" a little from the body.  The following four rows are performed in exactly the same way. </p><p>  3. Take 24 white modules and put on their last blue row, turning the short side out.  This series must be done already in the previous series.  This result is achieved by placing the white modules on the finished row by the other side. </p><p>  4. In the next row, we increase by 6 modules: for each 4th module, two modules must be put on.  In this row, the modules are turned outwards with the long side. </p><p>  5. As a result, the number of modules used in a row will increase to 30. Assembling the following rows, we create a head consisting of eight rows.  In the last row, we bring the modules together, giving a roundness to the head.  At this stage, the modular origami "Hare" is partially ready.  Now we need to make ears. </p><p>  6. For the eyelet in the front row, we will fix 6 modules on the head.  The second row is assembled from 5 modules, and the third - again from 6. At the same time, the outermost modules must be worn on the extreme corners of the rows.  Thus, we perform seven rows of abalone, and in the eighth we perform narrowing.  To do this, put the extreme modules on the three ends of the row.  The eighth row of the eye consists of 5 modules, and the ninth - only of 4.  The two middle modules in this row should be placed above the extreme ones.  Our origami "Hare" must have two ears, therefore, we will perform the second ear. </p><p>  7. This completes the assembly of origami.  The hare, the manufacturing scheme of which is presented in this article, is almost ready.  We turn to its design: draw, cut and glue the following details to it: a muzzle, eyes, a collar and pens that can be cut out of thick paper and glued between the modules. </p>
