Consider this type of government in more detail. </p><h2>  General definition </h2><p>  To understand what constitutes a monarchy, you need to know its definition.  If a monarchy is that form of government where only one ruler is in power, having inherited his power and exercising it for life, then what is a "bourgeois monarchy"?  The definition is not too different and sounds like this: this is a form of government where all power is in the same hands, which inherited it, carry out for life and rely on such a class system as the bourgeoisie. </p>

    <h2>  The main features of the bourgeois monarchy </h2><p>  There are just a few features that distinguish this type of monarchy from others.  First of all, this is the participation of representatives of the class class in the management of the entire state.  In addition, it is important to say that this segment of the population is also involved in the drafting of various legislative acts. </p><p>  The second distinguishing feature was the fact that this bourgeois monarchy is taking shape under conditions that imply the centralization of all political power.  All classes were represented differently in the state system - they were at different levels, due to which they carried different significance.  It is surprising that some legislative and legislative bodies of that time have survived to this day and are parliaments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The third distinguishing feature of the bourgeois monarchy is the limited authority of the monarch.  This can be explained by the fact that there was a very rapid development of monetary and commodity relations.  This greatly undermined all the fundamental foundations on which the subsistence economy of the state rested.  This is precisely what became the prerequisite for the emergence of a bourgeois monarchy.  This gave an impetus to political centralization, after which the power of the monarch was limited to representative-estate bodies. </p><p>  All this in combination constitutes the main features of the bourgeois monarchy. </p><h2>  The bourgeoisie as a separate layer of society </h2><p>  The bourgeois monarchy in Russia had its place.  It was characterized by the presence of the bourgeois class in the social and economic composition of society.  The bourgeoisie is a prosperous layer of the population in the state. </p>

    <p>  The bourgeois monarchy was based precisely on this layer of the population.  Representatives of the then bourgeoisie are precisely those people who were members of the legislative bodies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russian state </h2><p>  In 1861, when the peasant reform was completed, the development of the capitalist system in Russia began.  The rapid growth of all domestic industry began.  In addition, the bourgeois monarchy contributed to a very quick and strong stratification of the entire social structure.  The entire landlord economy was turned into capitalist economy, market relations intensified, which became the impetus for the construction of railways - new trade routes. </p>

    <p>  After the death of Nicholas I, his son Alexander II was forced to carry out peasant reform.  Following it was necessary to carry out many other reforms that were directly related to the bourgeois system in the state. </p><h2>  Change in the state apparatus </h2><p>  New state organizations appeared in Russia.  Their activities did not differ much from previous departments and ministries, but representatives of the wealthy stratum, that is, the bourgeoisie, began to be more often members of them.  The authorities have expanded their area of ‚Äã‚Äãauthority.  Ministers, as a rule, began to be appointed noblemen-officials.  Bourgeois entrepreneurship, meanwhile, began to play an increasingly important role in the life of the state.  The government autocratic apparatus increasingly took into account the views of the nobles and representatives of the bourgeoisie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The overthrow of the bourgeois monarchy </h2><p>  The overthrow of this type of monarchy occurred during the period when Vladimir Lenin came to power.  Everyone knows that he created the necessary methods of getting rid of the "kulaks" - the prosperous stratum of the population.  When the whole population lost their personal economy, uniting into collective and Soviet farms, the prosperous, that is, the bourgeois layer of the population simply did not become. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is worth noting such a historical fact as the implementation of a huge number of various reforms that were supposed to completely eradicate the bourgeoisie.  Lenin fought for the equality of all people both socially and economically.  Vladimir Ilyich considered the main task to make all property and land property state.  When people had all the benefits equally divided, and most of the other benefits belonged to the state, then the bourgeoisie was completely eradicated in Russia. </p><h2>  French Republic </h2><p>  The struggle against feudalism did not pass by France. </p><p>  The bourgeois monarchy in France originates in the Middle Ages, when the separation of the urban population and peasants began to take place.  Then the rich or prosperous layer of the population had much more rights and opportunities than the poor.  In the Middle Ages, all the townspeople who were in their mass much less than the inhabitants of villages and villages were considered bourgeois. </p><p>  After a while, bourgeoisie in France began to be called absolutely all sections of the population, except the privileged. </p><h2>  After some time </h2><p>  Very soon, this term began to have a slightly different meaning, defining a narrower meaning.  He began to relate more to the terminology of the "third estate."  This estate was distinguished by the fact that they needed to pay all taxes. </p>

    <p>  The more feudalism left, the more wealthy the bourgeois class in France was considered.  After the bourgeois revolution in the Netherlands, the bourgeoisie began to appear throughout Europe as an ardent supporter of revolutionary movements that supported the overthrow of the feudal elite of the state. </p><p>  The main difference between the European bourgeoisie was that it was clearly differentiated.  Both rich craftsmen and poor artisans belonged to her class.  This was due to the fact that the income from all of them was not at the expense of their hired labor, but at the expense of other citizens who purchased various goods and services, giving their money for it. </p><h2>  The bourgeoisie as the cause of the class struggle </h2><p>  The more capitalism developed, the more the bourgeoisie was stratified.  Large owners were the top of this class, but this top was very small.  People more and more sought in cities, science and art developed, and the scope of services expanded.  All this became prerequisites for the emergence of a poorer bourgeoisie, which was dissatisfied with its position and strongly supported capitalist views. </p><p>  In 1789, the division into estates in France ceased.  Now there were only two social classes: the bourgeoisie and the working people.  The revolution that took place in France was able to bring these two classes to the same legal level, that is, at the end of it, both classes had the same amount of rights and freedoms.  However, such a coup nevertheless entailed a separation on economic grounds.  This was what served as the class struggle in the nineteenth century. </p><h2>  General conclusion on this topic </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can give a clear definition of this form of government.  The bourgeois monarchy is that monarchy which is based on the bourgeoisie, in the state apparatus of which the bourgeois layer of the population takes part.  All the support of the state consists of a rich, wealthy stratum of the population, who receives their income from the townspeople and villagers for the sale or provision of their goods and services. </p><p>  What is the essence of the bourgeois monarchy?  Why was it needed?  We can say that the bourgeoisie has become rather a side effect of the rapid development of economic and trade relations.  This is quite predictable, because not all of the population managed to raise their incomes and reduce costs in certain conditions. </p>

    <p>  In concluding, it can be noted that the division of society into two classes ‚Äî the bourgeoisie and the poor ‚Äî was inevitable.  Since the emergence of the state as a legal institution, the entire population has always consisted of poor and rich people.  However, it is important to understand that the bourgeoisie received its income precisely from the fact that it sold its goods and services, due to which it had a solid financial basis. </p><p>  In addition, it should be remembered that it was thanks to the representatives of the bourgeois class that entrepreneurship began to develop in the world.  It has already been said above that bourgeoisie were considered not only large businessmen, but also small artisans selling products of their own manufacture. </p><p>  Despite the fact that today it is not customary to distinguish the bourgeoisie as a separate class, it still has a place to be.  This can include absolutely all large entrepreneurs and businessmen who have huge income from their firms, corporations and other enterprises.  To date, the bourgeoisie supposedly does not exist, but this economic class of the population is simply called differently.  In fact, this is the same bourgeoisie, leading a prosperous lifestyle, having a huge amount of benefits for its life, provided with all means in order to realize any of your desires. </p>
