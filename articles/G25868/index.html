Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Numerous islands with picturesque shores, places for pilgrimage, beach vacations and excellent fishing conditions - every year tens of thousands of travelers come to Lake Seliger.  Wildlife lovers spend the night in camps, and for those who value comfort and coziness, Ostashkov hotels are open.  This small town captivates with its provincialism and measured way of life. </p><h2>  Far from the metropolis </h2><p>  Ostashkov is often called the capital of Seliger - from here you can get to the main attractions of the lake on a boat, enjoy the architecture of the 18-19th century, enjoy plenty of blueberries, smoked fish and mushrooms, or just relax from the frantic rhythm of life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of ostashkov" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1312676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is interesting that the city is at the same distance from two megacities.  The bus journey from St. Petersburg takes 7 hours, and the journey on the Moscow-Ostashkov train will last 12 hours. </p><p>  An ideal option for a trip would be a personal car, because the most interesting places are scattered over tens of kilometers.  Public transport here runs on schedule - sometimes you can only get from one village to another by morning bus. </p><h2>  Seliger </h2><p>  Everyone who is accustomed to luxury and hotel service, we advise you to moderate your expectations.  Ostashkov hotels do not belong to well-known international chains, but they can also provide travelers with everything they need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The five-story building in the city center certainly stands out from the rest of the buildings.  Hotel ‚ÄúSeliger‚Äù (Ostashkov, Microdistrict 5) can accommodate up to 180 people at a time. </p><p>  The rooms are quite modest, but there is the necessary furniture, a separate bathroom, a TV and a refrigerator.  In addition to double and triple rooms, Seliger offers accommodation options for large groups.  Rooms designed for twelve people are suitable for students, schoolchildren or pilgrims. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel ostashkov" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1312675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Opinion of the guests </h2><p>  A grocery store, cafe and tour desk are located on site.  A walk from the station will take only 15 minutes, but the administration is always ready to provide a transfer or order a taxi. </p><p>  Traveler reviews are not advised to stay at this hotel for longer than one night.  Perhaps the only advantage of staying guests consider the location.  Paid parking is available nearby.  Everything reminds of the times of the USSR here: from the old building and furniture to the level of service.  According to guests, low prices are quite consistent with the situation and the lack of familiar comfort. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúCoastal‚Äù </h2><p>  Planning a trip to Seliger and Ostashkov?  The Beregovaya Hotel promises travelers a break from the bustle of the city and an atmosphere of calm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Within walking distance is a convent, a sandy beach, shops, a museum of local lore and much more.  The bus and train stations are just ten minutes away by car. </p><p>  The hotel ‚ÄúBeregovaya‚Äù received the first guests in 2014.  Today it offers comfortable rooms in a small two-story house, equipped with their own shower and toilet, LCD TV and a set of cosmetic accessories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ostashkov hotel coastal" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1312635.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The guest house has free parking and a 24-hour front desk.  For travelers, a bar and a restaurant serving European cuisine are open.  There is a sauna in a separate building. </p><h2>  Poison smell </h2><p>  Responsive staff, hearty breakfasts and a cozy atmosphere - the Beregovaya guest house has a good rating among travelers.  It successfully combines proximity to the main city attractions and Lake Seliger.  There is a barbecue in the courtyard. </p><p>  The impression of relaxation, according to guests, spoils the characteristic smell of hydrogen sulfide, which smells of water.  Unfortunately, Ostashkov hotels are not able to affect the health of the city sewer.  In addition, not all rooms have refrigerators, and the Internet only works near the reception. </p><h2>  "Oryol" </h2><p>  Advantageous location differs hotel ‚ÄúOrlovskaya‚Äù (Ostashkov, St. Orlovsky, 1).  There are always many tourists and pilgrims in the city, so some travelers especially appreciate privacy.  ‚ÄúOrlovskaya‚Äù is located in a quiet corner of Ostashkov, on the border with the Klichen peninsula and its magnificent sandy beach.  A ten minute walk is the river station, where you can go on the most fascinating walks in Seliger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oryol Ostashkov Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1312674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Cozy rooms are available for booking, designed for two or three guests.  Hospitable owners rent catamarans, boats and boats.  A small sauna was built on the shore, after which you can refresh yourself in the lake in summer, and in the ice hole in winter.  At any time, travelers can fry the barbecue on their own, smoke fish and even boil the ear. </p><p>  Guests note the comfort and cleanliness of the hotel.  In the cafe, located on the ground floor, the food is inexpensive and delicious.  In the warm season, there are not enough air conditioners and mosquito nets on the windows. </p><p>  Ostashkov takes tourists all year round.  Hotels set prices for accommodation depending on the season.  From July to August, for example, the cost of accommodation on Oryol Street increases to 500 rubles, which is quite acceptable even for budget travelers. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúEpic‚Äù </h2><p>  Ostashkov hotels are distinguished by a small number of rooms, modest furnishings and a minimum range of services.  Guests from a metropolis can find it difficult to get used to the measured life in the province and the lack of customer focus on the part of the staff. </p><p>  It seems that the city is gradually becoming desolate, so there are fewer ‚Äúdecent‚Äù establishments.  One of the most popular places is considered the hotel "Epos" (Ostashkov, Leninsky Prospect, 136). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel epic ostashkov" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1312831.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the ground floor there is a restaurant, and on the second and third rooms of three categories are located ("luxury", "standard" and "junior suite").  Bath accessories, a TV and the ability to install additional space - there is everything you need for living. </p><p>  Additional services: </p><p>  - laundry room; </p><p>  - meeting room; </p><p>  - luggage storage; </p><p>  - billiards; </p><p>  - repair of shoes and clothes; </p><p>  - bike rental; </p><p>  - organization of excursions; </p><p>  - currency exchange; </p><p>  - beauty saloon. </p><p>  According to travelers, breakfast is included in the price - one of four options to choose from.  The restaurant is popular with the local population, but live music can make it difficult to sleep. </p>
