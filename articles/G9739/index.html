Unification of calculation of damage under compulsory motor liability insurance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 2014, a new methodology for assessing damage after an accident came into force.  The project and the concept of <span>pre-trial dispute resolution</span> were developed by the Ministry of Transport in 2003, but have not been involved for 11 years.  Insurers all this time calculated the damage in their own way.  But, when the plenary session of the Supreme Court extended the Law on Consumer Protection to OSAGO, they decided to recall the document. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The average payment under the insurance policy, according to the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers</span> (RSA), is 36 thousand rubles, and through the court - 50 thousand rubles.  (excluding penalties).  According to statistics, every sixth claim is satisfied.  Insurers suffered losses.  And the victim has to fiddle with papers for a long time.  First 30 days to wait for the first decision.  Then another 20 to challenge it, and after that apply to the court.  Therefore, the RSA remembered that a unified methodology for calculating OSAGO damage was developed, and decided to use it.  It should remove up to 80% of disputes and narrow the gap between expert estimates.  As a result, drivers will receive real money not through a court, but from an insurance company (IC). </p>

    <h2>  Content </h2><p>  The unified method for calculating damage under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance (2014) includes price guides for different territorial zones.  They contain data on the cost of 80 million spare parts for 67 <span>brands of cars,</span> prices of standard hours and certain types of repair work.  These documents determine the procedure for calculating expenses in the event of a decision to conduct restoration work.  The base is the real cost of spare parts, taking into account all customs duties and other markups. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Disagreement </h2><p>  The problem with the appraisers is also solved by a unified method of calculating damage under compulsory motor liability insurance.  The project contains the rules for the examination.  If the company has already concluded an agreement with the appraiser, then the client will have to use his services.  The insurer has the right to inspect a damaged vehicle (TS).  And the owner must provide the car for examination by law.  According to the RSA, a unified method of calculating damage under OSAGO will get rid of unscrupulous car lawyers.  Is this really so, practice will show. </p>

    <h2>  Spare parts </h2><p>  Previously, when calculating damage, the average cost of parts was used.  Insurers could change it at their discretion.  Dissatisfied car owners challenged the decision in court.  In 2013 alone, 600 thousand lawsuits were filed.  While in the USA, courts do not deal with such cases at all, as companies use the officially fixed cost of parts for cars, which nullifies all differences.  For the same purposes, a unified methodology for calculating OSAGO damage has been developed. </p><p>  Since September 1, the regulator has increased the amount of payments for regular and Euro-protocol to 400 thousand rubles.  Amounts may be enough to cover the damage.  That's just it will now be calculated according to new standards.  The handbook was compiled at the ruble exchange rate at the beginning of 2014.  PCA promises to update prices once a year.  Question: what should victims do during this time?  Compensate for losses at your own expense?  Another problem: some types of damage can only be seen on a special stand.  But it is not present in all services, not to mention the appraisers.  As a result, they will not allocate money for the procedure, and the amount of compensation may not be enough for complex repairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Individual settlement </h2><p>  If the car owner has an exclusive part that will not be presented in the directory, then the insurers will calculate the costs in the old way, that is, manually.  To do this, the expert will collect statistics on unit prices and display the average price. </p><h2>  Wear is preserved </h2><p>  <span>Depreciation of the car</span> now depends on the age of the vehicle.  This question has caused a lot of controversy.  Various options were proposed, up to requesting data from the dealer about the production date of a particular machine.  But we stopped at the fact that age will be calculated depending on the number of full years of run.  So insurers will not spend much time on settlements and violate the decision-making deadlines, which are now limited to 20 days.  For middle-class cars, the difference in the calculation of data between the directory and <span>market prices</span> is 20%, and for ‚Äúcool‚Äù cars the difference can reach up to 300%. </p>

    <p>  The unified method of calculating OSAGO damage does not provide wear for all parts.  Without depreciation, the brake and steering system, optics, <span>seat belts</span> will remain - that is, elements without which the operation of the car is prohibited.  For all other parts, prices are based on 50% wear. </p><h2>  A new coefficient has appeared </h2><p>  An individual indicator will be charged if any part is worn out more than it should be by age.  For example, if the car was previously repaired, or a wing with three layers of putty is found at a one-year-old car. </p><h2>  Other nuances </h2><p>  The unified method for calculating OSAGO damage (October, 2014) provides for a calculation error of 10%.  In theory, this figure should be offset by inflation.  In practice, this can be a good loophole to reduce the amount of calculations.  If earlier such problems were solved through the court, now it will be much harder to challenge the decision, because the official document is used in the calculations.  The second minus - the technique does not overlap the old schemes, when payments were completely refused. </p>

    <p>  The situation regarding cars under warranty has changed.  If before the damage on such vehicles was calculated at dealer prices, now the calculation will be carried out according to the directory.  Therefore, if you have a car under warranty, it is better to purchase a CASCO policy. </p><h2>  What do dissatisfied drivers do? </h2><p>  Certain changes have already been made by a unified methodology for calculating CTP insurance.  October 2014 was marked by an increase in tariffs and the maximum size of payments, without which the involvement of the new scheme is impossible.  But it is hardly possible to achieve the results promised by the SAR.  Dissatisfied drivers are left with either a CASCO or go to court.  Both the first and second will bring additional costs.  Therefore, questions arise regarding the appropriateness of the new methodology. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The unified methodology for calculating damage under OSAGO 2003 development came into force only in 2014.  It presents the calculation of spare parts and works for all possible car brands.  Most of the disputes concern prices.  They should be updated once a year.  In the absence of devaluation of the national currency, there should be no problems.  But the methodology does not provide for costly tests, it does not overlap previously existing refusals of payment and contains an allowable calculation error of 10%.  How much insurers will abuse these shortcomings, practice will show. </p>
