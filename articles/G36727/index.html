It is called ‚Äúlittle Paris‚Äù, as if the city absorbed all the charm of the eighteenth century.  Sights of Bordeaux - a wide area surrounded by classic architecture, arched bridges over the river canals, Gothic cathedrals and ancient gates.  Which of these is worth seeing?  Let's find out. </p><h2>  Photos and attractions of Bordeaux </h2><p>  Talking about this city, the French usually do not skimp on words.  He is surrounded by dozens of epithets and enthusiastic assessments.  Strict and romantic, perhaps that is how Bordeaux can be described.  In the Middle Ages, his appearance was influenced by the culture of England, whose kings ruled here until the end of the centenary war. </p><p>  The heyday of the city fell on the XVIII century, thanks to the "triangular trade" between America, Europe and Africa.  Then it already belonged to France, and local authorities decided to make it the most beautiful in the country.  At this time, most of the sights of Bordeaux appeared.  The streets have acquired the features of classicism. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, his fame as a region of winemaking also developed.  Around the city there are many farms where wine is made from merlot, cabernet-sauvignon, bird-verdot, semillon, cabernet-france and other grape varieties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city itself is a major port and tourist center.  More than two million guests visit it annually.  Many cruise ships traveling across the Atlantic Ocean will certainly stop there. </p><p>  In the list of the main attractions of the city of Bordeaux in France, as a rule, the following objects are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Basilica of Saint Michel. </li><li>  The port of the moon. </li><li>  St. Andrew's Cathedral. </li><li>  Pont de Pierre Bridge. </li><li>  Base submarines BETASOM. </li><li>  Museum of Aquitaine. </li><li>  Basilica of Saint-Serenil. </li><li>  Botanical Garden. </li><li>  Telephony Museum of Aquitaine. </li><li>  Wine culture town. </li><li>  Palace of Rogan. </li></ul><h2>  Basilica of Saint-Michel </h2><p>  Not to see <span>this</span> Bordeaux <span>attraction is</span> simply impossible.  The huge spire of the cathedral rises to a height of 114 meters, notifying all guests of the city of its presence.  The construction of the temple began in the XIV century, but ended only in the XVIII.  The result was a beautiful Gothic building with sharp towers decorated with stone "spines" and openwork molding. </p>

    <p>  Inside the cathedral is divided into seventeen chapels.  Each of them belonged to some kind of craft fraternity and is decorated in its own way.  There are marble sculptures of saints, and in the chapel of St. James you can see a wooden carved altar.  There are 22 bells in the tower of Saint-Michel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Port of the moon </h2><p>  The port of the Moon is not one, but a whole complex of attractions of Bordeaux (France).  Now this is the name of the old part of the city, but once there was a fully functioning port.  He served until the 20th century, but then was moved a little lower. </p><p>  The Garonne River, on which Bordeaux stands, wriggles in this place in the shape of a crescent, which is why the port got its name.  Instead of accepting <span>cargo ships,</span> now it receives thousands of tourists.  Its warehouses were overgrown with pedestrian streets, and historical ships remained for the entertainment of guests.  The Colbert vessel, for example, has become a restaurant and museum. </p>

    <p>  The port of the moon is surrounded by a huge complex of classic and neoclassical buildings and structures.  Here is the famous Market Square, the Bolshoi Theater, the Cayo Gate, the city hall and the Rogan Palace.  The former port and the entire architectural ensemble are listed in UNESCO as a unique example of the Enlightenment. </p><h2>  Pont de Pierre Bridge </h2><p>  Pont de Pierre is the longest bridge in all of France and the oldest in Bordeaux.

    <p>  The river flow here is very strong and the crossing through it was accompanied by a number of difficulties.  Nevertheless, a stone bridge appeared in Bordeaux only in the 19th century.  It was built by order of Napoleon Bonaparte.  As a sign of this, each of the seventeen spans was decorated with the profile of a great commander.  They say that the number of arches is not accidental, but corresponds to the number of letters in his name. </p><h2>  Exchange Square </h2><p>  Place Bourse is one of Bordeaux's most popular attractions.  Not a single guide goes around her.  Like most objects in the central part of the city, it appeared in the 18th century.  It is adjacent to the Garonne embankment and is surrounded by two classic buildings located in the shape of a semicircle. </p>

    <p>  But there are many such ensembles in the city.  The quarters of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Catherine are filled with architectural monuments of the economic heyday of Bordeaux.  What attracts this area?  Relatively recently, a ‚Äúwater mirror‚Äù appeared on it.  The entire flat surface of the square is now covered by a layer of water of several centimeters, which reflects the building of the former stock exchange. </p><p>  From time to time, holes in concrete ‚Äúspew out‚Äù puffs of steam, making it even more attractive.  Children are happy to play and splash in the water, tourists photograph with amazement the resulting landscape.  In general, everyone liked the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Acquainted with all the architectural sights of the city of Bordeaux, you can go to the Botanical Garden.  Of course, the atmosphere of antiquity will not leave you here either.  The garden was founded in 1629.  At first, only useful plants were grown in it.  Medicinal herbs and shrubs were used to make oils and make perfumes. </p><p>  A small garden gradually grew into a city park, into which numerous exotic species were brought.  In the XIX century, his arrangement was entrusted to the royal architect.  The park was supplemented by walking paths, a river with a waterfall, bridges and stone sculptures. </p><p>  It combines the elegance of French gardens and the naturalness of English landscape decoration.  Today, the park has placed swings, carousels and other attractions.  They are decorated in the old style and do not stand out from the general picture of the garden. </p><h2>  City of Wine </h2><p>  There is an absolutely modern and even futuristic attraction in Bordeaux - the City of Wine.  This is a huge building with ten floors, in which everyone will tell you about wine.  Animated paintings will tell about the trade travels of wine both in the past and in the present.  Screens and tablets will show the vineyards and their features, and interactive globes will reveal the economic secrets of winemaking. </p>

    <p>  The building itself is an example of the latest architecture.  It has the shape of a twisted vine.  Its walls are metal frames and glass panels.  And the upper part of the "vine" in the form of a tower rises 55 meters in height. </p>
