    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting that, in addition to the positive aspects, there are also a number of significant shortcomings in the operation of the Malia Bay Beach Hotel &amp; Bungalows 3 *.  Traveler reviews are accompanied by the following comments: </p><ul><li>  the territory of the hotel is incredibly small, and therefore the noise from all the events that take place on the stage in the evening is heard in all rooms; </li><li>  a road passes through the hotel territory (despite the fact that traffic on it is not very intense, there is some discomfort); </li><li>  the beds are small enough, because of which it is not very comfortable for people with large stature to sleep on them; </li><li>  too little light in the rooms, which is why it is not just gloomy, but also rather damp; </li><li>  due to the fact that there are no mosquito nets on the windows, a huge number of mosquitoes get into the rooms, which neither fumigators, nor sprays, nor other insect repellents take; </li><li>  from cosmetics and hygiene items, only soap is put in the bathroom; </li><li>  there are no <span>beach towels,</span> and therefore you have to take baths to the sea or bring with you from home; </li><li>  the Internet is paid and quite expensive (some guests bought one card for two and used it together without informing the reception); </li><li>  not very good quality fruit at the buffet;  lack of a special menu for children; </li><li>  when you consider that the hotel has a huge number of families with children, the playground is incredibly small and does not differ in a large number of attractions; </li><li>  the hotel is located far enough from the central part of the resort town, and therefore there are practically no entertainment or walking spots near it; </li><li>  for sunbeds and umbrellas that are on the beach, you have to pay extra, which is very strange for a hotel that has its own coastal zone; </li><li>  disgusting quality not only in alcoholic beverages, but also in juices and refreshing cocktails (bartenders dilute everything with water); </li><li>  not only is it impossible to find a quiet place throughout the hotel, but the walls of the rooms do not provide any sound insulation. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  A fairly popular holiday destination in Greece is the resort and hotel complex Malia Bay 3 * (Crete).  Traveler reviews about this institution are mostly positive, but they can not do without comments.  So, it can be considered a hotel‚Äôs advantage that it is close to the sea and has its own private beach.  Nevertheless, it is incredibly small, and in order to use a sun lounger or umbrella, you have to resort to additional costs. <br><br>  Particularly flattering reviews were awarded to the work of the restaurant.  The food is more than decent, as for a three-star hotel.  A variety of dishes, although not the widest, but the food does not have time to annoy vacationers.  Perhaps the most enjoyable moment is the unlimited ice cream, which is provided to guests after lunch and after dinner. <br><br>  The hotel area is very small and incredibly beautiful.  But there are many shortcomings in it, one of which is the roadway, which runs between the buildings.  It is also worth noting that in the whole hotel there is practically no quiet corner.  There is a pool, there is a scene where animators work, there are office rooms.  And all this constantly makes noise. <br><br>  The rooms are quite spacious, but at the same time they are noticeably lacking in light.  Also a huge problem are local mosquitoes, which are absolutely resistant to any insect repellent.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that the furniture and appliances in the rooms are very outdated and decently worn out, and therefore require replacement.  Although all these shortcomings are fully compensated by the low cost that is charged for accommodation. </p>
