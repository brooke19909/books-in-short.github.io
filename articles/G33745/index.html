Many are mistaken in thinking that this country has the euro, since it is part of the Eurozone.  But the Republic, although it joined the European Union, did not refuse from the traditional state currency. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  After the <span>collapse of Czechoslovakia</span> in 1993, the Czech krona began to be used in the country, and the Slovak one in Slovakia.  At first, the old emblem was simply affixed with the emblem and other state attributes of the Czech Republic.  Only after some time new money began to be printed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.numismondo.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bill 1000 CZK" class="if uuid-2265959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2265959.jpg"></div><p>  In 2008, all coins of the Geller sample were withdrawn from circulation.  Only coins worth more than one crown remained. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  <span>The Czech currency</span> is divided into 100 Hellers, which were previously issued in the form of coins, but were withdrawn from circulation.  Now they are used only for cashless payments. </p><p>  Today in circulation are coins in denominations of 1 to 50 crowns and banknotes in denominations of 100 to 5,000 crowns. </p><p>  The currency of the Czech Republic is designated as CZK on the global financial market.  The issue of banknotes is carried out by the National Bank of the Republic. </p><h2>  Czech currency exchange rate </h2><p>  CZK is not in great demand on the international finance market, and the country does not play a large role on the world stage.  For these, and also for many other reasons, the national currency of the state has a low cost. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The price of the Czech currency to the Russian ruble is about 2.7 rubles to 1 kroon.  If we consider the opposite situation, then for one Russian ruble they will give approximately 0.37 kroons. </p><p>  The ratio of the U.S. dollar to CZK at the beginning of 2018 is approximately 1 USD = 21 CZK.  With a return exchange of 1 to $ 0.048. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech crowns" class="if uuid-2265976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2265976.jpg"></div><p>  For one euro you can get almost 25 and a half Czech crowns.  Thus, in one crown contains about 0.04 euros. </p><h2>  Exchange operations and cashless payments </h2><p>  The Czech Republic is a developed and modern country, and the financial structure here is at a high level.  Bank transfer is accepted in almost all supermarkets, shops, hotels and even in public transport. </p><p>  There are also many ATMs and branches of financial organizations, so there are no difficulties with cashing out funds.  The exchange can be made at the airport, hotel or bank office. </p><p>  The easiest way to exchange euros, dollars and British pounds.  With rubles, they work far from everywhere.  Considering that the commissions for the operation are not too large, you can exchange rubles for euros in Russia to make it easier on arrival. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The most common paper bill in the country is 1000 kroons.  It depicts a portrait of the famous and beloved historian and politician Frantisek Palacki.  Therefore, the people nicknamed her "Palace".  About 130 million of these notes are currently in circulation. </p><p>  In 2008, the Czech national currency for a short period took second place in the list of the ‚Äúweakest‚Äù monetary units in the world.  However, she quickly left this position, since the measures taken by the government have borne fruit. </p><p>  However, in the same year, a paper bill in denominations of 1,000 kroons was recognized as the most secure and safe from counterfeiters. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The Czech Republic</span> is one of the most beautiful and most attractive countries in Europe for tourism.  In addition, many Russians emigrate here in the hope of finding a better life.  Indeed, indicators of quality of life here are comparable to Western European ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveller.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 CZK bill" class="if uuid-2265981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/2265981.jpg"></div><p>  Millions of foreign tourists visit this small state every year.  Quite a lot of Russian citizens come here.  Going on vacation or work to the Czech Republic, you should find out more about the country's financial system and, in particular, its national currency. </p><p>  The state, like the currency of the republic, has a rich history with many interesting facts.  Therefore, it will be useful to know this for the general expansion of his erudition. </p>
