Not!  After all, the tablet is convenient and easy to manage.  You can take it with you to read a book or watch a movie on the way to work.  It can also be installed in the kitchen as a TV to watch whatever your heart desires while cooking or other kitchen work. </p><p>  The planet‚Äôs population has drastically reduced purchases of small televisions and replaced them with tablets.  Therefore, each company producing television equipment, supporting the current trend, releases its own line of tablets.  The company Global Satellite ("Global Satellite"), occupying a substantial niche in the production of digital satellite equipment, introduced the new GS700 tablet. </p><h2>  Global satellite </h2><p>  GS Group is a diversified manufacturer of satellite consoles and mobile equipment.  Being practically a monopolist in the satellite television market, in order to confirm their status, the corporation specialists simply had to release a compact device, for example, a phone or tablet. </p>

    <p>  Following Huawei‚Äôs example, Global Satellite launches the GS700 in 2014.  Its feature is that it is a teleplate.  The prefix "tele" indicates that thanks to this device you can access all the channels included in the Tricolor TV satellite TV service package for free and watch the broadcast as part of the home Wi-Fi without borders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A tablet is not just a tablet </h2><p>  Each buyer at the first inspection will ask a question, can it be used as a tablet?  The whole point of the device is that its owner is not dependent on a fixed plasma screen and can watch any channel online.  Thus, the number of moments that are missed due to the "five-minute excommunication at ..." will be significantly reduced, because you can always take a mini-TV with you everywhere. </p>

    <p>  The answer to this question will be: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù.  The GS700 tablet is a full-fledged device on Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS.  It can connect to any available Wi-Fi network without any problems.  Android has access to the Google Market, where you can download and install all the necessary applications.  The only difference from a conventional tablet is the TV output, and only through a home device (set-top box, receiver, etc.). </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The weight of the tablet is a little more than two hundred grams.  Diagonal 7 '' with a resolution of 1024 by 600. Cameras 2 and 0.3 megapixels.  Quad-core MT8127 processor, RAM - 1 GB, flash memory - 4 GB (up to 32 GB can be used), battery - 2800 mAh, USB 4.0 and HDMI, as well as Google Services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As you can see, the GS700 tablet has very good specifications.  The price recommended by the manufacturer should not exceed 4000 rubles.  Has a fairly diverse <span>tablet GS700 reviews.</span>  The price of it during the campaign can be reduced to 2 thousand rubles.  The same cost today and similar devices.  The only difference is the amount of RAM (other manufacturers - 512 MB). </p><h2>  Device advantages </h2><p>  The GS700 tablet, the technical characteristics of which inspire confidence, has a lot of advantages.  The very first is a powerful processor that can handle the most complex requests.  When compared with other tablets, then not all today come with USB 4.0.  In addition, a larger amount of RAM significantly speeds up the already excellent work of the tablet. </p><p>  A 7-inch diagonal is the most convenient format for a mobile device so that it remains mobile, not stationary.  This diagonal allows you to choose a keyboard for a modest fee and turn the tablet into a netbook or transformer. </p>

    <p>  We should also mention the HDMI-connector.  With it, you can display a picture from the tablet on a large screen (TFT, plasma or diode monitors).  Therefore, the GS700 tablet is a great assistant for a business person. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  I would like to avoid these points, but the buyer must know about them in order to make a conscious choice.  Buyers say that he has only one ‚Äúthin spot‚Äù - the battery.  In standby mode, it can work for a very long time, but at full power - no more than 5 hours. </p><p>  It should be noted that a powerful processor and a lack of RAM (for a four-core device requires at least 2 GB) can slow down the tablet‚Äôs processes while running several applications at the same time.  Running up to 3 applications will not overload the memory and allow the device to work as quickly as possible. <br>  The screen resolution is still not as high as we would like.  Of course, the IPS-matrix provides the most accurate color reproduction, but 1024 by 600 pixels is very small to carefully consider the details, especially on a 7-inch screen.  Despite this, many buyers praised the picture and were pleased with the ability to view in HD TV-quality. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows how to connect the GS700 tablet to their receiver.  Very colorful and clear instructions in the pictures are available on the GS Group official website.  Internet and television setup instructions are also available for download. </p>

    <p>  To connect, just follow a few simple steps: </p><ol><li>  You need to make sure that the GS E501 server (E502 and beyond), as well as the Wi-Fi router, are connected and configured in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended settings. </li><li>  On the tablet you need to install (or update, if already installed) "Play.Tricolor". </li><li>  Connect to a wireless network (its name in this case will correspond to the server name). </li><li>  The tablet will automatically ‚Äúpull up‚Äù all the settings.  After that, you can run the TV viewer without hesitation. </li></ol><h2>  Will the manufacturer replace the firmware? </h2><p>  The GS700 tablet, whose firmware is KitKat, has another drawback.  KitKat allows applications to be installed only on the built-in media, and not on an additional microSD.  As a result, we get a limited number of installed applications.  For someone, this will be completely uncritical, but if a person is a gamer, this can become a serious drawback. </p><p>  Many who own programming do root.  They say that it is very simple.  But the bulk still hopes that the General Satellite should resolve this problem in the near future. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

Moreover, its price category is another advantage.  The functionality is decent, the processor is not bad.  Of the minuses, buyers note that the battery needs improvement.  Overall a decent model.

    <h2>  To buy or not? </h2><p>  Before making a purchase, it is worth deciding what you need the device for.  If it is necessary as a tablet, without a TV, then you will not find the best for such an affordable price.  If you have a Tricolor TV connection, then you should not even think, but take it.  A tablet is always useful, because its functions are far from being limited to one TV. </p><p>  For many who purchased this tablet, it was critical that it discharges very quickly (much faster than what is regulated by the manufacturer).  Obviously, the price / quality ratio for the GS700 is the best. </p><p>  And how can you solve the problem of fast battery discharge?  Very simple!  You can buy an inexpensive and simplest external battery at 5000 mAh.  This will allow you to maximize the use of this compact device throughout the day.  Agree, this is a huge advantage, which, unfortunately, is not in the factory equipment, provides a huge number of opportunities, for example, to watch movies all day. </p><p>  Before you all the cards are revealed, so whether to buy or not is up to you.  We hope that the material presented above has become useful to you.  Good luck and good mood! </p>
