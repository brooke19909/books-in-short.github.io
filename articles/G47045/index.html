Unexplored Goa attracts tourists primarily with its soft gentle and clear sea, as well as its price.  Here you will not find promoted five-star hotels, as in Egypt and Turkey, here few people know what All Inclusive is, but here there are charming landscapes and a quiet, moderate family vacation. </p><p>  Those who have already visited the coolest resorts and who have seen how to please tourists, those who come to Goa will be disappointed.  You should not come here in search of the highest level of service or chic restaurants.  This is not the case when you are entertained at every step by animators, and there will be dozens of pools and slides in your home.  No, everything is much simpler here, and you need to be prepared for this.  That is why Goa is considered one of the cheapest resorts.  Despite the cost of the flight, one night at the hotel can cost you 1,500 rubles.  Agree, in some resort cities of Russia and even more expensive. </p>

Reviews among tourists are very diverse.  Some, those who have already traveled half the world and consider themselves a connoisseur of the hotel business, will leave bad comments, they say, have seen better.  Well, those who understand where he goes and what money he pays for it will enjoy the rest and the sea, despite some shortcomings.  We will try to find out what awaits the tourist in the Alagoa Resort 2 * hotel and where the real truth is hidden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The small building of our hotel is located in a very favorable area.  Access to the sea is through a neighboring hotel, which belongs to the same owner.  It takes about 10 minutes to get to one of the most picturesque beaches of Goa - Betalbatima.  Around - palm groves and <span>rice fields.</span> </p><p>  Very close, a 5-minute drive, is a small tourist town - Kolva.  There are many attractions for tourists, and if you do not want to sit in a hotel, you can easily get there and see how the life of the Indians works.  There are also a huge number of bars and restaurants where you can eat.  The airport and train station are also very close, so you will spend little time on the transfer. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Alagoa Resort 2 * does not have its own beach area.  It is considered urban, and therefore there are many people here.  As you know, all residents of hotels located nearby also use one access to the sea. </p><p>  The beach is very nice, sandy.  Pretty shallow sea, which allows you to feel relaxed when relaxing with children.  Throughout the year, there is a high water temperature. </p><p>  Services on the beach are paid.  If you want to use a chaise lounge or an umbrella - pay. </p>

    <h2>  What is in the hotel </h2><p>  It features a pool and barbecue area.  On the territory are also located: bar, restaurant, conference room, laundry, dry cleaning.  If you need to leave a car, then parking is free.  At the reception you can arrange car rental for trips inside the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel has Wi-Fi.  But, as tourists say, he catches very poorly and only at the administrator's zone.  Many went to a nearby hotel and connected to the network there.  Buying a local SIM card is also very expensive. </p><p>  There is a currency exchange.  It is a small stall on the way to the beach.  An Indian Durjan is in charge of the exchange there.  But the Russians simply nicknamed him - Sasha.  Everyone knows that you can change it at a very favorable rate. </p><p>  From entertainment Alagoa Resort 2 * Betalbatim offers only swimming in the pool, a library and organizing excursions.  If you use the services of a guide in Kolva, then it will cost a little cheaper. </p>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  In general, tourists are happy with their stay at the Alagoa Resort 2 * hotel.  Reviews about the rooms are very mixed.  As mentioned above, there are three types of rooms.  Standard and deluxe are in the same building, while bungalows are located on site.  Initially, when buying a tour, your tour operator should clarify what type of room you want.  Know that you do not need to pay extra at the reception for the ‚Äúimproved‚Äù room.  There were times when the administration forced tourists to pay for deluxe, when it was already provided for with a ticket. </p><p>  The condition of the rooms is standard and deluxe, according to tourists, very deplorable.  No, the furniture is not old, the equipment is working, but various "guests" are often found in the form of bugs and cockroaches.  Moreover, the administration is trying to keep silent about the settlement of unexpected residents and ignores all complaints.  More than once there were reviews that it is very difficult to achieve relocation or disinfection.  And this is not counting countless mosquitoes and ants, from which it is simply impossible to fight back. </p><p>  Without exception, tourists unanimously advise buying additional fumigators.  Those available at the hotel do not help. </p>

    <p>  But tourists who were lucky to stay in a bungalow are very satisfied.  They note that the bed was very clean, changed it daily, all the furniture is new, the plumbing is working and there are no bugs or spiders. </p><p>  Do not forget that the Alagoa Resort 2 * hotel (Goa) is located in the tropical part of India, and even more so the country itself is not famous for cleanliness.  When traveling to this region, you need to be prepared for the unexpected. </p><h2>  Reviews about the territory </h2><p>  The territory of the hotel is small, but neat and well-groomed.  The frustrated palm grove brings frustration.  Arriving at a resort in an exotic country, I want to see an abundance of palm trees, plants.  In reality, the palm grove is a few low trees planted along the alley.  And it is better to go exotic plants to contemplate in the neighboring three-star hotel, the garden is more interesting there. </p><p>  If you are told that you need to go to the sea through a palm lane, do not listen to anyone, but use the advice of experienced tourists.  Alagoa Resort 2 * (India, Betalbatim) does not have access to the beach, and to get there, you need to go through a neighboring hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Let us recall that we are considering a two-star hotel.  As you know, we are not talking about a buffet.  You should be warned about all the nuances at a travel agency.  Alagoa Resort 2 * has one restaurant where you will be served breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><p>  Most tourists choose a breakfast-only tour.  And it is right.  On the one hand, do not expect a good dinner from a two-star hotel, and on the other, there is the opportunity to get acquainted with national delights. </p><p>  Food hotel Alagoa Resort 2 * offers a very uniform.  Breakfast is an omelet or scrambled eggs, pastries and tea.  With a good appetite, this is hardly enough to get enough for the whole day.  So buy a tour only with breakfast or without it at all.  Moreover, some rooms have a kitchen. </p>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Rest in the Alagoa Resort 2 * hotel (India) can be considered very decent.  In any case, there are more positive sides than negative ones.  Tourists tell how they had a great time with their family, dined on the balcony, admiring the sunset and tropical nature.  You can turn on the light in the room outside the door so that mosquitoes do not fly in.  The fumigator was purchased in the city, and it worked properly.  The staff is friendly, cleaned regularly. </p><p>  The fact that some complain of poor isolation is a problem that often occurs around the world.  The hotel has a lot of Russians, so there aren‚Äôt any problems.  The sea and nature smooth out all conflicts. </p><p>  In general, on a ten-point scale, visitors rate the Alagoa Resort 2 * hotel as follows: </p><ul><li>  numbers - 7 points; </li><li>  service - 6 points; </li><li>  purity - 8 points; </li><li>  nutrition - 5 points; </li><li>  infrastructure - 5 points. </li></ul><p>  But most of all it affects the beach and the ocean.  The sand is clean, snow-white.  Sometimes it seems that you are stepping on warm fluffy snow.  In the ocean, you can rarely find exotic fish, more often stingrays and starfish, but still nice.  You need to swim carefully so as not to get hurt about them. </p><p>  They wrote that from the rooms once someone had lost their personal belongings.  In this case, the administration has a safe.  But all the reviews over the past 2-3 years indicate that there were no more such incidents. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For those who prefer a quiet relaxing holiday away from noisy resorts, Alagoa Resort 2 * is an ideal option.  Here the warm soft sea and amazing nature are perfectly combined.  India is considered to be an exotic country for us, and there you can see a lot of new and unusual.  The main thing is to understand that you are going to 2 stars, and that everything will be modest and accurate there. </p><p>  Another question is that India is one of the dirtiest countries in the world.  The country's population lives below the poverty line, and more than half do not know how to read and write.  So there may be surprises.  But the tours there are quite cheap, and the advertised resort will do everything possible to please its guests. </p>
