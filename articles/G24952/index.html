    <p>  The nearest city to Nikolaevka is Simferopol, 40 km to it.  Pension "Radiant" (Nikolaevka) was built in an ecologically clean area, on the very shore of the Black Sea.  The remoteness of the resort village from major cities, which are traditional tourist places of Crimea, and the developed infrastructure of this place create a surprisingly comfortable and relaxing atmosphere for families to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The main advantages that can be distinguished from the general review of reviews about "Radiant": </p><ul><li>  beautiful terrain, landscaping and decoration of the territory, good environmental conditions; </li><li>  proximity to the sea and clean beach; </li><li>  comfortable, clean living rooms; </li><li>  good nutrition; </li><li>  excellent conditions for an exciting holiday with children; </li><li>  polite and friendly staff. </li></ul><p>  Of the significant disadvantages of tourists, the price increased over the year is unpleasantly surprising.  However, one can often find the opinion that even a rise in price will not prevent guests from again choosing the Radiant House (Nikolaevka) as a place for a family summer vacation. </p>
