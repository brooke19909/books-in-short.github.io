    <p>  Of course, there are no insects in the rooms of this hotel.  According to the majority of tourists, rooms that are rented out in the complex have practically no disadvantages.  The only thing is that some former residents of Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access 4 * consider the rooms equipped in the villas to be slightly old.  But at the same time, many are advised to give preference when booking it to them.  The rooms in the buildings, according to former residents of the hotel, are somewhat less comfortable. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For the convenience of residents at the Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access Kata hotel (photos of the hotel and its rooms are presented on the page), among other things, the following are provided: </p><ul><li><p>  outdoor pool, next to which massage sessions are held; </p></li><li><p>  free parking. </p></li></ul><p>  Also, hotel guests can optionally visit the Internet cafe.

    <h2>  Guest reviews about the service </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the hotel Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access 4 * (Phuket), most of its residents according to their development, consider it quite appropriate for four stars.  The staff at this hotel are quite polite.  The pool at the hotel is not particularly large, but swimming is quite comfortable.  It has a depth of about 1.2 meters.  This, of course, is not particularly much.  However, the water in the pool of the complex is always quite clean and does not smell like bleach.  Everything else, when bathing in it, hotel guests can admire the simply magnificent mountain scenery. </p><p>  Really like the residents of the hotel and the massage sessions held on its territory.  Visit at least one of them advises most vacationers. </p><p>  Tourists have a good opinion about this hotel for one more reason.  Unfortunately, hurricanes quite often happen on Kata.  At the same time, electricity is disconnected throughout the resort.  In such cases, residents of the Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access hotel, reviews of which are actually very good, do not experience any inconvenience at all.  The fact is that the hotel, among other things, has its own generator.  Therefore, the light in the complex is turned on literally 10 minutes after it disappears in Kata itself.  With electricity, therefore, residents of this hotel never have problems.  The same goes for hot water.  She is always at the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists consider some of the drawbacks of the center to be that sometimes noisy Chinese people come here.  Moreover, they usually come to the hotel in large companies at night.  However, the Chinese make noise most often only in the yard, and in their rooms they are almost inaudible.  In addition, the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire leave the hotel in most cases very quickly (they rest for only 2-3 days). </p><h2>  Hotel dining reviews </h2><p>  Rooms for rent at the Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access Kata hotel with meals.  About the hotel restaurant, as well as about its rooms and service, there are also mostly only positive reviews.  Actually the hall of this institution itself is considered by many tourists to be quite clean and tidy.  The staff in the restaurant, according to the former residents of the hotel, is quite polite and quick. </p><p>  In most cases, Russian tourists rent rooms in this hotel only with breakfast.  But the restaurant operates a complex around the clock.  So, if you wish, you can also have lunch and dinner here.  The menu in this institution, according to many vacationers, is quite diverse.  You can find something new in the hotel restaurant at least every day.  In addition, local chefs cook quite tasty. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the restaurant, there is also a small cafe on the hotel grounds.  It is located next to the pool and earned just excellent reviews from residents.  According to the opinion of many vacationers, they cook in this restaurant even better than in the hotel restaurant. </p><h2>  Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access 3 *: beach reviews </h2><p>  The location of the complex relative to the sea, many tourists, as already mentioned, consider it quite convenient.  But older people can get to the beach in the heat for 20 minutes, of course, it can be difficult.  In addition, you need to go to the sea from the hotel directly along the roadway.  Therefore, at the Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access Kata, among other things, there is also a free shuttle service to the coast. </p><p>  Actually Kata beach itself is considered by most tourists to be the best in Phuket.  The sand on the coastline here is clean, white and very soft.  The water in the sea at this place is usually completely clear and clean.  Free loungers for guests of the Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access Kata, however, like most others in Phuket, is not provided.  You need to pay for their rent separately.  But the coastline on Kata itself is very wide.  And therefore, despite the rather large number of vacationers, there is always a lot of free space. </p><p>  The water in the sea on <span>Kata beach</span> is very warm in season.  And therefore, swimming here is quite comfortable not only for adults, but also for children. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are often very large waves in this place of the island on the sea, out of season.  At this time, tourists should adequately calculate their strength and not go into the water too far.  Lifeguards are constantly working on Kata beach.  However, risking vacationers is still, of course, not worth it.  Most of the hotel guests, when excited by the sea, prefer to swim in the pool. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  An employee at the tour desk at Kata Lucky Villa Pool Access Kata is always ready to help guests plan their trips around Phuket.  Of course, there are not so many interesting sights on this island, as, for example, in the same Greece or Italy.  However, there is still something to see here. </p><p>  Many hotel residents, for example, buy excursions to the very beautiful <span>Similan Islands.</span>  This tropical archipelago is one of Thailand's largest national parks.  It consists of 11 islands, some of which are open for tourists to visit.  They bring Phuket guests to the islands by boat. </p>

    <p>  Most tour operators offer hotel guests, of course, a free sightseeing tour.  Vacationers who agree to it can inspect a jewelry factory, a latex factory, visit a fruit market, etc. </p><h2>  Useful advice </h2><p>  Many tourists rent a car or bike in Thailand.  With such equipment, of course, you can see a lot more attractions.  At the same time, such independent excursions will cost, of course, much cheaper than organized by tour operators. </p>
