This is one of the major cities of the Mangistau region, which is located on <span>the Mangyshlak peninsula.</span>  The territory is adjacent to the coast of the <span>Caspian Sea.</span>  The name of the peninsula is translated as "a thousand villages", one of which is the modern city of Fort Shevchenko. </p><p>  Today, the city has a port of Bautino on the coast of the Caspian Sea.  For a long time, local airports worked.  They took in light aircraft and helicopters.  Now they are abandoned and are used as emergency sites.  The city can now be reached by car and water. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort shevchenko" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1006136.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first mention of the city dates back to the mid-19th century.  Historical documents speak of the military fortification of Novopetrovsky, which was later renamed Fort Aleksandrovsky, which performed a protective function.  His purpose was to protect the Russians from raids by nomads.  T.G. served here.  Shevchenko, whose name was named Fort-Shevchenko in 1939. </p><p>  Archives give a description of the settlement.  The construction consisted of four powerful bastions, two of the same half-bastions enclosing the outer shaft, and a stone block.  All together it looked very impressive and made the enemies retreat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city was in the center of the Silk Road.  He always attracted many travelers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort shevchenko in kazakhstan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1006131.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What is in the city? </h2><p>  Today, Fort Shevchenko is known as a port city, near which there is a fishing base and a canning factory processing such varieties as stellate sturgeon and sturgeon.  There are also remains of a fortress, a <span>museum of local lore, a museum of T.G.</span>  Shevchenko, ethnographic museum, Shevchenko monument, Armenian chapel, <span>mass grave of the</span> heroes of the Civil War. </p><p>  Also here, almost on the seashore, limestone mining was founded.  It is white and white, and the water casts blue.  A very beautiful sight.  Who will visit Fort-Shevchenko should definitely visit the shore and admire. </p><p>  The holidays of May 1 and 9 are widely celebrated in the city, as well as Nauryz. </p><p>  Noaryz is a celebration of spring renewal, when residents tidy their homes, plant trees and flowers. </p>

    <p>  Nearby is the architectural complex of the 16-20 centuries, as well as the Beisenbay necropolis of the 17-19 centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many tourists visit Fort Shevchenko annually.  The sights of the city allow guests to plunge into the atmosphere of past centuries when visiting. </p><p>  So remarkable is the ancient well existing in the city and clearly showing how water supply was organized in the past. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  An interesting museum is T.G.  Shevchenko, who is already one hundred and fifty years old.  The complex is located on the site of the Novopetrovsk garden garden.  The main exhibition is located in the hall of the curfew.  Shevchenko was exiled here for composing ‚Äúimpudent‚Äù verses and spent eight years here.  The museum has documents telling about the performance of household work by a soldier Shevchenko.  It was through his efforts that the city became a beautiful park, where even a willow brought by the poet was planted.  For many years, local residents cherished it as a relic.  Also on the territory of the museum complex is a monument to Shevchenko. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort shevchenko rest" class="if" height="483" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1006135.jpg" width="383"></div></h2><h2>  Mosque </h2><p>  There is a White Mosque in the city with a crescent moon, visible from afar.  This is the oldest building.  True, now it is destroyed.  At one time this building was both a warehouse and a cinema. </p><p>  There was an Orthodox church in the city, but not so long ago it burned down. </p><h2>  Necropolis </h2><p>  Separately, it must be said about the necropolis of Fort Shevchenko.  This is an old soldier‚Äôs cemetery with tombstone tombstones.  There are also many children's graves - the climate for the colonists was not easy.  In the center of the cemetery rises a chapel.  In the old part of the cemetery there are tombstones, signed in Hebrew. </p><h2>  Activities for active </h2><p>  Residents of the city are actively involved in sports.  Here, activities such as ballroom dancing, bicycle, boxing, chess clubs, table tennis, and skiing are developed. </p><p>  On the outskirts of the city there is a very interesting building with arched windows.  This is a youth sports school.  And initially there was an officer meeting.  Also, the city holds regional boxing competitions. </p><h2>  Chapel </h2>

    <p>  Another attraction of the city that you need to see is the white-walled Armenian chapel made of stone behind the forged fence at the foot of the Kurgan-tash.  Before, the Armenians were part of the merchants in Fort Shevchenko, grave tombstones also speak about this.  It was delivered in the 19th century by Astrakhan merchants.  Today it is only an architectural monument with the silence characteristic of the abandoned altars. </p><h2>  Where to relax and settle down if you come to Fort Shevchenko? </h2><p>  Rest you can offer the hotel Chagala Group (Bautino).
