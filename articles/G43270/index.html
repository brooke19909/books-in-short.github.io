The heart of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhere life does not stop for a minute, is located on La Rambla Boulevard - a pedestrian street tiled with interesting ornaments.  The most famous corner of the tourist center can be compared with Montmartre in Paris, Arbat in Moscow or Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg.  And it is not for nothing that the famous Federico <span>Garcia Lorca</span> said that this is the only street on our planet that never ends. </p><h2>  The heart of the city </h2><p>  Located in the heart of the Rambla (Barcelona), whose photos often appear in foreign magazines, extends for 1.2 kilometers and consists of five boulevards that smoothly transition into each other and have different names.  True, this division is purely arbitrary, and they speak about the street in the singular.  Considered the soul of the city, it attracts millions of tourists, and locals regrettably go around it because of the huge flows of tourists.  A wonderful corner that has not lost its charm for a long time helps to find inspiration and recharge with positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramble barcelona photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029030.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many years ago, the new term "ramblear" even appeared, which means walks along the popular boulevard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main attraction of the city </h2><p>  Reflecting the vibrant nature of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa unique landmark cuts the Old Town in two.  It is located between two blocks: the Gothic and Raval, which is notorious.  The name of the Rambla Boulevard (Barcelona) is borrowed from the Arabic language and means "dried up river bed."  The street acquired its usual look at the end of the 18th century, when it was decided to demolish medieval buildings and organize a fashionable promenade in their place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramble spain barcelona" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rambla Canaletes </h2><p>  The first section of the Rambla Boulevard in Barcelona begins in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPlaza Catalunya.  He got his name from the name of an unusual cast-iron fountain located under a lantern and having four drinking bowls with taps.  A sign is placed next to it, on which an ancient legend is stamped, which says that everyone who gets drunk from it will love the city with all his heart and will definitely return here.  It is curious that contemporaries took care of our smaller brothers and made a drinking bowl for dogs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramble street in barcelona" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029280.jpg" width="333"></div>

However, guides do not recommend that tourists come to the boulevard at a time when young people excited by drinking have fun, exploding firecrackers, as this can threaten people's lives.  Young thugs trashed located on the street.  Rambla in Barcelona shops, and it all ends with a brawl involving the police. </p><h2>  Rambla Teachings </h2><p>  Following is a stretch of street, which once was the first university that gave it a name.  After the local population did not obey the will of the authorities, the Spanish king at the beginning of the 18th century placed barracks for soldiers in the buildings of the educational institution, and later the building was completely destroyed. </p><p>  It is curious that once upon a time here funny trills of birds sounded coming from numerous stalls located on the street.  The mayor's office, which considered that the places of sale of birds do not meet hygiene standards, closed them, and now only one shop has the right to sell animals. </p><p>  Here you can see the theater building, which is of interest with a giant clock on the facade, on which all city services check time.  However, the main attraction of the boulevard is the Church of Our Lady of Bethlehem, made in the Baroque style.  The magnificent facade, decorated with statues of saints, delights at first sight. </p><h2>  The Rambla of the Flowers, or St. Joseph </h2><p>  The most beautiful section of the boulevard is famous for the numerous flower shops that appeared in the 19th century.  According to an ancient legend, it was one of the most popular places in the city, as the lively saleswomen were famous for their beauty and sharp tongue.  Both ordinary shoppers and womanizer, who flirted with young lovers, were in a hurry here.  Later, book collapses appeared near the shops, and this section of the Rambla (Barcelona) was chosen by intellectuals who were vigorously discussing the latest news. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramble barcelona" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029042.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The boulevard inherited its official name from the name of the Carmelite monastery of Sant Josep.  Now in its place is the famous <span>Boqueria market,</span> which all tourists dream of wandering around.  The oldest attraction, which dates back to the 13th century, is amazing in its size: you can even get lost inside it.  As tourists note, this is a rather expensive market, offering a wide variety of products. </p><p>  However, those who want to save money will have to go deep into Boqueria, where the same products can be bought much cheaper.  It is worth remembering that sellers do not allow to try their goods and prohibit taking pictures of them.  On the territory of the market, which is open all days except Sunday, the best restaurants of the city are comfortably located, the prices at which can lead tourists to confusion. </p><p>  This is the most picturesque and bright section of the Rambla (Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain), which has something to see.  It attracts the attention of vacationers located in front of the trading floor of the Erotic Museum, which is visited by a mechanical doll.  Sexy Marilyn Monroe, holding a skirt, waves her hand and sends kisses, inviting to go to an unusual institution. </p><h2>  Rambla of the Capuchins </h2><p>  This part of the Rambla in Barcelona has gained worldwide fame thanks to a bizarre structure decorated with the head of a Chinese dragon who opened its mouth and cast-iron umbrellas on the facade.  The Bruno Quadras building delights with ancient Egyptian images, Japanese-style stained-glass windows, <span>palm fans.</span>  Now in an unusual house, claiming to be original, there is a bank branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona ramble boulevard" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An equally famous building is the Grand Liceo Opera House, which, according to architects, was supposed to surpass the beauty of the famous La Scala in Milan.  The beautiful building actually competed with many cultural institutions of the world in interior decoration and excellent acoustics.  This place was adored by the respectable bourgeoisie, who went to opera performances only in order to declare their status and high position in society.  At the end of the 19th century, a young anarchist detonated a bomb in a theater building, which claimed the lives of 20 people. </p><p>  Next to the Grand Liceo is the Opera Cafe, considered the most popular establishment not only in the Ramblas, but also in Barcelona.  It is always crowded, and there is a chance to meet any celebrity, who must leave his signature in a special book, which has grown to three volumes.  People come here just to admire the decoration of the halls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramble street in barcelona" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029032.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Here you can also see multicolored mosaics laid out by Spanish artist J. Miro on asphalt, included in the lists of street art objects. </p><h2>  Rambla Santa Monica </h2><p>  The last section of the boulevard originates at the old Theater Square.  Rambla (Barcelona) is not only unique architectural objects that delight in its beauty.  Here stands the former main theater Principal, which could not stand the competition with other institutions and closed.  Now the building, waiting for better times, looks very unsightly, and tourists bypass it. </p><p>  There is also a monument to the explorer Columbus, which is an 80-meter column.  The symbol of the city appeared in 1888 and was timed to coincide with the opening of an international exhibition.  An elevator is located in the very center of the metal monument, which will take visitors to the observation deck, from where a stunning panorama of the charming Spanish pearl opens. </p><p>  On the oldest street of Escudelers there is a famous restaurant "Snails", which has a rich history.  Famous for its cuisine, it is recognized as a popular attraction.  Its halls are decorated with snails made of stone or wood, and even bread is baked in the shape of mollusks. </p><p>  Once it was a prestigious place where aristocrats walked, and today it has turned into a danger zone for tourists.  The Raval district, located where the Rambla (Barcelona) ends, is a slum of the poor and a home of ladies of easy virtue. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Remember that theft is rampant, and the police will not even come to the rescue in the event of a robbery.  Theft of money is not considered a crime, so tourists should be very careful when paying for goods. </p><p>  Prostitution flourishes here, and the local mafia controls the illegal sex industry.  Black ladies who go hunting for men, rob them, adding sleeping pills.  Therefore, in the late evenings it is better not to endanger your life.  Also, do not get involved in dubious entertainment and play cards for money. </p><p>  All souvenirs sold in shops are expensive.  However, sellers like to bargain, and if desired, reduce the price several times. </p><h2>  Center for mass walks </h2><p>  The human stream passing along the famous boulevard increases every year.  This is a kind of open-air art exhibition where you can enjoy street theater performances, pose for artists, take part in dance competitions, listen to music, take pictures with live sculptures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona ramble district" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2029265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And on holidays the street becomes the center of mass festivities, processions and parades.  As the locals say, only after going through the entire Rambla district in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãyou can find out the city from the inside and feel how it breathes. </p>
