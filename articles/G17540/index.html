    <p>  1) You can‚Äôt buy a policy for a new car that is not registered.  The thing is that when applying for a policy, you must enter the state registration mark of the machine.  You cannot get numbers without insurance.  It turns out that insurance for new cars is available only at the sales office. </p><p>  2) The discount that the driver accumulates for each accident-free year of driving is not always displayed.  It turns out that when you purchase a policy via the Internet, you overpay and lose the discount. </p><p>  3) Insurance companies can customize the application menu at their discretion and automatically check the boxes next to additional insurance items.  At registration it is very difficult to replace these items and uncheck.  It turns out that there is a risk of acquiring unnecessary additional services. </p><p>  4) If you make a mistake when filling out the application, you will not be able to make changes.  Have to re-fill it.  If you register the policy and after you find a mistake, you will need to personally contact the office of the insurance company, write a statement and wait until changes are made and a new CTP insurance policy is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="OSAGO policy in electronic form" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12962/1076246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to buy insurance policy on the official website of the company "Rosgosstrakh" </h2><p>  The very first company that offered motorists an electronic insurance policy - <span>Rosgosstrakh.</span>  <span>Customer reviews</span> indicate that it is acquired quickly and easily.  To purchase the form, you need to go through a simple registration on the official website, confirm personal information, fill out an application and receive a mandatory policy in electronic form. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews of buyers of an electronic policy, there are some difficulties in filling out an application: </p><p>  - the diagnostic card is not checked through a single EAISTO system, so not every motorist will be able to buy motor third-party liability insurance for a used car; </p><p>  - when changing a driver‚Äôs license or last name, a discount is not displayed: in such a situation, you must personally contact a representative of the insurance company and ask to change information and save a discount for trouble-free years. </p>

To renew the policy, you only need to enter the series and number of the old form, wait until all the information is downloaded, and click "calculate for a new term and renew."
