Consider the process of making several do-it-yourself fabric crafts.  Master classes will be presented later. </p><h2>  Case for sunglasses </h2><p>  Making an original pouch for sunglasses is easy.  Do-it-yourself DIY fabric crafts for beginners.  Especially good is that there is simply a huge number of design ideas that will help give the case individuality, make it original and unique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jenniferperkins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY denim crafts" class="if uuid-2362710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362710.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  For work, you will need cotton or linen: 22 x 18 cm for the base, 11 x 12 cm for the cord, 22 x 18 cm for the lining.  You also need a cord and fabric to decorate the finished cover, for example, using appliqu√©s, beads and sequins, and other decorative elements.  The sizes here are for standard sunglasses.  If you set out to make such an article of fabric with your own hands for specific glasses, you first need to check whether the indicated sizes fit them.  To make sure of this, you can first sew a simple bag of unnecessary fabric for fitting size.  Also needed are threads in the color of the main fabric, scissors, needles for handicrafts, a sewing machine, a washable or disappearing marker on the fabric, pins, and an iron with steam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Making a pouch bag </h2><p>  Having prepared all the tools for DIY from the fabric with your own hands, we begin cutting parts.  Two parts (11 x 18 cm) must be cut out of the main part, two parts (11 x 6 cm) from the fabric for the cord, as many details for the lining (11 x 18 cm).  Slices of fabric should be the same in size and as even as possible.  First, we work with two smaller rectangles (fabric for the cord).  Tighten 5-7 mm on both sides (short) and sew, fold the parts in half and place them between the lining parts and the main fabric.  Sew together and repeat the same steps for symmetrical parts. </p><p>  Now you need to assemble the cover into a single whole.  Fold two identical parts face to face, aligning the seams, stitch around the perimeter.  Be sure to leave a small hole to unscrew the product.  Before that, trim the corners.  So the finished product will be more accurate.  Turn the cover through the hole in the lining that you previously left un sewn.  After eversion, sew it with a blind stitch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diypick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY fabric scraps" class="if uuid-2362711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362711.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to insert the cord into the prepared hole.  Cut it in half, insert each half into the holes with a pin so that the ends come out on one side.  Tie the ends of the cord into a knot.  Now, if you pull the knots, the cover will be tightened and will not require any additional fastening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Decorative elements </h2><p>  If you want to make an applique on a case or decorate it with some decorative elements, then you need to do this before stitching two parts of the main fabric.  You can, for example, cut out a silhouette of glasses or any other figure from a patch of contrasting fabric, make a three-dimensional bow, decorate the product with sequins or beads. </p><h2>  Educational toy </h2><p>  Want to make an interesting and safe educational toy for your baby, as well as save money?  A ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù, for example, can be easily made independently.  For such a do-it-yourself fabric crafts, you will need felt of different colors, a bright fabric for the warp, synthetic winterizer, threads of suitable colors, scissors, a needle, textile Velcro fasteners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crestawards.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY patchwork mosaic" class="if uuid-2362725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362725.jpg"></div><h2>  Working process </h2><p>  From the main fabric, cut two identical rectangles measuring 20 x 25 cm and the same rectangle from sintepon.  Sew a synthetic winterizer sheet to the main fabric, laying inclined lines at the same distance, for example, every 5 cm. Now sew a series of pieces of textile Velcro, they should also be at the same distance from each other.  It remains to sew the second segment of the main fabric from the back of the syntepon filler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now work with felt begins.  From colored material you need to cut two identical rectangles.  For example, yellow can be made the largest, blue - a little smaller, orange - even smaller.  Cut the top of the pyramid, for example, from green felt.  The corners on each rectangle are better to round off a bit.  Sew a piece of Velcro tape to one piece of felt from each pair in the middle, sew paired parts, leaving a small hole below, through which you need to fill the parts of the pyramid with filler (this can be cotton wool, holofiber, synthetic winterizer).  Next, you need to sew up the holes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric crafts" class="if uuid-2362729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362729.jpg"></div><p>  The developing toy "Pyramid" is ready, you can attach the details to the base.  It can be folded in order or, conversely, the child can independently form a picture as he likes.  This DIY handmade fabric is safe for babies, as there are no sharp corners and small details on it. </p><h2>  Kitchen potholder with pocket </h2><p>  You can make a craftsmanship from a cloth with your own hands for the kitchen - this is not only a creative process, because the result is a useful little thing.  You will need cotton fabric in two colors (for example, red with a pattern and striped), scissors, synthetic winterizer, threads of a suitable shade, oblique trim.  First cut out a paper tack (a rectangle, the corners of which are rounded on one side) and a pocket to it (the same rectangle, but smaller) - this will be a pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makingitwithdanielle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crafts" class="if uuid-2362708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362708.jpg"></div><h2>  Master Class: Tack </h2><p>  From the red fabric, cut out two large details according to the pattern, one part of the pocket.  Cut the second part of the pocket out of striped fabric.  Cut one more large and small part from the synthetic winterizer.  Now sew on a sewing machine a pocket from a synthetic winterizer to the wrong side of the fabric part.  You need to do this with straight lines parallel to each other.  Also stitch the synthetic winterizer to a large part. </p><p>  Now, manually or on a sewing machine, sew the second part to the inside of the pocket, it must be placed face out.  Treat the top of the pocket with an oblique bek.  Next, sew a finished pocket to the front side of the tack piece.  Fold both parts of the tack with the sides facing each other and sew along the edge, leaving a hole on top.  Turn out a practically finished tack with a pocket on your face. </p><p>  Only the uncut sections from above remained.  On this fabric DIY article, sew the inlay on your own, leaving the loose ends on the sides that need to be rolled up with a loop for the convenience of using the product.  DIY do-it-yourself pocket tack is ready!  Such a product is better held on the hand, it is more convenient and quick to put on and take off than the tack purchased in the store. </p><h2>  Patchwork plaid for cold evenings </h2><p>  You can make a lot of crafts from scraps with your own hands, but a plaid is a good option for beginner needlewomen.  For such a voluminous product, however, a lot of material is required.  You need to find old T-shirts, sweaters, kitchen towels, trousers and shirts, and then cut out many, many triangles or squares from them.  For a baby blanket (110 x 140 cm), for example, 192 pieces of fabric, each 8 x 8 cm, are required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY fabric crafts master class" class="if uuid-2362717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362717.jpg"></div><p>  Nothing if the texture of the fabric is different.  The main thing is that a patchwork mosaic of fabric (do-it-yourself crafts takes a little time) blends seamlessly into the interior.  If a sufficient amount of material cannot be found, then the patchwork can be made of denim.  Such an article made of denim with your own hands will allow you to usefully get rid of all the old jeans at once, and usually quite a lot of them accumulate over several years. </p><p>  You will also need a lining fabric (you can use high-quality cotton, it is desirable that it be plain and combine with the front side) and insulation.  A synthetic winterizer or holofiber is usually used as the latter.  As for the progress of work, first you need to connect all the segments together - this is the most difficult part of such a do-it-yourself piece of cloth scraps.  Then it remains only to connect the front of the plaid, lining and filler.  The edge must be treated with a fabric strip.  Craft from scraps of fabric with your own hands is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crafts for the kitchen" class="if uuid-2362719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2362719.jpg"></div><h2>  Fabric organizer for small things </h2><p>  A useful and original DIY denim handicraft is an organizer for small things from old jeans.  To make such a thing, you need to cut pockets and a small space around them (like shreds) from several pairs of old trousers.  Now you should sew the shreds together, just as you would sew a patchwork quilt.  Organizer base is ready.  It remains only to process the slices, from above, for example, you can attach a belt from trousers or a strip of fabric in a contrasting color.  To fix the denim crafts on the wall, you need to sew on the loops.  They can be threaded with a plastic stick or a regular branch, previously dried, washed, treated with stain and varnish. </p>
