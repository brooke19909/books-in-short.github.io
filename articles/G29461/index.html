    <h2>  Description of the dolphinarium in Tuapse </h2><p>  The park received its first visitors in 2003.  It is open-type and is located near the water park "Dolphin" in the resort town of Nebug (15 km from Tuapse).  The pool for performing artists has a circular shape.  Places for spectators are located in the form of an amphitheater and covered with a canopy.  Therefore, the performance is comfortable to watch in any weather.  But the guests from the first near the "bad weather" is still provided: animals, jumping and spinning, create fountains of spray. </p><p>  You can shoot video and take pictures in the dolphinarium (Tuapse), but only without a flash (it is very harmful to animals).  And they are especially cared for here.  Water in the pools (for living and for performance) is regularly updated.  All mammals undergo routine veterinary examinations.  They have high-quality nutrition, enriched with special vitamin complexes, sparing training and a lot of time to relax.  That is why the artists are always in a good mood, and they perform with great pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For guests arriving by car, a guarded paid parking is organized.  Dolphinarium address in Tuapse: Novorossiysk highway, 9-b. </p><h2>  How is the show going </h2><p>  Not the territory begins to start up an hour before the start of the water show.  At the entrance, guests are greeted with life-size puppets that play with children.  Inside the park there is a cozy cafe with a buffet and tables where you can have a bite to eat while waiting for the show to begin. </p><p>  The first part of the performance consists of the numbers of all members of the troupe.  Each shows his skills, easily completing the tasks of mentors.  This part ends with complex acrobatic somersaults from a trio of dolphins and their solo numbers. </p><p>  The second part of the performance on the “stage” is only the star of the acting troupe - the lioness Alice.  It is incomparable with its elegance and grace. </p><p>  But the favorite part of the show for both children and adults is painting.  Any artist with such rapture and love draws that it is impossible to break away from this spectacle.  Moreover, during the entire existence of the dolphinarium there is not a single repeating pattern.  Each of them is unique. </p><p>  At the end of the water show, the drawing can be purchased at auction.  All proceeds go to charity.  There is also the opportunity to take pictures with marine actors.  And for an additional fee, swim with one of them in the pool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The whole performance lasts about an hour, and at the exit each guest is given free ice cream. </p>

    <h2>  Acting troupe </h2><p>  The water in this area of ​​the Black Sea coast is ideal for keeping dolphinarium pets.  Therefore, they perfectly live and perform in it: </p><ol><li>  Toma is a fur seal.  Very mysterious person.  Her artistic talent leaves no one indifferent. </li><li>  Alice is a sea lioness from South Africa.  Here is an unsurpassed actress.  Alice is the oldest in the corpse, and, of course, she does not need to have experience.  In addition, she is incredibly charming and plastic.  In general, just a beauty.  Her character is calm and balanced.  Alice in any, even the most unpredictable situation, has perfect control over herself.  This lioness is the true lady of the whole dolphinarium in Tuapse (reviews about how she conquered all viewers, young and old, are found more often than others). </li><li>  Gerda is a Far Eastern beluga whale.  A very serious and purposeful artist.  The soul is very quivering and loving.  Gerda has a cheerful and kind character and an optimist in life.  The public loves her very much. </li><li>  Dodon is a Pacific walrus.  He has been performing since a year and a half.  According to mentors, smart beyond his years.  Plus, Dodon already has quite a lot of artistic experience, which allows him to look at everything that is happening a bit down.  With an absolutely unflappable look, the walrus puts the coach in an awkward position, which causes an explosion of laughter in the stands.  His friend is Guidon.  Very artistic and charming.  Trainers say that he is very curious, walrus believes that with his weight (almost 900 kg) this is not his problem. </li><li>  And, of course, dolphins are the Black Sea bottlenose dolphins: Gosha, Yasha and Petrovich.  The latter is an absolute leader among his own.  Very wayward and picky.  But the order in the territory is kept in the most thorough manner.  Gosh is excessively expressive and at the same time extraordinary.  It has a bright but complex character.  His mentor managed to find an approach to him, and now Gosha is an ideal team player.  Yasha, on the contrary, is a naughty boy and a favorite of the audience.  Despite this, he is unconditionally trusted with the most difficult acrobatic tricks, because he is persistent and purposeful. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Sea tricksters </h2><p>  It seems that there are no such combinations and techniques that the AquaMir pets could not do.  All they can do: acrobatics, juggling, singing, drawing.  And both on land and in water.  The rooms cause a storm of emotions among the audience: the guests laugh and applaud the artists all the time.  Yes, and indeed, how can one resist when a sea lioness Alice, who came from South Africa, plays the guitar or pushes speech from the rostrum?  Endless ovations sound in honor of the walruses Gwidon and Dodon, who easily balance the pyramid of barrels on their nose, before doing gymnastics.  And the bastard whales <span>Gerda and Kai,</span> who arrived at the AquaMir Dolphinarium (Tuapse) from the Far East, enjoy dancing the waltz. </p><p>  The numbers of marine artists are many.  But each of them is saturated with love and tenderness between animals and their mentors.  Perhaps that is why the sea lioness hugs with a trainer, and dolphins Yasha, Gosh and Petrovich ride trainers on their noses. </p>

    <p>  All artists are very charming.  Neither children nor adults can believe that a sea lioness waves its guests flippers, or a walrus that closes its face in embarrassment are also learned tricks.  Water artists are very elegant and natural. </p><h2>  Having fun - learn </h2><p>  In the Tuapse Dolphinarium, throughout the course of the action, the audience is told about each animal participating in the performance.  Guests will learn their habits, lifestyle and many other interesting facts about mammals.  And later, a competition is held for children.  The prize is a close acquaintance with marine artists. </p><p>  In addition, dolphin therapy sessions are conducted here.  They have a beneficial effect on children with autism.  Specially designed programs enable the child to interact with the outside world and teach communication.  Sessions are held by prior arrangement with the dolphinarium administration. </p><h2>  Pleasure cost </h2><p>  Entrance ticket to the dolphinarium in Tuapse will cost 600 rubles, except for children up to five years old inclusive (they watch the show for free) and some members of low-income families.  A discount is provided for them, but only upon presentation of a document. </p>

    <h2>  timetable </h2><p>  The entire holiday season shows are held twice a day: at 11.00 and 17.00.  The artists' day off is Monday.  With a decrease in the number of vacationers, each show is announced in advance.  You can clarify the information on the official website of the dolphinarium in Tuapse or official groups on social networks. </p><h2>  Post scriptum </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of good mood, you can visit the dolphinarium and the oceanarium located nearby from each other in Nebug (Tuapse).  The latter is relatively small, and it is much closer from the city.  You can get to him in half an hour.  Regular buses and intercity buses go to Nebug.  You need to exit at the stop "Center". </p><p>  But, on the other hand, the species composition of oceanic inhabitants in the oceanarium of Lazarevskoye is more interesting and diverse. </p>
