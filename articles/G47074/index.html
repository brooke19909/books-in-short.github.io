  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Raglan knitting from the neck - fashionable, beautiful, convenient and easy!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, the ‚Äúhand made‚Äù trend is becoming fashionable again.  It puts forward the first place in clothes and accessories made by yourself.  The process of independent sewing, embroidery, making jewelry from felt and beads, nylon and sequin is welcome.  A separate unit in fashion stands out knitting.  Raglan takes a special place in this block. </p><p>  <span>Knitting a raglan</span> from the neck is very convenient in that, firstly, it relieves the master from knitting armholes and ridges at the sleeves - a rather difficult moment in the process of making things.  Secondly, this method practically solves the problems associated with stitching sleeves into the armhole, as a result of which the thing of this model always successfully ‚Äúsits‚Äù on the figure.  Thirdly, if the sweater is intended to be worn by the baby, then, as it grows, it is very convenient to tie it up, only the very bottom of the sleeves and the product itself.  And even if the needlewoman does not have the yarn of the desired color, you can make cuffs and a lower elastic band from another material or knit original strips into the edging. </p><p>  If the craftswoman is not ready to begin work on circular knitting needles, then she can use ordinary knitting.  With the chosen method of knitting, the <span>raglan sleeve</span> is still much easier to do than to carefully reduce-add loops in the manufacture of a conventional model with an armhole. </p><p>  In order for the seam of the sleeve to look beautiful, reduction should not be done along the very edge, but 2 loops should be removed from it.  That is, by removing the hem and knitting two front in each row, the next two loops need to be knit together front.  In the same way, a decrease is made on the back and in front of the model.  The sleeve is finished when it will be required - the craftswoman will see this when applying the part to the pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But more convenient, as already mentioned, knitting a raglan from the neck.  Moreover, the model with this embodiment can be a jacket, a cardigan or even a coat with a fastener in front of the bottom of the product.  Or maybe it can be a braid or tennis with a small, 10 centimeters, fastener on top.  You can also make the product in the form of a sweater with a neck for a shirt, either ‚Äúunder the neck‚Äù, with a collar - a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù, which, if desired, turns into an original hood, or an elegant ‚Äúcollar‚Äù.  But all these collars are tied to the neck or sewn after the main product is ready. </p><p>  Raglan knitting from the neck itself is performed on top on circular knitting needles.  In some cases, you can use ordinary knitting needles.  But then you should pay attention to the fact that the needles should have both ends free.  And so that the loops from such knitting needles do not fall off, it is recommended to use pieces from the eraser, which should be worn on both ends of the knitting needle immediately after knitting all the loops on it.  When the turn of a new needle approaches, one working end of the needle is freed from the eraser.  Spokes should be taken as much as is necessary for the job. </p><p>  Usually everywhere the knitting of the raglan from the neck has such a description of the connecting seam of the sleeve with the main part: on both sides of the selected loop, around which the loops are added, the usual crochets are made.  After knitting them then in the usual way, openwork holes are obtained.  On thin products, it looks extremely beautiful. </p><p>  But in the manufacture of tight knit models, for example, cardigans or coats, such holes are even, you see, undesirable.  Then adding loops with the help of the crow's feet pattern is quite appropriate.  In this case, just three are knitted from one loop.  A hole is not formed in this case. </p><p>  To knit three stitches from one, you should knit a loop in the usual way, but do not remove it from the left knitting needle.  Then the yarn is made, and the loop is knitted again.  Only then can it be removed.  The seam also looks beautiful and elegant.  The most important thing in any knitted model is the accuracy of execution.  And then everyone who begins to wear a hand-knitted item will constantly experience comfort and pleasure from it! </p>
