Both young men and women, as well as adults, are striving here.  Some want to enjoy the city's beauties and see the main objects of the country.  And some want to come to the city in order to find work and stay here.  In any case, all people are connected by a desire and desire to find affordable housing in Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geos-inform.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãcourtyard" class="if uuid-2649992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2649992.jpg"></div><h2>  How to rent a house in Moscow </h2><p>  Of course, the ideal option would be to housing in which your friends or relatives have already stayed. </p><p>  Removal without intermediaries is the best option.  Most experienced tenants understand that if you have an intermediary, you need to pay a lump sum of three times the sum for the housing (security deposit for the last month, current month and the agreed amount to the agent). </p><p>  If you decide to rent an apartment, not a hostel, then it is better to use a long-forgotten way - ads.  In the area where you are going to live, post paper announcements and communicate only with the owners.  Inexpensive apartments in Moscow (secondary housing) can be found not only in the periphery.  The main thing is to check all the documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drop inn" class="if uuid-2650966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2650966.jpg"></div><p>  Read the documents carefully (lease agreement).  This applies to both rental apartments and hotels, hostels.  The contract must necessarily indicate the owner, the deadline for the rental, cost.  You can supplement the documents yourself with the necessary items (in case of damage to property or other circumstances). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hostels, or Cheap Accommodation in Moscow </h2><p>  It is worthwhile to decide in advance on the area in which you are comfortable living.  You need to understand that if you rent a hostel at the other end of the city, far from work, you can spend more money and time on the way to the desired place. </p><h2>  Drop inn </h2><p>  This small hotel is located very close to Red Square and the train station.  Guests respond well to the hostel and rate their stay in it at 9.3 points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel ICON, Moscow" class="if uuid-2650970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2650970.jpg"></div><p>  Among the shortcomings, seasonal high cost is noted, although compared to all other hotels, the price is decent (about 3000 rubles).  The storage system for shoes and outerwear is not quite thought out. </p><p>  This hostel provides its guests with the opportunity to sleep in a full room or in a capsule for one person.  The big plus is that the capsule has a screen, which is locked with a key.  A sense of security and preservation of personal space is ensured.  This has significant advantages over other hostels, where you have to cohabit with neighbors (not always adequate). </p><p>  All guests say that the apartments and capsules are very clean.  The bedding is fresh and snow-white.  There are shelves in the capsules.  The issue of storing shoes in capsules has not been thought out.  Most leave it near their berth, which creates some kind of chaos in the room, and the smell is a little annoying. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hostel Jolly </h2><p>  This cozy hostel is located within walking distance from the Cathedral of Christ the Savior (Ostozhenka Street, 7).  Many believe that living in it is much more comfortable than in the nearest other mini-hotels.  Hostel - housing in Moscow for daily and inexpensive (3500 rubles), but comfortable. </p><p>  The building of the mini-hotel itself is a cultural monument.  Very cozy green courtyard.  The hostel is clean and quiet.  Many even say that it can not be called a hostel - it's too good.  The staff is friendly and always ready to help.  There is a small kitchen with everything you need, except for the stove.  A coffee machine is available for a fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Jedi, Moscow" class="if uuid-2650971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2650971.jpg"></div><p>  After leaving for a symbolic price, you can leave your things in storage.  The temple is visible even from some windows.  Directly in this building is located "Chocolate Girl", and opposite a shop and a pharmacy.  There is free internet and a washing machine.  Everything is pretty new.  The repair is decent, and the interior is tasteful. </p><h2>  Hostel Kremlin Lights </h2><p>  If you walk 200 meters from the Borovitskaya metro station, you will be taken to the doors of this hostel.  Just a two minute walk you will be met by the Kremlin.  Exact address: Volkhonka street, 5/6, building 4, Khamovniki. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most guests believe that such a place fully meets the price-quality ratio.  Here you can either stay in a separate room or rent a bed for the necessary time, which is closed by a curtain.  The average cost of a room is 3000-5000 rubles. </p><p>  Book a place in advance.  For some, this may be a minus.  After all, this location makes the hostel very popular.  All guests respond positively about this place.  They say that it is very clean and comfortable.  The rooms are constantly cleaned.  Bed linens are somewhat worn from washing, but they should soon be replaced.  Very friendly administrators are ready at any time to tell you how to get to one place or another. </p><h2>  Netizen Moscow, Rome </h2><p>  Enthusiast Boulevard, d. 2 is the address of this hostel.  Guests rate it at 9.1 points and consider it acceptable for short-term stays.  This is an inexpensive housing in the new Moscow (2000-3000 rubles). </p><p>  The great advantage of this hostel is that it is located in the business center building.  On the ground floor there is a cafe, as well as a gym.  Guests can use the free internet.  Each room is equipped with ironing facilities and a hairdryer.  Laundry facilities are available for a fee. </p><p>  All guests of this place consider it excellent.  Of the shortcomings, it can be noted that bed linen must be made up by ourselves (at night check-in is not very comfortable for neighbors).  The rooms even for 14 people are very spacious, there is air conditioning.  In the morning, breakfast is buffet style.  Nearby there is a large supermarket and restaurant.  Attractions within walking distance.  A free left-luggage office helps out a lot upon check-out. </p><h2>  Hostel ICON </h2><p>  Relatively close to the Arbat and the Luzhniki Stadium (about 3.5 km) you can spend the night in this mini-hotel.  Numerous reviews suggest that the hostel is in demand among city guests. </p><p>  If you need to rent a house in Moscow inexpensively, you can spend the night in a comfortable apartment with an interesting interior (on average from 1,500 to 3,000 rubles).  The rooms are all new and clean.  The beds do not creak, there are separate sockets and shelves for small things. </p><p>  Some guests note poor ventilation in the rooms and old plumbing in showers.  The morning breakfast did not please everyone.  Some say that at 8:35 the food was never served.  The view from the apartment is simply gorgeous, especially from the upper floors. </p><h2>  Hostel "Yesenin" </h2><p>  On the street Krasnoprudnaya, d. 28, you can inexpensively spend the night.  The hostel with such a poetic name attracts many tourists who rate it at 9.3 points.  It should be noted that this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow is quite popular for guests, because it is here that there are many attractions and memorable places.  The pricing policy of hotels and their congestion in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city are connected with this. </p><p>  The interior of the mini-hotel is quite calm and laid-back.  Everything is done in a classic style, walls in pastel colors.  At the entrance you will meet beautiful furniture and a <span>luminous sign.</span>  Stylish and affordable housing in Moscow is the Yesenin hostel (room rates from 1,000 to 3,000 rubles). </p><p>  Of the minuses, some guests note problems with hot water (interruptions) and poor drainage in the shower.  The requirement of a deposit at the reception is somewhat confusing.  However, such rules exist in almost all European hotels.  Take cash with you, because there are no ATMs in a radius of 500 meters, and you can‚Äôt leave a deposit on the card at the hostel. </p><p>  In general, the apartments are spacious and clean.  The internet works pretty well.  The staff is polite and friendly.  A fridge, microwave and kettle are also featured. </p><h2>  Hostel Boxtel </h2><p>  This capsule hostel is located on the old Arbat Street, a 15-minute walk from the metro station of the same name.  This is an option of housing without intermediaries in Moscow - inexpensive and very convenient (up to 3000 rubles). </p><p>  Many people choose this type of overnight stay to preserve their personal intimate space.  The capsule is locked with a shutter.  Inside there are sockets and a shelf for small things.  Bed linen and towels are provided.  Showers are clean.  However, they do not have mirrors.  You can use the kitchen and everything you need.  During check-in, they will give you a key to the capsule and a chip from the intercom, so you can return at any time.  Conveniently, there are double capsules. </p><p>  Some note poor ventilation in boxing in hot weather.  However, perhaps this is just a situational flaw. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Boxtel, Moscow." class="if uuid-2650974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2650974.jpg"></div><h2>  Jedi hostel </h2><p>  On the Arbat, it‚Äôs quite difficult to rent inexpensive housing.  This youth hostel, according to guests, is one of the best.  Some have stayed here more than once and are ready to come again only to this place.  You can rent cheap accommodation in Moscow on Arbat at night in this hostel (about 1500-2000 rubles per day). </p><p>  Right at the entrance to the hostel at the second Smolensky Lane 1/4 you will be welcomed by a smiling staff who will tell you how to live in a hostel.  Slippers and a towel will be issued, as well as the keys to your own locker and intercom.  All sleeping places are equipped with curtains, sockets and shelves for small things, and also nearby there are shelves for storing things. </p><p>  Shower and toilet are shared.  However, they do not have a queue, as in other hotels.  The fact that there is no elevator is upsetting, and therefore it‚Äôs hard to go up to the 4th floor with a suitcase.  It can sometimes be noisy outside, but it's Arbat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Jolly" class="if uuid-2650969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2650969.jpg"></div><h2>  Star Wars Hostel </h2><p>  Address: Krivokolenny per., 4, c3.  Those who visit this hostel for the first time may be very surprised at the value for money.  A day's stay will cost 2000-3000 rubles. </p><p>  Firstly, the excellent location of the hotel makes all tourists happy.  Near Red Square, GUM, metro, shops and cafes.  All that is needed is within walking distance.  The chic interior of the apartment.  Very fresh and stylish.  Feel at home. </p><p>  The staff is also very friendly.  They help to understand metro lines, leave things in storage even after eviction.  Inexpensive housing in Moscow in such an area and with such a service is very difficult to find. </p><p>  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Always clean.  Slippers, a towel and soap accessories are provided free of charge.  The kitchen has tea, coffee and all the necessary equipment and utensils. </p><h2>  Cheap apartments in Moscow (secondary housing) </h2><p>  If you decide to purchase your own housing, so as not to pay certain amounts to the owners, then you need to study the real estate market.  It is important to determine the area and type of construction. </p><p>  Resellers without intermediaries can be inexpensively bought without repair and interior decoration.  Some sell apartments quickly or in installments.  It is important to negotiate with the owner all the nuances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uvao.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="secondary housing" class="if uuid-2650026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2650026.jpg"></div><p>  Inexpensive secondary housing in New Moscow is acquired by young families on credit, as well as mature people.  To do this, simply contact the bank and request the necessary amount.  Everyone is trying to choose comfortable housing in a developing area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Nearby there should be kindergartens, schools, shops, as well as metro and bus stops.  All this is very important in everyday life. </p><p>  For example, apartments in the South-Eastern district of the city are currently in demand.  Offers of secondary housing (inexpensive) in Moscow SEAD is common.  This may be due to the environmental situation in the area.  It's all about the smoke coming from industrial plants.  Winds blow into this part of the city.  However, there are many parks and green spaces, which is favorable for couples with children.  The apartments here are quite spacious and comfortable.  Large courtyards with parking lots are equipped. </p>
