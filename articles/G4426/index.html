    <h2>  Russian comments on the number of rooms and the location of the hotel </h2><p>  Almost all the tourists staying at Manos Palace 3 * during their trip to Crete note that the rooms offered by him were quite spacious and pleasantly decorated.  According to them, it is noticeable that recently a repair was carried out here.  Furniture and appliances in the apartments are not new, but everything is in good, working condition.  Also, many guests were pleased with the presence of a kitchenette in the room and a minimum set of dishes.  So, if you wish, you can always cook yourself a dinner, make coffee or make tea.  Our compatriots were satisfied with the quality of cleaning, as well as its regularity.  According to the guests, the maids changed linen and towels twice a week.  Also, experienced travelers recommend that those who are embarrassed by the water flowing from the curtain in the bathroom to the floor, ask the maid for an additional towel for the floor. </p><p>  As for the location of Manos Palace 3 *, it can be confidently called very successful.  So, the beach from the hotel can be reached in just three minutes.  In addition, in the vicinity of the hotel there are many taverns and restaurants where you can treat yourself to superbly prepared dishes of local cuisine.  By the way, experienced tourists recommend ordering one portion for two here, since the portions are very large, and it will not be easy to deal with them alone.  There is also a bus stop near the hotel with links to many cities in Crete.  The very village of Bali, where the hotel is located, is small and more conducive to a relaxing family vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of tourists about the food and staff of the Manos Palace Hotel </h2><p>  An exceptionally positive opinion among our compatriots was formed about the employees of Manos Palace 3 * (Rethymno).  So, according to them, the staff, led by a very pleasant and hospitable host, does everything possible to create a homely atmosphere of coziness and comfort for guests.  You can always ask employees a question, they will help you in any situation.  In addition, many tourists were pleased with the fact that some of the hotel staff speak Russian.  Therefore, you will not have any problems in communication here. </p><p>  As for food, the guests at the Manos Palace (only breakfast is offered here) were satisfied with the guests.  Despite the fact that the set of dishes every morning was approximately the same, there was always plenty to choose from.  So, something hot was always offered (fried eggs, omelet, etc.), salad, cereal, fresh vegetables and fruits, delicious pastries.  In addition, many guests liked the fact that breakfasts are served in the restaurant on the fourth floor of the hotel, which offers picturesque views of the sea and surroundings. </p><h2>  Travel Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, the Manos Palace 3 * hotel is a great place for lovers of beach holidays.  So, the nearest magnificent sandy beach is 200 meters from the hotel.  The water here is clean, the area is equipped with comfortable sunbeds and umbrellas, as well as equipment for entertainment and sports on the water.  If you want to soak up the sand, then renting a deck chair is not necessary.  So, you can walk a few tens of meters to a site not occupied by beach equipment, and conveniently sit on a rug or towel brought with you.  Along the coastline there are lots of taverns, cafes and bars, so you can have a bite to eat and refresh yourself with your favorite drink. </p><p>  Since Manos Palace has a very small territory of its own, it cannot offer any special entertainment to its guests.  So, there is only a small outdoor pool.  Experienced travelers recommend not to get hung up on beach vacations and sunbathing, but to travel to Crete.  This can be done both as part of an organized excursion group, or independently, by renting a car. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say with confidence that most of our compatriots who visited Manos Palace 3 * <span>(Crete)</span> this summer <span>,</span> really liked the <span>hotel</span> .  According to them, it is an excellent combination of price and quality.  Many tourists would love to come back here again.  In addition, almost all guests plan to recommend this hotel to their relatives and friends. </p>
