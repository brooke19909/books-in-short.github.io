More than a million Russians live here, so the question of housing construction is very acute.  The new Platovsky residential complex will partially help to resolve it.  Rostov-on-Don is characterized by rather dense buildings.  Finding a free site within the city for a large-scale project is very difficult, but the Platovsky developer was able to obtain permission to obtain an area of ‚Äã‚Äã14 hectares for the construction of a housing complex.  In the future, a whole microdistrict from 20 residential high-rise houses and cottages will grow here.  LCD "Platovsky" is only the first part of this project.  In the future, a developed urban infrastructure with children's institutions, shopping centers, leisure facilities will appear here.  So far, there is almost nothing out of this list.  How do apartment owners of the first houses commissioned in Platovsky live?  What difficulties do they have to face?  How is the progress of construction of this <span>residential complex?</span>  When is the final deadline?  First things first. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It can be said that on the northern outskirts of the city is the Platovsky residential complex (Rostov-on-Don).  The address of the land plot allocated for its development was as follows: Pervomaisky district, Musorgsky street / Alyabyev lane.  Now the first houses already handed over are assigned to Teryaev Street.  They were assigned letters 9, 8, 5 and 7, and the house with letter 6 was assigned to Timofeev street.  On the west side, the neighbor of the complex is the Cosmos Garden Association, from the south and east - the areas of Kamyshevakh and Aksai.  In the north direction from the complex to the Rostselmash Gardening Partnership, there are territories not occupied by large construction projects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  It is not very convenient for residents of the Platovsky residential complex to reach the central areas of the city.  Reviews of those who have already moved into their new apartments mark one of the main disadvantages of the complex as its inconvenient transport accessibility.  Only one bus No. 35A reaches the new complex, and there are usually no flights at 6:00 and 6:30 declared in the timetable, and the interval between other flights is about an hour.  Before bus stops No. 36 and No. 42A from the complex you need to walk about 500 meters, which is not so far, but these routes work extremely poorly.  Residents of Platovsky sent an open letter to the city administration asking them to transfer the final stops of some city buses, in particular, No. 92, closer to the housing complex. As a result of their efforts, authorities allocated more cars to route No. 35A, which practically did not affect the traffic interval.  In addition, the mayor's office promised by the end of 2017 to resolve the issue of transferring the final stops of some buses closer to the complex. </p><p>  For motorists, the transport accessibility of the Platovsky residential complex can be called conditionally favorable.  Next to the complex is the Shchepkinskoye highway, passing into the Alyabyev lane, which is certainly convenient.  In addition, it is easy to drive from the complex onto the Don highway and get to the city center via it.  But traffic jams often occur on these highways, which increases the length of the trip to / from work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The nature around is one of the significant advantages of the Platovsky residential complex.  Rostov-on-Don has a developed industry, but all enterprises are concentrated closer to the city center and are at a considerable distance from Platovsky. </p><p>  But natural objects from the complex are located very close.  So, to the Rostov Sea from it - only 500 meters, to the Schepkinsky forest - less than 800 meters, and to the beach on the Rostov Sea and the forest park located immediately behind it - less than 1 kilometer. </p><p>  In large cities, the ecology is worsened by the flow of cars on the roads.  LCD "Platovsky" and with this was lucky, because next to the complex there is only one more or less stressful highway. </p><p>  Small minuses in the location of the complex, as indicated by some residents, can be called only two points: </p><ol><li>  Residents from the upper floors, whose windows face the east, report that they can see the cemetery from the windows. </li><li>  A nuclear repository is located 15 km from the complex. </li></ol><p>  Regarding the second point, it should be said that Platovsky, in comparison with other housing complexes of Rostov, is in the most favorable position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The developer at the Platovsky residential complex is not one company, but a whole association called the VKB New Buildings.  It includes 9 construction companies and 6 management companies.  Specifically, Platovsky is engaged in IC Rostov, CJSC Kuban Marka and OJSC Gulkevichsky.  VKB New Buildings is a fairly well-known agglomerate engaged in the construction of real estate not only in Rostov, but also in Krasnodar, Anapa, Sochi.  The developer has dozens of commissioned facilities, including housing complexes, schools, hospitals, kindergartens, sports facilities, and all the companies that are part of VKB New Buildings strive to always comply with the deadlines and perform the work efficiently. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  RC ‚ÄúPlatovsky‚Äù in Rostov-on-Don, according to the general plan, consists of 5 buildings with storeys from 16 to 19. In the future, another 14-15 buildings of different floors will be built next.  In this LC, the infrastructure is not very rich and includes only well-maintained house sections.  Here flowers, shrubs and trees will be planted, tiled paths laid, benches installed.  Surrounded by greenery, the developer undertakes to build several playgrounds with attractions, a surface parking lot, and allocate places for drying clothes.  <span>The fencing of the territory</span> and its protection are not planned.  In the future, when the microdistrict grows, multiple social facilities (market, kindergarten, school, clinic, pharmacies and shops, sports facilities) should appear on its territory. </p><h2>  Infrastructure nearby </h2><p>  At the moment there is no very developed infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the Platovsky residential complex (Rostov-on-Don).  Responses of residents note that building social facilities on the territory of the complex is a vital concern.  Of all that is now nearby, it is a veterinary clinic 450 meters from the LCD, and two grocery stores, respectively, 650 and 500 meters.  The nearest kindergartens (private and municipal) are within a radius of 1,500 meters, the nearest schools and clinics are within a radius of 2,000 meters.  You need to walk about 1 kilometer to large supermarkets and shops from the complex. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Platovsky" (Rostov-on-Don), reviews of real estate investors and tenants </h2><p>  This housing complex has become a wonderful opportunity to purchase the long-awaited apartment for people whose wealth is average or low.  It also provides for the sale of real estate on special conditions to orphans and other socially unprotected categories of citizens.  Perhaps this is one of the main advantages of Platovsky. </p><p>  The opinions of those who have already settled on the complex are somewhat ambiguous.  Residents see in the LCD such advantages: </p><ul><li>  adequate price for 1 sq. m .; </li><li>  apartments for rent fully finished; </li><li>  wonderful ecology of the area; </li><li>  the proximity of the Rostov Sea and forest parks. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages noted by the tenants are as follows: </p><ul><li>  transport accessibility consists of one bus route, the traffic interval of which is about an hour, and all other bus routes are still at the promise level; </li><li>  very expensive utilities; </li><li>  in apartments often does not work heating; </li><li>  water may not rise to the upper floors; </li><li>  after signing the acceptance certificate, the builders did not correct all the violations noted; </li><li>  no infrastructure. </li></ul><p>  Those who are still waiting for the treasured keys, note such shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  delay in delivery deadlines; </li><li>  some apartments have poorly glazed balconies and poorly sealed construction joints. </li></ul><p>  Interest-holders see the advantages of the complex in its location with respect to natural objects, low housing prices, the reliability of the builder and the excellent work of sales managers. </p>
