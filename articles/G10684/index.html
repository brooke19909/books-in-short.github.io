    <h2>  A bit about local regulations </h2><p>  Almost all the beaches of Rimini and the surrounding area are divided into numbered zones.  Each is serviced by a separate owner, who provides reception, children‚Äôs and sports grounds, a shower and changing cabins at his site.  There are also the main attributes of a beach holiday: sunbeds and umbrellas.  Here and there are bars and small cafes. </p><p>  There is Wi-Fi on the beaches of Rimini, but you shouldn‚Äôt count on watching a movie.  The maximum that will turn out is to check mail.  The music flowing through the loudspeaker is sometimes interrupted by announcements in Russian, mainly about how to relax safely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are the flags honking? </h2><p>  With a certain periodicity along the coast you can see lifeguards decorated with flags, the color of which carries information about the weather and the safety of swimming.  The best conditions are assumed by a white flag.  It means that the gentle sea is ready to take you into its arms.  If the red flag is hanging, then this may mean - or the absence of rescuers, or the sea is such that it is better not to swim.  Yellow, however, signals that bathing in general is not a matter of strong winds, even umbrellas cannot be opened. </p><p>  On each beach, about 20 meters from the water, there is a free zone on which it is forbidden to sit with things.  But this order is often violated.  Here you can see street vendors, mostly blacks, who evaporate at the slightest hint of police officers. </p>

    <h2>  About the cost of beach services </h2><p>  Prices vary significantly on different Rimini beaches, even in the same area.  In general, the northern coast is considered to be the most economical: Viserbella, Rivabella, Viserba, Torre Pedrera, despite the fact that there are quite expensive areas here.  The most expensive on the coast of Rimini is the central zone of Marina Centro - the farther south from it, the lower the prices.  The average cost for one umbrella and two sun loungers is 15 ‚Ç¨ per day or 80 ‚Ç¨ per week.  One sunbed can be rented for 3-5 ‚Ç¨ per day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Special Purpose Beaches </h2><p>  There are in Rimini (Italy) beaches of "interest", on which you may be more comfortable than on ordinary ones.  For example, with animals you can safely go to the beach of the 6th Chelly Rivabella in the northern zone, the beaches of the 26th, 28th, 39th and other central zones, or the 76th, 80th, 150th in the south direction.  Section 38 Edgisto Viserba offers additional services for the blind - for example, a tactile map.  There are beaches specializing in children's vacations - here for kids there are many entertainments, animations, slides, swings, etc. There are places for young people, where there are a lot of sports grounds, bars.  We remind you that you can get to any beach for free, but you can use sun loungers, umbrellas and other services only for money. </p><p>  All the beaches of Rimini, according to tourists, are great for families with children due to the shallow depth of the sea near the coast and the gentle entrance - it‚Äôs quite safe for children to swim here.  Most even free beaches are well-groomed and suitable for swimming, but paid ones are certainly cleaner, and more services are offered here. </p>

    <h2>  Marebello </h2><p>  This beach area in the center of Rimini, in the area (or in the Italian commune) of Miramare, is also popular among young people due to its many entertainment programs, fun and exciting evenings.  You will not be bored here for sure during the entire tourist season, which lasts from May to September.  Very well-kept beach, clean sand, clear water, a gentle entrance and many water attractions.  You can safely go and a big company, because any person will find here something to their most demanding taste.  Many sporting events: if you wish, you can take part in futsal, volleyball or learn something new, because master classes are held here constantly and the choice is huge. </p><p>  Even lovers of traditional Slavic holidays, who do not recognize any stress on vacation, will not get bored, because almost daily tastings of local wines simply will not leave time for melancholy.  In the evenings, colorful fireworks can be seen from anywhere in the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarebello, which can often be seen in the photo of the beaches of Rimini.  And if a family with small children comes here, then they will most likely be satisfied with the rest - instructors, trainers, experienced nannies will teach the child to swim and even a bunch of useful things, and just look after the children, while their parents will anneal them in good conscience in <span>Italian Riviera.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Bellariva </h2><p>  Not far from Marebello there is another part of Miramare beach, 4 km from Rimini south - this is Bellariva beach, which means ‚Äúbeautiful beach‚Äù.  It is widely known among Italian tourists and advanced foreigners who know how to choose places to stay.  The sea here, as indeed in the entire resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRimini, is clean and gentle, the sand is fine, white and warm, the <span>beach is gentle.</span>  It is recommended that families with children go here, since there is a large rescue center and it works almost around the clock.  That is, when asked which beach in Rimini is the safest, you can safely answer that it is Bellariva, although Italians do a good job of safety along the entire coast.  There is enough entertainment both day and evening: holidays are arranged almost every day, as well as various folk festivals.  The Sangiovese mollusk festival, known far beyond Italy, is also held here.  Italians flock to it like butterflies into the light from different parts of the country. </p>

The Marina Centro area is always full of people, fun and interesting.  Here they play volleyball, football, table and tennis, do yoga, dance.  In the end, they just get to know each other and have fun together.  In the evening, at Marina Central every day there are shows and discos where you can meet both locals and tourists, literally of all ages. </p><p>  You won‚Äôt be hungry at Marina Central - there are simply catering establishments like mushrooms for every taste: <span>street bars, restaurants,</span> and seafood <span>cafes</span> .  And of course, everything is very tasty - Italians know a lot about food. </p>
