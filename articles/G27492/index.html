    <h2>  The policy is ... </h2><p>  The first step is to understand what kind of document we are talking about.  A medical policy is a document that allows you to participate in CHI or VHI programs.  Most often, the first option is found in practice. </p><p>  Serves for receiving free medical care in all medical institutions of Russia.  This should be remembered by every citizen.  Recently, this document is drawn up in 2 forms.  The first is an old model.  It represents a small blue paper.  It contains information about the insured person, as well as information about the insurance company. </p><p>  The policy must be issued by every citizen of the Russian Federation.  Even children at birth do it.  Therefore, it is important to know what this document is. </p><h2>  View </h2><p>  A new medical sample will be presented below.  What does this document look like?  A new policy is the most common piece of plastic.  A plastic card that resembles a credit card.  It is this kind of policy that has begun to be encountered in Russia recently. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The card has information from two sides.  Completely duplicates everything that is written on the old-style insurance policy.  Only now you can carry with you not paper, which is easy to damage, but a compact and durable card.  Very comfortably! </p>

    <p>  Usually cards are distinguished by their design.  Much depends on which company produces plastic.  Most often, black or painted in the colors of the Russian flag. </p><h2>  Policy Information </h2><p>  Interested in a new sample of medical policy?  It is worth paying attention to what specific information is written on a plastic card.  Not everyone understands this moment. </p><p>  The policy card contains: </p><ul><li>  F. I. O. of the insured person; </li><li>  information about the insured; </li><li>  personal data of the insured person; </li><li>  expiration date (mostly none); </li><li>  floor; </li><li>  signature example; </li><li>  photo of the insured person (not on all cards); </li><li>  citizen's individual account number. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, the information on the new policy is even more diverse than on the old version of the document.  In any case, some insurance companies.  Therefore, it is not necessary to think about whether to get a new sample of a medical policy.  Such a document will not be superfluous.  You can store it with bank cards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  What are the pros and cons of the document under study?

    <p>  The thing is that such documentation was introduced in Russia to expedite patient care.  In fact, using a plastic card is really convenient.  Among the advantages can be identified: </p><ol><li>  Durability.  Spoiling a plastic card is very difficult. </li><li>  Mobility.  The small size of the document contributes to the convenient storage of a plastic card. </li><li>  The speed of patient care.  Work with the new policy is really faster than with the old model. </li></ol><p>  But there are also disadvantages.  They are fewer, and they are not so significant.  The disadvantages that a new type of health insurance policy has is that plastic cards are not accepted at all medical institutions.  As already mentioned, the emergence of new policies has occurred in Russia recently.  And not all organizations can accept a document for further processing.  The best option is to get both a paper policy and a new one. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  But only in what organizations is this document drawn up?  This question interests many.  Answering it is easy enough.  Modern citizens can contact the following organizations: </p><ul><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  Insurance companies; </li><li>  portal "Public services". </li></ul><p>  Most often, the population turns to insurance companies.  This is the fastest scenario.  But what documents can come in handy?  How is a new medical policy issued? </p>

    <h2>  Documents </h2><p>  In fact, everything is extremely simple.  But a lot depends on who the recipient of the document is.  In practice, people who first draw up a policy get two of its options at once.  But you can also separately obtain a medical policy of a new sample. </p><p>  To do this, it is enough to contact one of the previously listed bodies with a statement of the established form.  Apply to it: </p><ul><li>  identity card (passport); </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  This is all that is needed from an adult.  If you have an old-style policy, you can bring it.  But this is optional. </p><p>  In order for them to have a new sample of a medical policy, children need: </p><ul><li>  statement on behalf of parents; </li><li>  passport of the applicant parent; </li><li>  SNILS of the child; </li><li>  birth certificate; </li><li>  identity card of the child (for persons from 14 years old); </li><li>  certificate of registration (preferably). </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  By the way, foreign citizens can also get a policy card.  To do this, you need: </p><ul><li>  statement in the established form; </li><li>  identity card (foreign passport); </li><li>  migration card or other evidence of legality in the country. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  After a while, you can pick up the finished document.  If there is no old-style policy, then a citizen will be issued a temporary one.  It will allow you to receive medical care for free, but only until a certain date. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what kind of sample a new sample medical policy has.  In fact, the use of this document is gaining popularity.  The population notes that a plastic card is more convenient than a paper interpretation. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the so-called PEC is now being put into circulation in Russia.  This is a card that replaces many documents.  For example, a passport or policy.  Valid for only 5 years, after which it must be replaced.  Usually manufactured at the MFC upon request.  This is also a peculiar example of a new medical policy.  But only PECs are not in great demand. </p>
