It can be both construction or real estate objects, and other events (for example, in the form of integrated investment projects). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As mentioned above, state regulation of investment programs is carried out by the adoption of federal laws regulating the formation of federal budgets for each <span>financial year.</span> </p><h2>  Investment program: features of its financing </h2><p>  The composition of investment programs of federal significance is constantly undergoing changes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="federal investment program" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5085/436162.jpg" width="565"></div>  So, recently (since 2011), in addition to property of state importance, as well as property of business entities (for example, legal entities), capital construction projects of municipal property of constituent entities of the Russian Federation are included in their composition.  A prerequisite for such investments is the availability of co-financing of construction works through the provision of subsidies (appropriations) from the federal budget.

    <p>  The investment program annually provides for the allocation of budget funds for reconstruction, construction, acquisition of various facilities, as well as their technical re-equipment (an average of 900 billion rubles).  At the same time, obsolescence of strategically important facilities for the state requires more and more financing every year.  For comparison: in 2010 federal funds were allocated in the amount of 764 billion rubles, in 2011 - already 895 billion rubles, in 2013 - 953 billion rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the presence of a surplus of the federal budget of the Russian Federation in 2011 allowed in 2012 to allocate the maximum amount of allocations for the development of investment projects - 1063 billion rubles. </p><h2>  Monitoring of investment programs </h2><p>  What is an investment program?  This is well understood by the ministries and departments interested in state subsidies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is an investment program" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5085/436163.jpg" width="350"></div>  However, the state puts forward certain requirements that require immediate implementation:

Therefore, it is safe to say (and without exaggeration) that an investment program of federal significance allows the construction or reconstruction of facilities in those areas of activity that are partially or fully supported by the state. </p>
