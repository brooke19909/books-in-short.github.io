    <h2>  Causes </h2><p>  Each battery has a power controller.  Thanks to him, we can see the percentage of battery charge on the screen.  The same element determines the need for the device to recharge.  When the phone is discharged, the controller after urgent requirements to replenish energy reserves goes into the mode of protecting the battery from complete exhaustion. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the battery is charged through a charger that has a <span>current limiter.</span>  This information contains a way to revive the phone‚Äôs battery - to put current directly.  In order that this does not carry a danger to life, there are several simple ways, which are described below. </p><h2>  Elemental way </h2><p>  No matter how unexpected it may sound, leave your device to charge for a day.  For some devices, the push will be one of the pulses received from the charger.  Roughly speaking, at some point, the battery will ‚Äúpick up‚Äù the current and begin to accumulate charge.  Do not get angry if the phone reacts to the charger with a dark screen.  In this case, you can‚Äôt rush.  Other methods should be tried only after this method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Power supply, resistor and voltmeter </h2><p>  For the second, more complex and time-consuming method, a power supply with a constant voltage of up to 12 volts is required.  It is better that the voltage is from five or a little higher (it is safer).  You can use the power supply from the router and even the charger from the smartphone itself.  As an assistant, a resistor is suitable, which is designed for power from 0.5 watts and a nominal value of 330 ohms. </p><p>  As for the voltmeter, it is rather a whim than a necessity.  So its presence is by no means necessary, although very desirable. </p><p>  The connection scheme to primitiveness is simple: we connect the minus of the source to the minus of the battery, and plus through the resistor to the plus of the battery.  Where is the plus and where is the minus at the source?  If you have a charger like a plug from a Wi-Fi power supply, then the plus is the inside of the cylinder, and the minus is the outside.  For the USB charging type, you must first make the test with a multimeter.  This will allow you to check where is the plus and where is the minus by ringing each channel. </p><p>  After everything is securely fixed, you need to apply current.  If you observe by a voltmeter, then you should wait until the voltage rises to 3.5 volts - this is about 15 minutes of continuous operation.  This is an ideal way for old-type batteries, but it is also suitable for smartphones.  Again, take your time and keep calm.  A mistake can cost the battery life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Third way </h2><p>  Not such a time-consuming method <span>as to revive the</span> phone‚Äôs <span>battery</span> , is to use a power supply with a controller designed to restore and charge all types of batteries.  Such blocks are used when Ni-MH batteries are being restored.  This is a Turnigy Accucell 6 device. How to use it?  As well as cables in the second method. </p><p>  It is important with this method not to try to charge the battery fully through this device.  Why?  Over time, the battery wears out and its volume is significantly reduced.  In order not to ruin the battery, charge it through a universal charger to 3.5 volts, and then through the phone or tablet itself - with the device whose battery we have reanimated. </p>

    <h2>  Fourth way </h2><p>  By simplicity, this method can be compared with the first.  Unfortunately, it does not work on all types of devices, but it has to be, as it does not oblige you to have additional equipment or skills.  This way to revive the phone‚Äôs battery at home looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Remove the battery from the smartphone. </li><li>  Connect the charger to the device. </li><li>  Insert the battery into place. </li><li>  Leave the phone on charge for 10-12 hours. </li></ol><p>  Why might this work?  As stated earlier, the battery needs to be ‚Äúpushed."  Such a sharp current flow can become such a push, and the battery will return to normal, starting to accumulate energy. </p><h2>  Simple battery to help </h2><p>  This method also does not always help, but nevertheless has great popularity.  For its implementation, you need to take a fully charged battery or a powerful battery and connect it using conductors, observing the polarity.  After ten minutes, you must try to insert the recoverable battery into the phone and connect the charger. </p><p>  The method used by motorists is taken as the basis of this method, giving a ‚Äúlight‚Äù to the battery from another car.  And, as in cars, one must not allow anything to heat up! </p>

    <h2>  Is it only to revive? </h2><p>  Another, no less strange way is freezing.  Some who have already conducted similar experiments with the battery of their device claim that they were able not only to ‚Äúresurrect‚Äù it, but also to increase the life of the battery.  The principle of operation of this method is in deceiving the controller, which was mentioned above, because at a reduced temperature the chemical reactions in the battery slow down significantly. </p><p>  Before you restore the battery capacity of your phone, make sure that it is not lithium-ion.  This type of battery can not tolerate such experiments. </p><p>  The resuscitation process itself is as follows.  To begin with, the battery discharged below the level is sent to the freezer for a period of no more than half an hour.  After a minute charge it.  At the same time, turning on the phone is strictly prohibited.  Next, you need to remove the battery from the device and let it warm up to room temperature on its own.  In this case, the battery cannot be heated and rubbed. </p><p>  As soon as the battery reaches room temperature, it must be put in the device and charged in the usual way.  Such a charge lasts for more than a day, in some cases even two. </p>

    <h2>  What's better? </h2><p>  Before you revive the phone‚Äôs battery, completely discharged, you should decide which method is most effective.  All these recovery methods are good in their own way, but some do not have evidence of their safety, others require special skill and tools. </p><p>  In fact, the first and fourth methods are not only ways to revive the phone‚Äôs battery, but also a real guide for an emergency.  Such methods will not harm or aggravate the position of the smartphone. </p><p>  There is a lot of controversy about freezing, since low temperature is what can cause a battery to swell.  Some say that this is a way to give the ‚Äúdying‚Äù battery a ‚Äúpain reliever‚Äù so that its death then comes quickly and painlessly. </p><p>  The second and third methods even restore Ni-MH batteries.  But if you do not have access to the necessary equipment and are simply far from electronics, it is better not to risk it and turn to the masters of this matter. </p><h2>  Some tips </h2><p>  Whatever method suits you, the best solution is to prevent it.  Try to ensure that your smartphone does not disconnect from the fact that the battery is dead in it.  Carry a charger kit or a portable battery with you and recharge the battery if necessary.  Try to avoid friction, shock and large temperature changes - this greatly reduces the performance of the battery and shortens its life. </p>
