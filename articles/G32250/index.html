Knit patterns will help to fulfill the desire.  The technique will emphasize the skill of the creator.  The above methods do not require in-depth knowledge and are suitable for everyone who decided to update their wardrobe on their own or just to please loved ones with an elegant gift. </p><p>  Regardless of the level of experience, you are guaranteed to enjoy one of the techniques for creating scarves presented in the article.  Perhaps the most difficult thing here is only to decide which of the proposed options to associate first. </p><h2>  Scarves: what is the secret of popularity? </h2><p>  Imagine a cool late autumn evening or a cold winter wind meeting on the way home.  Probably a warm jacket will save you from unpleasant weather conditions, covering your throat.  However, only a scarf guarantees a reduction in the risk of a cold, as it tightly closes the chest.  If you freeze badly, it will protect you from strong winds.  It‚Äôs enough to wrap up properly.  There are also summer options designed solely to emphasize an elegant look. </p><p>  There are countless reasons why women's knitting patterns are almost indispensable.  Here is some of them: </p><ul><li>  Scarves will be the perfect accessory for any outfit.  Depending on the yarn used, you can wear them year-round, inside and out. </li><li>  Knitwear patterns are ideal for both the novice master and the professional.  Indeed, because they are easy to create, they do not require knowledge of the intricacies of heavy structures and at the same time retain an attractive appearance. </li><li>  Emphasizes style.  There are scarves that visually lengthen the silhouette of the wearer.  Others act as a way to protect against the cold.  If you choose the right color scheme, the accessory will add a twist. </li><li>  Practical and beautiful gift.  Handwork was famous at all times.  In the modern world, originality is valued more than ever, because this type of gift will emphasize certain aspects of the future owner. </li><li>  Many knitted patterns provide light patterns and require only the price of yarn.  Moreover, scarves are universally comfortable. </li></ul><p>  Due to the uniqueness of this type of product, it is easy to choose the simplest models.  Some of them have intricate lace patterns that test your technical knitting skills.  The rest, on the contrary, can be created at the last minute before preparing a gift.  Only you decide what the choice will fall on.  Do not forget that you can always come up with something new and non-standard, if you use your own ideas, relying only on your instinct and provided knitted patterns with knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We select a pattern </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the process itself, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with all kinds of stitches.  In order to get a fashionable scarf, which is knitted with knitting patterns and descriptions, you must be able to distinguish between many techniques.  However, do not worry about your own skills, because first of all the techniques are aimed at a wide audience. </p><p>  Take a centimeter in your hands and measure the approximate width, given that in the process the product settles a little.  Loops are determined by the type of yarn.  For example, you plan to get a narrow scarf all year round or, on the contrary, dream of a warm accessory.  In the first case, a few loops should be typed, in the second - more, since the product will turn out denser and wider. </p><p>  A selection of the pattern is in second place in importance.  The following women's knit patterns are suitable for a visual representation of their diversity. </p><h2>  We form a relief </h2><p>  Gum (back and front loops) are selected when creating products, depending on the instructions, to give a small volume or completely get rid of it.  Each selected scheme is individual, since it will depend on your desire, but we offer you a way of alternating between each other (2x2, 3x3, etc.) </p><p>  The famous Polish gum is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polish gum" class="if uuid-3190079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190079.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishnet Images </h2><p>  This type is typical for crocheted scarves with patterns and description, however, it is also suitable for knitting needles.  Gum on such products are missing.  The non-standard pattern does not have to correspond to the given sample, since it is selected independently.  Do not be afraid to act creatively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme for creating a pattern" class="if uuid-3190080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190080.jpg"></div><p>  Use braids, weaves to form a realistic relief and transition.  If you use thick yarn to create a direct product, be prepared for the fact that by the end of the work the accessory can curl in unexpected places.  The iron will help solve the problem, but you will have to monitor the condition of the scarf more often so that the dissonance does not overtake at an important moment in the meeting. </p><h2>  Create a unique picture </h2><p>  Knitted patterns and description also apply to jacquard patterns.  Such a method will seem difficult for a beginner, since it has many complex transitions.  So, the type of pattern in question is suitable for experienced needlewomen who decided to test their own strength.  The creation process itself includes weaving inside out, requiring care so that the threads do not stick out in different directions, and the scarf looks as neat as possible. </p><p>  At the moment, there are many jacquard patterns of interest in original styles.  They are divided by level of difficulty.  For example, the sample below requires only two types of yarn of a different color palette, but sometimes the choice of material can reach ten.  Experienced craftswomen can easily create entire masterpieces in a minimal amount of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme for drawing" class="if uuid-3190081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190081.jpg"></div><h2>  The technique of lazy patterns </h2><p>  If you find it difficult to create a scarf with complex manipulations and multi-colored yarns, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with knitted patterns with knitting needles.  They are easy to learn and will not cause difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The technique of creating lazy patterns" class="if uuid-3190083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190083.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the technique to succeed, adhere to the set of unspoken rules: </p><ul><li>  Check the number of loops after removal or tying to notice a defect in time. </li><li>  Properly combine the color palette so as not to waste time in vain. </li><li>  Try not to tighten the hinges too much, but make sure that they do not hang, as otherwise the product will not meet your expectations. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme for creating a scarf" class="if uuid-3190084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190084.jpg"></div><p>  So, it is advisable to apply the above methods of knitting not only with the help of a strict summary of patterns.  You can also come up with your own.  In search of inspiration and future creations, a summary of original ideas will help you. </p><h2>  Rib scarf </h2><p>  People tend to buy more material so that they do not accidentally encounter a lack of color in the store.  If you want to get rid of the remnants of yarn, then take the chance to create a unique product. </p><p>  Experiment with color, as you are given the opportunity to make each strip or use a pattern of several different colors, widths and lengths.  To use heavier yarn, it is recommended to use large knitting needles. </p><p>  Knitted patterns with descriptions are selected for your taste, since the scarf itself implies a huge space for creative thinking.  The end result should have an odd number of stitches and a shift interrupting one of the loops.  All this is necessary to create a texture that will not constrict the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="potentiel.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scarf made from leftover yarn" class="if uuid-3190085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190085.jpg"></div><p>  Even if a specific project uses the rest of the material for a scarf, the same type of offset stitches can really be used as the creation of blankets, pillowcases or other convenient items.  Decorative ornaments - knitted with patterns - are also suitable for a budget gift option, if you use a rib. </p><p>  A larger pair of knitting needles will provide a looser pattern, while a smaller pair will provide a tight stitch.  For easier finishing, do not cut the thread.  Instead, each time you get to the right edge, twist them together so as not to accidentally transfer.  To change the width of the strips, add a new color, just weave the ends of the yarn. </p><h2>  Striped scarf </h2><p>  An elementary model with an original approach to serving.  Gradient slowly transitions from one to another.  The basic knitted pattern is built around linear technology: it is enough to choose the necessary number of colors so that they competently combine, and get to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright and warm striped scarf" class="if uuid-3190086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190086.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the product can start from 50 centimeters and reach infinity, until you yourself decide that it is time to stop.  The yarn is selected thinner, because this way you can achieve the desired result: a smooth transfusion of flowers. </p><h2>  Stitch scarf </h2><p>  Due to the alternation of 3 wrong and 3 facial loops, the end result looks like you spent a lot more effort on it.  The deep and soft rib of the scarf will surely warm in the colder months, if you use thick yarn. </p><p>  Knitted patterns are based on the principle of ordinary elastic with the amendment that the distance from the embossed sequence is wider.  This technique helps to carefully mask flaws, sloppiness and mistakes made during creation. </p><h2>  Thin little scarf </h2><p>  Ideal as an alternative to shawls in the summer or as a pleasant gift.  This is a light lace scarf in warm cashmere colors with a razor stitch. </p><p>  It is made from one ball of cashmere yarn, which, as a result, turns the product into a very soft cape.  Its length depends on your imagination, but it is recommended not to spare the yarn to create a masterpiece, carefully knit the loop. </p><p>  Size depends on your preference.  Some strive to create a wrap, others use a scarf as a huge plaid.  The product will also appeal to overweight people for the reason that it visually stretches the physique, if you follow the patterns of knitted products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Razor Stitch Example and Pattern" class="if uuid-3190087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127315/3190087.jpg"></div><p>  Razors of a razor stitch have a pleasant undulation, and thanks to its lightness, the scarf will easily flutter in nature.  Do not forget to check the number of loops and periodically recount them so that one of the corners of the cloak is not crooked.  Mindfulness will save your time. </p><h2>  Sky scarf </h2><p>  Surely you find time, at least once every couple of days, to be sure to look up and watch the clouds?  If you are a creative person looking for inspiration, then this accessory will not only complement your image, but also add a lot of positive emotions.  It will remind you of the magnificent warm summer that has gone so fast, or will return you to the first day of winter.  When you put your finished heavenly scarf around your neck, then remember how soothingly lost in thought and paid attention to the sun. </p><p>  The product you created has several advantages: </p><ul><li>  Adapts to all kinds of stitches. </li><li>  It makes you slow down and pay attention to the sky. </li><li>  Creates wonderful memories for the whole year. </li><li>  This is an original gift. </li></ul><p>  Knitted scarf patterns consist of alternating back and front loops or, in other words, from elastic.  The density of the product does not have strict criteria and is individual: it can be both warm and thin.  The color of the yarn is selected for a smooth transition of blue to pale blue.  You can connect a thin rainbow, a cloud or the sun - it all depends on your imagination. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you have come to know unique ideas that can be translated into reality using simple schemes.  Use different types of knitting needles to increase the distance between the stitches or to make it minimal for greater density.  Alternate techniques, do not be afraid to come up with something new, add bright colors or even use non-standard approaches, as in the case of knitting from the remains of yarn.  Try all the methods and find your favorite.  Most importantly, do not forget about care so that in the future you do not have to redo everything all over again.  Act - and you will complement your style with an unusual accessory created by your own hands. </p>
