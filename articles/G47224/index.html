    <p>  A small bar is comfortably located near the hotel‚Äôs pool, where guests are always offered refreshments or are happy to organize a romantic meeting. </p><p>  Vacationers who arrived at the Chebotarev Hotel (Sochi) often leave good reviews of local food.  In their opinion, all the dishes presented at breakfast are quite tasty and varied.  But sometimes, during periods of a large influx of tourists, it happened that someone could not have enough cups or some dish suddenly ended. </p><h2>  What else pleases the guests of the Chebotarev Hotel </h2><p>  Tourists coming to Sochi expect a magnificent beach from almost every hotel.  The Chebotarev Hotel does not have one.  But within walking distance are the excellent beaches of the sanatorium ‚ÄúSolnechny‚Äù and the parks ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù and ‚ÄúRiviera‚Äù, on the territory of which there is everything necessary for an excellent beach holiday. </p>
