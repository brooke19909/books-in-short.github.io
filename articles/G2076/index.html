    <h2>  Shalimar Hammamet 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists speak of rest in this hotel as successful.  The food is excellent, delicious.  Spacious rooms that clean well.  Great pool.  Warm and clear sea.  Our compatriots like the fact that there are few people on the beach, since both Europeans and locals mostly relax by the pool.  Nearby there is a shop where you can buy dates and olive oil at very reasonable prices.  In the evenings, you can walk along the promenade to Hammamet, where a free show begins around midnight.  There are also many discos and nightclubs where local and European youth "hang out".  The hotel is suitable for both family and sightseeing holidays.  She will also like those who came to "come off." </p>
