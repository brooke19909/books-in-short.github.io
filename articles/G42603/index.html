The new model received a CD-DVD drive, on the back there is a USB connector.  The screen is created using WVGA video technology.  Next to the screen on the left side there is a panel where the control buttons are located.  At first glance it may seem that they are sensory, but this is not so.  They are mechanical.  In general, the management is convenient.  Instructions for the Pioneer AVH-170 are included. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer avh 170 review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1887092.jpg"></div>

Here on the left you can see: USB, then the video output, under it is the input for the camera.  As a rule, rear-view matrixes are used, there is an audio input, it is a standard mini-jack.  Next to it is an output for the rear subwoofer, a linear output is slightly to the right.  Next, you can notice the main connector for connecting the radio, the input for the adapter to control the buttons on the steering wheel, as well as a special port for the antenna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer avh 170 manual" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1887093.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  It is necessary to say a few words about the menu.  According to reviews, the Pioneer AVH-170 does not change the color of the backlight (if we talk about the buttons), but in the menu you can independently change the image theme.  Three design options are available: green, red and blue. </p><p>  In the Russian translation of the software, you can notice some inaccuracies, which is completely uncharacteristic for the equipment from the Pioneer company.  When choosing loudness, a choice is made between low, medium and high frequencies - LF, MF, HF.  Many may not understand what the section is responsible for.  There is a problem with the translation.  This is not a frequency, but a level - LOW, MID, HIGH.  This is a trifle, but people who do not understand and have not previously worked with such devices can be confused.  In general, the menu is clear and intuitive.  You can add individual items to your Favorites. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound characteristic </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Pioneer AVH-170 has a very good sound, like other models from the manufacturer "Pioneer".  Equalizer Powerfull ("Powerful") is included by default.  This gives the unit brightness of sound, which contributes to better sales when demonstrating its capabilities by managers.  When using the radio in a car, it is recommended to change the equalizer settings if the car also has normal acoustics and a subwoofer.  Therefore, it is recommended to use the equalizer "gently" to avoid excessive sharpness of sound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer avh 170 how to turn off" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1887094.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pioneer AVH-170: reviews </h2><p>  Of course, you need to discuss positive feedback.  There is an equalizer, sound capabilities at an average level, which corresponds to the cost of the device.  The screen is noted as one of the best in its lineup.  He doesn‚Äôt read some videos, but he plays all the most popular formats.  The receiver is two-inch, which drivers really like.  The screen is large, it is quite easy to read from it.  Managing the device is also easy. </p><p>  In general, we can say that for a small cost, the buyer gets an excellent device that allows you to watch movies and listen to music.  It does not stick out when installed in the panel, it looks great.  The sensor works well, pretty fast.  The track can be rewound with ease, no need to pull the slider.  The backlighting of the buttons changes in the G model. Customers are happy with this, since sometimes with a single theme of design it does not ultimately fit into the design of the machine.  You can turn it on from the moment the playback is interrupted, even if it came from an external drive.  The menu is as clear as possible, it is easy to understand.  If you turn on the side lights, the buttons and the screen darken.  This feature is easily disabled in the settings. </p><p>  Like any other device, it has disadvantages.  They also need to be considered so that buyers understand what they are dealing with.  In particular, you should pay attention to screen calibration.  She is too bad.  Sometimes after trying to make it, the display settings have to be returned to the factory settings.  Also, people do not like the energy consumption in the off state.  Many complain about the screen, saying that the pixels are too visible.  This display is compared with the color screens of the first mobile phones.  Again, it is possible to single out the playback of not all video and audio formats, but this is considered by the owners to be an uncritical drawback. </p><p>  Some consumers wonder when they first get to know how to turn off the Pioneer AVH-170.  The equipment is basic, some users also do not like it.  Moreover, many complain that the camera has to be purchased separately.  The screen is too easy to get dirty.  You must always have napkins next to you.  To turn the device on or off, you have to wait about 7 seconds.  Such an indicator, if the device works with CD disks, the flash drive turns on quickly.  The device activation buttons are not on the panel.  To turn off the device in a running machine, you must click on the Off button, and after that - on the display off key.  This is a bit inconvenient for the driver, although it is also considered a minor flaw.  Due to the small buttons on the panel, you can easily miss.  Moreover, many are advised to buy a separate wireless remote control.  It will help facilitate the work with the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer avh 170 g" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1887080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Summing up, it must be said that the radio is generally good.  It is in demand, and many consumers advise it.  In general, the device is suitable for budget cars, such as Lada, Lada and so on.  The characteristics of the Pioneer AVH-170 are described above, they are not bad.  The large 6.2 ‚ÄùPioneer AVH-170 touch screen plays audio and video from virtually any source: CD, DVD, USB media, and the latest generations of Android and iPhone smartphones. </p><p>  You can purchase the device as an intermediate, if there is no money for more modern expensive equipment, but there is a desire to purchase it in the future.  In general, the design is modest, minimalist features prevail, but in principle buyers like it, they do not pay attention to it.  As already mentioned, the sound is at a good level, if you watch movies or music, you can see that lower frequencies prevail, unlike the others.  For fans of action movies, this news will be extremely joyful. </p>
