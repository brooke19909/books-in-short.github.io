    <h2>  How to travel around the island </h2><p>  We have already mentioned how important car rental is to travel in Mallorca.  After all, having a car, you can inspect the capital, and all the bays, and caves, and much more.  Do not miss the fortress of the fifteenth century - Torre dels Enogistes, where the museum of archeology is now located inside the impressive walls.  In addition to visiting nearby sights, experienced tourists are advised to go to Manacor, which is famous all over the world for the famous Majorca artificial pearls.  Porto Cristo will conquer you with thousands of its yachts and coastal taverns.  And the Dragon Cave, which is nearby, will surprise not only with its bright stalactites and stalagmites, but with a concert and boating on the underground lake.  Do not forget about the old Alcudia, which survived the era of the reign of the Moors, the riot of pirates and the cruelty of the Inquisition. </p><h2>  Sol Calas de Mallorca 4 * complex: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists recommend this hotel to other guests.  Guests enjoy the cleanliness of the rooms, comfortable beds, fantastic views of the sea and coves, large pools and varied animations, especially for children.  Kids here feel happy, and at the same time they do not interfere with their parents' rest.  Fine, well-prepared and varied food, just amazing for the Quartet. </p><p>  Hotel management often invites dancers and singers to entertain the public, especially flamenco performers.  Many people call vacation at this resort delightful.  It is good to come here to lovers, families with children and travelers with a romantic character. </p>
