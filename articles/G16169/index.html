What to see in Abrau-Durso?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Abrau-Durso (Krasnodar Territory) was previously an urban-type settlement.  Currently it is a rural district.  The latter includes three villages - Bolshoi Khutor, Abrau and Durso. </p><h2>  Famous lake </h2><p>  The sights of Abrau-Durso include the creations of not only man, but also nature.  The largest freshwater reservoir in the Krasnodar Territory - Lake Abrau - has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã0.6 square meters.  km  Its width is 630 m and its length is 3.1 km.  In some places, the depth of the lake reaches ten meters.  A river with the same name flows into it.  At the bottom of Abrau, the keys beat, and although there is no runoff by the lake, the water disappears somewhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Abrau Durso" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/470736.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another mystery of the reservoir is the light streak periodically arising on its surface.  Most clearly, it stands out at night.  In the cold season, this strip freezes last.  This feature is explained in different ways: some are of the opinion that a similar effect is observed due to the special interaction of wind and water, while others believe that the key is in the keys breaking at the bottom. </p><p>  Lake Abrau-Durso has amazing beauty.  The water in it has a pleasant <span>emerald color.</span>  In the warm season, it warms up to 28 degrees Celsius.  Freshwater fish live in the lake, including common carp, bream, ram, grass carp, trout, silver and <span>gold crucian carp,</span> silver carp, rudd and Abrau fish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1979, the reservoir has the status of a natural monument.  For this reason, motor boats are not allowed to move around the lake.  Fish can only be fished. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the described reservoir is the village of the same name Abrau.  Together with another small village - Durso - they form a single <span>recreational area</span> called Abrau-Durso.  The shores of the lake are equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable beach holiday.  Tourists especially appreciate the possibility of privacy in the nearby forest, to relax from the bustle of the city or go on a ‚Äúquiet hunt‚Äù for mushrooms and berries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Abrau Durso photo" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/470737.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Church of St. Xenia of Petersburg </h2><p>  Some sights of Abrau-Durso attract pilgrims from all over the country.  Among such places is the temple, majestically towering above the lake surface.  It was founded in 1996. Four years later, the construction of the temple complex intensified.  It was blessed by the Metropolitan of Yekaterinodar and Kuban Isidore.  The church in a festive atmosphere consecrated at the end of 2010 the bishop of Maykop and Adygea Tikhon. </p><p>  In 2011, the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Church of St. Xenia of St. Petersburg was celebrated.  A video material on the process of building a sacred place for all Orthodox people was prepared for the solemn date. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sparkling Beverage Production </h2><p>  "Abrau-Durso" - a factory of champagne wines, built in the nineteenth century.  Then, by order of Alexander the Second, an estate was built near Lake Abrau to live the imperial family.  Two years after the construction, the emperor‚Äôs personal agronomist went to Germany.  From abroad, he brought twenty thousand Rhine-breeding Riesling vines.  In order to produce red wine near Vienna, he acquired the Portuguese vines.  In the same period, the best examples of Sauvignon, Aligote, Cabernet and Pinot Blanc varieties were delivered from Livadia and Crimea.  The first vineyards were broken in the estates of Pilenko and Alexander II.  Later, both of them acted as examples of the development of viticulture in those places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abrau durso champagne factory" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/470738.jpg" width="466"></div>

    <p>  At the Yalta Exhibition, held in 1884, the wines of the Abrau-Durso factory were met better than the Crimean wines, which were considered the undisputed leaders of domestic winemaking. </p><h2>  Sweet Estuary </h2><p>  This lake is located on the Black Sea.  Several kilometers separate it from Novorossiysk and Abrau-Durso.  Excursions at this reservoir are held regularly.  Numerous tourists are attracted by the secrets of the lake, which no one still has the power to reveal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sweet Limanchik is separated from the Black Sea by a thin stone strip.  It is assumed that the pond arose as a result of a severe earthquake, as a result of which the blocks that fell from the mountain formed a rash.  The height of the latter is currently thirty-five meters. </p><p>  And now a little about the above secrets: the water in the lake is fresh and surprisingly clean, although the sea is very close by.  Scientists are still trying to solve this mystery of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abrau durso tours" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/470742.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An asphalt road leads to Sweet Limanchik.  The difficulties with the passage to the reservoir are that it is located near the recreation center of the RSU.  In the warm season, tourists organize tent settlements on the picturesque shores of the lake.  In the same period, a recreation center opens.  Travelers are prohibited from washing things and washing dishes in the clear waters of Sweet Estuary.  And although this rule is strictly observed, the reservoir, unfortunately, continues to degrade. </p><p>  On the shores of Maly Liman, a sword-grass, a field-bed plant, a scoopia, and a branch-tree grow - representatives of a unique flora. </p><h2>  Beautiful river </h2><p>  Listing the sights of Abrau-Durso, one can not help but mention this waterway.  Its source is located in the southwestern slope of Mount Gudzak.  Durso joins the waters of the Black Sea near the BO Sputnik.  In its valley is the village of the same name.  Since 1871, it has been part of Abrau-Durso. </p><p>  In the 1970s, archaeologists discovered a medieval burial ground in the Durso Valley.  This monument of antiquity is only partially preserved, it remained after the newcomers.  An interesting fact is that this burial ground has no analogues in the entire Caucasus, however, similar burials were found in the Crimea.  According to the version of scientists, the latter left the Crimean Goths. </p><p>  The Durso River is notable for a short length of only seventeen kilometers.  Nevertheless, travelers rush to her to enjoy beautiful views of the valley planted with vineyards. </p><h2>  The main excursion program </h2><p>  What to see in Abrau-Durso?  Local guides will help you answer this question.  A five-hour excursion starts from Anapa.  There, tourists get on a bus and follow to the Abrau-Durso agricultural complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in abrau durso" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/470741.jpg" width="250"></div>
