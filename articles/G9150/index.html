Firstly, close, secondly, inexpensively, thirdly, qualitatively.  In addition, the climate here is just perfect for the Russians and does not require any acclimatization.  In addition, in these parts there are many historical sights - a rich heritage of the peoples (Armenians, Greeks, Byzantines, Phoenicians, etc.) that once inhabited the territory of modern Turkey.  And this feature attracts on the coast not only fans of beach vacations, but also sightseeing tours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michell hotel spa" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/482889.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Turkey </h2><p>  The biggest advantage of this country for tourists is free, that is, visa-free entry.  When crossing the Turkish border, it is enough for citizens of the Russian Federation to present a passport, a ticket to a particular hotel, for example, to Michell Hotel Spa Alanya, and a return ticket for the plane.  Until 2013, you could stay in Turkey without a visa for 60 days, but today this period has decreased to 30. As noted above, there are many places worth visiting in this country, but its main feature is still magnificent beaches and chic Hotels located along the entire coast.  Among them you can find both budget 2-3 * and chic five-star deluxe hotels, which is the brand new and built by modern technologies Michell Hotel Spa 5 * hotel, which is located in the village of Avsallar, Alanya resort.  By the way, until recently, this resort did not have a single five-star hotel.  However, today, 400 meters from the beach, its original eight-story building resembling a motor ship flaunts.  Before proceeding with the description of this hotel, I want to talk a bit about the area in which the Michell Hotel Spa is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="michell hotel spa reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/482858.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, this does not apply to the village of Avsallar, in which the Michell Hotel Spa Alanya 5 is located. Palm trees and other tropical plants grow lushly, among which you can see royal bananas.  This situation is facilitated by the location of the resort on the shore of the bay, which protects it from the winds.  In other villages of Alanya (Inzhekum, Mahmutlar, Konakli, etc.), everything is different, there is practically no vegetation.  Probably because of this, Alanya is not among the most popular tourist destinations in Turkey.  Of course, in the territories of numerous hotels there are many artificially planted trees, flowering shrubs, etc. The hotel administration thus wants to correct this ‚Äúomission‚Äù of nature and turn its complexes into blooming gardens. </p><p>  In addition, coastal holidays are considered the most economical.  Five-star hotels are rarely seen here.  For example, in the village of Avsallar, until recently, there were no deluxe hotels.  In the summer of this year 2014, on the <span>shores of the azure</span> bay, Michell Hotel Spa 5 * finally opened its doors to visitors.  Reviews of tourists who have already managed to visit this chic hotel are quite positive.  However, according to almost all vacationers, there is still much to be done to bring it to a state of 5 *.  The biggest drawback of this German hotel is its private beach.  It is poorly adapted for a full beach holiday.  Entrance to the sea is uncomfortable and even dangerous, so most tourists prefer to relax next to the chic pools.  The advantage of the hotel is the presence in it of a chic spa with a wide range of treatments.  And in general, this resort has many recreational facilities: hamams (Turkish baths), thalassotherapy centers, massage rooms, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michell Hotel Spa 5 *" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/482894.jpg" width="600"></div>

The subtropical Mediterranean climate contributes to the establishment of wonderful weather conditions for a beach holiday.  The swimming season here lasts from late April to November, and in Avsallar, the warmest of the villages of Alanya, from early April to late November, that is, a month longer than in other areas.  If you have not had time to relax this year, then you are still ahead.  Until the end of November, you can visit Alanya and stay at the chic Michell Hotel Spa.  The only thing to consider when buying a tour to this hotel is that the children in this hotel have nothing to do.  For them there is no entertainment and amenities.  In a word, although this is not said openly, the hotel is absolutely not suitable for couples with children. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Avsallar is located 140 kilometers from the airport of Antalya, where planes arrive from different parts of the world, including from many large cities of the Russian Federation.  This terminal is the closest to Alanya.  And if you are going to the Avsallar village to relax in the five-star Michell Hotel Spa 5 * hotel by air, you must purchase a ticket for the flight to Antalya, and from there you will need to go by road to the resort first to Alanya, and then another 24 kilometers to Avsallar.  For a fee, Michel Hotel employees will meet you at the airport and deliver you directly to the hotel complex.  However, you can also use regular minibuses (fare 5 euros). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Michell Hotel Spa 5 *," class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/482891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The private sand and pebble beach is 400 meters away from the Michell Hotel Spa 5. Tourists' reviews about it are not as enthusiastic as, for example, about the service and food in the hotel.  According to some of them, there is still much to be completed.  For example, tourists complain about the inconvenient entrance to the sea, as well as insufficient equipment.  Nevertheless, there are many beach activities, such as windsurfing, diving (with an instructor), catamarans, scooters, bananas, parachutes and much more.  The beach also has a bar, which is served on the principle of ‚Äúultra ol inclusive‚Äù, sun loungers and umbrellas are free, there is a net for beach volleyball, etc. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The new five-star Michell Hotel Spa, of course, is the most chic on the coast of Alanya, but it is intended only for tourists who have come of age.  It has everything you need for a good rest of young people and people with an active lifestyle.  If you consider yourself to be in this category of people, the doors of the hotel will always be open in front of you. </p>
