Some geographical processes and phenomena surprise and amaze us, others scare and make us think of worthlessness, human weaknesses in front of the forces and power of nature.  Moreover, absolutely everything that happens on our planet is closely interconnected and interdependent. </p><p>  What are the geographic processes?  What it is?  And how do they differ from natural phenomena? </p><h2>  Phenomena and processes in geography </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that even the venerable professors-geographers cannot always clearly distinguish the difference between these two concepts.  Geographic processes and phenomena are often confused with each other, calling one another.  For example, the formation of caves (grand underground cavities) is sometimes called the karst process, and sometimes - the karst phenomenon. </p>

    <p>  Let's try to distinguish between these two concepts.  And for this it would be useful to turn to such a science as philosophy. </p><p>  In the methodology of science, a process (from the Latin <em>processus</em> - ‚Äúmove‚Äù, ‚Äúflow‚Äù) is understood as a sequential change of states in the development of something.  But phenomena are absolutely everything that a person is able to perceive sensually (that is, to see, feel, hear).  For example, a person may not know what processes are taking place in his body.  But a sharp increase in temperature (in this case it can be called a phenomenon) will tell you that something is wrong.  But back to geography ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Geographic processes differ in time dynamics.  In other words, they change over time.  In turn, natural phenomena are peculiar indicators of those changes that trigger various geographic processes.  This, for example, may be an eruption of a large volcano.  In this case, this phenomenon is the result of active tectonic processes occurring in the earth's crust. </p><h2>  Geographic processes are ... </h2><p>  Our planet Earth is amazingly versatile and diverse.  In its shells (spheres) the most diverse geographical processes are constantly occurring.  This, for example, volcanism and mountain building, denudation and accumulation, cryogenesis and solifluction.  The circulation of air masses and the movement of mountain glaciers also apply to them. </p><p>  So, geographic processes - what is it?  And what is their basis?  Try to answer these questions. </p><p>  Geographic processes are all processes that occur in the geographic shell of the Earth.  Their final results are changes in the amount of matter, energy or the form of landscapes.  It is important to note that the intensity of these processes varies over time, it either accelerates or slows down. </p><p>  Geographic processes lead to the active movement of matter and energy within the geographical envelope.  This, in turn, contributes to its qualitative transformation. </p><h2>  Geographic processes: pictures and examples </h2><p>  Not a single process in animate and inanimate nature happens just like that.  Each of them has its own root cause, its own foundation.  So, natural processes occur under the influence of the so-called internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) forces of the Earth.  They are responsible for volcanism, earthquakes and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The following can be mentioned as examples of physical-geographical processes: </p><ul><li>  volcanism; </li><li>  relief formation (in particular mountain building); </li><li>  soil formation; </li><li>  atmospheric circulation; </li><li>  denudation and accumulation; </li><li>  abrasion; </li><li>  cryogenesis; </li><li>  solifluction; </li><li>  erosion, etc. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that these are far from all geographical processes occurring on the planet and in its interior.  Pictures, photos and detailed descriptions of some of them are presented below.  They will help to better understand the essence and features of these unique processes that form the geographical shell of our planet. </p><h2>  Endogenous and exogenous forces of the Earth </h2><p>  Factors that provoke almost all the processes that occur in the geographical envelope are usually divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  endogenous (internal); </li><li>  and exogenous (external). </li></ul><p>  The endogenous forces of the Earth are associated with the energy that occurs deep in the bowels of our planet.  They act as catalysts of processes such as magmatism and metamorphism, provoke the <span>movement of lithospheric plates.</span> </p><p>  <span>Exogenous processes</span> occur directly on the earth's surface or at the junction of the lithosphere and atmosphere.  These include weathering, water erosion, abrasion, etc. </p><p>  If the first forces (endogenous) form <span>the Earth‚Äôs relief</span> on a global scale, then the second (exogenous) forces participate in its design, creating unique forms of the earth‚Äôs surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Denudation and accumulation </h2><p>  The modification of the earth's relief occurs due to two natural (sometimes called geological) processes - denudation and accumulation.  Moreover, their action is in the opposite direction.  Nevertheless, they are closely interconnected and constitute a single whole. </p><p>  In geology, denudation is a complex of processes of destruction and transfer of rocks.  They are based on gravity, as well as the work of wind, flowing water and ice.  By accumulation is understood the process of accumulation of destroyed rock material. </p><p>  The main task of denudation is to ‚Äúcut off‚Äù positive landforms.  But the main purpose of accumulation is completely opposite and is to increase the reduced forms of the earth's surface.  Well, the common result of these two processes is the general leveling of the planet‚Äôs surface, the destruction of mountain systems and the formation of vast plains. </p><p>  The geographic processes described above in the pictures are as follows.  The first photo shows an example of the denudation of the <span>earth's surface.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Volcanism and mountain building </h2><p>  If, apart from accumulation and denudation, no more processes took place in the world, soon our planet would turn into one huge and flat plain.  But we see that the relief of the Earth is unusually diverse.  Why? </p><p>  The answer is simple: the endogenous <span>forces of the Earth</span> generate processes, as a result of which new - younger structures arise in place of leveled (destroyed) mountain systems.  These processes are commonly called mountain building.  And they took place throughout the geological history of the Earth (according to scientists, it is about 4.5 billion years). </p><p>  Geologists distinguish five periods of folding in the "biography" of our planet.  We live in an era of <span>alpine folding,</span> which "gave" the world such mountain structures as the Alps, the Himalayas, the Andes and the Caucasus. </p><p>  The formation of the earth's surface is very difficult to imagine without volcanism.  This is another process that is directly involved in the development of the planetary terrain.  Volcanism is understood as a set of processes caused by the movement of magma in the earth's crust and its release to the surface.  As a result, tectonic ruptures, volcanoes and geysers appear on the body of our planet. </p><h2>  Geographical phenomena: types and examples </h2><p>  As you know from the school geography course, there are four shells of the Earth.  These are the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere.  Accordingly, all natural phenomena are classified at the place of their occurrence into four groups: </p><ol><li>  Geological (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, landslides, avalanches). </li><li>  Meteorological (hurricanes, tornadoes, rainbows, etc.). </li><li>  Hydrological (floods, tsunamis, floods, etc.). </li><li>  Biological (epidemics, fires, epiphytotics, etc.). </li></ol><p>  As mentioned above, any natural phenomenon is a direct consequence of any process.  For example, the lights of St. Elmo - a phenomenon that occurs as a result of certain processes in the atmosphere. </p>

    <h2>  7 unusual natural phenomena </h2><p>  Finally, we will consider seven of the most amazing, mysterious and interesting natural phenomena: </p><ul><li>  A mirage is a natural phenomenon that everyone has probably heard of.  This is an optical illusion, the source of which is superheated air. </li><li>  Ball lightning is a brightly glowing and moving in the air formation of a supposedly electrical origin.  This is one of the phenomena whose nature remains a mystery to scientists. </li><li>  The lights of St. Elm are brightly glowing spheres that appear on the sharp ends of highly placed objects (tree tops, ship masts, wings of flying planes, etc.).  They arise at a high electric field in the atmosphere. </li><li>  The belt of Venus is a saturated crimson belt between the sky and the horizon, which can be seen in places with a high dustiness of the atmosphere. </li><li>  Lenticular clouds are motionless and incredibly <span>beautiful clouds</span> in the form of lenses that form on the crests of the air currents. </li><li>  Bifurcation is a unique and rather rare hydrological phenomenon.  This is the division of the manual channel into two independent streams that flow in the autonomous valleys and are no longer connected. </li><li>  Light poles are unique streaks of light (white or another color) that occur most often in the night sky.  This beautiful phenomenon is explained by the refraction of light by small crystals of ice that are contained in the atmosphere. </li></ul>
