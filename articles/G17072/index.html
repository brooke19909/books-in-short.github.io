    <p>  In the individual shower rooms, guests are offered towels, a hairdryer, a bathtub set.  Of course, there is also a wash basin. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of Patong guests about this hotel was mostly positive.  The rooms at The Chilli Salza Patong 3 * Hotel are always clean and comfortable.  The maids here are very responsible and also polite to the guests.  The beds in the hotel rooms are comfortable, and the bedding is not washed, new and clean. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In particular, this hotel deserved good reviews of its guests for the presence of balconies in the rooms.  Here, if necessary, you can quickly dry your beach accessories.  On the balconies, among other things, light tables with chairs are installed.  So in the evening, hotel guests have the opportunity to sit here with some sort of drink.  But the views from the balconies of the hotel open, unfortunately, not too beautiful. </p><p>  Many tourists attribute the advantages of rooms rented at this hotel, including good noise isolation.  No sounds from the corridor or from the street to the guests of The Chilli Salza Patong Hotel (Phuket) 3 * hotel do not interfere.  The residents of the hotel are mainly residents of European countries and Russians.  Noisy Chinese and Koreans do not rent rooms here. </p><p>  The apartments in this hotel are equipped, according to tourists, unfortunately, not too good.  For example, a balcony door can independently open in a room, tables wobble, etc. The furniture in the rooms is quite old and even slightly cracked. </p><h2>  Showers in the hotel </h2><p>  The rooms intended for the adoption of water procedures in this hotel, according to many guests, are equipped relatively well.  Plumbing in showers is working properly.  It looks quite new at the same time.  Maids in the hotel wash the showers and toilets quite often.  They periodically take out the garbage. </p><p>  Some tourists think that many tourists consider the lack of bathroom accessories designed for brushing their teeth.  Unfortunately, there are no glasses for toothbrushes in the showers of The Chilli Salza Patong 3 * hotel.  Putting such accessories just on the sink, of course, is extremely unhygienic.  Therefore, tourists who have booked a room in this hotel should take a glass with them from home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, many vacationers cause certain complaints about the hotel due to frequent interruptions with hot water.  Having come to the room from the beach, many, of course, would like to take a shower and wash off the salt.  But this succeeds, unfortunately, by no means always. </p>

    <p>  This hotel has earned good reviews, including for the availability of parking near it.  It does not belong to the hotel itself, but to the city.  But the car on it can be set absolutely free. </p><p>  A good opinion about the service at this hotel among its guests was formed, among other things, because all the respected employees here know how to speak English.  Unfortunately, none of them knows the Russian language.  But those Russian tourists who do not know how to speak English can communicate with administrators, for example, through a Google translator on a tablet.  In any case, all hotel guests' problems try to solve quickly. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Rooms at The Chilli Salza Patong 3 * (Phuket Island) are rented with breakfast.  On the food in this hotel, its guests respond not too well.  In the mornings, only sausages, fried eggs, bread, tea and juice are usually served here.  Therefore, many hotel guests prefer to have breakfast, lunch and dinner in the cafes and restaurants working nearby.  Cooks of such establishments in Patong are usually prepared very well.  The dishes here are always fresh, warmed up and tasty.  In addition, they are very inexpensive. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the restaurant, the hotel also has a small bar.  Here, if desired, guests can order all kinds of snacks and drinks.  Reviews about this institution on the network are mostly positive. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The coastline is located at a distance of approximately 600 meters from this hotel.  In most cases, guests of the Wynn Chilli Salza <span>Patong 3 *</span> hotel <span>(Phuket, Patong)</span> visit Patong Beach.  The place is for recreation, according to many tourists, very suitable.  The total length of Pathog Beach is 4 km.  It is covered with light fine sand.  The entrance to the sea on this beach is gentle.  Therefore, it is very convenient to relax with children here.  The water in the sea at this place during the holiday season is always clean.  Moreover, it is also very warm (like fresh milk). </p><p>  Some disadvantage of Patong Beach, according to tourists, is that it is rarely cleaned.  Cigarette butts, algae, and paper can be littered on the shoreline.  There are always quite a lot of people on this beach.  But at the same time, the infrastructure here is developed just fine.  On the coastline of Patong Beach, there are many cafes, restaurants and various entertainment venues. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is no natural shadow on this beach.  But tourists at any time can rent sun loungers and umbrellas.  They stand on Patong Beach not too expensive. </p>

    <p>  Big Buddha is a huge statue located in the capital of the island - the city of Phuket.  It is located on Mount Nakked at an altitude of 400 meters above sea level.  Next to it is a temple where you can receive the blessing of local monks. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  The staff at this hotel is polite and attentive to their duties.  But sometimes the staff of this hotel can still be inattentive to their guests.  Some vacationers note, for example, the fact that hotel maids may not close the door in the room after cleaning.  Thais - the majority of people are honest and do not commit thefts.  However, guests from other countries also live in the hotel.  Therefore, an open door left by a maid can cause serious trouble.  Most likely, you should not leave money, valuables and documents in your room unattended at this hotel. </p><p>  Many tourists advise beginners who decide to book this hotel in Patong to take some mosquito repellent with them on a trip.  There are really a lot of mosquitoes in Thailand, including hotel rooms.  In the absence of protection, they can ruin the whole impression of relaxation. </p>
