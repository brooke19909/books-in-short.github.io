    <h2>  August Canal: Description </h2><p>  This is a huge <span>artificial reservoir</span> that stretches for 102 km.  Most of it is located in Poland, Belarus "got" only 22 km.  It connects the basins of large rivers - the Neman and the Vistula.  A large extent was achieved due to the systems of canals, lakes, ponds, canalized sections of rivers and channels.  A total of 7 rivers and 11 lakes are involved.  The figure is impressive, but not like the Augustow Canal itself. </p><p>  National holidays and <span>sport competitions</span> in kayaking and rowing are held here annually.  There are excellent hiking trails on the banks of the canal.  All this makes it an interesting place for outdoor activities.  Do not forget that the canal is built artificially, and in order for shipping to function normally, a system of locks was created.  The Augustow Canal includes 18 watersheds, 4 of which are in Belarus.  Locking adds a twist to your journey.  The Augustow Canal is not too deep, about 2 meters. <strong> </strong>  Originally used for communication between countries, trade and wood supply, today it is preserved only as a recreational and tourist attraction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The wealth of the Belarusian River Fund </h2><p>  The local area is very rich in fresh water.  The dense hydrographic network includes thousands of rivers and streams.  Their total length covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã90,000 km.  The most significant are the Dnieper, Berezina and Pripyat.  The construction of canals, ponds and reservoirs further increased the number of water sources.  It was often carried out in order to improve shipping and ensure the delivery of goods to all corners of the country. </p><p>  The largest channels of Belarus are of great importance for the country - all together and each in its own way.  The largest is the Dnieper-Bug Canal.  It combines two arteries - these are <span>the Pripyat</span> and Mukhavets <span>rivers</span> .  Built in the XVIII century, it was repeatedly restored. </p><p>  The second largest is the Augustow Canal, today it is used only for tourism purposes.  The youngest of all is the Vileyka-Minsk water system.  In addition, there are Oginsky, Mikashevichsky and Slavichsky-Yaminsky channels.  This is a brief overview of the rivers and canals of Belarus, and now we return to the center of tourism - Augustow Pond. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the majestic building </h2><p>  Not much time is left until the next solemn anniversary - the channel will celebrate its bicentennial.  Construction began in 1824, due to the urgent need for a transport corridor from Poland (within Russia) to the ports.  Prussia at that time blocked the transit of all necessary goods through its territory, and hence their access to the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The project was quickly approved by the emperor, and construction began.  It lasted 15 years under the guidance of the author, Ignatius Protzinsky.  More than 7,000 workers were invited to work, and by 1839 the construction was completed, and the canal opened for shipping.  Most of it is natural ponds, channels and lakes, but it also includes 40 km of artificial channel, which is dug out manually using wooden shovels.  According to the project, a trapezoidal shape with a width of 9 meters was laid for him.  Initially, 29 dams and 18 locks functioned here.  Around the perimeter there were service stations and bridges.  The gateway gate was made of oak with an iron edging.  Dam dams were driven by special gear designs. </p><p>  True, the channel was not used for its intended purpose.  Towards the end of construction, the open railway showed a much more convenient way for trade. </p>

    <h2>  How did world wars affect the state of the channel </h2><p>  Neither the First nor the Second World Wars spared the Augustow Canal.  The map will show many strategically important areas that were guarded from invaders.  And today, over its entire length, preserved concrete pillboxes remained, heavily damaged by the battles.  During the First World War, some floodgates were destroyed, dams were burnt, but in general the canal was preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Second World War affected him much more.  Along its coast ran the famous defensive line of Molotov.  Fierce fighting completely destroyed the <span>hydraulic structures of the</span> canal. </p>

    <h2>  Revival of the Augustow Canal </h2><p>  The surviving Polish part of the artificial reservoir suggested the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing it as a cultural and historical monument, a recreation center and tourism.  In 2004, the leadership of the Republic of Belarus decided to carry out a complete reconstruction of the canal in connection with its inclusion in the list of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof the country and UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

    <h2>  Unique ecosystem </h2><p>  <span>Grodno region</span> is a place of stunning beauty.  Dozens of species of animals live here that are not found anywhere else.  Plants, animals, fish and birds - a whole world opens up here, available for viewing during a leisurely walk.  The Augustow Canal (Grodno) is framed by the famous forest.  It is called the Grodno Forest.  It is not suitable for walking; it is a thick, impenetrable thicket.  In addition, this territory is marked as specially protected.  Many trees here are more than 200 years old, it is a real relic forest. </p><p>  Lynxes and wild boars, roe deers and beavers, deer and moose live in it, and there were also wolves.  Birds living here, especially the <span>black stork,</span> can be found in few places besides these places.  The water of the canal is full of fish; grayling, trout and barbel are listed in the Red Book. </p>

    <h2>  Hiking and cycling tours along the banks of the canal </h2><p>  No matter how interesting it is to sail here on the boat, it will not give as many emotions as you get by taking a walk along the shores.  Summer is the best time to visit the Augustow Canal.  An excursion without a guide will cost quite inexpensively, but you can miss a lot of interesting places.  These places are one of the most environmentally friendly on the continent.  Grodno Forest stretches for many kilometers, giving the opportunity to admire its pristine beauty. </p><p>  In the heart of the reserve is a beautiful recreational park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 6 hectares.  There are areas for family and outdoor activities. </p><p>  On both banks of the canal are beautiful gardening complexes, churches and churches.  Tourists are allowed to visit them, but only in the tombs can you go down only with the excursion group.  If you are traveling on your own, we strongly recommend visiting the palace and park complex in the village of Svyatsk, garden and park complexes dating back to the 17th century, in the villages of White Bogs and Radzivilki.  Fans of military history will love to see the forts and fortresses of the late XIX and early XX centuries, as well as the strengthening of the Molotov line.  It will be useful for young people to look at places where their grandfathers heroically defended their homeland. </p>

    <h2>  Boat excursions </h2><p>  Every day, passenger steamships run along the route.  Depending on the chosen tour, they run from 20 km or more.  Prices are more than affordable, for an hour's walk you will give away about one dollar.  It is possible to completely remove the entire ship and a friendly company to celebrate a birthday or other holiday.  An hour will cost less than $ 30. </p><p>  Such a vacation is suitable for those who do not like to walk, but want to see all the local attractions.  The channel is not wide, it allows you to literally absorb the beauty of its shores.  In addition, the ship makes stops so that tourists can explore especially significant places. </p>

    <h2>  Features of various tours </h2><p>  Tourists can choose different programs, designed for several hours or days.  Whether it's a Sunday walk or a vacation in Belarus, be sure that you will have a good time.  A full-fledged tour is a long swim with a lock.  As part of the tour program there is a bicycle rental.  Staying in a beautiful place, led by a guide, you will take a fascinating journey and look at the Augustow Canal from different sides.  Photos taken on its shores will remind you of pleasant moments for a long time. </p><h2>  Family and corporate holidays </h2><p>  Sit quietly on the shore, breathe fresh air, fish - this option is most often chosen for family vacations.  The Augustow Canal is ideal for this.  Pergolas located along its shores, can comfortably accommodate all members of the team, they have tables, barbecue facilities and all the necessary accessories.  Fragrant kebab or fresh fish baked on charcoal will add romance to your adventure.  The only negative is that swimming here will not work.  <span>The channel is navigable,</span> therefore security measures do not allow equipping beaches. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  They are best visited with a guide.  In the village of Nemovo, the old gateway keeper‚Äôs house, built in the 18th century, has been preserved.  Be sure to look into the Museum of the Augustow Canal, here its whole history comes to life, there are good examples of ancient maps of the area and channel designs.  The exposition presents handwritten documents, photographs and household items. </p><p>  Further, the path of tourists usually runs through the village of Sopotskin.  Here are preserved beautiful monuments of the 16th century, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph Kuntsevich.  In addition, you can see non-Gothic chapels, and lovers of antiquity - even look at the oldest Jewish cemetery. </p><p>  The Augustow Canal never ceases to amaze even after a series of excursions.  It is impossible to breathe air here, and time stops.  The moments spent in the bosom of untouched nature, forever remain in the memory, and I want to come back here again and again. </p>
