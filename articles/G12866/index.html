    <p>  On the Moscow River - a large number of embankments.  No wonder.  The Moscow River not only passed into the name of the city, but also became the reason for its creation.  However, like most settlements, Moscow was built at the intersection of rivers.  For the construction of the ancient city, it was a convenient place.  The river could serve as the nurse and protector of the people living in it. </p><h2>  Famous street </h2><p>  Traveling in Moscow can take more than one week.  Indeed, the city has many fascinating places.  Of interest is also this generally quite small street on the banks of the Moskva River - Danilovskaya embankment.  It is located in the Southern Administrative District.  The boundaries of the Southern Administrative District of Moscow were determined in 1995 by order of the mayor of the city.  The area adjacent to the embankment is also called Danilovsky.  All names are interconnected.  They originate from the Danilov Monastery and the settlement, which was once located at this place.  It is believed that this embankment of the Moskva River dates back to the nineteenth century.  The sources mentioned for the first time in the middle of the fifteenth.  In 1627, in the scribe book, it was noted that Danilovskaya Sloboda has twenty-eight yards and approximately forty or sixty souls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition, Danilovskaya <span>Naberezhnaya (Moscow)</span> has its own historical past, as it extends where the medieval road once led the travelers to the Kremlin from the south.  The road, along with the crossings through the Moscow River, defended the Danilovsky Monastery - one of the most remarkable places on the embankment - from the invasion of enemies.  The settlement here existed long before the appearance of the temple. </p><h2>  Danilovsky Monastery (Moscow) </h2><p>  The districts of the city do not all boast of such ancient buildings.  The Danilov Monastery was founded in the eleventh century by Prince Daniil, the son of the legendary Alexander Nevsky.  The prince ruled for thirty years, he was very pious and took the tonsure before his death.  He bequeathed to bury him in the monastery wall, which was later done. </p>

    <p>  This happened in 1303.  A few years later the monastery was transferred to the Kremlin, and then the Novospassky monastery was founded, while the Danilovsky buildings were desolate.  The tomb of the prince was abandoned.  But ordinary people did not forget about it.  There was a rumor that those parishioners who visited the grave of the prince were healed of various diseases.  It was this rumor that became the starting point for the revival of the Danilov Monastery.  During the time of Ivan the Terrible and on his orders he was restored, and Prince Daniel was counted among the saints. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Danilovsky Monastery in our time </h2><p>  In Soviet times, the Danilovsky Monastery was closed.  As in other monasteries of the country, a <span>colony for juvenile</span> delinquents was placed in it, many buildings were destroyed.  Only at the end of the last century the monastery was again given to the church and restored. </p><p>  Now it looks the same as in the nineteenth century.  It currently houses the Church of the Holy Fathers of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, built in the middle of the fourteenth century, the refectory Church of the Intercession, built in the second half of the seventeenth century, the northern limit (a building of the nineteenth century), the Trinity Cathedral (the first half of the nineteenth century). </p><p>  In September of the ninety-seventh year of the last century, the Tula Square was decorated with a monument to Prince Daniel of Moscow and a chapel.  Particles of the relics of the prince are stored in the Trinity Cathedral. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Danilovsky Monastery is the most important attraction that Danilovskaya Embankment has.  The rest of the buildings are mainly industrial or commercial.  Moreover, they are all located on one side, while the river extends on the other.  Once it was on the Danilovskaya embankment that the southern river station was located, but later it was transferred to Nagatino. </p><p>  The length of Danilovskaya embankment is about a kilometer.  There are many office and industrial buildings, hotels, hostels, cafes and restaurants along the entire length. </p><h2>  Manufactory </h2><p>  A special place in the history of the Southern Administrative District of Moscow is the Danilov manufactory, which was built in 1867.  Previously, there was <span>weaving.</span>  But the real boom occurred precisely in that year.  The beginning was laid by the merchant who came here from the Kaluga province - Vasily Mescherin.  He first built a small craft enterprise, which later grew into a huge industrial manufactory with a full cycle of work. </p>

In 1872, seven hundred and fifty people were already working at the manufactory.  Meshcherin's textile production was one of the most advanced in the country at that time.  By the beginning of the twentieth century, it was already an enterprise for more than a thousand machine tools and one thousand two hundred workers.  Then the manufactory also opened a network of stores throughout the country.  Moreover, Meshcheryakov not only gave work to people, but also taught.  Many workers received a qualified education, studied for spinners, dyers, engravers.  We looked for talented children and taught them the profession of fabric artists.

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  A polyclinic, a maternity hospital, a nursery, and even a theater were opened for workers.  The manufactory also had its factory canteens.  It bore fruit.

The company began to supply products to the <span>Persian Shah.</span>  After the revolution, the manufactory was nationalized and turned into a Frunze cotton factory.
