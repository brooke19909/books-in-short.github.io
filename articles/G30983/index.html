You can really relax here very well, and at quite reasonable prices.  There are many different coastal villages and towns that are perfect for spending vacations in Thailand.  Here, vacationers are waiting not only for clean beaches and the warm sea, but also for their well-developed tourist infrastructure. </p><p>  Many domestic vacationers recently prefer to buy tours to the beautiful village of Krabi (Thailand).  Russian tourists have good reviews about the rest in this Thai village, including because it is easy to rent comfortable housing at a relatively low cost here.  Krabi as a resort began to gain popularity among vacationers recently.  However, the infrastructure here is already quite well developed.  Very good reviews on the network, for example, are available about the Palm Paradise Resort 3 * hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Hotel Palm Paradise is located 30 km from the provincial capital of Krabi, in the village of Ao Nang, in a small palm grove.  Taxis from the airport to this hotel are not too expensive.  The price of a trip from Krabi to Ao Nang is about 600 baht.  If desired, you can get to the village by bus.  In this case, a ticket will pay only 150 baht. </p>

    <p>  Those tourists who do not want to take a taxi from the airport to Ao Nang and do not regret shaking in the bus during the heat should order a transfer from the travel agency that sold the package with accommodation at the Palm Paradise Hotel.  Such a service will cost about 2000 rubles for two adults. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This hotel is located quite far from the sea - 800 meters.  However, judging by the reviews, this does not deliver any particular inconvenience to its guests.  Actually, you need to walk about 15 minutes to the coastline from the hotel.  The same amount of time will have to be spent on a trip along the sea to the beach. </p><p>  Of course, half-hour walks may not be convenient for all tourists.  Therefore, Palm Paradise included in the list of its services and free delivery to the beach.  Every day, according to the schedule, a tuk-tuk departs from its gate towards the ocean.  It takes just 5-10 minutes to get this traditional Thai taxi to the beach.  There is a free hotel tuk-tuk to the sea only until 10 p.m.  This is worth considering.  However, if a tourist lingers on the coast until late - it does not matter.  Walking to the hotel is also optional in this case.  If desired, you can also get to the public tuk-tuk.  Such a taxi in Thailand is very inexpensive. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the hotel and its territory </h2><p>  Represents the hotel Palm Paradise Resort 3 * a small complex consisting of a main building and several small villas.  Tourists consider the hotel territory very beautiful and well-groomed.  Tropical greenery is really planted here just a huge amount.  Paths in the courtyard are covered with paving slabs, and beautiful flowerbeds are laid out next to the villas and the main building.  A significant part of the hotel courtyard is occupied by the pool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel villas have a very interesting light architecture and are surrounded by greenery.  The main building (four floors) is built in a modern style.  Walking along the paths of the hotel in the garden during the day, according to most tourists, is very convenient.  But at night, the hotel grounds, unfortunately, are not covered.  At the same time, the paths in the courtyard of the hotel are quite narrow.  In addition, there are dips in some places between the tiles.  Therefore, moving around the hotel at night is more careful. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  In total, Thai Hotel Palm Paradise offers its guests 45 comfortable apartments.  In the main building, guests of Ao Nang are given deluxe rooms (52-70 m <sup>2</sup> ).  These are actually very comfortable and spacious rooms.  However, most Russian tourists rent, of course, less expensive bungalows in Palm Paradise Resort 3 *.  Room types for villas in this hotel are: Palm Garden Villa (35 m <sup>2</sup> ) or Palm Twin Villas (40 m <sup>2</sup> ).  All apartments in the hotel are designed for two people.  If desired, guests of the village can also order another extra bed. </p>

    <p>  A small part of the hotel pool has a very high bottom and sides.  This small "paddling pool" is intended for bathing children. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  All rooms in the hotel Palm Paradise Resort 3 * are rented with breakfast.  In the morning, residents have the opportunity to go down to the restaurant and eat quality and tasty dishes.  Judging by the reviews of former guests, the food at the hotel is very good.  All dishes are prepared by an experienced chef using fresh and quality products.  Some complaints about breakfast at the Palm Paradise hotel have earned only for the uniformity.  But if a tourist is suddenly tired of eating the same dishes every day served in the hotel restaurant, he always has the opportunity to visit one of the cafes located near the hotel. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel restaurant serves not only breakfast, but lunch and dinner.  The menu in this institution is quite diverse.  If desired, for a fee, you can order dishes of both local cuisine and European. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Beaches </h2><p>  The coastline from this hotel is quite far.  But not so much as to lead to any inconvenience.  Guests of the Palm Paradise Resort 3 * hotel have the opportunity to visit the beaches of Ao Nang or, for example, Nopparattara.  In both cases, a comfortable holiday for tourists is guaranteed. </p><p>  A fairly clear and calm warm sea is what distinguishes Krabi (Thailand).  Tourists have good reviews about the rest in this village, primarily because here you can sunbathe and swim with comfort. </p><h2>  Ao nang </h2><p>  The central beach of the village of Ao Nang has a length of about one and a half kilometers.  In the south it ends with picturesque cliffs, and in the north with a stone cape.  The beach strip here at low tide is very wide and covered with fine sand.  There are many cafes and restaurants on the shores of Ao Nang.  Also, tourists have the opportunity to buy a boat trip to neighboring beaches or islands.  The price of this service is about 100-300 baht one way. </p><h2>  Nopparattara </h2><p>  Beautiful sea sunsets and simply magnificent nature - this is what, of course, guests of the Palm Paradise Resort 3 * hotel can enjoy.  Nopparattara beach, like Ao Nang, is also covered with sand and surrounded by picturesque mountains.  Swimming in this place is not particularly convenient, since the bottom of the sea is clay.  Mostly tourists visit this beach at low tide to watch the many local crabs rolling balls of sand.  Sometimes the water on Nopparattara goes so far that vacationers can walk to the nearest islands in the sea. </p>

    <p>  Of course, guests of Palm Paradise Hotel have the opportunity to visit other not less convenient beaches in Ao Nang.  In any case, you will not have to pay at this resort for the opportunity to swim in the sea.  All beaches in Ao Nang are public. </p><h2>  <strong>Palm Paradise Resort 3 *:</strong> Location </h2><p>  Thus, the opinion of the hotel itself, tourists have developed mostly good.  Excellent reviews on the network, for example, are available about its location.  This hotel is located in a quiet street, and tourists, including at night, have no rest here.  There are quite a lot of places in the rooms, judging by the reviews of the guests. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  The speed, courtesy and responsibility of the staff is also what tourists praise the Palm Paradise Resort 3 * hotel.  Service here is rated by vacationers, if not five, then a solid four.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  Therefore, the hotel rooms look cozy and romantic.  Of the minuses, guests note only the presence in the apartment of a huge number of ants.  To keep them smaller, experienced tourists advise never to leave any food in the room (fruits, milk, etc.).  But there are practically no mosquitoes on the territory of this hotel and in its rooms. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Power Reviews </h2><p>  This hotel has earned some complaints from tourists because the pool on its territory is not too deep (only 55 cm).  About food in the hotel Palm Paradise Resort 3 *, as already mentioned, tourists respond well.  But they still advise newcomers in the event that they are tired of Thai food, visit the Our Rasha cafe located near Ao Nang Beach.  Here you can order dishes of Russian cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>Palm Paradise Resort 3 *</strong> : entertainment for guests </h2><p>  Of course, it is unlikely that its guests will have fun in any way at the hotel.  According to most tourists, this hotel is best suited for a quiet family vacation.  Perhaps, only swimming in the pool can become the only entertainment on the hotel territory.  There are no Russian TV channels here, and the Internet is pretty slow. </p><p>  But in the village itself, tourists who want to have a good time, will surely have something to do.  In Ao Nang, you can, for example, go to the Planet Ao Nang nightclub, play a pool at Funky Fish, sit in O'Malley's Irish Pub, etc. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, although there are some drawbacks to this hotel, in general, tourists consider it a very comfortable and cozy place.  Many tourists recommend a room for renting a hotel at Palm Paradise when choosing Ao Nang as a vacation spot.  The Palm Paradise Resort 3 * hotel looks presentable, and living in its rooms and bungalows is really quite convenient. </p>
