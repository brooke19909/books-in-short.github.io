For the first time, a convenient geographical location and excellent climatic conditions were appreciated by King Jaime I. It was off the coast of the future city of Salou that he gathered his fleet in order to later go to conquer Majorca from the Saracens.  It happened on September 6, 1229.  By the way, this historical fact turned over time into a holiday: from September 3 to 10, various events take place on the streets of the city. </p><p>  Later, the port attracted pirates and robbers, who periodically attacked it.  After their repeated raids, local residents tried to leave the city. </p><p>  In 1539, by order of Bishop Pere de Cardon, a fortress was built in Salou, which protected the city from raids. </p><p>  In the 17-18 centuries, a small Spanish town became the main cargo port of the country. </p><p>  In 1858, a lighthouse was completed on the cape and began to operate.  And a few years later, the city authorities are taking their first steps to attract tourists: small houses are installed on the beach so that people can change clothes. </p><p>  The next step in this direction is the opening of a railway station that connected the two cities of Spain: Salou and Barcelona.  Twenty years later, the Carrilet tram was launched, which brought the first tourists to Salou. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea shore </h2><p>  <span>The beaches of Salou</span> in Spain, striking with their snow-white sands, stretched more than seven kilometers along the sea.  The city has eight city beaches.  They are well equipped and perfect for relaxing.  There is also a deserted wild coast in Salou, the nature around which is striking in its beauty.  To get to such places is quite difficult, but if you really want to enjoy the unity with nature, then it's still worth a try. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Salou" class="if uuid-2283280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2283280.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most famous in Salou (Spain) is the beach of Lievant.  Its length exceeds a thousand meters, and in some places its width reaches 150 m. Plus, there is a lot of entertainment on the beach, so tourists often prefer it. </p><p>  Ponent is the second largest beach in Salou.  In times when joint bathing of representatives of opposite sexes was forbidden, only women bathed here. </p><p>  The small, but very picturesque beach of Capellans is also popular among tourists.  Its length is not more than 250 meters.  The beach is bounded by cliffs on both sides, but swimming is safe here. </p><p>  Other places of sea recreation are also famous among tourists: Llarga, Cala de la Font.  However, all the beaches of Salou are perfect for this.

This is a manor that was built in 1974.  She completely copies peasant old houses.  In it you can get acquainted with the life of the Spanish peasants, their traditions, kitchen utensils and a variety of little things that allow you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of ancient times. </p><p>  The fortress of Torre Velha is the one that protected the small town of Salou in Spain from attacks by pirates and sea robbers.  It was built in the 16th century and served as a defensive structure. </p><p>  Port Aventura Park is the largest entertainment center in Europe.  A huge number of attractions, souvenir shops.
