    <p>  For the manufacture of fences from corrugated board, the raw materials of the Severstal and NLMK Concerns are used. </p><p>  Masterovit makes a fence from a mesh-netting on its own in the areas of its three production bases.  In the process of manufacturing products on German automatic machines, European technology is used.  Capacities of automatic lines allow producing up to 5 km of net per day. </p><p>  For the manufacture of fences made of wood, ‚ÄúMasterovit‚Äù (reviews of the company's employees - confirmation of this) uses softwood (spruce, pine), which it purchases in the northern regions of the country (Veliky Ustyug, Arkhangelsk).  Timber products from these areas are characterized as quite durable, with high density and increased resistance to aggressive environmental influences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Euro fences</span> are in high demand <span>.</span>  In tandem with Finnish specialists, Masterovit developed and patented the Finfold Europacket.  Own production makes it possible to cut shtaketin of very different lengths, from 10 cm to 4 m. </p><p>  Another type of fence from Masterovit is brick.  The foundation for such a fence is poured from high-quality concrete.  Pillars and foundation masonry are made using facing bricks. </p><h2>  Guaranteed quality </h2><p>  The highest quality of the services provided is an integral component of the success of Masterovit (St. Petersburg).  Reviews and customers and employees of the company characterize fences as strong, elegant designs with a sufficiently long service life. </p>

    <p>  The company is very responsible for the selection of suppliers of raw materials for its products.  In addition to this, the company buys high-precision and high-quality equipment for the production of various types of fences and uses European technology for the manufacture of products. </p><p>  The company employs specialists with relevant specialized education, which allows us to find complete understanding with the customer and satisfy all his wishes, optimally combining product quality and the amount of financial investments necessary for this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Company pricing policy </h2><p>  The price of a fence from any material is formed from several factors.  For example, in the cost of fencing from corrugated board, the main component is the price of the material itself.  LLC ‚ÄúMasterovit‚Äù (customer reviews - confirmation of this) for the manufacture of its products uses corrugated board with a thickness of 0.5 mm.  Material with a thickness of 0.4 mm is used only for those fences and fences, which will soon be intended for demolition.  Further, the price of a running meter of the fence will depend on its height, the required number of lags and, if necessary, the works ordered and performed additionally (foundation, installation of gates and gates). </p><p>  The price of a meter of linear fence made of netting will consist of such factors as, in fact, the height of the fence, the number of rows of reinforcing broaches, the thickness of the mesh itself (1.8 or 2 mm) and the cost of work performed additionally. </p><p>  The price of the wooden fence also takes into account its height, the distance at which wooden shtaketins are located from each other, additional work and the option of painting (impregnation with Aquatex or Tikkurila paint). </p>

This approach to business, of course, colors the reviews about the company Masterovit in the most iridescent colors. </p><p>  Fences from corrugated board are treated with a special powder to prevent corrosion and painted with Tikkuril and Hammerayt paints.  More than 200 possible shades and colors can be selected in a single RAL catalog.  In addition, the company can offer solutions such as imitation wood, stone, and other natural materials. </p>

    <p>  Covering the fence from the netting net - galvanizing.  Wooden fences, as already mentioned, are tinted using the materials ‚ÄúAquatex‚Äù or ‚ÄúTikkurila‚Äù.  These paints, in addition to their immediate functions, also have the properties of antiseptics that protect the wood from fungus and rot. </p><p>  The powder coating of Euro-fencing fences is carried out under the control of one of the leaders in this field - the Henkel company.  The most popular colors today are stained oak, ripe cherries, chocolate, green moss. </p><h2>  Installation of fences </h2><p>  It should be noted that the installation of fences is also the work of Masterovit.  Customer reviews report that specialists at all stages of installation work quickly, smoothly and efficiently.  Like the fence itself, all the necessary components and hardware are supplied by the company.  All load-bearing structural elements are installed in compliance with the basic rules. </p><p>  When it comes to a brick fence, for which a foundation is required, a specialist of the company preliminary studies the soil on the site, makes the necessary measurements and makes the marking of the territory.  Further, all work is performed by professional craftsmen, which in a financial sense fully justifies itself. </p><h2>  Is it difficult to place an order? </h2><p>  "Masterovit" reviews of employees are called a perfectionist company.  One call - and the manufacturer will take all possible measures to ensure that the customer receives a durable and beautiful fence as quickly as possible and as close as possible to his financial capabilities. </p><p>  To make an order, you can, firstly, just call and leave a request for a call back. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, you can visit the Masterovit sales office (there are 9 of them, all within walking distance from metro stations).  Thirdly, you can call a specialist to your site (‚Äúmobile manager‚Äù service).  The cost of such a visit includes consultation, carrying out all necessary measurements, placing an order with a full package of supporting documentation.  It is allowed to pay for the company‚Äôs services both in cash and non-cash by credit card. </p><h2>  Working conditions of ‚ÄúMasterovit‚Äù </h2><p>  So to speak, the ‚Äúarea of ‚Äã‚Äãinfluence‚Äù of a company is not only Moscow, but also distant districts far from it.  About 130 professional teams carry out their work in all weather conditions and on any type of soil.  A minimum of time elapses between placing an order and the beginning of installation work, as there is always a supply of materials, components and hardware in the warehouses of Masterovit.  After all, accessories, poles and corrugated board are products of our own production, and the necessary raw materials are purchased in large quantities.  All this allows customers to win in price and time.  After the installation is completed, work crews must remove garbage after themselves, which is also important. </p><h2>  Storage of finished products </h2><p>  An always available stock of finished products is one of the rules of the management of Masterovit.  Reviews of many customers report that the order was made very quickly.  Often this is the result of the fact that at the time of signing the contract, the order, one might say, was already ready, i.e.  finished products were available in specially designed warehouses for storage.  For each type of fence, the conditions are met to prevent possible deformation, or in the case of fencing from a netting netting - tangling of rolls. </p>

    <p>  Not every manufacturer can afford such storage conditions for finished products on the construction market of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Why do I need to give preference to ‚ÄúMasterovit‚Äù? </h2><p>  Reviews of the company ‚ÄúMasterovit‚Äù inform consumers that this manufacturer is one of the oldest and most experienced fences in the market.  Hence the consequence: the entire process from the order to the installation of the finished product is debugged to the smallest detail.  During its operation, the company has earned a reputation as a reliable companion for both raw material producers and customers. </p><p>  The presence of large own production facilities, imported high-precision equipment, the latest technology, time-tested suppliers of raw materials and professional professionals are the <span>guarantee of the quality of</span> their products and are components of the success of Masterovit. </p><h2>  The opinion of employees about their employer </h2><p>  The vast majority of specialists and workers are quite satisfied with the fact that they work at Masterovit.  Fences (consumer reviews confirm this) are ordered the most different and from a variety of materials.  The company provides its specialists with all the necessary tools and equipment for high-quality and quick work.  The company pays for the work of its personnel at a sufficiently high level, always on time and without delay. </p>

    <p>  The company saves the working hours of its teams: 250 vehicles with building materials are sent daily to consumers' addresses.  The use of Swiss dyeing technologies, Finnish lines for the manufacture of picket fence, German automatic machines for weaving mesh netting allows the finished product to be competitive in the market for the production of fences and from year to year the company increase sales. </p><h2>  Consumers about Masterovit </h2><p>  The bulk of consumers who contacted the company Masterovit leaves positive feedback.  An order is issued quickly, and in order to make it, it is absolutely not necessary to go to the office.  The service "mobile manager" is very pleased with many customers. </p><p>  Installation work was carried out quickly and smoothly.  Quality is almost always guaranteed.  A large number of consumers ordered fences for summer cottages outside of Moscow.  The distance did not in any way affect the quality and efficiency of the order.  The teams always work in contact with the customer, taking into account his wishes and requirements.  A difficult terrain with slopes or a request to preserve the roots of trees growing next to a future fence is not something impossible for the specialists of this company. </p><p>  If defects formed during the execution of the work, it was enough to call a mobile manager to fix everything and solve all the issues by mutual agreement. </p>
