Many offer favorable interest on loans and deposits.  Clients prefer to conclude agreements with prompt banks that have been working in their field for more than one year.  This is Baltinvestbank.  Reviews about the institution can be heard mostly positive, although there are rumors that the company will soon have its license revoked. </p><h2>  Bank History </h2><p>  The company took the first steps in its development in December 1994.  Then an institution called ‚ÄúBaltonexim Bank‚Äù was founded.  The early years were very difficult for the organization.  Almost no one knew about the bank; customers were in no hurry to conclude an agreement with it.  Rapid development began after the company received dealer status in the Russian trading system in 1997.  In 1998, the first branch was opened in the city of Vyborg. </p>

Reviews show that since then the institution has become more recognizable.  A large office was opened in the city of St. Petersburg.  Every year, more and more branches were opened in various cities.  Customers began to trust the company.  Today the network consists of 5 large branches and 28 offices.  In most cases, these are branches in large cities of Russia.  However, management does not plan to stop the development of Baltinvestbank.  Soon, the network will spread to small towns.

    <p>  The new lending program has several advantages.  Firstly, it is possible to conclude a contract for 7 years, due to which the minimum contribution is significantly reduced.  Secondly, you can purchase vehicles in just two documents.  This is the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and the number of SNILS.  In some cases, an institution may require another income statement for the last 6 months.  If desired, you can include an insurance premium in the loan amount (CASCO or CTP). </p><p>  The loan rate depends on the vehicle that is purchased.  Reviews show that the highest overpayment will be if the transaction is a used car.  The rate is 18.7%.  A new vehicle can be purchased at 16% per annum. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Despite financial difficulties, Baltinvestbank continues to issue loans for housing in St. Petersburg.  Everyone has the opportunity to purchase housing in a new building under the "Primary Market" program at 10% per annum.  To conclude an agreement, you will need a passport, SNILS number, as well as proof of income for the last 6 months.  Formal employment is required.  The likelihood of issuing a loan will increase if the client can attract solvent co-borrowers.  In their role may be the next of kin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
