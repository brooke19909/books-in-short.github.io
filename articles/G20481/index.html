Who are the Vikings?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most striking events in history can rightly be considered the Viking campaigns, as they themselves can rightly be called very interesting figures from the 9th to the 11th centuries.  The word "Viking" roughly means "swimming in the sea."  In the native language of the Normans, “wik” means “fiord”, which in our opinion will be “bay”.  Therefore, many sources interpret the word "Viking" as "a man from the bay."  The common question is “Where did the Vikings live?”  it will be just as inappropriate as the statement that “Viking” and “Scandinavian” are one and the same.  In the first case, it is about <span>the occupation of a</span> person, in the second - about belonging to a particular people. </p>

    <p>  With regard to belonging to a particular ethnic group, it can be identified with difficulty, since the Vikings settled in the occupied territories, saturated with all the local “goods”, as well as saturated with the culture of these lands.  The same can be said about the names that were awarded to the "people of the fort" by various peoples.  It all depended on the place where the Vikings lived.  Normans, Varangians, Danes, Russes - these were the names of the "naval army" on more and more new shores, where it landed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many myths and misconceptions hover around the vivid historical characters that the Vikings were.  Where the Norman invaders lived, what they did besides their campaigns and raids, and whether they did anything besides them in general, are very sensitive issues that torment the heads of historians to this day.  However, to date, at least seven misconceptions regarding the “Scandinavian barbarians” can be deduced. </p><h2>  Cruelty and thirst for conquest </h2><p>  In most films, books and other entertaining resources, Vikings appear to us as bloodthirsty barbarians who cannot imagine their life without everyday sticking their ax into someone's skull. </p>

    <p>  The initial reason for the Norman military campaigns was the overpopulation of the Scandinavian lands where the Vikings lived.  Plus constant clashes between clans.  Both that and another forced a considerable part of the population to go in search of a better life.  And the river robbery became nothing more than a bonus of their hard way.  Naturally, poorly fortified European cities became easy prey for sailors.  However, as for other peoples - the French, British, Arabs and others, who also did not disdain bloodshed for the benefit of their pockets.  It is enough to recall that all this happened in the Middle Ages, and this method of profit was equally attractive to representatives of various powers.  And there was nothing to do with the national penchant for bloodshed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hostility </h2><p>  Another assertion that the Vikings were hostile to everyone but themselves is also a fallacy.  In fact, strangers could both take advantage of the Normans' hospitality and join their ranks.  Many historical records confirm that among the Vikings, the French, Italians and Russians could meet.  An example of a stay in the Scandinavian possessions of Ansgaria - the messenger of Louis the Pious - is another proof of the hospitality of the Vikings.  You can also recall the Arab ambassador Ibn Fadlan - the film "13th Warrior" was shot based on this story. </p><h2>  Natives of Scandinavia </h2><p>  Although, contrary to the aforementioned remark, the Vikings are equated with the Scandinavians - this is a profound error, which is explained by the fact that the Vikings lived on the territory of Greenland, Iceland, as well as France and even Ancient Russia.  The mere statement that all the “people of the fjord” are from Scandinavia is a mistake. </p>

    <p>  Where the Vikings lived at the beginning of the Middle Ages is an inappropriate question, since the “maritime community” itself could include various nationalities from different lands.  Among other things, it is worth noting the fact that the French king unconstrainedly gave part of the land to the Vikings, who, in gratitude, became the guardians of France when the enemy attacked her “from outside”.  It is not uncommon that Vikings from other lands were also this enemy.  By the way, this is exactly what the name Normandy appeared. </p><h2>  Dirty Gentile Savages </h2><p>  Another oversight of many storytellers of past years is the image of the Vikings as dirty, unclean and wild people.  And this again is not true.  And proof of this is the finds that were excavated in various places where the Vikings lived. </p>

    <p>  Mirrors, ridges, baths - all these remains of ancient culture, found during excavations, confirmed that the Normans were a clean people.  And these findings were extracted not only in Sweden, Denmark, but also in Greenland, Iceland and other lands, including the Sarskoye fortress, where the Vikings lived on the banks of the Volga, which was located on the territory of Ancient Russia.  In addition to everything else, it is not uncommon for the remains of soap made by the hands of the Normans themselves to be found.  Once again, their cleanliness and a joke of the British prove something like this: "The Vikings are so clean that they even go to the bathhouse once a week."  It does not hurt to recall that the Europeans themselves visited the bath much less often. </p><h2>  Two meter blond </h2><p>  Another false statement, since the remains of the Viking bodies suggest otherwise.  Those who are represented by tall warriors with blond hair, in fact, in growth reached no more than 170 centimeters.  The vegetation on the head of these people was of different colors.  The only thing that is undeniable is the preference for this type of hair among the Normans themselves.  This was facilitated by the use of special coloring soap. </p>

    <h2>  Vikings and Ancient Russia </h2><p>  On the one hand, it is believed that the Vikings were directly related to the formation of Russia as a great power.  On the other hand, there are sources denying their involvement in any event in the history of the <span>ancient Slavs.</span>  Especially controversial historians perceive Rurik's belonging to the Scandinavians, and vice versa.  Nevertheless, the name Rurik is close to the Norman Rerek - that is how many boys were called in Scandinavia.  The same can be said about Oleg, Igor - his relative and son.  And wife Olga.  Just look at their Norman counterparts - Helge, Ingvar, Helga. </p>

    <p>  Many sources (almost all) unanimously state that the Viking possessions extended to the Caspian and Black Seas.  In addition, to reach the Caliphate, the Normans used the crossing of the Dnieper, Volga and many other rivers flowing on the territory of Ancient Russia.  The presence of trade transactions in the area of ​​the Sarskoye fortification, where the Vikings lived on the Volga, was repeatedly noted.  In addition, raids were often mentioned, accompanied by robberies in the area of ​​Staraya Ladoga, Gnezdovsky mounds, which also confirms the presence of Norman settlements on the territory of Ancient Russia.  Incidentally, the word "Rus" also belongs to the Vikings.  Even in the "Tale of Bygone Years" it was said that "Rurik came with all his Russia." </p><p>  The exact location where the Vikings lived, whether or not on the banks of the Volga, is controversial.  Some sources mention that they were based right next to their forts.  Others argue that the Normans preferred a neutral space between water and large settlements. </p><h2>  Helm Horns </h2><p>  And another misconception is the presence of horns on the upper part of the military clothing of the Normans.  For all the time of excavation and research in the places where the Vikings lived, no helmets with horns were found, with the exception of the only one that was found in one of the Norman burial grounds. </p>

    <p>  But an isolated case does not give grounds for such a generalization.  Although this image can be interpreted differently.  That was how it was beneficial to introduce the Vikings to the Christian world, ranking them among the offspring of the devil.  And all that is related to Satan, for some reason, Christians necessarily have horns. </p>
