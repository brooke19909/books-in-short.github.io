  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do hotel stars depend on?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most common hotel classification system is the number of stars assigned.  Hotel stars are responsible for the quality and availability of compulsory services (such as changing clothes in the room, the presence of a minibar, a TV-set) and for the level of staff qualifications, the size of rooms, and the location of the hotel. </p><p>  <strong>1 star hotel suggests:</strong> <br>  The size of a double room is not less than 8 square meters.  m. The room is cleaned every day, linen is changed approximately once a week, towels twice a week.  There must be at least two bathrooms on the floor, and one toilet for 5 or less rooms.  The room has a mirror, washbasin, chairs, clothes hanger or wardrobe.  Of the replacement accessories, two towels are put on the guest. </p><p>  <strong>2 star hotels suggest:</strong> <br>  Everything is the same as in one-star hotels, but bed linen is changed every six days, and in rooms, usually there is a toilet and a bathroom.  In addition, two-star hotels should offer lodging options to guests.  And to have a cafe or restaurant on its territory. </p><p>  <strong><span>3 star hotels</span> suggest:</strong> <br>  Room size is not less than 10 sq.m.  Three-star hotels, as well as hotels of a higher category, have a toilet and a bathroom in their room.  Just like a luggage stand, <span>dressing table</span> , etc. With rare exceptions, the rooms are equipped with air conditioning, radio and TV.  <span>Bed sheets are</span> changed twice a week, and towels are changed every day.  Bathrooms have soap.  In addition to a cafe or restaurant, a hairdresser, an exchange office, a guarded parking lot, and a swimming pool can be located on site.  In some three-star hotels it is possible to take an iron for temporary use.  The staff is divided into services, and wears <span>uniforms</span> appropriate to the position <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>4 star hotels suggest:</strong> <br>  Everything is the same as in three-star hotels, but in addition there may be a telephone, a safe, a minibar in the room.  In the bathroom: <span>shower gel,</span> shampoo, hair dryer.  For a fee, such services as cleaning, washing, ironing are provided.  Breakfast menu is served in the room.  On the territory of the hotel you can visit a sports center, a conference room, a music and TV lounge, a sauna.  It offers car rental.  Room size is not less than 13 square meters.  m </p><p>  <strong>5 star hotels suggest:</strong> <br>  All as in four-star hotels, but in a better quality.  Additionally, guests can have a telephone in the bathroom and another bathroom located in the room.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is not less than 16 square meters.  m </p><p>  Four and five-star hotels offer guests the opportunity to eat in the room, call a taxi, purchase souvenirs and newspapers. </p><p>  When choosing a hotel, it must be remembered that such a classification of hotels does not necessarily imply that the list of services is fully consistent with the number of stars.  Therefore, it is better to ask in advance what conditions of hotel accommodation.  Some of the amenities expected by existing stars may not be available or available for a fee. </p><p>  The price of rooms in one hotel may depend on the level of service, room size, additional equipment, floor location.  In addition to the choice of rooms, the hotel can offer guests a variety of food options.  If the hotel offers a limited number of dishes, it is advisable to ask in advance about the availability of nearby restaurants and their prices. </p><p>  Hotels are not always classified by star rating.  Sometimes a letter classification is used for this (for example, in Greece).  This must be taken into account when going on vacation to some countries. </p><p>  You can always check with the tour operator for additional information about the features of hotels, and then your trip will not be overshadowed by unfulfilled expectations. </p>
