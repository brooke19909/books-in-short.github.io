Here, travelers will be able to see the mountain peaks covered with snow, and slowly flowing rivers, and picturesque beaches. </p><h2>  Country features </h2><p>  South and North India are attractive destinations for many travelers.  Since the country is rich in climatic features, before you go to India, you need to make a choice: enjoy a few warm days in the tropics or enjoy the snowy peaks of the mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mnogolok.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="south and north india" class="if uuid-2530398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2530398.jpg"></div><h2>  Manali and Shimla </h2><p>  North India is suitable for lovers of relaxation with cold and snow.  It is here that the most beautiful places of those that can be found on our planet.  What unique species does North India have?  It is in this part of the country that there is Mount Jakhu, Rakhla Falls, Rohtang Pass, the Jung River, as well as many other picturesque places that you should definitely see. </p><p>  Manali is famous for sporting events in skiing, as well as in mountaineering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mnogolok.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what attracts tourists to India" class="if uuid-2530437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2530437.jpg"></div><h2>  Auli </h2><p>  What else does North India offer tourists?  A trip for ski lovers in Auli is the perfect solution.  It is this place that skiers from different parts of the globe prefer to improve their skills. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In your free time, you can enjoy the amazing scenery of the Himalayas, get acquainted with the largest artificial lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moments-unlimited.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in india" class="if uuid-2530403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2530403.jpg"></div><h2>  Udaipur </h2><p>  What else can North India please?  The most visited place in the world is Udaipur (Rajasthan).  He impresses the traveler with the magnificence of his palaces, temples, and the number of old buildings.  All buildings preserved in this region are the cultural and historical heritage of mankind. </p><p>  Northern India is a place where tourists strive to get in order to see the Monsoon Palace, Lake Palace with their own eyes.  This is only a small part of the places that you need to visit, if there are no restrictions on the timing of travel.  The capital of Jaipur - Mount Abu is a famous attraction, occupying a leading position in the number of unique monuments and structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mariafresa.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist information" class="if uuid-2530408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2530408.jpg"></div><h2>  Goa </h2><p>  What places is India rightfully proud of?  North Goa (Candolim) - a favorite place for fans of beach holidays.  The country has a fairly long coastline, so you can choose a place to relax for every taste. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is what attracts tourists to India.  North Goa (Morjim, Karangut) is chosen by supporters of a luxurious holiday. </p><p>  The best discos, hotels, beaches, seafood - all this is located in Goa.  Among the beaches, which are always crowded, we mention Calangute, Colva, Anjuna. </p><p>  Goa is historically and administratively divided into northern and southern zones, and the Zuari River flows as a natural boundary between them.  Such a division also affects the specifics of tourism infrastructure, recreation, and makes the distinctions in terms of atmosphere and energy visible.  It is difficult to understand in which part of Goa it is better to relax, everyone chooses the part that seems more convenient to him. </p><p>  For example, North Goa is preferred by fans of outdoor activities, parties, discos.  This is not the destination of tourists who dream of meditation alone with nature. </p><p>  Local beaches are constantly filled with youth, noisy and fun.  In the northern part of Goa there are no ultramodern hotels and elite tourist services. </p><p>  The cost of trips to the northern part is quite acceptable for the middle-income strata of the population. </p><p>  The visiting card of North Goa is considered to be Arambol.  It is rightly called the most famous beach.  Here is a huge number of budget hotels, cafes, shops, bars.  Arambol is known to tourists for its ‚Äúdrum circle‚Äù, as well as for the beach market. </p><p>  There are no noisy youth companies in Mandrem; couples prefer to relax in this place.  The conditional border of the territory of this beach is small rivers through which ordinary bamboo bridges are thrown.  In small natural pools with sea water, which are located on a sand strip, children splash. </p><p>  Morjim is a gently sloping beach that locals call Moskow Beach.  This is a favorite place for a beach holiday for Russian-speaking tourists.  The cafe serves Russian cuisine.  The place is quite expensive at prices, but great for fans of windsurfing and kiting. </p><p>  Calangute in the eyes of travelers looks like a city with a well-developed beach infrastructure.  There are restaurants, and hotels, and numerous cafes.  At any time of the year, this beach is crowded and noisy. </p><p>  Candolim is suitable for those travelers who have not yet decided where they should go to Goa.  This beach is considered the most ‚Äúsecular‚Äù and respectable in the district, which is more reminiscent of South Goa.  Comfortable accommodation, harmonious atmosphere, well-developed infrastructure - all this can satisfy the needs of even the most fastidious travelers. </p><p>  The only drawback is the steep descent to the sea, but it is fully bathed in the impeccability and beauty of the water surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="file.army" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in India" class="if uuid-2530417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2530417.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For those tourists who first went to India, experienced travelers are advised to go to North Goa.  This will provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the peculiarities of life of the inhabitants of the country, to appreciate the spirit of true freedom from civilization, to get real pleasure from ordinary human joys.  It should be noted that for Russian travelers, the most favorable season for the first acquaintance with India is winter. </p><p>  When there is a snowstorm and severe frosts in Russia, the Goa season is the velvet season.  The time of the monsoon ends, and in most of the country dry and sunny weather sets in.  Given that the territory of India is quite large, in the regions there may be some differences in climate, but the average temperature is +30 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  Each region of India has its own "highlight", so it is difficult to give advice on choosing a particular place to stay.  Amazingly beautiful beaches, friendly locals, affordable prices are factors that attract tourists from all over the world to India. </p>
