Reviews on the children's health camp "Green Noise" (Serpukhov)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rest, gatherings by the burning fire, horror stories about the black room, delicious breakfasts, sporting events - all these bright childhood events in the adult generation are associated with relaxation in pioneer camps.  And now, having matured, we wish that our own children also preserved the most touching and brightest pictures of childhood.  Pioneer times are a thing of the past, they were replaced by health facilities in the immediate vicinity of Moscow, in which a child can gain vitality, find true friends and have fun.  This is the set of impressions that Green Noise offers. </p><h2>  Information for reference </h2><p>  Pioneer camp "Green Noise" is a long-liver among all the health facilities of the Moscow Region.  During its existence, he was often the first in competitive events among many camps. </p><p>  Nature itself helps maintain an ideal environment for those who relax on the territory of this institution.  Around the complex is a pine forest, which is full of mushrooms and berries.  The healing properties of the air in the reserve have a beneficial effect on the health status of both children and adults.  The camp‚Äôs large-scale base allows you to accept about 500 children at a time.  To create comfortable conditions for relaxation, more than 150 adults work in the institution.  The key advantage of DOL Green Noise is the staff of professional educators.  Long-term experience of mentors allows you to create a positive atmosphere. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Green Noise (Serpukhov) is located on the 97th kilometer of Simferopol highway on the banks of the Oka River in the life-giving zone of the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve.  In its open spaces you can see many beautiful plants and animals that you will not find in other parts of Russia.  Many representatives of the flora growing in the reserve are listed in the Red Book as endangered species. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complexes for accommodation </h2><p>  Children's camp "Green Noise" is represented by six two-story buildings that have all the necessary conditions for a comfortable stay.  Buildings designed by the best specialists are located on the territory of a pine forest. </p><p>  At the disposal of a separate group of children (detachment) - their own floor, if necessary closed by counselors.  For personal use, each vacationer is allocated an individual place in the closet, cabinet, as well as hangers. </p><p>  Laundry facilities and drying rooms are equipped for laundry care.  Bedding sets change on a bathing day, twice a shift.  The rooms in which children live are designed for four to six beds.  The furniture in them is very ergonomic, comfortable and safe.  Bathrooms are equipped with the maximum level of comfort in accordance with the gender of the child.  Also, children can use showers, which have all the necessary hygiene products.  Residential buildings are supplied with hot water around the clock.  There are common coolers on the floors. </p><h2>  Methodology for the formation of detachments </h2><p>  In the morning hours (10.30 - 11.00), the children gather in the assembly hall for the formation of units.  Initially, groups of the smallest children are completed.  For this, girls and boys of the same age category are invited to the stage, a squad is formed from them.  When distributing, first of all, the opinion of the child is taken into account.  Relatives and friends who want to stay in the same group must communicate their intention to counselors or leaders.  The best option would be for the guys to gather in the squad with an age interval of two years.  This difference has a beneficial effect on communication within the group.  If the interval exceeds the required indicator, then children will most likely not be able to find common <span>hobbies and interests that</span> will unite them.  This factor will negatively affect the emotional state of the child and the general spirit of the detachment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Medical service </h2><p>  All the guys visit the medical office on the day of arrival to undergo a thorough examination.  In the future, qualified specialists continue to monitor the condition of children.  If necessary, experienced doctors of the institution treat the child.

    <p>  Important!  For safety reasons, the bus convoy does not stop on the way.  Everyone who did not have time to get on the bus gets to the camp on their own.  You can deliver your child using public transport.  The train leaves from the Kursk station with a stop at the Serpukhov station.  Then you should use a taxi, indicating the final destination - ‚ÄúGreen Noise‚Äù.  The road to the resting place does not seem long to you.  ‚ÄúGreen Noise‚Äù is a camp (photos are presented in the article), which is located in a picturesque area.  Amazing views delight the eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green noise, camp, photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26316/607406.jpg" width="600"></div>
