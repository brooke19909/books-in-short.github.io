Especially if they knit for their children.  The latest and rather unusual idea was the Marshmallow booties.  They look like a work of art.  Therefore, many novice craftswomen do not dare to undertake the implementation of this product.  However, in the master class presented below, we will explain the technology in detail and prove that it is quite accessible even to those who are just starting to learn the basics of knitting. </p><h2>  Yarn Features </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen note that the beauty of the product largely depends on the used knitting threads.  Therefore, at the preparatory stage, it is important to take the choice of material seriously.  It is best to give preference to children's yarn.  Then it will be possible not to worry that the baby will be uncomfortable in booties or contact with delicate skin will cause allergies.  When choosing a color, you can safely rely on your own taste.  But at the same time, you should not wear your baby in dark and gloomy shoes.  In addition, it is important to note that for knitting booties "Marshmallows" you will need yarn in two colors.  In this case, you can take a completely different combination.  In a pinch, use a white skein and any bright one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="marshmallow booties description" class="if uuid-2997512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997512.jpg"></div><h2>  The subtleties of buying a tool </h2><p>  Knitters, long engaged in their favorite business, have already managed to determine for themselves the best knitting needles.  But beginners need a hint when choosing a tool.  Otherwise, the creative process can turn into a real nightmare.  Experienced needlewomen recommend for those who like to tighten their loops to opt for metal knitting needles.  Those who knit very weakly love stretching loops, it is better to choose wooden ones.  And booties "Marshmallows" can be knitted with both circular knitting needles and hosiery.  The size of the tool is determined, focusing on the selected yarn.  Professionals advise knitting equal to the thickness of the yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Measurement Rules </h2><p>  So that the baby was comfortable wearing ready-made shoes, it is necessary to measure his leg before knitting.  This requires: </p><ol><li>  Take a tape measure, a sticker and a simple pencil. </li><li>  Remove shoes, socks, etc. from the children's foot.  Otherwise, the obtained parameters will be inaccurate. </li><li>  Measure the length of the sole from the thumb to the heel. </li><li>  Then the width of the sole in the widest part of the foot. </li><li>  Fix both parameters on paper. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="marshmallow booties measurements" class="if uuid-2997500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997500.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the Zephyro booties can be determined by eye or measured from the heel to the base of the lower leg and multiplied by two.  Also, if desired, you can measure the girth of the base of the leg. </p><h2>  Patterns used for knitting shoes. </h2><p>  As we noted earlier, booties of this model look very unusual and original.  However, their implementation does not require special knowledge.  After all, the patterns of which they consist belong to the base.  The basis is a garter stitch.  It includes only facial loops knitted in each row.  The bow is the highlight of the booties, reminiscent of hosiery.  After all, it also represents a series of front and back rows.  We will consider the technology in more detail a bit later. </p><h2>  Calculation of the sizes of the conceived product </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="marshmallow booties features" class="if uuid-2997533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997533.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting booties "Marshmallows" with needles is a pleasure.  Because they are carried out with a smooth cloth, without increases and decreases, without tying out complex parts.  Therefore, as soon as they appeared, they immediately liked a huge number of knitters.  However, in order not to be mistaken with the size of the idea, it is important to correctly apply the measurements taken.  To do this, prepare a sample of scarf knitting - a square with a side of 10 cm. We count the number of loops, divide by 10 and multiply by the height of the booties.  Find out how many loops you need to dial.  Then we multiply the same quotient by the width of the foot.  So many loops are required for knitting the bow.  Now it remains to calculate the number of rows that need to be knitted to get booties of the intended size.  To do this, we count the rows in the sample and divide by 10. After we multiply by two foot lengths. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bringing Ideas to Life </h2><p>  Having dealt with the preparatory phase, we knit the Marshmallows Bootees according to the description proposed below.  We start with a set of loops.  Recall that their number is equal to two heights of booties.  Use the thread of the main color and leave the initial tail of medium length.  We will later sew the finished product to them.  After knitting 2/3 of the required length of the garter stitch.  That is, in the front and back loops we knit the front loops.  Most importantly, stopping is important by knitting an odd row.  In the even we close the extra loops.  And then we work with those that are equal to the width of the foot. </p><h2>  Knitting the bow of the product </h2><div class="photo" data-original="deborahnormansoprano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marshmallow booties step by step" class="if uuid-2997526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997526.jpg"></div><p>  Earlier, we noted that the highlight of the booties of the studied model is their sock.  To complete this part of the Marshmallow booties with knitting needles, the description is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We take the second color yarn. </li><li>  We knit the first and third row with facial loops, the second and fourth - purl. </li><li>  We use the main thread again. </li><li>  We knit the fifth and seventh row on the wrong side, the sixth and eighth - front. </li><li>  We tie the remaining 1/3 of the total length.  Roughly, six stripes of each color should be obtained.  But in any case, you need to finish with the main color. </li><li>  Next, take a white thread.  We knit a number of facial, the next - purl, and again facial. </li><li>  Thus, we get 6 whole strips and one unfinished. </li><li>  We cut off the additional thread, leaving a large ponytail. </li><li>  We put it in a sewing needle. </li><li>  Turn the booties inside out and fold the main part in half. </li><li>  Without removing the loops from the knitting needle, we sew the main part and the nasal suture "loop into the loop". </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="loop in loop booties marshmallows" class="if uuid-2997507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997507.jpg"></div><p>  The result is the last untied row, and the product closes in a ring.  That is, we manage to make marshmallow booties without a seam. </p><h2>  Final assembly </h2><p>  If the reader has reached this stage, he can safely put the knitting needles to the side.  They will no longer be useful.  Next, we have to work with a needle.  We put in the initial tip of the thread.  Then we pass a needle into each loop of the lower edge of the bow.  We tighten the canvas and fix it well.  After the same thread we sew the sole.  The bottom of the booties is ready!  Now, acting on the described technology, we collect the upper part of the bow.  To hide the assembly, we decorate booties with bows, beads or other decorative elements.  At the end, carefully wrap the side to give the product even more charm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit marshmallow booties with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2997534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997534.jpg"></div><h2>  Marshmallow booties with sole </h2><p>  If desired, you can associate a different model of the studied product.  To do this, you need to study the following master class: </p><ol><li>  It starts with a set of loops.  The number of which is equal to the girth of the base of the tibia. </li><li>  Next, we knit with solid facial loops. </li><li>  The result should be a canvas equal to the height of the booties. </li><li>  Now we have to tie the sole.  In the center of the canvas, we select as many loops as necessary to complete the desired part. </li><li>  And we knit a rectangle, moving back and forth.  We knit one last loop of each row together with the one that is located on the side wall.  Thus, we can tie out the sole and attach the sides of the booties to it without using needles. </li><li>  We divide the sole into two parts and fix the half with a pin. </li><li>  Using a hook, knit the loops on half of the side of the booties.  And add them to the rest. </li><li>  We knit the bow of the product, based on the instructions proposed earlier. </li><li>  Then we sew this part to the sole and half of the side wall. </li><li>  We decorate finished products at our own request. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="marshmallow booties recommendations" class="if uuid-2997522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2997522.jpg"></div><p>  This concludes our master class.  We hope that it will help beginners to knit the Marshmallow booties without seams with knitting needles.  Good luck! </p>
