Many people liked the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Republic of Adygea for relaxation.  Hotels and recreation centers, which are presented in this article, will allow you to forget about all domestic problems and just enjoy the moments of peace. </p><h2>  "Farm" </h2><p>  Among a considerable number of recreation centers in Adygea, it is worth highlighting ‚ÄúKhutorok‚Äù - a place in which each guest can feel special.  The first thing worth noting is its convenient location.  It is located only 40 kilometers from the capital of the republic - Maykop.  This corner is suitable for a variety of guests, whether it be large families, friendly companies or couples in love.  At the same time in the recreation center "Farm" can accommodate about forty people.
