Many have <span>expensive things,</span> sheepskin coats and fur coats, suits and dresses that cannot be washed in a regular machine.  However, giving things to specialists, there is always a chance to run into dishonest work.  And when you get your things not perfectly clean, but, on the contrary, in stripes and divorces, you still need to prove that they were not there.  Therefore, be sure to make inquiries. </p><p>  Today in the field of our attention was the dry cleaning "Chanterelle".  Most of the reviews emphasize that this is a reliable organization where they carefully treat each incoming product.  Therefore, we decided to tell the reader more about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574285.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Time-tested quality </h2><p>  Against the background of companies that have just entered the market and begin to offer their services, she looks very respectable.  The fact is that the ‚ÄúChanterelle‚Äù dry-cleaner, the reviews of which we will analyze in detail below, has been operating on the market since 1997.  The company was one of the first to open points and express workshops that meet international standards.  Their extremely convenient location in the largest shopping and business centers of Moscow ensured an influx of customers and a rapid increase in popularity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews moscow" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574281.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment and staff </h2><p>  This is the most important thing a client should take an interest in when he needs to give expensive things for cleaning.  After all, an ordinary laundry is not able to provide proper care for capricious fabrics, leather and fur.  And in this regard, in a favorable light, we see the dry cleaning "Chanterelle".  Feedback from regular customers suggests that when you come here for the first time, you immediately feel that this is a serious company that values ‚Äã‚Äãthe time and money of its customers.  There is enough space around - perfect cleanliness, a large reception table allows you to easily inspect the thing that needs to be cleaned. </p><p>  The work of employees is another important point.  All of them are professionals, know everything about fabrics and furs and can give a full consultation to the client.  Therefore, if in doubt, tell the dry cleaner what changes you want to see.  He, in turn, will share with you his vision of the situation.  Because not every stain can be removed without a trace, and if you come unprepared for a thing, you can be very disappointed. </p><p>  So, all dry cleaning workshops are equipped with the latest European equipment.  This acts as a certain guarantee that an ideal result will be achieved.  The second step to achieve sparkling cleanliness without harming the products is the use of the best Western cleaning products.  These are powders and stain removers, dry cleaning and glossing products, that is, an entire arsenal of products that helps to achieve ideal results with a minimum of effort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle employee reviews" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574274.jpg" width="520"></div>

Reviews of regular customers indicate that it keeps pace with the times, and since the time of their first visit to the company has changed a lot for the better.  Indeed, if you had to spend a lot of time on the road before, now in the developed network there are 15 express workshops that are located throughout the city. </p><p>  In 2001, the company was one of the first to open a workshop with the latest equipment, which at that time had no analogues in Russia.  It works on a hydrocarbon solvent.  This allows for gentle cleaning of exclusive clothing.  Since then, dry cleaning "Fox" has become even more popular.  <span>The reviews (Moscow</span> is a metropolis spoiled by offers) suggest that it is here that you can appreciate the wide range of services and feel the highest quality of service, as well as the professionalism of employees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Modern technologies </h2><p>  Apparently, the most advanced in the city is the dry cleaning ‚ÄúChanterelle.  Employee reviews emphasize that each of their ordinary employees is subordinate to one of the technologists who train and observe the correctness of the work.  In addition, professional technologists are constantly introducing new methods of high-quality cleaning of products with minimal damage to the fabric.  These are the famous Alpen Clean, Winter Shine and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 2012, a new surprise awaited visitors.  A new workshop was opened and the latest equipment was installed, which works according to the safest technology in the world, which is called GreenEarth, and in addition, meets all environmental requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews russia" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services and prices </h2><p>  And now I want to say a few words about how accessible for the average Russian is the dry cleaning "Lysychka".  Reviews (Russia is a country with a harsh climate, where sheepskin coats and fur coats are not a luxury but a necessity) emphasize that only professionals can tidy their outer clothing, do it delicately enough to maintain its pristine appearance.  The organization provides a wide range of dry cleaning services, starting with expensive furs, leather and sheepskin coats and fabrics, and ending with individual washing of underwear. </p><p>  Putting in order a short fur coat made of faux fur will cost you 1,500 rubles.  A similar fur coat from natural fur will require costs from 3000 to 5000 rubles for a full cleaning.  It is worth replacing that after it the product will take its original form.  Additionally, a specialist can process it from moths, this will add 15% to the cost of services. </p><p>  If we consider leather products, then here the cost can also differ markedly.  Cleaning a sheepskin coat - from 3,000 to 4,000 rubles, and a vest or skirt - 1,600. Softening leather fabric is an additional service, for which you will have to pay 30% of the cost of services.  Restoring film coating is the most expensive service, and adds 40% of the size of the check. </p><p>  Based on this, it can be said that the Lysichka dry cleaning offers its customers average and quite affordable prices.  The reviews (Russia, Moscow are accustomed to impressive amounts for quality service) emphasize that, despite a democratic pricing policy, the quality of work performed remains at its highest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews Russia Moscow" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574271.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Free services </h2><p>  Customers are pleasantly surprised that the reception of a technologist in the hall is completely free.  You will be met by a competent specialist who will hold a consultation, examine things and tell you how you can correct the situation within the framework of this dry cleaning.  In addition, tinting and applying water-repellent impregnation to leather and suede products is completely free of charge.  Water- <span>repellent impregnation</span> on ski suits is also free of charge. </p><h2>  How to find </h2><p>  As we have already said, there are several dozen places in the city where the Chanterelle dry cleaning is located.  The reviews (you can choose the address from the list below) indicate that it is very convenient, since you do not need to carry heavy clothing across the city after a long winter. </p><ul><li>  Shopping center "Klyuchevoy", located at: st.  <span>Borisov Ponds,</span> d.6. </li><li>  Shopping center "Zig-Zag", st.  Lobnenskaya, 4a, 2nd floor. </li><li>  Shopping center "Novinsky".  It is located on Novinsky Boulevard, 31, basement. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there are about a dozen points that are scattered throughout the capital.  Even if you live far from the center, you will find your own dry cleaning ‚ÄúChanterelle‚Äù.  The reviews (Butovo, for example, is located quite far from the center, but there is also a branch here: Dmitry Donskoy Boulevard, 8) thank the administrators for such a developed network with excellent conditions for customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dry cleaning chanterelle reviews butovo" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1574268.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  A large network of dry cleaners "Chanterelle" is growing and developing every day.  Due to the extremely convenient free catering service, it is becoming more and more easy to use its offers.  On any day of the week, from 9 am to 9 pm, an employee will come to your home or office and pick up things that need cleaning.  In the city, the minimum order amount for free delivery should be 1000 rubles.  If you need to leave the MKAD, then the cost of the order should already be from 1500 to 2000 rubles, depending on the degree of remoteness of the object. </p>
