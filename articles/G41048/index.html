What is the population of Vladivostok for 2014?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Vladivostok is an important administrative, strategic and economic center of the Primorsky Territory.  It houses one of the main <span>ports of Russia</span> in the Far East.  In terms of cargo turnover, it is the fourth in the country.  Also, the city is considered the final destination of the well <span>-</span> known <span>Trans-Siberian Railway.</span>  On the coast of Vladivostok is the main base of the Russian Pacific Fleet. </p><h2>  History of nationality </h2><p>  In ancient times, on the territory of the modern city there was a small state called Bohai.  The locals were Khitan.  Then the territory passed into the possession of the Jurchen tribes.  In the 8th century AD  e.  an Asian state was formed here, the name of which in translation meant "Eastern Xia."  However, already in the middle of the 13th century, the settlements of the Jurchen were destroyed.  The blame was the numerous attacks of the Mongols, as a result of which the territory came to complete desolation. </p><p>  For several decades no one lived here, but gradually the region began to fill with nomadic peoples.  At the end of the 13th century, the city, whose name is today Vladivostok, had a population of thousands.  The main ethnic groups were Han Chinese and Manchu.  They populated the southern region of Primorye. </p><p>  The city received its official name in 1860.  A Siberian flotilla landed in the <span>Golden Horn Bay</span> to establish a strategic post.  The operation was commanded by Captain Alexei Shefner.  It was he who named the port in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan Vladivostok. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladivostok population" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/924416.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the 1930s, the city served as a transit point on the route for the transfer of large loads and prisoners.  At that time, the local transit camp was very famous, where all those objectionable to the Soviet regime were behind bars.  Among these were the poet Mandelstam, and the <span>academician Korolev,</span> and the writer Ginzburg, and many other popular figures.  In the early 1940s, a correctional camp called Vladlag was based near the Second River station.  Here, the prisoners were engaged in logging and construction.  By capacity Vladlag was not equal throughout the country.  It could simultaneously contain up to 56 thousand people.

Its borders were open only to official delegations.  Since January 1992, all foreigners were free to visit the region at any time.  Immediately after Yeltsin signed the corresponding decree, the city‚Äôs population rapidly increased.  Vladivostok has become an international center.  Across the border, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemigrants poured into the Soviet Union.  Most of them were from China and neighboring countries. </p><p>  <span>The collapse of the USSR</span> affected the economic side of the city extremely negatively.  Along with this, the standard of living of local residents fell.  The result was a <span>demographic crisis.</span>  Fertility has dropped tenfold.  In the late 1990s, young and able-bodied people quickly left the country in search of a better life.  The main points of urban migration were China and Kazakhstan. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the crisis did not diminish the strategic importance of Vladivostok.  It remained one of the main trade and transport centers of the country.  The improvement of the economic and social situation was outlined only towards the beginning of the new millennium.  The peak of the heyday of the city is 2012. </p><h2>  Administrative division </h2><p>  The municipality today includes Vladivostok itself, as well as the surrounding villages, such as Trudovoye, Beregovoye, Popova and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the city, it is divided into several areas.  Each has its own history and economic structure.  There are 5 administrative districts in Vladivostok: Pervomaisky, Leninsky, Sovetsky, Pervorechensky and Frunze. </p>

    <p>  The <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãis</span> headed <span>by the Head of the</span> Administration, which forms decrees and orders based on the laws of Primorsky Krai and the Russian Federation.  The structure of municipal authorities also includes the local Duma and branch executive bodies. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  One of the fastest growing cities in Russia in recent years is considered to be just Vladivostok.  The population here has grown 6 times since the 1920s.  The first census in the area was conducted at the end of the 19th century.  Vladivostok, whose population was gradually growing, numbered about 29 thousand people.  By the 1920s, similar indicators amounted to about 90 thousand inhabitants. </p><p>  With each subsequent decade, the demographic component became better.  In 1931, Vladivostok, whose population varied within 140 thousand people, was one of the most progressive cities in the eastern part of the RSFSR.  After 25 years, the number doubled.  The city crossed the border of 300 thousand citizens in the early 1960s.  Positive dynamics continued until the early 1990s.  The consequences of the collapse of the USSR, Vladivostok, whose population at that time was about 645 thousand people, felt in the first months. </p>

    <p>  The economic crisis that swept all of Russia and other post-Soviet countries negatively affected the size of the Primorsky Territory.  So, over the next 10 years, Vladivostok has become almost 10% empty.  The situation began to level off only by 2010.  In 2013, the number was just over 600 thousand people. </p><h2>  Demographic component </h2><p>  On average, the population of Vladivostok is replenished by 4000 inhabitants annually.  Most of the newly made townspeople are migrants from the Asian half of the continent.  With regard to fertility, it amounts to slightly less than 4% of the total number of citizens.  In turn, mortality over the past few years has been at the level of 3.5%.  In 2013, the number of newborns for the first time after the collapse of the USSR exceeded the number of deaths.  Every year in the city from 6 to 7 thousand children are born. </p><p>  The migration balance also develops positively.  The whole blame for the increase in the level of comfort of life.  Each year, the city‚Äôs authorities invest huge amounts of money on the development of healthcare, the economy, the housing sector and social construction.  Over the past couple of years, more than 50 thousand migrants have come to the city.  At the same time, Vladivostok left 20% less. </p><h2>  The population of Vladivostok for 2014 </h2><p>  For this period, the number of cities increased by 1.4 thousand citizens.  This is far from a record result, but positive dynamics continues.  The total population of Vladivostok for 2014 is about 603 thousand people. </p>
