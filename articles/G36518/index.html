    <p>  At the age of 17, Mikhail Efremov joined the army.  He began a volunteer service in an infantry regiment.  Two years later, with the rank of ensign, he participated in the famous breakthrough under the command of Brusilov.  Mikhail joined the Red Army in 1918.  The hero of the <span>Great Patriotic War</span> gained fame thanks to armored vehicles.  Due to the fact that the Red Army did not have armored trains with good equipment, Mikhail decided to create them independently using improvised means. </p><p>  Mikhail Efremov met the Great Patriotic War at the head of the 21st Army.  Under his leadership, the soldiers restrained enemy troops on the Dnieper, defended Gomel.  Not letting the Nazis go to the rear of the Southwestern Front.  The beginning of World War II, Mikhail Efremov met, leading the 33rd Army.  At this time, he participated in the defense of Moscow and in the subsequent counterattack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In early February, the strike group, commanded by Mikhail Efremov, made a breach in the enemy‚Äôs defense and went to Vyazma.  However, the soldiers were cut off from the main forces and surrounded.  For two months, the soldiers raided the rear of the Germans, destroyed enemy soldiers and military equipment.  And when the cartridges with food ran out, Mikhail Efremov decided to break through to his people, asking on the radio about the organization of the corridor. </p><p>  But the hero of <span>World War II</span> could not do this.  The Germans noticed the movement and defeated the strike group of Efremov.  Michael himself, in order not to be captured, shot himself.  He was buried by the Germans in the village of Slobodka with all military honors. </p><p>  In 1996, persistent veterans and search engines ensured that Efremov was awarded the title Hero of Russia. </p><h2>  In honor of the feat of Gastello </h2>

    <p>  What other heroes of the Great Patriotic War were forgotten?  In 1941, a DB-3F bomber flew from the runway of the airfield, which was near Smolensk.  Alexander Maslov, namely he was flying a combat aircraft, was given the task of eliminating the enemy column moving along the Molodechno-Radoshkovichi road.  The plane was hit by enemy anti-aircraft guns, the crew was declared missing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A few years later, namely in 1951, in order to honor the memory of the famous bomber Nikolai Gastello, who had rammed on the same highway, it was decided to transfer the remains of the crew to the village of Radoshkovichi, in the central square.  During the exhumation, they found a medallion belonging to Sergeant Grigory Reutov, who was a gunner in the crew of Maslov. </p><p>  They did not begin to change historiography, however, the crew began to be listed not as missing, but perished.  The heroes of the Great Patriotic War and their exploits were recognized in 1996.  It was in this year that the entire Maslov crew received the corresponding rank. </p><h2>  The pilot whose name was forgotten </h2><p>  The exploits of the heroes of the Great Patriotic War will remain in our hearts forever.  However, not all heroic acts are remembered. </p><p>  Peter Eremeev was considered an experienced pilot.  He received his <span>order of the Red Banner</span> for repelling several German attacks in one night.  Having shot down several Junkers, Peter was wounded.  However, after bandaging the wound, within a few minutes he again flew on another plane to repulse the enemy attack.  And a month after this memorable night, they accomplished a feat. </p><p>  On the night of July 28, Yeremeyev was tasked with patrolling the airspace over Novo-Petrovsky.  It was at this time that he noticed the enemy bomber, which was going to Moscow.  Peter hit him in the tail and started shooting.  The enemy left to the right, while the Soviet pilot lost it.  However, he was immediately noticed by another bomber, who was leaving for the West.  Walking close to him, Yeremeyev pressed the trigger.  But the shooting was never opened, since the cartridges ran out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Without thinking for a long time, Peter got a screw into the tail of a German plane.  The fighter, turning over, began to fall apart.  However, Yeremeyev escaped by jumping with a parachute.  For this feat they wanted to hand him the <span>Order of Lenin.</span>  However, they did not have time to do this.  On the night of August 7 near <span>Moscow, the feat</span> was repeated by Viktor Talalikhin.  It was his name that was inscribed in the official annals. </p><p>  But the heroes of the Great Patriotic War and their exploits will never be forgotten.  This was proved by Alexey Tolstoy.  He wrote an essay entitled "Taran", in which he described the feat of Peter. </p><h2>  Only in 2010 he was recognized as a hero </h2><p>  In the Volgograd region there is a monument on which are written the names of the Red Army soldiers who died in these parts.  All of them are heroes of the Great Patriotic War, and their exploits will forever remain in history.  The name Maxim Passar appears on that monument.  The corresponding title was awarded to him only in 2010.  And it should be noted that he fully deserved it. </p>

    <p>  He was born in the Khabarovsk Territory.  The hereditary hunter has become one of the best among snipers.  He showed himself in the <span>battle of Stalingrad.</span>  By 1943, he had destroyed about 237 Nazis.  The Germans established a significant reward for the head of a well-aimed Nanai.  He was hunted by enemy snipers. </p><p>  He accomplished his feat at the very beginning of 1943.  In order to free the village of Peschanka from enemy soldiers, it was necessary to get rid of two German machine guns first.  They were well fortified on the flanks.  And it was Maxim Passar who was supposed to do this.  For 100 meters to the firing points Maxim opened fire and destroyed the calculations.  However, he failed to survive.  The hero was covered by enemy artillery fire. </p><h2>  Minor heroes </h2><p>  All of the above heroes of the Great Patriotic War and their exploits were forgotten.  However, all of them must be remembered.  They did everything possible to bring Victory Day closer.  However, not only adults managed to prove themselves.  There are also heroes who are not even 18 years old.  And it is about them that we will go further. </p><p>  Along with adults, tens of thousands of teenagers participated in the hostilities.  They, like adults, died, received orders and medals.  The images of some were taken for Soviet propaganda.  All of them are heroes of the Great Patriotic War, and their exploits have been preserved in numerous stories.  However, five teenagers who have received the appropriate title should be distinguished. </p><h2>  Not wanting to surrender, blew himself up with enemy soldiers </h2>

    <p>  Marat Kazei was born in 1929.  It happened in the village of Stankovo.  Before the war, he managed to finish only four classes.  Parents were recognized as "enemies of the people."  However, despite this, Marat‚Äôs mother began to hide partisans in her home in 1941.  For which she was killed by the Germans.  Marat and his sister went to the partisans. </p><p>  Marat Kazei constantly went to reconnaissance, took part in numerous raids, and undermined echelons.  He received the medal "For Courage" in 1943.  He managed to raise his comrades to attack and break through the ring of enemies.  At the same time, Marat was wounded. </p><p>  Talking about the exploits of the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, it is worth saying that the 14-year-old soldier died in 1944.  This happened during the next task.  Returning from intelligence, he and his commander were fired upon by the Germans.  The commander died immediately, and Marat began to shoot back.  He had nowhere to go.  And there was no possibility as such, since he was wounded in the arm.  Until the cartridges ran out, he held the defense.  Then he took two grenades.  He threw one at once, and held the second until the Germans approached.  Marat blew himself up, killing several more opponents in this way. </p><p>  Marat Kazei was recognized as a Hero in 1965.  The minor heroes of the Great Patriotic War and their exploits, stories of which are widespread in a fairly large number, will remain in memory for a long time. </p><h2>  Heroic deeds of a 14-year-old guy </h2><p>  The partisan reconnaissance Valya was born in the village of Khmelevka.  It happened in 1930.  Before the capture of the village by the Germans, he graduated from only 5 classes.  After that, he began to collect weapons and ammunition.  He passed them to the partisans. </p><p>  Since 1942, he became a partisan scout.  In the fall he was given the task of destroying the chief of the field gendarmerie.  The task was completed.  Valya, together with several of his peers, blew up two enemy vehicles, killing seven soldiers and the head, Franz Koenig himself.  About 30 people were injured. </p><p>  In 1943, he was engaged in reconnaissance of the location of the underground telephone cable, which was subsequently successfully undermined.  Valya also took part in the destruction of several trains and warehouses.  In the same year, while on duty, the young hero noticed punishers who decided to raid.  Destroying the enemy officer, Valya raised the alarm.  Thanks to this, the partisans prepared for battle. </p>

    <p>  He died in 1944 after the battle for the city of Izyaslav.  In that battle, a young warrior was mortally wounded.  The title of hero was received by him in 1958. </p><h2>  Slightly lacked until 17 years old </h2><p>  What other heroes of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 should be mentioned?  Future Scout Lenya Golikov was born in 1926.  From the very beginning of the war, having obtained a rifle, he went into the partisans.  Under the guise of a beggar, a guy went around the villages, collecting data about the enemy.  He passed all the information to the partisans. </p><p>  The guy joined the detachment in 1942.  Over his entire military career he took part in 27 operations, destroyed about 78 enemy soldiers, blew up several bridges (railway and highway), blew up about 9 vehicles with ammunition.  It was Lenya Golikov who blew up the car in which Major General Richard Witz was driving.  All his merits are fully listed in the award sheet. </p><p>  These are such minor heroes of the Great Patriotic War and their exploits.  Children sometimes performed such feats that adults did not always have the courage to do.  It was decided to award Lena Golikov with the Golden Star medal and the title of Hero.  However, he could not get them.  In 1943, the military detachment, in which Lenya was a member, was surrounded.  Out of the environment, only a few people.  And Leni was not among them.  He was killed on January 24, 1943.  Until the age of 17, the guy never lived. </p><h2>  Killed through the fault of a traitor </h2>

    <p>  Heroes of World War II rarely recalled themselves.  And their exploits, photos, images remained in the memory of many people.  Sasha Chekalin is one of those.  He was born in 1925.
