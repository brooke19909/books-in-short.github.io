    <p>  In the evenings, animated events are organized on site for adults. </p><h2>  What to do with children </h2><p>  Hotel Joya Park 4 * (Bulgaria) is designed for tourists of different categories.  If you come with the kids, you will be pleased that the hotel has a children's pool.  A corner with a slide and a swing is equipped, where children can have fun and actively spend time.  There is no children's animation, but for vacationers of any age, there is a huge water park nearby with many slides, attractions and entertainment that vacationers of the Joya Park 4 * hotel will definitely like.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  admiring tourists will leave no doubt that everything is thought out here for a good and eventful leisure.  Inside the water park there is an artificial river, waterfalls, the ruins of the ancient city (artificial).  Children fall into the wonderful world of adventure and have fun from the heart. </p><h2>  How to diversify your vacation </h2><p>  Of course, being constantly in the hotel Joya Park 4 * (Golden Sands) is not interesting.  I would like to explore the surroundings and make the rest complete.  Especially for lovers of active pastime, there is a horse base nearby, where you can take a horse ride and even book a couple of interesting individual lessons.  Adults can go on a boat trip, because the prestigious yacht club with a marina is very nearby. </p><p>  The resort is also known for its thermal springs.  Modern balneocenters function here, where they offer anti-stress programs, mud therapy, aromatherapy and apitherapy sessions (treatment with honey and other beekeeping products). </p><h2>  Hotel Joya Park 4 * (Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  In general, hotel accommodation leaves a good impression.  The hotel was built relatively recently, the furniture is modern, the area is closed from prying visitors, comfortable and clean.  An additional advantage, according to guests, can be called an amazing garden, where it is nice to take a walk after a hearty lunch.  The road to the sea takes no more than 5 minutes, and this is a great opportunity to walk a bit and enjoy the picturesque surroundings.  It is important to know that during the active season (from the first week of May to the end of September) hotel rooms are reserved for at least 3 days. </p><p>  Tourists note the excellent service and amazing pool of Joya Park Complex 4 * hotel.  The reviews are excellent, because the staff makes sure that the water here is always clean, and in the evenings include beautiful lighting, which adds comfort.  Agree, for an inexpensive hotel of this level this is a very important advantage.  True, the pool only works in the warm season. </p><p>  Check-in is quick and the whole staff is friendly and welcoming.  It is very convenient that you can use MasterCard, Visa cards for calculation.  Among vacationers there are many foreigners, mainly Americans and Germans.  Book rooms better in advance.  What is nice: no commission is charged.  The staff speaks English and <span>Bulgarian.</span>  However, Russian-speaking tourists say that there are no problems with understanding and communication.  If necessary, you can call a doctor, but his services are paid extra. </p><p>  If you need to cancel the reservation and the previously made prepayment, the rules here differ depending on the ordered room.  Find out more from the hotel staff. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The main attraction in the vicinity is the ancient <span>Aladzha monastery</span> , which functioned until the 18th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joya park 4 reviews" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/522420.jpg" width="320"></div>  Local monks led a harsh lifestyle, devoid of all worldly pleasures.  The cells are carved directly in the limestone rock, inside there is a wooden staircase.  The monastery received its name (‚ÄúAladzha‚Äù from Turkish as ‚Äúmotley‚Äù) because of the colorful wall paintings, which today can hardly be seen.  The distance from the resort center is almost 2 km.
