In every city you can smell the antiquity, see the magnificent buildings and monuments, learn a lot of interesting facts.  One of such keepers of the Russian stone annals is a small town located in the Moscow region - Borovsk.  The sights of this settlement are churches and temples, historical and modern <span>architectural structures,</span> monuments and museums.  The city got its name thanks to the pine forest, which surrounds it from almost all sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Borovsk" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233349.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Before you start sightseeing in Borovsk, I want to say a few words about the history of the city.  The first mention of it can be read in a letter of 1358 by Ivan II the Red, although historians believe that the settlement appeared much earlier, and Ryazan princes were supposedly its founders.  Around the first half of the 14th century, a border fortress with wooden walls and six towers was erected on the Protva River, which was destroyed by fire in 1634.  Today, a small mound with low residential buildings remains on this site.  Here stands the city school and administration building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Continuing to explore the sights of Borovsk, we move on to the old part of the city, located on the right bank of the Protva.  On a rectangular square, shopping arcades have been partially preserved.  Nearby is the Annunciation Cathedral, built in the 18th century on the site of the wooden church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  Over the course of its existence, the building was repeatedly reconstructed, as a result of which the building has long lost its original appearance.  Of particular interest is the iconostasis of the temple.  Now in this building is a <span>wooden sculpture of</span> Nicholas the Wonderworker, a <span>sculpture made of wood from</span> Paraskeva Friday and the icon of St. Paphnutius of Borovsky the Wonderworker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Borovsk attractions" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233351.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Streets depart from the square, the architecture of which is dominated by stone merchant mansions.  Most of them are located on Moskovskaya Street.  Usually they continue to visit such sights of Borovsk as temples of the era of classicism, for example the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on the Highlands.  The construction of the temple ended in the 19th century.  It is a one-headed one-story church with a low bell tower and rises at the western edge of the central square.  Passing to the outskirts of the city, you can see the church of Boris and Gleb.  The temple building was built in 1704.  It has gilded domes that are clearly visible from the surrounding areas of the square.  The beauty of this building delights all tourists.  The temple has a three-part structure, has five chapters and is painted red.  In the decoration of the facade, white cornices and decorations in the form of arches were used for contrast.  A map of Borovsk with sights will help to more accurately navigate the location of a particular ancient monument.  Among the majestic structures, Borovsky Pafnutev Monastery, located on the banks of the Protva River, 3 km from the city, should be noted.  Its foundation dates back to 1444.  During its existence, something has been constantly being built here, strengthened.  Today this building is a real gem of Russian architecture.  The list of temples and monasteries can be supplemented with the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, built of white stone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Borovsk map with landmarks" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233352.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Borovsk sights also include more modern buildings and sculptures.  The most visited monument is considered to be K.E. Tsiolkovsky, who worked for 12 years at the Borovsky district school.  It will be interesting to visit the museum of the scientist who laid the foundation for modern astronautics, which is located in one of the apartments associated with his life and work.  Another unique monument is the chapel, the appearance of which is associated with the life of the Sokovnins sisters.  <span>The internal space of</span> this structure is divided into two parts: upper and underground.  Steep stairs lead to the dungeon.  Here you can see the tombstone over the grave of ascetics. </p>
