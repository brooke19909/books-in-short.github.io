Most people are only familiar with how the figures move, their names and the order in which they stand.  But chess is one of the most interesting games.  It is difficult to guess where this or that move can lead you, and who will win.  Many of those who are far from this exciting game, and novice players ask: "Is it true that professional chess players know almost all other people's moves and can predict the actions of the enemy?"  Do not be surprised, but this is true.  In chess, openings are tactics and strategies in which you can predict in advance the actions of an opponent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chess debut" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/433245.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  In chess, openings appeared more than two hundred years ago.  And in the XIX century they already became high art.  At that time, chess was a very popular game, they took pride of place among other competitions.  Then a large number of championships were held, they paid much more attention than in our time.  And the grandmasters devoted a lot of time to creating strategies that allowed them to win with a minimal amount of losses.  Imagine, long before computers appeared, it was possible to calculate a game for five, or a maximum of ten moves!  You are probably wondering about how the invention of the computer influenced the game of chess.  A huge breakthrough was made, as it became possible to calculate the most complex algorithms and tasks.  It was with the help of a computer in chess that openings helped to calculate moves even for twenty transitions.  It makes the game predictable, right?  Unfortunately, using these automatic calculations has done its job, turning the game of the mind into a mechanical one - you can foresee what your opponent will do, and you will always know what is the best way to go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white chess openings" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/433246.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Tactics today </h2><p>  It was in the twentieth century that the most active development of openings began, completely new beginnings were created.  In the second half of this century, the study of tactics essentially came down to thinking about some options that arose in familiar principles.  At the end of the century, <span>Mark Taimanov</span> said: ‚Äú... chess theory develops half-steps somewhere between 20 and 25 moves.  No new strategy, no new ideas, no new systems ... ‚Äù  Due to the fact that openings in chess have been developing for several centuries, as well as powerful computers and high-quality programs have appeared, unfortunately, tactics in itself have ceased to be the most creative part of the game.  Almost all existing options have undergone a thorough analysis.  Today, as already mentioned, the miscalculation reaches 15-20 moves, and maybe even further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chess Debuts for Beginners </h2><p>  Due to this sophistication, the requirements for the game become very serious.  Therefore, all novice players must know the main options for opening.  And a professional today is impossible to play without them.  He should have a huge set of debuts, plus also carefully study them.  Because of this, most chess players are critical of openings.  They believe that the initial stage of the party is "monstrously computerized."  Resentment is caused by the fact that in the stage of debut there is almost no place for the art of chess.  It is believed that tactics and strategies are not the most difficult thing in chess.  Most players, even beginners, thanks to the knowledge of the main openings can fight at the same level with the opponent stronger than them.  Fisher chess is called a way of avoiding the problems of studying tactics, since it is impossible to memorize options in them due to the random position of the pieces at the beginning of the game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess Debuts for Beginners" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/433248.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  But all novice players must learn openings.  Without them, they will not be of any interest to the enemy, even having certain skills.  Nowadays, chess openings are very popular, and therefore it makes no sense to think about their meaning and advantages.  That is why in order to learn how to play, you just need to study them.  And some should even be memorized - it is highly likely that you will need them on the game board. </p>
