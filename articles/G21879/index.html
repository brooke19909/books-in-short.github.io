  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a ringtone for iPhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All iPhones, like any other mobile phones, are equipped with a set of standard ringtones.  But this is precisely the essence of the concept of “standard”, which means that everyone has them.  Of course, you can simply buy a ringtone by sending SMS with a specific number.  But there is another way, more attractive: Let's talk how to make an iPhone ringtone yourself. </p><h4>  How to make a ringtone for iPhone via iTunes. </h4><p>  The standard iTunes program is the constant companion of all generations of iPhones.  It is downloaded and installed at the stage of activation of the device.  Therefore, for starters, just open it on the computer. </p><p>  1. Find the File item in the menu. </p><p>  2. Press the button "Add to Library" then add your favorite song, from which we will make a ringtone. </p><p>  3. Right-click on the "Information" tab. </p><p>  4. We find the tab “Parameters”, mark “Start” and “Stop time” there.  The gap must be determined no more than 30 seconds.  Click OK </p><p>  5. We right-click on the melody, select “Convert to ACC” - after this procedure, a section of the melody lasting 30 seconds with the same name will appear under the original song. </p><p>  6. Right-click and select "Show in Windows Exporer" from the window.  A folder will open, it should have one file weighing about 500 kB, in m4a format.  This format needs to be changed to m4r.  Check that the file name is in English.  The file location must be remembered. </p><p>  7. Go back to iTunes to remove our piece of the melody from the music folder, close the program. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  8. Open iTunes again, find “File” - “Add to Media Library”.  Select our <span>renamed file</span> in “Ringtones”. </p><p>  9. Connect the iPhone, click on the “Ringtones” tab, select the desired ringtones and click “Apply” or “Synchronize”.  If the created file is available in the Media Library, and you can’t transfer it to the phone, then most likely the problem is with the track duration.  Therefore, if the melody lasts more than 30 seconds, then you need to try to make it shorter. </p><p>  10. In the tab “Settings” - “Sounds” - “Melody” we set up our new ringtone for incoming calls (or for SMS, MMS, alarm clock - as your heart desires). </p><h4>  How to make a ringtone for iPhone using special programs (iRinger, GarageBand) </h4><p>  Previously, installing your own melody, even purchased through the iTunes Store, was very, very problematic.  Third-party developers gradually introduced their own programs that allowed you to make ringtones for iPhone on your own.  And over time, the "apple" developers made concessions.  Starting with iTunes 7.5, you can easily record even “left” ringtones on your phone, and the iLife melody tune pack is provided by default on any Mac. </p><p>  Double, we’ll take a look at how to make a ringtone for iPhone using the example of using GarageBand from iLife. </p><p>  1. Run the program, select “Ringtone for iPhone” - “Example Ringtone” in the appeared wizard. </p><p>  2. The finished ringtone created by GarageBand as a sample appears in the main window.  Delete this example with Delete. </p><p>  3. Drag the song from which we will make the melody for the phone to the GarageBand window. </p><p>  Tip: be sure to look at the right side of the program - there is a browser with excellent ready-made melodies and SMS signals. </p><p>  4. Ringtone for iPhone should not sound longer than 40 seconds.  In our program, the length of the track that you will cut out is shown by a yellow bar located immediately above the name.  The size of the strip can be increased or decreased. </p><p>  5. When our ringtone is ready, select the tab “Export” and “Send ringtone to iTunes”, then synchronize our phone with the Mac. </p><h4>  How to make a ringtone for iphone 3gs </h4><p>  For all generations of iPhones, ringtones are made exactly the same.  Therefore, try using one of the above methods. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say that manufacturers are now trying to simplify their development as much as possible, so do not be afraid that you do not have enough qualifications or knowledge to use them.  The instructions that we have offered you will be enough to try to create your own unique melody for the iPhone.  After all, it is so nice to create a ringtone with your own hands and select a phone from many others. </p>
