    <h2>  Turkey, Kemer: photos, description of the resort </h2><p>  One of the most popular resort areas - Kemer - is located in the southern part of the Turkish Republic.

In Kemer, a large area is occupied by pine forests, which makes the local climate very healthy. </p><p>  As for the beaches of Kemer, most of them are pebble.  However, some hotels brought sand to their beaches.  Nevertheless, at the entrance to the sea, pebbles are still found almost everywhere.  The sea here is very clean.  So, the bottom can be seen even at a depth of eight meters. </p><p>  Kemer Resort is a great place for a relaxing family vacation with children, and for a fun and noisy pastime for a company of youth.  So, tourists traveling to Turkey with children, most often opt for the villages of Camyuva and Kirish.  Here the beaches are small-pebble, which is important for a comfortable rest for kids.  In addition, local hotels have all the necessary infrastructure for an excellent pastime for families with children. </p><p>  If you are a fan of a calm and respectable vacation, then buy a ticket to the city of Kemer or to villages located to the south of it.

So, for example, tourists going on vacation to Alanya are forced to spend more than two hours on the road from the air harbor. </p><p>  - The presence of a wide variety of entertainment for every taste: from nightclubs, restaurants, shops to hammams, spas and sports. </p><h2>  Hotel selection and cost of living </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel in Kemer, be sure to pay attention to the fact that in the city itself most hotels have a very small territory of their own.  However, there is a large number of various shops, souvenir shops, bars, restaurants, night clubs and other entertainments.  Hotels located in resort villages, as a rule, have a large territory of their own, on which various entertainments are concentrated.  Hotel prices in Kemer vary greatly.  So, you can always find here both a budget option of housing, and choose a luxury hotel with the appropriate cost.  For example, a three-day stay in a two-star hotel "Ersa" (only breakfast included) will cost $ 170, in a three-star <span>hotel "Ilimira"</span> (all-inclusive food) - $ 185, and in a four-star hotel "Magic" - $ 200 . </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots who have been on <span>holiday in Kemer,</span> are more than happy with their vacation.  So, almost all tourists note the magnificent climate, fragrant air, in which the smell of the sea is mixed with the scent of pine trees, picturesque landscapes and a clean warm sea.  Even though most of the beaches here are pebble, this does not bother vacationers at all.  Indeed, thanks to this, the water in the sea is transparent, and it is often possible to observe schools of swimming fish.  Some tourists were lucky to see firsthand even huge sea turtles. </p><p>  The lovers of nightlife were also very pleased.  They note a large selection of entertainment venues both in Kemer and in nearby resort villages. </p>
