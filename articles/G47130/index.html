An undoubted advantage is the proximity to the beach - just a few minutes of leisurely walking, and you can already enjoy the soft sand under your feet and the gentle waves of the sea. </p><p>  There are no special entertainments on the territory of the hotel, but for most tourists this is not required.  There are all amenities for a comfortable stay, and breakfasts are always tasty and satisfying.  The hotel also has very polite and welcoming staff.  Almost everyone speaks English, so communication problems are rare.  If guests have any complaints, administrators seek to resolve everything quickly and without conflict. </p><p>  Travelers definitely recommend Rayaburi Hotel Patong 3 * hotel.  Phuket is the perfect place for a relaxing beach holiday. </p>
