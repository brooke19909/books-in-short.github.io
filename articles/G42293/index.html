GPS monitoring systems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the development of modern technologies, companies are gaining more and more technical capabilities to improve their services and increase the quality assurance of their provision.  Monitoring systems for moving objects are gaining more and more popularity and availability in the market of technical solutions.  With their help, any transport company can guarantee the safety of the delivery of goods to its customers.  They show the location of the vehicle, what stops it made, how fast the load was, and whether the route changed.  For large cities, the ability to monitor the movement of vehicles is relevant not only for corporate purposes, but also for domestic purposes.  With it, you can determine in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cork. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  A tracker is installed on the vehicle, capable of receiving signals from the <span>navigation system.</span>  Moreover, satellite signals and a global wireless network can be used.  For this, a GLONASS system, GPS or LBS module must be installed.  This tracker saves in its memory all the events occurring with the car.  At certain intervals, this information is sent to the main server or to the owner‚Äôs phone in the form of an SMS message. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  The main function of the system is to determine the exact location of the vehicle with an accuracy of 2.5 meters.  In addition, it allows you to view the history of vehicles.  More modern systems also provide voice communication with the driver, allow you to record audio of the surroundings near the car, and also report the amount of gas mileage and any deviations of the car from a given route. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Differences </h2><p>  Monitoring systems for moving objects are very similar to each other, basically their trackers are identical, but there are still important differences that distinguish different objects in the market.  Naturally, the main difference is state affiliation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moving object monitoring system" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1816641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are also various methods of operating radio frequencies.  So, for example, in GPS control systems, weak protection and stable coded CDMA access, while they are more economical and low cost.  But the GLONASS system has a secure, reliable dedicated FDMA line, but at the same time it requires more resources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="satellite monitoring of transport" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1816640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there are differences in the locations of the satellites receiving the signal.  So, Russian satellites are unchanged during the rotation of the Earth.  It uses eight satellites and three planes.  But in the case of American satellites, constant synchronization and adjustment of data is needed.  There is the operation of four satellites and six planes.  There are also differences in different latitudes and in the signal error.  For example, GPS monitoring systems can distort data from two to four meters, and the GLONASS system from three to six.  According to forecasts, such a gap will be reduced to ten centimeters by 2020. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  The best option for transport companies is to use systems that support both navigation methods.  They make it possible to make the percentage of detection accuracy of vehicles better and work even in difficult conditions of large cities with a high density of buildings affecting signals from satellites. </p><h2>  Scope of application </h2><p>  Satellite monitoring of transport is relevant for courier and service services that need to receive operational data regarding the location of couriers and cargo.  Thus, it is possible to quickly track which of the employees is closest to the office of the client of the company.  They are also needed by companies that have their own fleet, including taxi services, logistics companies, and public transport regulators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glonass system" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1816639.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <p>  With the help of monitoring systems for moving objects, you can actually track the path, calculate the most convenient and inexpensive routes and reduce the cost of shipping goods.  In addition, this will protect the company from unscrupulous employees who specifically wind up extra kilometers or drain gasoline for their needs.  It is worth considering that modern systems also allow you to control the driver.  For example, if a car drives outside a previously defined route, you can remotely shut off the engine.  There is also an option to control the ignition by tuning the car so that it will work only after sending an SMS message.  GPS monitoring systems allow you to limit the speed of the machine, thereby affecting the reduction of fuel consumption.  Many trackers are equipped with an alarm button that allows the driver to call for help in a timely manner, protecting his life and the safety of the cargo.  And the presence of voice communications significantly reduces the consumption of mobile devices. </p><h2>  Wialon System </h2><p>  The Vialon system is one of the software platforms for satellite monitoring with a web interface that is widespread in the domestic market.  With its help, vehicle control is carried out through the use of modern cloud technologies.  The monitoring system of mobile objects "Vialon" differs from its competitors in the first place by its ease of operation and comfortable interface.  You don‚Äôt need to install additional software with it, you can get data using any browser.

    <p>  The system works simultaneously with GLONASS and GPS, which significantly increases the efficiency of data display.  It perceives the most common types of maps, which allows you to quickly and efficiently create a route and track vehicles without delay.  It uses a special data storage system that reliably protects information and works in fast mode.  Using it, creating a report takes just a few seconds. </p><h2>  System "Diamond" </h2><p>  The monitoring system for moving objects "Almaz" is designed for automated control of the company's transport.  It can be used in a wide variety of fields.  In the domestic market, it is popular with logistics companies, collection services and law enforcement agencies.  It consists of equipment, dispatching software and terminals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diamond moving object monitoring system" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47218/1816637.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The monitoring system for moving objects differs from its competitors in the ability to communicate with the driver through VHF communication channels.  The terminal is independent of the connection to the power grid.  This system works not only with moving, but also with stationary objects.  Dispatcher can secretly listen to an object.  The terminal is able to work for several hours on a stand-alone battery at low temperatures.  If communication with the object is interrupted, the dispatcher will be automatically notified about this. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Satellite monitoring of transport is very relevant for many companies involved in cargo transportation and not only.  Even at the household level, control systems help fulfill daily responsibilities.  The technology market annually receives new prototypes <span>of tracking systems,</span> and the quality of their work is constantly being improved.  Now you can purchase systems of varying complexity and secure your fleet, which helps to significantly reduce company costs. </p>
