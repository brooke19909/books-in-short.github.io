It has a huge territory, but the whole life of vacationers is concentrated around Soho Square, in the area with the slightly frightening name Sharks Bay (Shark Bay).  Fifty meters from this busy place with cafes, restaurants and shopping centers, which is famous for <strong> </strong>  with its singing fountains and duty-free shops, the Island View Resort is located.  Ex <span>Sunrise Island View</span> 5 - you can still read about it on the network.  After all, it was under this name that she was known until recently.  She stands on the front page of the beach and offers tourists to relax and forget about the problems in any season and any time.  The city‚Äôs air port is not far away, and it takes no more than fifteen, at least twenty minutes, to go there.  The proximity to both the airport and the sights is one of the main attractive bonuses for tourists of this hotel.  The surrounding area itself is very safe and well-maintained. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Meals:</strong> This hotel practices the Ultra All Inclusive service system.  The guests wear bracelets, according to which they are served free of charge in all restaurants and bars of the Island View Resort hotel.  Ex Sunrise Island View Resort 5 takes pride in its main beautiful White Knight restaurant, which has a buffet mode.  But there are three very good establishments where waiters take orders and bring dishes.  These restaurants - Italian cuisine ("Trattoria"), eastern ("Fatima") and fish squash "Barracuda" - can also be visited for free, but you need to reserve a table a day at the reception.  Among other things, you can drink soft drinks and <span>non-alcoholic cocktails</span> at the Hollywood Cafe and Victoria Bar, as well as a quick snack if you are reluctant to go to the main restaurant.  It‚Äôs hard to say where the food is better - in the ‚ÄúWhite Knight‚Äôs Hall‚Äù or <span>‚Äúa la carte‚Äù</span> - but the service is everywhere up to the mark, and it causes commendable responses. </p><p>  <strong>Beach:</strong> For some reason, the name of the White Knight Beach has been fixed to the coast on which the hotel is located.  Maybe because nearby is the eponymous restaurant.  Island View Resort - ex Sunrise Island View Resort 5 - has a fenced area for swimming.  There are a lot of sunbeds and umbrellas, all of them are free.  <span>Beach towels are also given,</span> and not for money.  There are several approaches to the sea: for children (a site cleared of corals) and from the pier, immediately to the depth.  Indeed, these places are known for their amazingly beautiful underwater world off their shores, and Shark Bay in this sense is no exception: you can put on a mask and look at the fish right from the pontoon.  The hotel has pools in the form of a sea lagoon, one of them is heated.  Thus, spending time on the beach will be fabulous for lovers just to wallow and plunge into the water of the temperature of <span>fresh milk,</span> and for those who want to stare at the wonderful world of the depths. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Additional Information:</strong> Vacationers at the hotel are entertained day and evening.  The animation team organizes aerobics classes, holds sports games and competitions.  There is a separate mini-club where professionals of different ages are involved.  We can say that this is a great place where they care about the physical condition of guests - Island View Resort.  Ex Sunrise Island View Resort 5 has a fitness room and spa equipped with the latest cardio equipment, where you can relax under the experienced fingers of a massage therapist and rejuvenate in a sauna or hammam.  In case of any health problems, there is a medical office in the territory.  There is a business center with office equipment at the disposal of people who want to do business and during leisure, as well as not thinking themselves without communication and social networks. </p><p>  <strong>Reviews:</strong> Almost all vacationers noted the convenient location of the hotel in the Soho area.  This is a significant plus - go out of the hotel in the evening directly to the singing fountains, walk through the shops and generally walk the weekend dresses.  What else do people like about Island View Resort?  Ex Sunrise Island View Resort 5 is located between the same respectable Concord and Savoy, and not a construction site and a desert, as is often the case in other Egyptian resorts.  Therefore, it is very pleasant to make evening walks here.  Many positive reviews are expressed about nutrition.  Meals are compared with Turkish ‚Äúfives‚Äù, often making a choice in favor of Egyptian delights.  The dishes are varied, tasty, unlike most resort hotels with All Inclusive, where the a la carte restaurant can be visited only once, here at least every day you can go to the place you like (you just need to reserve a table in advance).  Many tourists, including young guests, were satisfied with the <span>work of the animators.</span> </p>
