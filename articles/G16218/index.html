    <p>  The GPS navigator today is a <span>multifunctional device</span> that has an accurate positioning system, so that the exact coordinates and route will be determined on the map of the area.  Almost all modern models have voice alerts, so the driver does not need to be distracted while driving.  In addition, GPS navigators for cars can have rich functionality that extends the capabilities of these accessories.  The essence of their work is as follows: </p><ul><li>  <span>The</span> GPS <span>navigation system</span> includes 24 space satellites that move in the orbits of the Earth.  They send radio signals to our planet, which are captured by ground-based devices. </li><li>  After determining the signal, the navigator is able to determine the coordinates of the car and its route. </li></ul><p>  <span>How to choose a navigator</span> to serve reliably and stably? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First: choose a card </h2><p>  Modern GPS navigators for cars are based on navigation programs.  The most popular are Navitel and Garmin.  The first program is a software designed for PDAs, communicators and car navigators of a number of brands: Navitel, Prestigio, Explay, Lexand.  The program works on the basis of detailed vector maps of cities and regions of Russia, where everything is indicated - from the metro station to the house number, which facilitates orientation in any region. </p>

That is why, instead of a stationary device, many prefer a <span>tablet with a GPS navigator</span> for a car.

    <p>  What is the best GPS navigator?  Someone focuses on prestigious and expensive devices, and someone likes practicality combined with the functionality of models.  Consider the most popular models - inexpensive and premium, to assess the differences between them.  Among the budget models - worth up to 7000 rubles - we decided to highlight the following: </p><ol><li>  Garmin Nuvi 2250. This device costs 4400 rubles, while it has all the important functions, which are quite enough on the road.  The uniqueness of the navigator is that it monitors the state of fuel, allowing you to save and refuel in a timely manner.  Without driver‚Äôs participation, the device copes with thinking over and calculating the route, taking into account even complex interchanges that can get caught on the road. </li><li>  Prestigio GeoVision 5500 BTFM HD.  For 5500 rubles you can purchase a quality and reliable Prestigio navigator.  It attracts attention with an ultra-thin body, the presence of an integrated Bluetooth module, a 5-inch display and compact dimensions.  Modern functionality is responsible for the performance of the device.  Instrument software - Navitel. </li><li>  LEXAND ST-7100 HD is another popular model.  Its cost is 6400 rubles.  Own RAM allows you to download the necessary navigation programs and update them in a timely manner.  Additional features include an audio player, photo album and FM transmitter. </li><li>  Prestigio GeoVision 5056 Navitel will be a loyal assistant to every driver who appreciates usability.  High-quality software, a 5-inch screen, three-dimensional visualization - all this distinguishes the Prestigio navigator. </li></ol><p>  Note that at an affordable cost, each navigator pleases with reliable operation. </p><h2>  Dear models </h2><p>  Among prestigious models, which on average cost from 15,000 rubles and above, Garmin brand products deserve special attention.  Every year the company releases a new product, which is characterized by more advanced functionality.  So, the Garmin NUVI 3450 model is equipped with the new Guidance 3.0 application, which allows you to remember frequently visited places and lay routes to them.  Another highlight highlighted by the Garmin GPS is the safe reading of texts when the device itself speaks the text written on the screen. </p>

    <p>  Navigator for the car TomTom Go 730 belongs to the premium class (its average cost starts from 15 000 rubles).  Its feature is in the wide screen, the latest generation GPS receiver and a set of modern functions that are ideal for the driver. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that any navigators for cars - budget and more expensive - in principle, have the basic functions needed by the driver.  And the high cost is due to additional features that are not always needed.  If you like multifunctional devices, then choose richly equipped models. </p>
