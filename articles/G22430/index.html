  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet vests - beautiful clothes in a short time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitted vests, which season already, are indispensable items in the wardrobes of fashionable women.  Especially proud are the things created by your own hands.  Knitting fishnet vests can be done either crochet or with the help of knitting needles.  Moreover, work on the replenishment of the wardrobe with knitted products does not require much effort and time. </p><p>  Crocheting vests will take several free evenings, and if there is decent experience in this work, then the lead time for the product may be reduced.  Thread consumption depends, first of all, on the thickness of the yarn and on the chosen model.  When working on a voluminous vest, no longer than the waist, it will take about 350 grams of thread of medium thickness. </p><p>  The pattern and scheme for the vest can be designed independently, taking into account personal dimensions, or use the ready-made ones that are presented on the site. <br>  The pattern for the product is optional.  Today, one of the most fashionable patterns is knitted fur, however, you can use the pattern and easier. <br>  When crocheting vests, the following rule must be observed.  If unusual fancy yarn is used, then it should be knitted with the front stitch or with a scarf.  If the product will be based on braids or a complex openwork pattern, then you need to use threads with a simpler appearance and composition.  The length of the apparel is determined independently, and depends on the chosen style and <span>personal preferences.</span> </p><p>  Crocheting vests allows you to get unique, original things.  To make the product more refined, unusual tricks are used: side seams are replaced with loops and buttons, the vest is supplemented with original patch pockets, a hood or a collar made of natural fur.  The main thing is not to overdo it or overdo it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If for the performance of sleeveless jackets with the help of knitting need not have special skill, and even beginner needlewomen can do such work, then crocheting vests requires good experience.  Using knitting needles, work can be simplified by choosing a lighter pattern and focusing on unusual material.  With the help of the hook, the main emphasis is precisely on knitting the pattern.  The production of such vests is distinguished by their delicate work, complex spider web and lace patterns. </p><p>  At the same time, crocheting of vests is performed from ordinary thin yarn - the finer the thread, the greater the attractiveness and sophistication of the product. <br>  Work can be done by knitting patterns that follow each other in a straight line, as well as by connecting separately connected openwork elements. <br>  Women's vests will look very original, the knitting of which is made from delicate details of different colors, as well as products made using fancy yarn and beads, lurex, sequins and other additions.  Thin knitting of the pattern can be combined with satin ribbons and narrow fur strips. </p><p>  The trend of the season is fur vests, not only sewn, but also crocheted.  To get an unusual original model you will need natural fur, which must be cut into narrow strips up to 10 mm wide, ordinary yarn and a hook. </p><p>  The first stage of work consists of knitting a mesh pattern; for this, two air loops and one yarn are alternated.  Openwork patterns consisting of repeating small patterns are best for knitting. <br>  Then, using a hook, fur strips are stretched into the mesh cells.  They can be threaded both vertically, diagonally, and in the horizontal direction.  The vest will look original, decorated with the interweaving of fur ribbons not over the whole product, but in a certain sequence - with intricate patterns, alternating vertical or horizontal stripes. </p><p>  The result should be a unique fashionable vest. </p>
