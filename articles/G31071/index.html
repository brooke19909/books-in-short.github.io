    <p>  For an extra fee, you can visit the spa and treat yourself to a variety of luxurious treatments, or book a masseuse in your room or pool.  Opening hours: from ten in the morning until eight in the evening.  You will surely like traditional Thai, Swedish, Oriental massage using aromatic oils, cosmetics, etc. </p><p>  One of the most common procedures is peeling of the skin of the legs with the help of small fish.  Be sure to try this method, but not on the street, but in reliable institutions.  In the hotel this service is also available. </p><h2>  Kata Sea Breeze Resort 3 *: location reviews </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews of tourists, the best thing that the hotel described in our review can boast of is its excellent location.  One of the best beaches in Kata is literally within walking distance.  It is public, for this reason sunbeds, mattresses and umbrellas must be paid.  Travelers who visited it unanimously claim that the place is magnificent: both in cleanliness and silence, and in natural beauty.  They emphasize the proximity of numerous restaurants with cuisine specializing in seafood, bars and the market.  Many people recommend not sitting still, but for a small fee, ride in a tuk-tuk (a local form of transport) to Patong Beach, where nightlife is most active. </p>

    <h2>  Kata Sea Breeze Resort 3 * <span>(Phuket):</span> room and service <span>reviews</span> </h2><p>  After analyzing the reviews of tourists, we can safely say that the hotel completely and fully justifies its three stars.  The territory, according to the guests, is very spacious, shady and very well-groomed.  Particularly pleased with the rooms on the ground floor, which have their own access to the pool.  In general, those who lived in the hotel note the courtesy and cordiality of staff who are always ready to meet the needs of customers.  The rooms, according to our compatriots, are clean, sound.  They are simple but cozy, albeit no frills, but they have everything you need for a comfortable stay, cleaning is carried out in good faith and daily. </p><p>  Guests note minor problems with wireless internet.  In the Kata Sea Breeze Resort 3 * hotel it is paid - you can just connect to it only in the lobby, but the signal is very weak.  The reviews also mention breakfast.  They are not particularly diverse, but very tasty, and you can eat here at every corner. </p>
