    <p>  Each of them has its own specifics.  So, in the case of the adjacent scheme, advanced opportunities are used for the <span>distribution of electricity</span> between industrial facilities.  It provides the highest level of reliability and economy.  The backbone scheme assumes the existence of a cable line to which distribution points and consumption receivers are connected along its entire length.  We will talk more about them in passing.  But the most interesting part of the article is the radial power supply scheme.  It is implemented by laying several cable lines.  In this case, branches are not allowed.  Each line works exclusively with one end user. </p><p>  Owing to such specifics of construction, its use is expedient in providing requests of high power.  Radial and trunk power supply circuits are the most common in industry. </p><h2>  When is it applied? </h2><p>  It makes sense to use a radial power supply scheme when power consumers are in different directions with respect to the source.  It should be noted its ease of use.  In the event of emergency outages or repair work on one <span>line, the impact</span> is only on the specific consumer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Consider a small example.  Suppose we have an enterprise that produces cars.  There are three main areas: the body, engine and all the rest need parts.  But now the time has come for a scheduled repair.  The radial power supply circuit of the body cooking workshop stops its work, and this product is not manufactured.  But engines and other components are produced as before.  Due to the ability to continue their activities, many large enterprises and companies make their choice in favor of such energy supply for their structures. </p><h2>  How are they built? </h2><p>  In the case of radial power supply schemes, two main types are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  single stage; </li><li>  two-stage. </li></ul><p>  Single-stage schemes are used to provide for large consumers, which are tightly concentrated in a certain territory.  They can also be used when you need to work with small objects that have low power distribution.  As an example, compressor and pumping stations, electric furnaces can be mentioned.  Two-stage schemes are used in cases where electricity is connected to medium and large objects in a large area.  In such cases, it is not reasonable to load the main energy consumption centers at enterprises with a significant number of small outgoing lines.  By the way, this is where the radial and trunk power supply circuits differ.  Indeed, because of such moments, many people often confuse them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  There are various nuances and aspects of the implementation of electricity supply.  One of them is the construction of a radial power scheme with a backup mechanism.  What is he like?  In this case, it is envisaged that electricity will be obtained from various power sources.  They can be either a common redundant bus or backup high-voltage jumpers.  From a financial point of view, the use of such an approach is advisable in cases where the substations are located at a certain distance from the power source.  But at the same time there should not be a significant distance between them. </p><p>  To indicate real-world conditions, all such connections are divided into three categories.  The first and second mean the use of two power transformers.  These substations operate according to the block scheme.  Due to this, voltage is supplied to each power transformer in a separate line. </p>

    <p>  What if there is no data on power consumers?  In this case, each transformer should provide 60-70% of the current load on the substation.  And in case of emergency and failure of one unit, the load will be compensated by the equipment remaining in the system.  Consumers of the third category stand a little separately.  They use substations with one transformer.  Redundancy in such cases is carried out through cable jumpers, which, as a rule, have a throughput of 15-20% of the transformer capacity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  By the way, this is not the only place for their such application.  So, a similar approach is also used in high-voltage lines.  In order to avoid no-load losses at low load, transformers are often switched off using exclusively redundant jumpers. </p><h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  Let's pay attention to individual points that are of interest.  To do this, consider the differences between the main and radial power supply schemes.  This will help you better understand the topic of this article.  Imagine that we have before us a radial diagram of the power supply of the thermal workshop.  It is used only when there are separate nodes with a sufficiently large amount of concentrated loads.  In this case, powerful electric receivers receive power directly from the substation.  Smaller devices through distribution points. </p>

    <p>  In the thermal workshop, you can also lay the main circuit.  In this case, it is necessary to apply the technology of one level of complexity, while with the radial scheme it is possible to make certain concessions, which requires less money to implement the entire structure.  But at the same time, you should look so that single-phase and three-phase power receivers are not connected to the same chain.  In the best case, the technique simply won‚Äôt start working.  It is very likely that it will simply burn out. </p><h2>  Rational Technology Requirements </h2><p>  One of the basic principles of the construction and operation of the circuit is the so-called deep input.  What does he offer?  According to him, it is important to ensure that high voltage sources are located as close as possible to consumers, while using a minimum number of devices and stages of intermediate transformation.  So, if there is a small enterprise, then one substation will probably be enough for it to receive electricity.  In this case, often there is no need to carry out energy transformation (when the supply voltage for the object coincides with a similar characteristic of the distribution network).  But, alas, this does not always happen. </p>

    <p>  With the increase in production space and the complexity of the cycle, there is a need for transformation.  The radial power supply scheme of the plant allows you to provide the main and necessary structural elements that are at the enterprise.  Let's look at a small example. </p><h2>  How is everything arranged? </h2><p>  So, let's say that we have a territory in the middle of which there is a power source.  In the north, west, south and east, respectively, there is an administrative building, a tool workshop, a material processing workshop and an assembly conveyor.  A separate cable goes from the power source to each object.  At the same time, only computers are used in the administrative building for which there is enough network voltage.  Therefore, the radial power supply circuit of the building provides for the laying of a cable to the distribution panel.  A highway is already being laid from it, to which all computers are connected.  But the materials processing workshop uses many different devices, both for energy-consuming processes, and equipment with low requirements.  And this is his difference.  So, for a blast furnace for steelmaking, a separate cable may be provided.  But for equipment that makes something from wood or plastic, because of their possible number of several pieces, the line is already broken.  In general, it should be noted that the radial power supply scheme of the enterprise is adapted to the specific requirements that are put forward to them. </p><h2>  About the advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Initially, it should be noted its high reliability and ease of use.  So, in the event of a short circuit, only one element and the line will be stopped, which is laid to it.  All other objects will function in standard mode.  The most significant drawback is the significant cost.  Moreover, this emerges from its advantages.  After all, laying a large number of lines costs a significant amount of money.  In addition, you need to take care of more <span>switching protective devices.</span>  And they also cost money.  But when there are questions of reliability, then cost is often thought of last. </p>

    <p>  This is how the radial power supply scheme can be briefly characterized.  Advantages and disadvantages allow her to take a recognized place. </p><h2>  How much does the circuit layout cost? </h2><p>  In many respects, the answer to this question depends on the tasks set.  But a significant impact is also exerted by various technical conditions.  For example, what will act as an object of work?  As a rule, the cheapest in laying are the lines to city apartments and private residential buildings.  It all depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object, and the start is in the price range of 5-7 thousand rubles.  In the case of an enterprise, this cost will double.  In addition, in some cases it is still necessary to ensure that all necessary permits are obtained.  After all, connecting to a power line requires certain adjustments throughout the system. </p><h2>  What can you advise when choosing a contractor? </h2><p>  If there is a need to attract outside experts, it is not superfluous to take into account a few tips.  After all, with poor-quality network laying, a fire or other problem can occur.  Therefore, it is first necessary to make sure that the contractor has all the necessary permissions and licenses from the state and inspection bodies.  It will not be superfluous to search for reviews about a particular company.  But they should not be trusted too much in view of the popular practice of self-glorification from a third party. </p>

    <p>  You should also pay attention to the service.  After all, if the company treats a person with connivance, then it is unlikely that the technique will be different.  Fortunately, companies involved in the electric power industry are not currently appointed on a team basis, but we choose on our own.
