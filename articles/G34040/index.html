From the age of 11, Peter I was engaged in drill training with the "little guys" entrusted to him, which Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich assigned to the command of the Tsarevich.  At first they thought that Peter would play and forget, but everything was serious.  So, when the groom S. Bukhvostov, who was serving at the court, enlisted in the "amusing" regiment on the last day of November 1683, this event marked the beginning of a great military history. </p><p>  And today, after an almost century-long break, in April 2013, the Semenovsky and Preobrazhensky regiments were revived by Presidential Decree. </p><h2>  The emergence of hussars in Russia </h2><p>  Hussars were a special kind of troops that existed in the Russian Empire even before Peter the Great.  The <span>cavalry regiments</span> in those days included primarily the Hungarians, as well as Ukrainians, Poles and Tatar horsemen.  Cavalry famously crashed into enemy carts, knocked over bases and destroyed enemy patrols.  The fearlessness of the cavalry was a saying.  But then no one had any idea about the uniform form of the hussars, and indeed in the army: they dressed in what they would have, but a spectacular Hungarian style was a priority. </p><div class="photo" data-original="evg-crystal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Peter I" class="if uuid-3042436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042436.jpg"></div><p>  Researchers in military history determined the date of the first Russian Life Guards of the cavalry regiment - December 31, 1730, which was the successor to the Kronshlot Dragoons regiment, founded by Peter the Great in 1706. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hello-museum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Ivanovna" class="if uuid-3042457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042457.jpg"></div><p>  The initiator of the creation of the cavalry regiment was Anna Ioannovna, who needed the support of the guard, but did not enjoy the love of the oldest guards regiments: Izmailovsky and Preobrazhensky. </p><p>  The gallant XVIII century came into its own, and the Russian guard became an elite branch of the army, which was greatly facilitated by the elements of the Hungarian costume introduced into the hussar uniform </p><h2>  Petrov's daughter </h2><p>  It was Elizabeth Petrovna that Russia owed the appearance of hussar regiments, where the service was held on a regular basis.  According to the staff list, the Life Guards Hussar Regiment consisted of six squadrons, in which there were 834 lower ranks, under the command of 73 non-commissioned officers.  Further on the rank was followed by officers, of whom there were 37;  14 trumpeters, as well as 972 horses, were assigned to the regiment.  Total 1032 people served in the regiment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Preobrazhensky Regiment" class="if uuid-3042447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042447.jpg"></div><p>  The privilege of the hussars was permission to leave a mustache, unlike other military branches, where they strictly monitored the smoothness of the face.  The servicemen of the Life Guards of the <span>Hussar Regiment</span> were also exempted from dusting with powder, however, they were ordered to braid two braids in the temple area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In honor of Empress Elizabeth, on the front of the tashka (flat leather bag) that each hussar had, the empress‚Äôs monogram in the form of the letters ‚ÄúE.R.‚Äù  from twisted cords, as well as a crown. </p><h2>  Tunic of the times of Elizabeth </h2><p>  The uniform of the Life Guards Hussars was a real work of tailor's art.  It included: </p><ol><li>  Mentik: fur-lined outerwear resembling a short jacket, decorated with five rows of buttons that made up a single element with cords and loops.  The mentic wore on top of the doloman. </li><li>  Doloman, or a shortened jacket with one side and a stand-up collar, also trimmed with numerous twisted cords, loops and a special kind of buttons. </li><li>  Chakchirs, or a kind of tight leggings.  They existed in two versions: one species, called the "French", stood out with a wide belt and was in use in the army of Napoleon;  the second, aka ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù, common under Alexander I, was notable for its easy sewing, no belt and strap, the fastener was in front.  The cutting and sewing of the chakchir was elementary: two equal parts were sewn together with seams to the outside, which were decorated with braid.  The chakchirs were fastened with suspenders, and their rear part - with a buttonhole. </li><li>  A sash, identical in color to the doloman and decorated with interceptions called "gombs", the shade of which coincided with the cords that decorated the doloman. </li><li>  A flat leather bag (tashka), which often served as a container for urgent packages. </li><li>  A quiver, carved according to the French pattern, which Russian tailors created by decree of Arakcheev from the end of spring 1808.  The shakos of the lower ranks and officers were distinguished by ‚Äúburdocks‚Äù and ‚Äúetiquettes‚Äù.  Soldiers were prescribed burrs of red, white or yellow, depending on the shade of the etiquette.  Non-commissioned officers relied on etiquette, diagonally divided into 4 parts, of which the top and bottom were black and orange (later replaced by gray), and the side parts were white.  In officer etiquette, costing several times more than the shako itself, silver threads were woven with elements of silk black and orange. </li><li>  A hat made of felt or fur, as well as a black leather band that was worn crosswise and served as a bandolier. </li></ol><h2>  Post-Elizabethan Innovations </h2><p>  After the death in 1762 of Queen Elizabeth, the form of the Life Guards of the Hussar Regiment underwent some changes that affected most of the accessories: buttons, cords, etc.: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The difference between the lower ranks and the officers was that the latter, along with the identical parts of the hussar costume, were required to wear cords and galloons in gold or silver, the same was true for buttons.  The boots were introduced yellow from morocco, and the spurs for them were laid exclusively from copper with gilding. </li><li>  Patterns of doloman and shakos changed due to an increase in the number of cords located on the front of the uniform to 10, however, the distance between them decreased, and their ends began to communicate;  however, 5 rows of buttons remained unchanged.  The length of the doloman itself was increased by 14 cm. </li></ol><h2>  Horse decoration </h2><p>  In a separate line, rules regarding the distinguishing features of horses assigned to the Life Guard regiment were deduced.  According to the decoration of the horse, the owner was judged, therefore, for cavalry horses were provided: </p><ol><li>  Peregrine Falcon - a special piece of clothing, consisting of brushes designed for the head, papierstva, as well as attached to the groins of the horse.  Brushes wove from thinly cut straps of their black leather. </li><li>  Valtrap - a cloth litter for a saddle.  The non-commissioned officers were supposed to decorate the leopard with one row of gold or silver galloons, and the head officers were ordered to have two rows of galloons. </li></ol><p>  Horse care was given the most serious importance: both the success of the campaign and the life of the hussar depended on it.  Therefore, the so-called repair officers, selected from among the employees in this regiment, were on a special account and enjoyed trust and respect, since they had to deal with large sums of money collected for the purchase of horses. </p><p>  The recruits were taught riding and caring for the horse entrusted to him, according to the "Instructions for the Colonel Equestrian Regiment", which advised to take care of the horse, establish good relations with the animal, do not beat him, give commands calmly, without screaming, feed him freely, clean and clean after him Do not wave your arms in front of the muzzle. </p><h2>  From Catherine to Nicholas I </h2><p>  The leapfrog that began after the death of Elizabeth Petrovna, connected with the struggle for the Russian throne, ended with the accession of Catherine II.  During her reign, by the beginning of 1775, "at the highest command," Prince G. A. Potemkin-Tauride created specially for serving under Catherine II a hussar squadron number 130, and with him two escort teams from the Cossacks: one became known as Donskaya, and the second - Chuguev.  The squadron itself was called the Life Guards of the Hussars. </p><p>  April 1775 was marked by changes in the structure of the squadron: it consisted of the best representatives of the nobility, distinguished officers and lower ranks of the hussar and army regiments, as well as representatives from abroad with a stately appearance and good appearance.  Until the very end of Catherine's reign, the Leib Hussar squadron guarded the empress. </p><p>  On November 17, 1796, Paul I ascended the throne, and the very next day the hussar squadron was reorganized.  According to the emperor‚Äôs plan, the Hussar squadron and the Cossack squadron, which was part of the Gatchina army, were added to the Leib Hussar and Cossack squadrons.  All this association became known as the consolidated Leib Hussar Cossack Regiment, which was subject to the privileges established during the previous reign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="white-idea.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uniforms of an officer and Private Life Guards of the Preobrazhensky Regiment" class="if uuid-3042610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042610.jpg"></div><p>  But Paul I did not calm down on this: another 5 hussar squadrons joined the existing 4 squadrons in 5 months.  And after 9 months, the Life Hussar Cossack Regiment began to consist of two regiments: the Life Guards Hussars and the Life Guards Cossacks.  Then, after 8 months, another improvement followed: 2 battalions remained in the hussar regiment, which consisted of five squadrons each. </p><p>  On March 11, 1801, Emperor Alexander I reigned on the throne, who, as is known, ruled until December 1, 1825.  He did not rush too much with the reforms, so only after 10 months did they touch the hussar regiment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="white-idea.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunic of the Life Guards Colonel of the Hussars" class="if uuid-3042604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042604.jpg"></div><p>  Since then, the regiment was deployed in Pavlovsk and Krasnoye Selo, and the composition changed to 5 squadrons.  But a year later, with a small regiment, it already consisted of 6 operating squadrons and one in reserve, which lasted until 1814.  Since April 1818, the future Emperor Alexander II became the chief of the Life Guards of the Hussars. </p><h2>  From Nicholas I to Nicholas II </h2><p>  On December 25, 1825, power in the Russian Empire passed to Emperor Nicholas I, who owned the phrase "where once the Russian flag is hoisted, it should not be lowered there."  He ruled until March 1955.  During the years of his reign in 1836, an additional 7th squadron was formed, called the reserve.  After 6 years, the emperor ordered to form a reserve for the 8th squadron, also a reserve.  By 1848, all changes were completed. </p><p>  The name "His Majesty's Life Guards Hussar Regiment" was given to the army in honor of the accession in February 1855 to the throne of the chief of the regiment, and now - Emperor Alexander II.  The following year, the composition of the regiment was changed and began to consist of 4 active squadrons and one standing in reserve.  Since 1975, the reserve squadron became a reserve. </p><p>  In 1881, Emperor Alexander II was killed by the Volunteers, and power passed to his son Alexander III, in which after 2 years the composition of the regiment increased by 2 squadrons, and the spare squadron was gone: the personnel of the guard reserve remained. </p><p>  The year 1896 was marked by Khodynka, which marked the beginning of the reign of the last emperor of Russia, who completed his reign on March 15, 1917.  10 days before His Majesty the Life Guard, the regiment was again called the Hussars, due to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II from the throne.  This regiment kept this name until May 8, 1918 - the date of its disbandment. </p><p>  During the Civil War, attempts were made to revive the regiment in southern Russia.  Then from it remained the regimental association that existed in exile. </p><h2>  Grodno Regiment </h2><p>  The Life Guards The Grodno Hussar Regiment covered itself with glory in many battles.  Its composition at different times served as great poets and philosophers.  Grodno is an ancient city in Belarus.  And it was his coat of arms that became the hallmark of the banner of the cavalry regiment.  The history of its creation is associated with the unification in the Life Guards of the Grodno Hussar Regiment of 3 squadrons: Izyumsky, Sumy and Olviapolsky.  This happened in 1806.  Then a banner with a coat of arms appeared. </p><p>  Since the time of Alexander I, the regiment had 5 squadrons in its composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zabavatut.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hussar parade uniform 1813 - 1837" class="if uuid-3042546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042546.jpg"></div><p>  6 years after the founding, the regiment took part in many battles with the enemy army of Napoleon: the battle near Gutstadt was won largely thanks to the Grodno hussars;  the battles near the cities of Koenigsberg, Likendorf, Friedland were very memorable for the French, who called the Grodno residents ‚Äúblue hussars‚Äù because of the distinguishing mark on their uniform - the blue mentic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sammler.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunic of the non-commissioned officer of the hussar regiment" class="if uuid-3042478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042478.jpg"></div><p>  Under Friedland, only the courage and self-control of Commander Kulnev allowed the regiment to break out of the encirclement in which the Grodno residents fell due to ill-conceived command orders.  General Kulnev was awarded the Order of St.  Anne of the 2nd degree for her feat. </p><p>  Hussars of the Grodno regiment distinguished themselves in the Swedish campaign led by the regiment commander Kulnev.  And then Denis Davydov commanded one of the squadrons, and the future hero of the war of 1812, General Bagration headed the command of the corps.  The heroic deeds and fortitude of Grodno residents and their regimental commander were admired even by the enemy: the Swedish king signed a decree prohibiting royal soldiers from sending weapons to General Kulnev. </p><p>  The highest courage was shown by the soldiers of the Grodno regiment when crossing the ice sheet of the Baltic Sea to the shores of the Swedish state.  On March 7, 1809, the Swedish city of Grisselgam surrendered almost without a fight.  Panic broke out in the royal palace, which culminated in a peace offer.  In honor of this ice passage, the medal "For the transition to the Swedish coast 1809" was instituted, which was adorned with the uniform of the Life Guards of the hussar regiment (in particular on the mentics) of many Grodno hussars. </p><p>  The results of battles with Napoleon‚Äôs army are impressive: Grodno showed themselves in more than 30 important battles, and vanguard clashes were commonplace.  Captured up to 200 generals and officers of the enemy army, and soldiers about 13 thousand.  The regiment took part in the overseas campaign of the Russian army, passing through the cities of Reims, Berlin and entering Paris. </p><p>  437 Crosses of St. George were handed over to the soldiers of the Grodno regiment, and the regiment itself was marked with many insignia, such as silver trumpets. </p><p>  The service in this regiment was very honorable, and it was not without reason that it included members of the Romanov dynasty, as well as Emperor Alexander II, Emperor Alexander III, and the last autocrat Nicholas II. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foto-history.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas I in the uniform of the Grodno Regiment and the Life Guards Hussars" class="if uuid-3042638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042638.jpg"></div><p>  In 1837, Mikhail Lermontov arrived at the duty station in the Grodno Hussar Regiment, where he served until the spring of 1838.  The "Caucasian series" of the poet was written during this period. </p><p>  The Grodno hussars took part in the Warsaw campaign of 1831, in the Crimean War of 1855, liberated Bulgaria from the Turkish caliphate.  General Skobelev, a participant in those events, is still revered in Bulgaria: there is a park, a street, a square, and a monument dedicated to Mikhail Dmitrievich Skobelev. </p><p>  For the glorious exploits during the liberation of the Bulgarian kingdom, the Grodno Hussar Regiment was awarded the standard of St. George. </p><p>  On the battlefields of the First World War, Grodno residents also distinguished themselves in Galicia, Lublin, under Warsaw and other regions. </p><p>  After the Bolsheviks came to power, the Grodno Hussar Regiment was disbanded in early March 1918.  But some of its representatives fought in the White Movement.  Next is emigration. </p><h2>  Semenov hussar </h2><p>  Life Guards Semenovsky Regiment - one of the oldest military units, was founded in 1683.  For the services he had, in 1700 he was awarded the rights of the Old Guard.  The uniform of the hussar regiment was dominated by blue.  Certain requirements were also imposed on the appearance of the Semenovites: stately tall brown-haired or fair-haired who were forbidden to wear a beard were selected. </p><p>  The regimental temple of the Semenovsky regiment was the Vvedensky Cathedral on Zagorodny Prospect, built with the participation of the architect Benoit.  There is no temple today - they were demolished during the struggle against "opium for the people." </p><p>  The regiment distinguished itself: in the battle of Narva (even under Peter I);  during the capture of the fortress of Noteburg in 1702;  in the Battle of Poltava in 1709;  in the Patriotic War of 1812, including the battle of Borodino;  in the overseas campaign of the Russian army in 1813 (Leipzig, Lutzen, Paris). </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.season.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Officer uniform" class="if uuid-3042522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3042522.jpg"></div><p> I would especially like to note the indignation of the personnel of the head company in October 1820 against the commander of the regiment Schwartz and the orders of Arakcheev.  The case ended with the disbandment of the Semenovsky regiment and punishment: for the instigators - gauntlets, for the rest - distant garrisons.  And this is under Alexander I the Blessed ... </p><p>  Many poets and philosophers well-known throughout Russia served in the Life Guards of the Semenovsky Regiment: Baratynsky and Chaadaev, as well as the Decembrists Bestuzhev-Ryumin and Muravyov-Apostol.  Later, the future marshal Tukhachevsky and Soviet diplomat Chicherin learned the basics of military affairs here.  But the great fame of the Semenovsky regiment was brought by Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, in 1905, the Semenovsky regiment was brought in to suppress riots in Moscow. </p><p>  In 1917, the Semenovites went over to the side of the new order and became known as the "3rd Regiment of the Petrograd City Guard named after Uritsky."  In 1919 there was a massive transfer of personnel to the side of the White movement - more than 600 people, which allowed the regiment to reserve the name "Semenovsky".  Historians believe that for the Soviets it was the Semenov Regiment that was the personification of the foundations of the army of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  In 1932, those who remained in Russia and returned from exile were condemned or executed.  Then, during the destruction of the regimental church of the Semenovsky regiment, a regimental banner was discovered. </p><p>  And in the building on Lazaretny Lane, in which the world-class historical and medical museum of Russia has settled today, there was once a hospital for the servicemen of the Semenovsky regiment. </p><h2>  Pavlovsky regiment </h2><p>  The Life Guards Pavlovsky Regiment was founded in mid-May 1790. </p><p>  For valor shown in the Polish campaign, the regiment in 1831 received the rights of the Old Guard.  A distinctive feature of the Pavlovtsy form was the predominant white color.  And they recruited into this regiment recruits similar in appearance to Emperor Paul I: middle-aged blond or red-haired with upturned nose.  Of course, nowhere in the charter was this rule spelled out. </p><p>  Alexander Nevsky was considered the patron saint of the Pavlovsky regiment.  On November 23, on the day of commemoration of the Holy Right Prince, practically all the personnel of the regiment were present at the service in the church of Alexander Nevsky, free of guard duty and other matters.  The regimental church was on the 2nd floor, above the premises of the barracks, in 1918 it was destroyed. </p><p>  On the third day after his accession, Paul I issued a decree on the formation of the Pavlovsky Life Guards <span>Grenadier Regiment.</span>  It consisted of 2 battalions.  Also, two companies from the Moscow Grenadier Regiment, which were in reserve, were attributed to him. </p><p>  In April 1813, for the courage and courage shown in the battles against Napoleon‚Äôs army, the Semenovsky Regiment was given the rights of the Young Guard.  This allowed on the marches of the Life Guards regiments to march with arms "on hand". </p><p>  Since 1819, the regiment‚Äôs barracks were located on the Champ de Mars in St. Petersburg.  The building was designed by architect V.P.  Stasov, who included in the complex of buildings already at that time the Lombard and the building of the Educational House, created by the architect Yu. M. Felton. </p><p>  10 days before the start of the First World War of 1914, a reserve battalion appeared in the regiment, which was due to mobilization.  Almost 3 years later, in pursuance of the order in the Petrograd Military District, he became the Guard Pavlovsky Reserve Regiment. </p><p>  In 1917, the Pavlovsky regiment supported the Bolshevik party.  In May 1918, the regiment ended its existence, and on the territory of its barracks, exercises and reviews were held even years later.  In 1929, Lenenergo settled in the former barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment and existed there until 2010, when they began to reconstruct the building to open a hotel complex in it. </p>
