The newspaper weaving technique allows you to reuse unnecessary materials, and also helps to preserve nature.  The edges of such a thing are made of various shapes, they are bent in different ways and form unusual patterns, using the experience of specialists in weaving baskets from vines. </p><h2>  Features of working with newspaper tubes </h2><p>  The main difference between the technology of weaving trays from newspaper tubes and rods is that working with wood materials requires a special attitude and certain knowledge.  You need to be able to properly harvest them, process and store them.  To bleach the vine and give it shape, you will need a lot of free space and sunlight - such conditions are difficult to provide in an ordinary apartment.  Crafts from newspapers look like wooden, but make them much easier.  No need to prepare material for a long time - just cut the paper into strips of the desired length and width, twist them and paint them in the color you like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tray of newspaper tubes master class" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1897866.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Newspaper tray: workshop </h2><p>  To work, you need to cook: </p><ul><li>  2 sheets of cardboard </li><li>  colorless acrylic varnish, </li><li>  white water-based paint, </li><li>  gouache, </li><li>  water </li><li>  pencil, </li><li>  a brush </li><li>  PVA glue, </li><li>  ruler </li><li>  scissors, </li><li>  regular sheet A4, </li><li>  sharp clerical knife, </li><li>  35 cm long knitting needle </li><li>  a thick book or other item that can be used as a press, </li><li>  newspapers. </li></ul><p>  To make the tray, start with the cardboard base: mark and cut out two 15x20 cm rectangles. In the center of the A4 sheet, place one of the shapes and circle it to understand where to apply the glue.  Then, using a brush, apply a thin layer of glue inside the rectangular base and lay the cardboard on top.  At the sheet, cut the corners with a ruler and a clerical knife.  Glue the edges of the paper with glue and bend it, firmly pressing it to the cardboard.  Make another same detail.  Place both blanks for the bottom under the press until the glue dries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper tray easter tray" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1897865.jpg" width="500"></div>

Now you need to make newspaper tubes: the frame will be made of them.  For work you will need newspapers, a clerical knife and a knitting needle. </p><ol><li>  Fold in half a sheet of newspaper into 4 equal parts on the short side, and then divide the fold line.  You should get strips about 5.5 cm wide. 80-100 pieces of such strips will be needed.  To create the frame, you can also use office paper. </li><li>  Take one of the strips and apply a thin layer of glue on the long side.  Screw the strip tightly onto the needle starting from the angle opposite to where the glue was applied. </li><li>  Press the corner so that the tube does not unwind, take out the knitting needle and wait until the glue completely dries.  Make 30 pcs. </li><li>  Squeeze the sharp end of the tube and lubricate it on one side with glue. </li></ol><p>  Now stick the tubes along the marks to the bottom of the tray, pressing them well.  Then, having filled the entire perimeter, apply glue to the bottom, carefully lubricating the fastening points of the tubes.  Attach another cardboard part on top and place the blank under the press for at least six hours. </p><h2>  Tray assembly </h2><p>  The next step in the workshop “Tray of newspaper tubes” will be the assembly of the product.  While the workpiece is drying, make about 50 more tubes. </p><ol><li>  Glue the two newspaper tubes together in length.  Bend this part to get two equal parts, and start braiding the posts from the corner. </li><li>  Grow the tubules when necessary, and continue to braid the tray, moving in a circle. </li><li>  At the end of the third row, fix, glue and cut off the ends of the braiding tube. </li><li>  Stand with the next row in a row and bend it up.  Continue in a circle until you reach the last tube. </li><li>  Insert the last rack of the row into the loop at the bottom, formed by the first rack, and bring it up. </li><li>  Start braiding the racks with a double tube from one of the corners.  At the end of the fourth row, fix, glue and cut off the end of the braiding tube. </li><li>  Fold the stand to the right, to the next stand, and then lower it down.  Cut the end, stepping back two centimeters from the fold, coat with glue and tuck into the weave from above. </li><li>  Continue in a circle. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Tray Handles </h2><p>  Handles for the tray can be done as follows: in the corners from the narrow side, insert two tubes covered with glue and bend two tubes towards each other, making a loop.  Leave 5 cm from the fold and cut off the ends.  Coat the edges with glue and insert into the base of the tray.  Begin tightly wrapping the handle with a newspaper tube.  On the horizontal part, braid eight each two ducts separately, then fix the ends with glue.  Repeat all steps on the opposite side of the product. </p><h2>  Product design </h2><p>  It remains to prime and color the tray in the color you like.  For primer, mix water, glue and white emulsion paint in white in equal proportions, and then apply this composition with a brush on the entire surface of the product.  Then add gouache to the primer and paint over all surfaces except the bottom.  When the paint has dried, cover your creation with two layers of acrylic varnish so that it can be washed.  The master class “Tray of newspaper tubes” is completed.  Use the product, delighting yourself and loved ones with a beautiful and practical hand-made thing. </p>
