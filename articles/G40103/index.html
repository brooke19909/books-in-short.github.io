    <h2>  How to get to Ephtalia Village </h2><p>  Hotel Eftalia Village Hotel 5 * is located in the Avlassar region, five kilometers from the resort village of Konakli.  To get to this hotel, you must first get to Antalya.  As a rule, most travelers who have bought package tours meet a transfer, and they get to the hotel without any problems, unless they wait until their vacation mates are taken to closer resorts.  However, it is worth noting that it will take a long time to go to the resting place, probably at least two hours.  If you belong to guests who like to drive on their own, then you should take the minibus from the airport to the bus station.  There you already need to catch a dolmush or a comfortable bus with Internet on board, next to Alanya.  He will take you to the right place.  Almost all public transport that travels along the route between these cities stops near large hotel complexes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eftalia Village Hotel 5 HV" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2069727.jpg"></div>
