And especially entrepreneurial inventors more than once had to hear his name in their address: ‚ÄúYou are like Kulibin!‚Äù  However, few people know that out of a dozen developments, I.P.  Kulibin patented only a few.  And the world now knows that the architect Town built a heavy-duty construction of the bridge, but Kulibin invented it - he does not know. </p><h2>  Inventor </h2><p>  Ivan Petrovich will be born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1735.  To his surprise, there were no learned people in his family, and therefore the abilities of a self-taught mechanic can rightfully be called an outstanding talent! </p><p>  Ivan's family existed at the expense of petty trade: his father was an entrepreneur and an Old Believer, and his mother was engaged in farming and helped to keep accounts. </p><p>  From an early age, the boy felt great sympathy for engineering designs and various inventions, of which there were not so many in the villages at that time.  But the young man, passionate for science, did not want to keep books and went to the apprentice to a fellow villager, to study metalwork, turning and watchmaking. </p><p>  Gaining experience, Kulibin makes his first watch, analogues to which to this day in the world can not be found.  The tiny invention served as a watch with a fight, as well as a music box and miniature theater.  Catherine II herself could not resist the work of art of the Nizhny Novgorod master - he gave her a watch, and she invited Kulibin to work. </p>

    <p>  Consider a few things that Kulibin invented, but never patented. </p><h2>  Paddle water motor </h2><p>  In the 18th century, hired burlak labor was one of the most common ways of moving ships against the course of rivers, as well as in shallow water. </p><p>  Ivan Petrovich decided to save people from torment and introduce an engineering novelty in the shipping business - a vane engine.  The principle of its operation was based on the technique of moving ships using anchors and ropes - a ship was pulled to an anchor dropped far ahead with a rope.  And while the ship "went" to one cargo, they threw another one further - and so in turn. </p><p>  Kulibin improved the system.  Now, instead of hired workers, the engine (it consisted of 2 wheels with blades) with the help of water energy had to attract the vessel to the rope.  It would seem that a simple and reliable design that will save hundreds of barge haulers, and hundreds of money for entrepreneurs.  However, even after successful trials of moving a ship with 65 tons of sand, financing for production was never made. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that Ivan Petrovich Kulibin invented, but could not arrange the release. </p><h2>  The elevator for the empress </h2><p>  Aging Catherine II with difficulty moved around the apartments of the Winter Palace.  Therefore, Kulibin was given an important assignment - to come up with an elevator for the empress herself. </p><p>  The winch elevator did not meet the main condition: it was strictly forbidden to attach the ropes to the ceiling of the Palace.  The resourceful scientist came up with a different mechanism, similar to the work of an office chair or tightening the nut: the servant twisted the handle, and the self-tapping screw, rotating in the sleeve, raised and lowered the chair.  Unfortunately, the mechanical elevator has not survived to this day.  After the death of Catherine II, as unnecessary, it was laid with a brick, and Kulibin did not get the right to authorship for its development.  He became another subject that Kulibin invented, but could not be considered his brainchild. </p><h2>  Bridge </h2><p>  If the foresight of Catherine II did not fail her at that time, then she would rightfully be considered the founder of the bridge business in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, Ivan Petrovich developed an extremely stable design of a single-span bridge.  He worked on his invention for 30 years!  Despite the lack of necessary knowledge in mathematics and physics, he, without knowing it, practically discovered new laws.  The great advantage of the bridge was the fact that ships could pass under it without cutting down their match. </p>

    <p>  The great Euler, checking the drawings of the master, was surprised at the lack of miscalculations and errors in them.  Potemkin himself allocated money for the construction of a model of the bridge, but this ended the sponsorship. </p><p>  And 30 years later, Town became the famous architect of the bridge, and not IP Kulibin, who invented this bridge. </p><h2>  "Grandfather" of the car </h2><p>  Among other things, Ivan Petrovich invented a self-propelled stroller.  In appearance, it was very similar to a car, but the principle of operation was different.  The stroller could be safely called a hybrid of a bicycle and a cart, as a person brought it into action by pressing the pedals.  The invention for some time served as a toy for the nobility, but she did not have the desire to sponsor its production.  The drawings of the "grandfather of the car" have sunk into oblivion, not reaching our days. </p>

    <p>  Do not confuse the stroller that Kulibin invented, and the Shamshurenkov bike crew.  His invention was much larger and more interesting: there was enough space for two, and in winter the bike crew turned into a sleigh.  I would like to note an interesting similarity: nobody took up production of the development of Leonty Shamshurenkov, and the drawings of his invention were lost. </p><h2>  First prosthesis </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, Kulibin presented "know-how" to the staff of the Academy of Sciences!  Lower limb prosthesis.  The first test of the design was Nepeytsyn - he lost his leg during the assault on Ochakov, and now his military career was on a slope!  However, Ivan Kulibin, who invented his new leg, gave a start to his new victories!  As a result, Nepeytsyn rose to the rank of Major General and received the ridiculous nickname Iron Leg. </p><p>  A searchlight, a ship launching system, an <span>optical telegraph, an</span> iron bridge project across the Volga are the smallest list of things that Ivan Petrovich Kulibin invented. </p><p>  Unfortunately, photos and drawings of many of them have not reached our days.  However, the fame and memory of such an outstanding person must be preserved in our hearts! </p>
