    <p>  Nevertheless, many note that for a three-star hotel, the level of food is quite good.  Moreover, those who wish could always have an inexpensive meal in one of the cafes located outside the territory. </p><p>  There are negative reviews about staff who, according to some, are engaged in extortion.  And in this matter, the opinions of tourists were divided, because there are those who categorically deny this phenomenon. </p>
