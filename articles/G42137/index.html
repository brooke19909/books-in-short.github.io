  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Volost court. Structure and decision making</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The volost court is a public peasant judicial body that existed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  He solved minor problems between peasant residents. </p><p>  A special volost court for peasants made decisions only regarding insignificant acts committed against the same peasants on the estate.  We will tell you more about this. </p><h2>  Territory of the volost court </h2><p>  This court took place on every estate.  If the estates were small, then one small volost court was organized for these small villages.  The local people were considered one whole community. </p><p>  The volost court made decisions regarding peasants living in the community.  He had the right to dispose only in this estate. </p><p>  Meetings of the volost court were held in a special room that stood out for this purpose.  Later they began to build special courthouses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volost court, assembly" class="if uuid-2585861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91034/2585861.jpg"></div><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  The volost court for peasants consisted of one chairman and two assessors.  Such a composition was considered minimal.  Typically, the composition calculation was determined as follows: </p><ul><li>  if 500 men live on the estate, then the composition should be minimal; </li><li>  for every 250 men one more assessor is added. </li></ul><p>  Each volost court provided for the existence of two substitutes (deputy assessors). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Substitutes could participate in decision-making only when the assessor is unable to attend the meeting, the issue of relatives or close friends of the judge is being resolved. </p><p>  Requirements for Judges: </p><ul><li>  members of the volost court are obliged to adhere to the same religion as the greater half of the peasants of the estate; </li><li>  the candidate must have perfect behavior; </li><li>  age - not less than 25 years; </li><li>  if the candidate is an estate worker, then the consent of the landowner was required. </li></ul><p>  Appointed to this position for one year. </p><p>  Member of the volost court - it was a paid job.  The judges received the salary that the volost would appoint them.  The deputy (substitute) received a salary only when he replaced one of the assessors for more than two weeks. </p><p>  The judges had a number of privileges: they were not obliged to serve in the army and they could not be punished physically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="working peasants" class="if uuid-2585859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91034/2585859.jpg"></div><h2>  Making decisions </h2><p>  The volost court made decisions regarding the following issues: </p><ul><li>  from 1861-1889, decisions were made if the claim value was less than 100 rubles; </li><li>  since 1889, decisions have been made if the claim value is less than 300 rubles; </li><li>  division of property between peasants; </li><li>  inheritance of peasants. </li></ul><p>  The court met twice a month.  But on the initiative of the chairman, he could meet more often. </p><p>  Punishment: </p><ul><li>  community service from 1 to 6 days; </li><li>  a fine of up to 3 rubles; by the end of the 19th century, the maximum fine was 30 rubles; </li><li>  arrest up to a week, by the end of the 19th century the maximum term of arrest was a month; </li><li>  up to 20 strokes, by the middle of the 19th century this punishment was not applied to women, and this punishment did not apply to children under 14 years of age and older people. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="special volost court for peasants" class="if uuid-2585867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91034/2585867.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, punishments were not subject to appeal, but a little later the punished could appeal the verdict.  In this case, a county or provincial judge could be invited to the volost court. </p><p>  The sentence was executed by the headman of the estate, the local police or the volost foreman.  In 1917 (after the February Revolution), the volost court was abolished and ceased to exist. </p>
