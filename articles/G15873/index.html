    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The village is located in a picturesque valley.  Two rivers flow here - Teshebs and Vulan.  This place is one of the largest in terms of population and area among the resort villages of Greater Gelendzhik.  Arkhipo-Osipovka is very popular across the region and country. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The main advantage of the village is its location.  It is located on the Federal <span>highway M4,</span> namely in the place where the road goes to the Black Sea.  From here to Krasnodar - about 130 kilometers.  The long road running through the mountain serpentines attracts not many.  This grueling journey will have to be overcome on the way to other resorts.  Such prospects do not please most tourists.  For this reason, it is Arkhipo-Osipovka that becomes the place to spend a vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkhipo osipovka pension" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/474394.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the hotel sector </h2><p>  Those who are going to spend their holidays in Arkhipo-Osipovka should know some nuances.  The length of the village is quite large.  Accordingly, the hotel sector in the resort is extensive.  Almost all hotels are located at a distance from the sea.  Guests should be aware that you will need to walk a certain path to the coast.  It can take anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour.  The distance is affected by the remoteness of the holiday home, where guests prefer to stay.

In the midst of the season, you should take care of pre-booking rooms.  During this period, finding a suitable hotel near the sea is a rather difficult task.  This is especially true for family tourists who are attracted by Arkhipo-Osipovka.  Pensions with meals are an ideal place to stay.

Therefore, rooms must be booked in advance. </p><h2>  Popular health resorts </h2><p>  Pension "Teshebs" (Arkhipo-Osipovka) is considered one of the most visited in the resort.
