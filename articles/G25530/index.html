Even being in a neglected state, the structure is striking in its beauty.  At the moment, this pearl of the 18th century Serpukhov district is still in ruins, of which it still looks with arrogant pride at everyone around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legendsofmoscow.wixsite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the course of recovery" class="if uuid-2719191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719191.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of the Pushchino-on-Nara estate, which has survived, dates back to the 1790s, when Prince S. Vyazemsky acquired this territory.  Subsequently, the estate became hereditary for this ancient family.  A number of historians claim that the history of the main building dates back to the 16th century, but evidence of this can never be found. </p><p>  However, the original date of construction of the building was lost forever with the death of its first owners.  The documentary sources also did not preserve any information about her.  All that remains of the original history of the ancient house is the fact that it was built after 1766.  The first owner was a secret adviser to the emperor.  This highly artistic work was called in the old newspapers ‚Äúa provincial house of good proportions,‚Äù but this title was undeserved.  The architectural monument the estate of Pushchino-on-Nara actually turned out to be a construction of the capital's scope.  Its creation is attributed to N. Lvov - the famous talented architect of that era, although there are only suggestions that indicate this.  So beautiful was this country estate of the princes of Vyazemsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The owners </h2><p>  From the 19th century, the landowner N. Novosiltseva became the owner, and from 1911, the manufacturers Ryabovs.  They founded a weaving factory in imperial times.  In addition, their family owned several factories.  The senior owner - Peter - paid great attention to charity.  At the beginning of the 20th century, he allocated funds for the construction of the bell tower of the temple in Buturlin, overlaid it with brick.  Thanks to his assistance, the church in memory of Alexander II was once built in the current building of the pre-trial detention center.  These are just a few of a number of cases of patronage of this outstanding person.  He made his corrections to the architecture of the estate as well - during the time of his life the terrace was expanded, fountains were added on both sides of the main building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legendsofmoscow.wixsite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the period of the USSR" class="if uuid-2719189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719189.jpg"></div><p>  With the revolution of 1917, the manufacturer lost his estate, a dairy farm was opened in it, then an orphanage.  All this did not hold out for a long time; subsequently, employees of the local state farm were located here. </p><h2>  Soviet time </h2><p>  During the Civil War, a military hospital was established on this estate.  And in 1918 she was nationalized.  Only in 1975 it was recognized as an architectural monument, the state began to protect it.  Already at that time, the building needed restoration, despite the safety of internal ceilings and roofs.  During the years of the existence of the USSR, classes for schoolchildren were even held here, then a full-fledged school was opened.  However, when the school was closed, the building was in disrepair and, under the influence of merciless time, was systematically destroyed in a natural way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the estate Pushchino-on-Nara </h2><p>  The main building, the basis of the entire complex, has two floors and mezzanines.  Its front entrance with 8 columns and porticoes with 4 columns decorate the public on the rustic, protruding arcades of the basement.  The wide entrance arches repeated in the semicircular windows in the middle of the building. </p><p>  The decorative decoration of the walls of the Pushchino-on-Nara estate had a special grace.  On the facades flaunted half-cannulated pilasters.  Decorating the facades with stucco garlands, sockets, profiles with delicate drawings added unique sophistication to the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life-trip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alley view" class="if uuid-2719201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719201.jpg"></div><p>  The monumentality and harmony of the overall composition are impressive.  Everything in it looks more like a theatrical scenery than a residential building.  Theatrical masks sculpted on the walls of the house add this feeling.  Each has its own facial expression - scary, angry, laughing.  It seems worth it to be here with the sunset, then ghosts will appear here. </p><p>  The atmosphere here reigns philosophical and full of deep pride of this place with ancient history.  The curious details of architectural decisions keep the eye on.  The estate is drawn to go around more and more, and each time there is something new - bas-reliefs in the spirit of antiquity, the quality of brickwork that has stood the test of centuries.  Wild herbs sprout through it.  And with the sunset and the rays breaking through the through holes of high windows, the spectacle becomes completely unforgettable and amazing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional buildings </h2><p>  On the territory of the complex there were once 4 wings.  However, only 1 of them has survived to this day.  A beautiful house on the banks of the Nara River was buried in acacias.  Green hedges united the buildings of the territory.  Two huge blue spruces stood out the passage to the house.  Being once full of all kinds of outbuildings, at the moment the complex has retained only the remains of the service building. </p><h2>  Park zone </h2><p>  Fountains with two oval-shaped bowls, which once reflected a beautiful house, added romanticism.  The park zone of the estate was divided in the northern part of the estate territory.  At the moment, the ancient exhibit of the park of the Pushchino-on-Nara estate has been preserved - an alley 300 m long with three lindens planted in three rows along it.  They coincide with the planning axes of the complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imesta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Preserved tiles" class="if uuid-2719431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2719431.jpg"></div><p>  This alley starts from the fountains and leads to the river.  Transverse alleys of the park zone was divided into rectangular sections.  From the eastern part, they separated the orchards with their backstage full of acacias.  In the western part of the infield there was an ancient planting with birches, which are already more than a hundred years old.  Once upon a time there were many maples, willows, rare Siberian larches. </p><h2>  Riddles </h2><p>  The reason remains why the Pushchino-on-Nara estate has not been investigated for a long time.  The strange thing is that it is not mentioned in books of art historians and guidebooks.  The building is considered a real masterpiece, it is complex, monumental and majestic, but for some reason has remained unrecognized.  Only the glory of the most picturesque ruins of the entire Moscow region was assigned to this sad monastery in the Serpukhov district. </p><h2>  condition </h2><p>  And to this day, the estate of Pushchino-on-Nara needs reconstruction.  The restoration of this unique ancient ensemble is a very risky undertaking, since internal walls have already collapsed in it.  Corrosion destroyed most of the metal bonds that contributed to the strength of the building. </p><p>  The doomed building, surviving its last days, still extends enchanting witchcraft to everyone who saw them.  Having been here, many come back again and again in the desire to preserve this estate of the Pushkin era in memories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nataturka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glorious past of the estate" class="if uuid-2719196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719196.jpg"></div><h2>  Latest data </h2><p>  According to news reports, the estate was finally bought by investors who will be engaged in the restoration of this amazing place.  The further fate of the ancient monument after its restoration has not yet been declared and is a secret.  In order to create the most presentable view of the estate, you will need to take care of the natural surroundings, the landscape, free from extraneous buildings.  At the moment, this goal is fully unattainable due to the large number of buildings of private owners in this territory.  However, investors decided to recreate the lost wings of the front yard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recovery work" class="if uuid-2719192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719192.jpg"></div><h2>  Restoration progress </h2><p>  Work has been ongoing for several years.  Like a phoenix, a magnificent building rises from the ashes, acquiring its former shape.  The roof is already installed, floors are restored.  It is planned to open a hotel here, in which everyone can touch history, becoming an inhabitant of a mysterious noble estate from the distant past. </p><p>  The courage of the decision to prevent the magnificent building from perishing by breathing new life into it is respectable.  Thirty years ago, in the 1980s, it was planned to restore this house in order to open a dispensary there for employees of the local factory.  However, even then, the authorities concluded that such a project was disadvantageous due to the strong destruction of the building.  Local residents in the 1970s were taken away by many details of the construction of building materials.  But then she was in much better condition than at the present time.  Before the restoration began, the palace literally lived out its last days, a couple of years separated from its final destruction, at best.  The main task of the restoration work is to precisely restore the lost monuments of antiquity. </p><h2>  Historical accuracy </h2><p>  It is important to note that the building is being restored in accordance with a historically accurate plan to the extent possible.  The construction even involved the elderly, who once lived in the main building in Soviet times. </p><p>  So, during the restoration, the memories of R. A. Kotova, who was born in 1937 in the estate and spent all her childhood years in it, are used.  According to her story, modern architects use her advice, because she remembers where the sculptures were located in the building, their condition.  She showed where the underground passages that led to the river were located.  She pointed out that in the park area there were many sculptures in the form of owls, and the fountain was with a stone frog.  According to her confession, she would like to look at this complex again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alxlav.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In Pushchino-on-Nara" class="if uuid-2719203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2719203.jpg"></div><p>  A pensioner lives 100 meters from the legendary building where she was born.  It is important to note that the roads around her house are in a deplorable state, like so much in the village.  With the beginning of the restoration, she, together with local residents, found hope that with the opening of the estate, the authorities will begin to restore local roads.  After all, it is impossible for the territory around the complex to demonstrate such a plight as it is now. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to get to the Pushchino-on-Nara estate?  The easiest way will be to get to the ancient place by car through the navigator.  The estate is located Pushchino-on-Nara in the Moscow region.  The road from Moscow will lead to Simferopol highway, then to Serpukhov.  Having passed through the city, you will need to call on the territory of the Pushchino settlement.  In it, find Proletarskaya street, which is the main road along which they enter the settlement.  The ruins will be visible directly from it, you will only need to peer into the rare trees.  And the easiest way is to find the outbuilding standing by the road.  A dirt road leads to the main building, so it‚Äôs quite possible to drive up to it by any car. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.9387645" data-lng="37.36067030000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/4/6/5/7465.png"></div><h2>  By public transport </h2><p>  The task is complicated when traveling by public transport.  You will need to take the train to Serpukhov.  Already in it, find the bus stop 29 to Gavshino.  After driving on it for about half an hour, get off at the stop at the railway crossing.  Further, the matter will remain small - from the stop you will need to walk literally 50 meters to get to the main building of the estate complex. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At the moment, restoration work in the estate continues.  And upon arrival here, you can see the scaffolding surrounding the estate rising from the ashes, which is gaining its majestic strength more and more every year.  A lot of local historians, historians and local residents are connected to the work, the preserved photo archives are used.  Due to the instability of the dollar, the work dragged on for a much longer period than originally planned.  Nevertheless, restorers still promise to restore the original appearance of the estate.  At least, due to the timeliness of the intervention, the building was already saved from imminent death, at the moment when it was in the balance from it.  Now travelers of the future will have a unique opportunity to plunge into the alluring luxury of the noble life of an era that has forever passed. </p>
