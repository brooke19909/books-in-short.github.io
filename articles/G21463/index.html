Features of the exchange of Russian money into Ukrainian and vice versa</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need to convert Russian rubles to hryvnias arises both among Russians traveling to Ukraine, and Ukrainians when returning home from Russia.  Accordingly, when moving in the opposite direction, it is necessary to transfer the hryvnia to Russian rubles.  In addition, the exchange of one currency for another is necessary for those who in the course of work make payments in both countries. </p><h2>  Currency Description </h2><p>  The national currency in Ukraine is the hryvnia.  Settlements in rubles on the territory of this country are not officially made.  The hryvnia is indicated by the set of letters UAH or by the numbers 980. </p>

    <p>  The ruble is a currency that has been used in Russia for a long time.  The ancestor of modern Russian money was the Soviet ruble, which was much less depreciated.  The modern ruble, according to the new standards, is indicated by the RUB symbols or by the numeric code 643. </p><p>  The hryvnia to the ruble for a long time was approximately 1: 4.  In 2014, the hryvnia depreciated significantly, and the rate was set at about 1: 3.  The hryvnia was and remains more expensive than the ruble.  This fact is neither positive nor negative from the point of view of the Russians, because the stability of the currency is important, not its actual rate.  The country may experience a very low exchange rate of the national currency with a high level of economic development, as evidenced by the <span>Japanese yen.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out the <span>exchange rate?</span> </h2><p>  Before you convert rubles into hryvnia or vice versa, you should familiarize yourself with the current rate.  It is better to do this immediately before the exchange operation, because the rate has been changing very often lately.  It is necessary to distinguish the official rate from the commercial one: you can change money only at the buy and sell rates. </p>

    <p>  Official rates, as well as average rates for buying and selling currencies, are published on the websites of central banks: the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian National Bank.  The course is changing every day. </p><p>  In addition, there are many sites where you can find built-in calculators, for example, on the websites of banks, on information resources, etc.  To use them, just select the direction of the exchange and enter the amount that is available for the operation. </p><p>  In addition, there is a very useful option from Google.  Enter in the search line: "XXX rubles in hryvnias" and immediately get the desired result.  Accordingly, the query “XXX hryvnias in rubles” will help to find out the result of the transfer of Ukrainian money to Russian.  You can enter the exact amount or round it to 1 rub. / 1 ​​UAH.  Kopeks are separated by a comma or a dot.  The course that appears as a result of such an operation will be calculated based on data from the American Citibank.  Rates at various banks in Russia and Ukraine may vary slightly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where can I convert rubles to hryvnias? </h2><p>  If you change <span>Russian money</span> to Ukrainian, then it is better to exchange in Russia, and vice versa.  In this case, you can count on a more favorable rate.  Cash can be exchanged at bank branches or exchange points.  If the money is on a ruble bank card, then they can be transferred to a hryvnia card. </p>

    <p>  In addition, when paying by card abroad, <span>foreign currency</span> is converted automatically.  Hryvnia can be withdrawn in Ukraine with a ruble card (details must be specified in your bank).  Under no circumstances should you use the services of money changers, because many of them are scammers. </p><h2>  What you need to know when using the exchanger? </h2><p>  Exchangers continue to be very popular in the territories of both countries.  In Russia, it is difficult to find an exchange point that accepts or issues <span>Ukrainian currency.</span>  However, they can be found in large cities near train stations, as well as in border zones.  In Ukraine, there is no such problem: rubles can be converted into hryvnias almost everywhere. </p><p>  To find the exchanger with the best rate, you can use the Internet: the necessary information, as a rule, is published on the information portals of the city.  In addition, you can call the hotlines of several banks and find out at what rate you can exchange money in their exchangers.  In Ukraine, you no longer need to present documents when exchanging currency. </p><h2>  Other exchange methods </h2><p>  In addition to exchangers, there are such ways of converting money: </p><ul><li>  Cash exchange at a bank branch.  Make sure the cashier provides such a service.  As a rule, departments in which rubles can be converted into hryvnias hang up information on the sale and purchase rates on the street. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Convert Russian Ruble to Ukrainian Hryvnia" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/428076.jpg" width="360"></div></li><li>  Transfer between accounts.  You can open accounts in different currencies in the same bank.  Then it will be possible to carry out transfers with automatic conversion. </li><li>  Withdraw money from the card.  Check if your card will be active when traveling abroad.  If so, then you can withdraw money from ATMs from the same card that you use in your country.  Money will be automatically converted at the current rate.  It must be remembered that when withdrawing money at foreign ATMs, the bank commission increases. </li></ul>
