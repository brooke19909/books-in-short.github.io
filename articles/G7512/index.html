    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  The Blue Wave Hotel (Crimea) is one of the best places on the peninsula for families with children.  Young guests are welcome here from any age, a playground, a games room are organized for them, and the menu in the dining room is designed in such a way that all the food, with rare exceptions, is perfect for them. </p><p>  Walking in the fresh air with the aromas of pine needles, sea and mountains, along with therapeutic procedures will strengthen the immunity of the kids, and sports games and communication with peers will allow you to not get bored of older children. </p><h2>  Terms of accommodation </h2><p>  The following rules apply at the hotel: check-in and check-out must be done no later than eight in the morning.  Please note that a tourist fee is required upon arrival - it is one percent of the total cost of the stay. </p><p>  Children under three years old without extra bed and meals are free of charge.  Extra beds for adults can be in all types of rooms, except for a double junior suite in the first building and triple accommodation options. </p><p>  Of the documents required a common passport, ticket and insurance policy.  For children, grab a birth certificate and health certificate. </p><p>  <em>It is important!</em> </p><p>  If you plan to visit the treatment center, you need to bring a spa card with you, since you cannot apply for it on the spot.  If you want to carry out treatment for a child, a card is also needed. </p><h2>  Weather in Alushta: when is the best time to go? </h2><p>  It seems that they have decided on the hotel, but everyone knows the fact that there is such a thing as a tourist season, and someone wants to find more hot sunny days, and someone wants more comfortable and cooler weather.  The weather in Alushta during the swimming season varies significantly: if in May-June this is on average twenty-twenty three degrees (such conditions will be good for pensioners and young children, only in the latter case it is better to go a little later, when the sea warms up), then July-August - twenty-six to twenty-eight heat.  August and the beginning of September are the highest tourist season, which means the most expensive vacation. </p>
