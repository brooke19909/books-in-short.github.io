    <h2>  Rest in Loo </h2><p>  Pensions, hotels, private sector, sanatoriums - here everyone can choose for themselves the most optimal type of accommodation.  Stretched along the seashore, the resort village offers guests a rest in an atmosphere of calm and warmth.  Many say that in Loo time flows differently.  Leaving turmoil and turmoil somewhere far away, tourists can enjoy the fresh mountain air and the amazing sea. </p><p>  Even at the height of the hot summer season, the air here is refreshingly cool.  And in combination with sea water, it has such a beneficial effect on the human body that it allows vacationers to get rid of many diseases.  Many people come here in the direction of doctors.  Experts recommend sunbathing and sea water for the prevention of diseases of the skin and nervous system, to regulate metabolism. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Loo hotels offer their guests a wide range of services.  For example, cafes almost always function on their territory, there are gazebos with barbecue facilities, a bathhouse or a sauna with a swimming pool, necessarily secured parking and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The staff of private hotels often organizes excursions for their clients to interesting places in the Greater Sochi area by personal car.  The traditional southern hospitality combined with the atmosphere of homeliness, attentive service and, most importantly, loyal prices will pleasantly surprise everyone, making your vacation simply unforgettable.  For example, in large hotels such as Kiparisovaya Usadba Hotel or Daniel, the cost of one night in a double room starts at 1400 rubles. </p><h2>  WaterLoo </h2><p>  Private Loo hotels offer a wide variety of services.  WaterLoo, which has a 3 * category and is located at the address: ul.  Pogranichnaya, 3. It is located fifty meters from the sea and has an outdoor pool on its territory.  Its infrastructure is fully consistent with the declared category;  at your service - buffet meals included in the price, garden, terrace, laundry, souvenir shop, depository safe, etc. </p><h2>  Boarding houses </h2><p>  The vast majority of them have their own beach or are within walking distance of the public.  Customer meeting is free in almost all guest houses.  Those that are located in the center of this resort village, where the main infrastructure is concentrated - shops, restaurants, entertainment, are more suitable for young people, and not for a calm and measured rest, moreover, they are more expensive.  Judging by the reviews, it is considered quite good, for example, the Mountain Air area, in which inexpensive hotels and pensions are built close to the seashore.  Loo is a resort that since Soviet times was considered a real health resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Loo" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1312374.jpg" width="413"></div>

Most tourists prefer to stay in rooms overlooking the Black Sea.  The price that many Loo pensions offer, as a rule, includes three meals a day, a swimming pool, a parking lot, the use of a beach complex and a sports base.  ‚ÄúAquaLoo‚Äù is not an exception (Dekabristov St., p. 78-b).  For example, a double room with <span>full board</span> here costs from two thousand rubles.  For treatment you need to pay extra.  The beach of this pension is considered the best in the region. </p><p>  Meals at AquaLoo can be obtained according to the buffet concept.  Like other similar Loo boarding houses, the prices of which are considered quite affordable, here doctors use the most modern medical equipment.  Their profile is the treatment of gynecological, cardiovascular diseases, as well as disorders of the nervous system. </p><h2>  Description of LOK "Mountain air" </h2><p>  Many health resorts and pensions Loo offer customers to take a course of restoration with mud or mineral waters.  The Mountain Air boarding house (Loo, Taganrogskaya St., 3) is no exception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Loo pensions" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1312371.jpg" width="600"></div>  This modern complex is located in an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Black Sea coast.  Leisure, which is offered to tourists, will appeal to both adults and children, because both entertainment and services are designed for all guests, regardless of their age.  A modern water park and swimming pools, sports grounds and animation, a gym, treatment rooms, cafes, high-quality Internet - this is not a complete list of the services and entertainment that the Gorny Vozdu boarding house offers.

    <p>  Loo is a place where you can relax and have fun.  The resort complex called "Mountain Air" has a large and landscaped area.  It is in close proximity to the small pebble beach. </p><h2>  "Ivushka" </h2><p>  Like many other Loo boarding houses, Ivushka (Luchezarnaya, p. 14) offers not only a pleasant and carefree vacation, but also wellness programs.  A year ago, it was renovated and updated the housing stock and all public areas, an elevator is working, there is a children's room.  Its territory of two and a half hectares fits beautifully into the landscape.  There is a playground for children.  Lovers of active life will enjoy the night cinema.  A gym, billiards, courts and table tennis are also provided for clients. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Mountain Air Loo" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1312372.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many people choose "Mountain Air" for living.  The guests are satisfied with everything: the number of rooms, food, treatment, and, most importantly, prices.  The boarding house staff, judging by the reviews, works harmoniously and professionally.  Seminars and other events can be held in the conference room for up to two hundred people.  Many of those who came here intend to return to this boarding house again.  <span>Loo, reviews</span> about the rest of which is mostly positive, annually receives a huge army of tourists from all over Russia and Europe. </p><p>  Beautiful territory, a lot of greenery, proximity to the sea, wonderful air - this is how many tourists speak about rest in the Ivushka boarding house.  Of course, there are those who were dissatisfied with the comfort of their rooms.  I must say that the boarding house does not have the highest stardom, so you should not expect the atmosphere of a fashionable hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boarding house loo reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1312373.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  But the nutrition, treatment and work of the staff of the ‚ÄúWaterLoo‚Äù boarding house are highly appreciated.  Five minutes walk from the sea, and three hundred meters from the street, where there are many cafes.  The beach next to the pension is very calm and comfortable. </p><p>  And "Mountain Air", and "WaterLoo", and "Ivushka", and "AquaLoo" are very popular among tourists.  In high season they are completely crowded, which is another indication that these hotels and pensions Loo offer the highest quality vacation. </p>
