Women's nightgown</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every woman can sew a nightgown.  The details of the decor will depend on the skill of the dressmaker, but the basis will not change.  In a few hours, a piece of material will turn into a new thing.  There are so many different types of knitted lace, ribbons, nets and appliqu√©s on the shelves of sewing shops!  Of course, you can buy a ready-made nightdress.  You will not have to build a pattern for it, but an independently sewn thing has the warmth of human hands.  This is a good gift for a loved one and the opportunity to take care of him. </p><p>  On the same pattern, you can sew a summer dress, sundress, topic or tunic.  So this is in every way a useful activity.  Usually, even a tailoring and sewing course begins with sewing a nightdress.  On the processing of the neck, hem, side seams, mastery is practiced.  On the construction of flirts, pockets, collars - modeling. </p><h2>  Size: fabric count </h2><p>  The principle of constructing a pattern of a nightdress is that the drawing is repelled from the most voluminous place of the body.  Someone has breasts, someone has hips.  Be that as it may, you will need two pieces of fabric with a width equal to half the control volume plus an increase of ten centimeters to freedom.  If the selected material has a width, for example, 80 centimeters, then for women's clothing will have to buy four lengths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY nightdresses" class="if uuid-3186571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3186571.jpg"></div><p>  This product parameter is measured from the seventh cervical vertebra through the highest point of the chest to the length that is intended.  At the same time, it is necessary to stand directly so that distortions in measurements are not obtained.  It is better to ask someone to help take measurements.  Five centimeters per hem are added to each part.  If the fabric is calculated in a store, five centimeters are added to this number and multiplied by two or four, depending on the width of the fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To process the seams and the neckline, you need a slanting inlay to match the tone of the fabric.  Some, on the contrary, choose a contrast, and then it acts as an element of decor.  Threads are cotton, size 50 for chintz and 40 for flannel.  They, too, are matched to the tone of the fabric.  It is better to choose lace, seam, braid, ribbons, having material with you.  It will be a shame if the purchased decor does not fit the color. </p><h2>  One-piece sleeve product </h2><p>  The nightdress should be comfortable, not to impede movements.  According to the principle of a pattern of a nightgown, the lower Russian shirt was sewn in antiquity.  Instead of tucks, assemblies were made on ribbons.  The sewing place of two pieces of canvas was closed with embroidery.  The nightdress can also be made in the Russian style and trimmed with ethnic motifs.  She will hide the uneven seams that the beginner will make. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="One-piece nightgown" class="if uuid-3186693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3186693.jpg"></div><p>  For the first experiment, choose a model with a minimum number of seams, cuts, without coquette and set-in sleeves.  If the material allows, you can build a pattern directly on it on the wrong side.  To do this, you need a washable felt-tip pen.  Those who are afraid to work as a felt-tip pen can purchase tailor-made colored crayons or take a remnant.  Get a clear, thin line. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the sleeve is carried out according to the principle of undershirts.  To do this, 24 centimeters (for 48 sizes) are laid off from the control point in both directions, drawing a square.  Add eight centimeters and draw a smooth rounding, as shown in the figure. </p><h2>  The simplest pattern: style selection </h2><p>  This model is a bit more complicated.  Fold the fabric in half to form a rectangle.  The fold passes along the shared thread.  The figure shows a simple pattern of a nightdress, built on the back of a piece of old wallpaper.  If you decide to use them, then pin the parts as close to the bend as possible.  How to build such a pattern will be shown below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sleeveless nightgown" class="if uuid-3186017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3186017.jpg"></div><p>  After marking the length of the product (point A - point 102), one fourth of the chest circumference is measured.  Draw a horizontal line.  Its level is determined by taking measurements.  A line of the side seam is drawn from it using the entire width of the fabric.  Adjust the length of the product.  The lower part is ready.  The upper one is built according to the drawing, using individual measurements.  The back of the nightgown is cut out in the same way - several lines are built at the control points and connected. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="TTABzAFYgIA" data-url="https://youtu.be/TTABzAFYgIA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/5/4/4/16544.jpg"></div><h2>  Camisole nightdress </h2><p>  Some models of underwear are very expensive.  Designers are working on their creation so that a woman in all outfits is good.  What to do when there is no money for elegant nightwear?  Many models can be sewn with your own hands.  To create an elegant dress for sleeping, you will need a base pattern of a semi-adjacent silhouette, which was removed from French clothes and put into Soviet production.  The dress sewn on it sits very well.  In older editions, you can even find drawings. </p><p>  The figure shows how to model a women's nightdress on the straps.  Sundresses and open dresses on the floor are sewn according to the same pattern.  The difference is only in the material from which the products are made.  For a nightdress, a satin or a cambric will do.  Cotton sewing in combination with a knitted fabric will look good. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Camisole nightgown" class="if uuid-3186119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3186119.jpg"></div><p>  When modeling, the chest lateral tuck closes, and at the same time it expands at the waist.  When a skirt is cut, these elements are not taken into account.  Insert lace strips from sewing.  In the side seams, six centimeters on the chest and 8-12 on the hips are added to freedom.  An elastic band is inserted into the sewing place of the skirt and bodice.  The length of the straps is determined individually.  A braid is inserted in the side seam. </p><h2>  Raglan nightgown pattern </h2><p>  A shirt model with such sleeves can be constructed in two ways: using the classic base of a semi-adjacent silhouette or a modern boho tunic pattern.  The figure shows how easy it is to do this in the second case.  The neck is gathered on a ribbon or elastic band and forms a beautiful line in a folk style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Raglan Sleeve Nightgown" class="if uuid-3186837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3186837.jpg"></div><p>  with such a model, you can arbitrarily increase the length of the sleeves or the bottom of the product.  It is easy to build.  Its minus is that a beginner can easily confuse a sleeve with a shelf or back.  Therefore, it is necessary to mark not only the very detail of the pattern of the nightgown, but also the side seams, the neck and the seam of the sleeve.  Then it will be impossible to get confused. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A fascinating journey into the world of creating clothes begins with tailoring the very first product.  For someone it will be a simple nightdress.  Pattern with or without sleeves is not so important.  The main thing is the beginning of a creative path. </p>
