  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development of sociology in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The history of sociology</span> in Russia began to emerge in the 60s of the 19th century.  It was at this time that the reading public and the scientific community first became acquainted with translations of articles and books by O. Comte.  The widespread dissemination of Russian sociology was in every possible way restrained by censorship of Comte's ideas, as well as a decline in foreign interest in positivism after his death.  The wave of ‚Äúsecond reading‚Äù by O. Comte, which swept the developed countries and France, captured Russia.  In the magazines "Russian Word", "Contemporary", "Domestic Notes", etc.  articles about sociology and O. Conte began to appear, written by VV Lesevich, P. L. Lavrov, D. I. Pisarev. </p><p>  The first Russian sociologists made a huge contribution to the development of sociology in Russia: the founders of this science Kareev, Yuzhakov, Mikhailovsky, Lavrov, etc.  They made their contribution to the development of sociology in Russia by forming their own approach to the knowledge and <span>study of social</span> phenomena.  They viewed society through the prism of the behavior of its individuals, especially purposeful, developed, active people - a subjective method.  One of the works of N. K. Mikhailovsky was called - "Heroes and the crowd."  The development of sociology in Russia was marked by the following problems: the emergence of a human person from an animal, the progress of society and the division of labor, the ratio of natural and social to the development of society, and the impact on economic progress. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sociology in Russia by the beginning of the 20th century already had certain achievements.  The development of sociology in Russia by that time was marked by the expansion of the range of problems studied, the following areas are emerging: psychological, geographical, materialistic.  At this time, Russian sociology began to influence the development of long-existing sciences: history, <span>law, philosophy</span> and other <span>social sciences.</span> </p><p>  If we talk about the stages of development of sociology in Russia, then the formation, the emergence of sociology in Russia, which lasted from the 60s to the 90s of the 19th century, can be completely attributed to the first stage.  It was at this time that sociological ideas spread, and directions of sociological thought were formed, which were rooted in the Russian sciences. </p><p>  The history of sociology in Russia considers the period from 90 years of the 19th century to the 20s of the 20th century as the second stage of development - institutionalization is taking place, i.e., it is recognized by society and the state, the creation of scientific institutions, departments and departments, foundation of societies and scientific journals, etc. </p><p>  At this stage, the development of sociology in Russia took place in close collaboration with foreign, namely European sociology. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in the 1920s.  an increasingly wary and hostile attitude towards sociological science is being formed on the part of the Soviet government.  This stage ended with the closure of sociological institutions, and sociologists with non-Marxist views and teachings were expelled from Russia or sent to camps for "re-education."  Since 1922, they close departments and stop studying in sociology at universities, the Sociological Society founded by M. M. Kovalevsky closes. </p><p>  The third stage in Russian sociology was the ‚Äúblackest‚Äù and lasted from the 1920s.  until the 1950s.  During this period, sociology receives the label of "bourgeois science" and is supplanted by <span>Marxist-Leninist philosophy</span> and scientific communism. </p><p>  A new partial institutionalization began only after the "personality cult" of Stalin was condemned, but the development of sociology was restrained by the CPSU and it was not widely used in society. </p><p>  The modern, fourth stage began in the 1980s and was marked by the rapid development of Russian <span>sociology.</span>  <span>Sociology</span> receives the status of an independent science and is taught in all Russian universities. </p><p>  Having gone through all the stages of the development of sociology in Russia, we see that it has more than a century and a half history.  Due to the fact that this is one of the rapidly developing sciences, the gaps in our knowledge of social relations and society are gradually being filled, we are gradually catching up with the national sociology schools of developed countries that have gone forward. </p>
