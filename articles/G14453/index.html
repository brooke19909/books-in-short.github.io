For tourists, the Oasis Marine 4 * hotel may be of interest primarily because it is located on the coast itself, surrounded by a real palm garden.  Stunningly beautiful nature in combination with the sea and white sand is a paradise for relaxation. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Oasis Marine 4 * is located 13 kilometers from Zarzis and 45 kilometers from the airport.

Breakfast includes cereal, milk, croissants, toasts, jam, cakes, fruits, freshly squeezed juices.  Everything is very tasty, but some tourists find this food too monotonous.  This is not entirely true.  Rather, breakfast can be called light.  This is due to the fact that most of the tourists are French and Swedes.  They do not welcome hearty breakfasts.  But for lunch and dinner there is a lot of food, and it is varied.  A lot of meat and fish dishes, as well as vegetables and snacks.  Of the fruits, the hotel serves melons, nectarines, watermelons, grapes, plums.  For dinner and lunch on the tables must have wine (red and pink). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 tunisia zarzis" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496661.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In total, the hotel has two restaurants, a pizzeria, a nightclub, three bars and two cafes.  The all-inclusive food system allows vacationers to try a large number of wonderful dishes performed by a local chef. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Oasis Marine 4 * (Zarzis) is a beautiful hotel on the coast, having just a huge territory.  All buildings of the complex and bungalows are surrounded by a palm grove.  The hotel will appeal to those tourists who like to relax in the lap of nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Despite the orientation of the Oasis Marine 4 * (Djerba) to the family contingent, the hotel is always happy for business people, and therefore a well-equipped conference room is at their disposal.  There are also several shops with souvenirs and goods for tourists on site.  You can rent a car at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 zarzis" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Very often, operators provide inaccurate information regarding the location of the complex, indicating that it is located on the island of Djerba.  This is not entirely true.  Indeed, tourists fly to the airport of Djerba, and then they transport them by bus across the island and the isthmus to the very edge of the mainland.  Of course, the Oasis Marine 4 * hotel (Tunisia) belongs to the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDjerba, but is located on the mainland.  This location makes it convenient to visit all the main attractions of the island, and at the same time you can go on a two-day trip to the Sahara. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Oasis Marine 4 * (Tunisia, Zarzis) has an indoor and outdoor heated pool.  It offers guests - two saunas, a fitness center, steam room, tennis courts, massage sessions, table tennis, mini-golf.  Due to the fact that the hotel is located on the coast, a large number of water activities are offered: <span>sailing,</span> windsurfing and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 jerba" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Oasis Marine 4 * offers its guests good animation.  It employs a professional team of animators who know their job.  Throughout the day, sporting events are organized, which tourists unobtrusively invigorate.  In the evenings, guests can enjoy music programs and shows. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The hotel is located right on the beach, and therefore you can walk to the beach in two minutes, depending on which bungalow you live in.  The coast is equipped with sun loungers and reed umbrellas.  The whole beach is the finest white sand.  The same sandy bottom and the sea.  Entry into the water is very smooth, without a single stone.  Sanding lasts quite a while.  It is very convenient for kids to swim here, there is a great opportunity to wallow around the coast.  A hotel worker is on duty at the beach all the time, watching over your things, he will also help you put a sunbed in the right place. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  The hotel is located near the town of Zarzis.  It is unremarkable, so there is nothing special to look at.  The main attractions are the shipyard and the archaeological museum.  South of Zarzis there is a road leading to the spit that separates El Bibane Bay from the Mediterranean Sea.  This is a very beautiful place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Zarzis harbor, a market is held on Fridays, which shoppers can visit.  Here you can see pirate ships built for tourists.  Local guides offer many sightseeing tours: </p><ol><li>  To have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe life of the Berber nomads, you can visit their desert settlements. </li><li>  Jeep safari in the Sahara. </li><li>  Overnight camel trip in the desert. </li><li>  Overview of troglodyte dwellings. </li><li>  A trip to the spice market in Gabes. </li></ol><p>  No less interesting is the island of Djerba.  Most of its attractions are concentrated in the capital of Houmt Souk.  The city is located in the north of the island.  It consists of clay houses, in the labyrinths of its streets you can find many shops with souvenirs and other goods, see ancient mosques, museums and monuments.  Here you can just walk and see the life of the local population.  Relaxing in the south of Tunisia, you will find a lot of entertainment to your liking. </p><h2>  Oasis Marine 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, let's turn to the reviews of guests who have been here.  I would like to note that even demanding tourists are very pleased with their vacation in Oasis Marine 4 * (Djerba).  Guest reviews - the best indicator of the success of the complex.  Although the hotel does not have a five-star status, and according to various tour operators, it has 3 or 4 stars, nevertheless many guests really like it, leaving in their hearts the desire to return here again. </p><p>  First of all, according to guests, the hotel impresses with its vast territory.  Despite its size, staff clean it daily and look for cleanliness.  The complex is located on the first line, or rather, right on the beach.  Bungalows are scattered throughout the territory, some of them are closer to the coast, and some are further away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 tunisia" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496650.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Three-story buildings have rooms.  According to some vacationers, they are more spacious and new than apartments in a bungalow.  However, it‚Äôs hard to say where it‚Äôs better to relax.  It's a matter of taste.  People who prefer outdoor recreation praise the bungalows very much.  Others, on the contrary, like standard rooms.  The hotel is not new, and therefore the furniture is appropriate.  However, everything works properly in the apartments. </p><p>  Tourists living in the bungalow note the presence of tropical animals inside the apartments at night.  There are no insects in the main building.  The staff explains their presence in the bungalow by the fact that palm trees grow nearby, hence the living creatures. </p><p>  Room maids are cleaned daily.  If you leave a tip, then towels and bed linen are also changed every day.  In general, the hotel all the staff is very welcoming and friendly.  The service is up to standard.  As for the Internet, there is free Wi-Fi at the reception.  The speed is normal, even allowing you to use Skype.  In addition, the reception has a computer for tourists.  It has an inscription that the use is paid, but no one actually requires money, so you can safely use it. </p><h2>  Food: reviews </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to reviews regarding food in the hotel.  Almost all guests are very satisfied, noting an unprecedented variety of delicious dishes, which is rare for a four-star complex.  A local chef prepares many different dishes of meat and fish, sometimes served with shrimp.  Every day a lot of sweets: cakes, pastries, several varieties of ice cream.  After lunch, the bar begins to work, it is possible to take not only soft drinks, but also sweets left after breakfast and lunch.  The hotel serves delicious freshly squeezed juices from grapefruit and oranges.  The local wine is quite tasty, it makes no sense to order imported alcohol, but the cocktails in the bar do not differ in variety.  The main restaurant has a beautiful outdoor terrace, which is very nice to eat.  It has very prudently placed glass shields that cover the tables from the wind.  It is much nicer to eat here than indoors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis marine 4 djerba reviews" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The great advantage of the hotel is its location.  Not every complex can boast of being on the shore.  The beach of the hotel is clean and beautiful, there are no crowds, vacationers always have enough space, there is no need to take places.  The sea is cleaner in the morning, after lunch sometimes a wave appears, then the water becomes a little cloudy.  From time to time, algae are nailed to the shore by the wind.  The hotel staff removes them, taking them out of the beach.  The sea is always warm, but after three hours the water resembles fresh milk. </p><h2>  Animation and entertainment: reviews </h2><p>  Another advantage of the complex is its good animation.  During the day, guests can play basketball, volleyball with the animators, do gymnastics and water aerobics, archery, and take part in various competitions.  In the evening, after dinner, a mini-disco awaits tourists, after which older people dance for half an hour.  And then the show begins: a cabaret, Mr. and Mrs. hotel, and much more.  After 23.00, vacationers wishing to continue the evening move to the club on site. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that in general the reviews about the Oasis Marine 4 * hotel (about. Djerba) are very good.  Of course, there are minor flaws in the complex, but they are not so significant.  The hotel has several advantages, thanks to which it can be safely recommended to vacationers. </p>
