    <p>  <span>It is</span> simply impossible to find features in the design of the <span>Lenovo A526</span> .  The device is incredibly similar to its predecessors and has absolutely no external zest.  Not knowing the characteristics of the device, you can simply pass by. </p><p>  The front part of the standard got a display, a camera, touch buttons, sensors and, of course, the company logo. </p><p>  Behind is the speaker, the sign of the company, as well as the main camera. </p><p>  The top end has become a haven for the USB jack and headphone jack, and on the side are the volume and power buttons. </p><p>  As you can see, the appearance of the device is not particularly attractive.  And given the fact that most users choose the device by design, most likely, <span>Lenovo A526</span> does not expect due popularity. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The weak point of the device can rightfully be considered the display.  Equipped <span>"Lenovo A526"</span> pretty good diagonal as much as 4.5 inches.  Size, of course, falls short of advanced models, but also not very small. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Problems begin with the matrix used, namely the outdated TFT.  Naturally, there are successful screens with this technology, but the A526 is not the case. </p><p>  Provided the device with a resolution of only 854 by 480. For a screen measuring 4.5 inches, this is an incredibly poor performance.  Even if you do not look closely, the pixels on the display are noticeable.  By the way, Ppi is only 218 units. </p><p>  The screen of the device is incredibly bad, and the low cost is not an excuse.  The Lenovo company produced devices with a similar price and a much better display. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The camera turned out to be no less bad.  "Lenovo A526" received only 5 megapixels, and without a flash and useful functions in the form of autofocus.  Accordingly, the pictures are obtained of terrible quality even for a budget device. </p><p>  Only 0.3 megapixel front cameras are not particularly surprising after meeting with the main camera.  Of course, it is quite enough for video calling. </p><h2>  Filling </h2>

    <p>  A more pleasant detail will be the hardware of Lenovo A526.  Technical specifications are really powerful and look weird against the background of other shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the device was equipped with a frequently used MTK processor with as many as four cores.  Each frequency is 1.3 GHz.  The Lenovo A526 phone can be safely equated with more expensive brothers in performance. </p><p>  A gigabyte of RAM is also installed.  Such a memory is quite enough for the device to perform most modern tasks.  Of course, the quality of the display will not allow you to fully appreciate HD or enjoy advanced games. </p><p>  The phone has only 4 GB of internal memory.  Given the system, only 2-2.5 GB will be available for use.  The memory is really very small, and the owner will have to worry about increasing the capacity.  A flash drive will help fix this problem, the device accepts cards up to 32 GB. </p><p>  Most likely, such one-sidedness arose due to the miscalculation of the company.  Otherwise, it is very difficult to justify the incredible prevalence of the filling over all other parameters. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The Lenovo A526 smartphone operates on the basis of Android 4.2.  For a budget device, this is the most suitable system.  "Android 4.2" will help the device to show its best side when working with applications. </p><p>  The phone, like all Lenovo, has acquired the company's proprietary shell.  There are no noticeable shortcomings, and this suggests that everything was perfectly worked out. </p><p>  If necessary, there is always the opportunity to upgrade the system to a more modern counterpart. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The capacity of the native battery A526 is 2000 mAh.  To a budget employee having a similar display, this is enough in full. </p><p>  The approximate duration of work with active use is 5 hours.  Most of the charge is spent on filling the device. </p><p>  Naturally, changing the battery to a more powerful analog will be a good solution, but this is in case of emergency.  The battery is enough for the device. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the device comes a USB cable, adapter, manual, headphones. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Lenovo A526 has few advantages.  Technical characteristics of the filling are on top and worthy of attention.  The excellent performance provided by the processor will come in handy in work and entertainment. </p><p>  There are also minor advantages in the form of working with two SIM cards and supporting the most necessary standards.  Also, an excellent version of Android allows you to realize the capabilities of the device as well as possible. </p><p>  The biggest advantage in the device is its cost.  For about 4 thousand rubles you can get a pretty decent phone. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  There are much more minuses in the device.  The most noticeable of them can be considered a bad display.  Applying outdated technology to a device released in 2014 is just a terrible mistake.  In addition to the TFT matrix, the smartphone received a low resolution, which is absolutely not suitable for 4.5 inches. </p><p>  The smartphone camera also leaves much to be desired.  The 5 megapixels acceptable for the devices of the past years look somewhat wretched on a device manufactured in 2014. The lack of mass of functions necessary for the camera also affects.  What can I say if there is not even the simplest flash. </p><p>  A painful point is the memory of the mobile phone.  Only two gigabytes available to the user do not look particularly attractive.  One gets the impression that the company is consciously pushing owners to buy a flash drive.  Even for a budget employee, the installed memory looks very modest. </p><p>  Design is also worth referring to the disadvantages.  Of course, an interesting appearance from a cheap device is not expected, but I want a highlight.  The predecessors from series A in almost every device had something individual. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The <span>reviews</span> left about the <span>Lenovo A526</span> tend to <span>suggest</span> that the device is good.  Despite the mass of shortcomings, the device actually turned out to be solid. </p><p>  Value for money smooths all the disadvantages of the device.  It will be impossible to find a desktop-performance device for the inherent A526 price. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Even among the budget category, the smartphone looks intriguing.  There is hope that the Chinese manufacturer will take into account all the shortcomings made in the A526, and will be able to come to a balance of all characteristics. </p>
