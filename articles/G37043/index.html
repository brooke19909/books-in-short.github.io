    <h2>  The creation of the North German Union: prerequisites </h2><p>  At the end of the seventeenth century, the ideas of nation states spread more and more in Europe.  Ethnicity is playing an increasingly important role for the common people and the intelligentsia.  At that time, the borders of many countries passed depending on the influence of its ruling elite, often without taking into account the national composition.  The German people are divided among many city states.  Centers of culture are located in Bavaria, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and many other cities.  However, two powers are fighting for supremacy in the so-called German world - Austria and Prussia.  During the invasion of Napoleon, more and more people are imbued with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting the entire German people in one state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of the north german union" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1292978.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, large feudal lords still have a decisive role in socio-political life.  For them, fragmentation plays an important role.  Since in such conditions they have unlimited rights and can calmly and unconsciously rule within their possessions.

Owners of private ownership of the means of production are looking for ever new markets.  And a huge number of states and, accordingly, borders complicate this process.  In the interests of this class, a customs union was concluded between many German cities, but discontent grew. </p><p>  Perfectly seeing all these processes, as well as taking as an example the experience of neighboring European states, Prussia and Austria are heading for the unification of German lands.  However, the powerful Austria does not have serious authority, especially in the north of the River Main.  And Prussia was too weak to withstand such a major player.  Here <span>Otto von Bismarck</span> appears on the political scene <span>.</span>  Germany owes much to this policy, since it was he who took a fresh look at the existing problem and found a way out of it. </p><p>  The bourgeoisie gained strength and now demanded political unity.  Prussia began to prepare for war.  Bismarck patiently created an army, taking into account new technologies and modern methods of warfare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Germany" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1292980.jpg" width="394"></div>  He perfectly understood that it was impossible to achieve the goals of the foreign policy without military operations against Austria.  When the army was ready, it only remained to find a reason.

In particular, they occupied Schleswig and Gastein.  Moreover, the contract was very complicated.  Both states had rights to these territories, and both had administrations there.  This is what Bismarck took advantage of.  Germany at this time increasingly felt the spread of the influence of Prussia. </p><p>  The Iron Chancellor (Bismarck's nickname) began to actively claim his rights to the disputed region.  The Austrian emperor understood the futility of possessing Gastein, since the region was cut off from the empire.  Therefore, he willingly went to negotiations.  Austria proposed on favorable terms to transfer territories to Prussia.  However, Bismarck refused.  Then the emperor began to look for allies for the upcoming war.  The future North German Union was designated even then.  Many states north of Main began to unite in an anti-Austrian coalition. </p><h2>  Excellence of Prussia </h2><p>  Bismarck also managed to conclude an alliance with Italy.  He began to aggravate the situation in the disputed regions, provoking the empire to declare war.  As a result, the Prussian troops occupied Gastein.  In mid-June, hostilities began.  The technical backwardness of the Austrian army did not allow it to organize a successful defense.  Many states did not have time to mobilize before Prussia occupied their territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bismarck germany" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1292979.jpg" width="600"></div>  Also, a few days after the outbreak of the war, Italy joined it.  The war on two fronts, as well as the technical superiority of the enemy, did not give Austria a single chance.  The war was won in seven weeks.  The creation of the North German Union made it possible for the new center of the "German world" to appear.

    <h2>  After victory </h2><p>  After a lightning victory, Prussia began to annex more and more territories.  Many states that declared neutrality at the start of the war were occupied.  Under pressure from the bourgeoisie, many cities joined in the south of Main.  The open borders, the absence of duties and the law loyal to traders allowed the North German Union to become very attractive for owners of private ownership of the means of production.  The state also actively promoted the Pan-German ideas of unification and fraternity, which favorably affected the image of the union in the common people. </p><h2>  Final union </h2><p>  The North German alliance with Prussia at the head was growing stronger day by day.  He began to claim all German lands.  Various military alliances were concluded with the so-called southern states (regarding the River Main).  But they were not enough to fully join the union.  Therefore, Bismarck conceived a new war.  The history of Germany is inextricably linked with France in terms of the struggle for dominance in the region.  Therefore, after a few years, Paris begins to put pressure on Emperor Wilhelm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north german union with prussia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1292986.jpg" width="453"></div>  The formal cause of the war was the Spanish crisis, in which France and the North German Union supported different candidates for the throne.  Despite the efforts of William to prevent bloodshed, the war was unleashed.  Like the Austro-Prussian, it began in the summer.  A year later, the French army was defeated, and the union finally annexed all German lands.  The history of Germany, in the form in which it exists now, begins precisely from this moment.
