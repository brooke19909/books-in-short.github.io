  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted coat is more relevant than ever</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fashion for homemade things is gaining more and more popularity every year, and the undisputed leader here is knitting.  <span>Knits are</span> beautiful, comfortable, unique, because depending on the yarn and the manner of knitting, the same model for different people can turn out differently.  Yes, the knitting process itself is very exciting and beneficial for the emotional state and <span>emotional balance,</span> and the use of fine motor skills guarantees excellent memory - it is rightfully loved not only by ladies of all ages, but many men are proud of their ability to knit. </p><p>  One of the trends of recent years has become a knitted coat.  This beautiful and practical thing is constantly present in many collections of the most famous fashion houses.  As a rule, these are thin coats, in fact, elongated cardigans, but warm coarse clothes are also found.  A knitted coat goes well with almost any clothing and shoes, but stylists recommend wearing delicate things with tight tights, light dresses and ankle boots, and warm thick-knit coats are perfect for jeans.  In principle, when served correctly, knitted coats will fit even in a business suit. </p><p>  There are two ways to knit such a thing - using a hook and knitting.  If <span>crocheted coats</span> have a more decorative load or are designed to visually adjust the figure, which, by the way, works great, then a knitted coat is not only a very beautiful, but also a warm thing that can warm and protect against wind.  Such a knitted coat are just the favorites of the season.  The most relevant are subtle, pastel tones, but there are also bright models of ultra-saturated shades.  They are relevant for the spring or autumn period, when the temperature fluctuates around 18-20 degrees, that is, it is not cold and not hot, and it is really difficult to pick up something. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Warm knitted coats are a more universal thing.  They practically replace the usual coat, only have a wide variety of shapes, textures, shades and possible decor.  If an ordinary coat assumes mainly a <span>classic style,</span> less often romantic or military, then a knitted one has a huge freedom of choice.  Especially significant is the fact that with independent knitting you can choose exactly the shade that is necessary, which can not be said about the <span>classic coat,</span> which usually becomes the thing on the basis of which the rest of the wardrobe is formed. </p><p>  So, we figured out knitted coats for adults, but that's not all: such a thing would be useful in the wardrobe of little fashionistas.  A knitted coat for a girl is no less relevant than for her mother.  The sets of coats and berets made in the same technique are especially interesting: such a set looks very cool and can create a harmonious ensemble with any children's clothing.  Coats for girls, unlike adults, can be knitted quickly enough, and the choice of colors and decor elements for children's clothes is simply huge, so this is also an exciting creative work. </p><p>  Of course, the most fashionable coats from thin knitwear are now rarely anyone can handle manually, rather, this is work for a knitting machine, but children‚Äôs or coats made of thick yarn are knitted easily and interestingly.  An experienced craftswoman will tie such a coat quickly enough, but beginners need to prepare for the season in advance and choose simpler models.  But a knitted coat is almost guaranteed to be a unique thing, since not everyone decides to do such a large-scale work, but the result is worth it!  You get a very practical, convenient and unique thing of fantastic beauty, which immediately becomes a universal subject of envy, and thus stand out from the crowd. </p>
