    <p>  Naturally, when planning a trip, you need to take into account not only official information, but also the opinion of tourists who have already managed to spend some time here.  Indeed, from former guests sometimes you can get a lot more valuable information.  So what they say about the hotel complex Heritage Village Club Goa 4 *? </p><p>  The reviews that guests leave are by and large positive.  The territory here is really beautifully arranged, it is pleasant to walk along it, and they clean it regularly.  The presence of a bar in the center of the pool is also considered by many tourists as a good idea.  By the way, the food at the hotel is really at a high level - there are enough meat and seafood dishes, and traditional Indian food with an abundance of spices has a special label (if you do not like these dishes).  The availability of good food is considered an important advantage, since not all hotels in Goa offer such a service. </p><p>  The rooms are cozy and beautiful, cleaned here every day, so the rooms are always really clean.  Some travelers say that household appliances are not new.  Nevertheless, it works properly.  The presence in the room of tea, coffee, sugar and utensils greatly simplifies life. </p><p>  The main advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the incredibly beautiful beach covered with crisp white sand - here you can enjoy the scenery and silence for a long time, since there are few tourists on the site.  The employees are very hospitable and delicate - it is always nice to communicate with them (by the way, some people understand Russian quite well). </p><p>  In general, tourists recommend the hotel Heritage Village Club Goa 4 *.  India is a magnificent country, but in terms of quality of service, it lags behind such "monsters" of the tourism business, such as Turkey or Egypt.  This in no way prevents travelers from spending holidays here, but you need to understand what to count on.  By the way, the prices here will also please you, especially considering the quality of accommodation and service.  Most of the guests here are regular customers, which also testifies in favor of the hotel. </p>
