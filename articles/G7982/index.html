Rumor has it that even 4 years before the birth of the first Apple computer, the beautiful mother of Steve Wozniak sent him a fateful article from a magazine called "Esquire", which was called "Secrets of the blue box."  It talked about the so-called hackers of the time, who found a way to penetrate the secret telephone lines of the CIA and the US government.  This article inspired Steve to assemble the same type of equipment.  After some time of painstaking labors, he got something similar.

    <p>  <span>Steve Wozniak</span> created miracle boxes, and his friend <span>Steve Jobs</span> sold them.  The guys were very keen on improving their apparatus.  Jobs was soon expelled from college. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

During the day, they worked, and at night they designed their first Apple.  The history of the name Apple is also quite interesting.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis name belongs to Jobs.  Wozniak wanted to call the device "Executive" or "Matrix Electronics."  But the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJobs prevailed, as he had one very important advantage - he occupied first place in the telephone directory.  So, jokingly, the history of Apple developed.

    <p>  So, the time has come to unveil the veil of secrecy over the main question of which year Apple was formed.  This happened on April 1, 1976.  On this day, an agreement was signed on the creation of the company.  The staff consisted of three people, it included Wozniak, Jobs and Wayne.  The latter was engaged in technical documentation. </p><p>  To create the first copies of Apple, the guys had to sacrifice a lot.  For example, Jobs sold a minibus, and Wozniak sold a programmable calculator. </p><p>  Jobs was <span>looking for customers.</span>  This turned out to be a difficult task, but soon the owner of the world's first network of computer stores made an order for 50 devices, for each of which he was ready to pay $ 500.  But he had one important condition: it had to be an integral apparatus, since potential buyers would not want to assemble it in parts. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple story" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10439/9274.jpg" width="600"></div>  This order was both good fortune and unhappiness.  A huge amount of money was spent on the first batch of Apple devices.  Products arrived on store shelves, but sold out very slowly.

      <p></p>
    <p>  But the company, despite everything, continued its development, and by 1980 the number of its employees was about a thousand. </p><p>  Currently, few people wonder what year Apple was formed and what problems stood in the way of its development.  Now it is a popular company with which the most famous designers and programmers work.  Apple products are happy to buy both celebrities and ordinary people. </p>
