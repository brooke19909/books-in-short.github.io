In summer, many travelers flock to the beautiful beaches of Sicily, the Genoese Riviera and other coastal resorts.  In winter, fashionistas are beckoned by Christmas sales and fashion shows in Milan.  In the spring, tourists are attracted by the spectacular <span>carnival in Venice.</span>  And in the fall it is so nice to escape from the dampness of Russian cities to warm Tuscany or Romagna to get acquainted with the cultural heritage of Florence, Siena, Rome, Naples, Bergamo or Bologna.  Thus, flights to this European country are relevant at any time of the year.  Many travelers would like to know how much to fly to Italy from Moscow.  In this article we will try to answer this question.  It will not be monosyllabic, since Italy is a very elongated country from north to south. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Italy difference" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2203086.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What affects travel time </h2><p>  In addition to the distance that the liner will have to cover, there are other factors that significantly affect how many hours you have to spend between departure from Moscow and landing at your destination.  First of all, this is the choice of flight.  Fortunately, the capital of Russia and various <span>Italian cities</span> have direct routes.  But tickets for such flights, as a rule, are very expensive.  Therefore, budget travelers often choose roundabout routes.  Needless to say, how long it takes to fly to Italy from Moscow is most directly affected by the waiting time at the airport transit.  After all, the gap between connecting flights can be more than three hours spent on board the liner.  A small but nevertheless correction (for 10-15 minutes) make the brand of the aircraft and weather conditions.  But the congestion of the arrival airport may cause your airliner to make several honorary circles above the city before the controllers allow the pilot to land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Italy from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2203076.jpg"></div>

Consider this with the example of the capital of Italy.  The planes of two airlines daily leave for Rome from Moscow Sheremetyevo.  These are Russian Aeroflot and Italian Alitalia.  Both of them deliver their passengers to the Roman air harbor of Fiumicino in three hours and 50 minutes. </p><p>  Now consider Milan, which is located in the north of Italy.  How much to fly from Moscow to this haute couture center?  If you are loyal to Aeroflot (its airliners will start from Sheremetyevo), it will take 3 hours 35 minutes to get there.  In this case, the ticket will cost 11 thousand rubles.  The Italian competitor Meridiana (departure from Domodedovo) promises to deliver its customers to Milan-Malpensa in exactly the same time, but at a price from 5375 to 6415 rubles. </p><p>  Russian tourists have a poor choice if they want to get straight to Sicily.  From Sheremetyevo to Palermo, only one company makes regular flights - Alitalia.  But in the summer, charters join it.  Travel time is 4 hours and 20 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy how much to fly from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2203038.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  We fly with transfers </h2><p>  Tourists who often travel by air probably know what low-cost airlines are.  Low prices for airline tickets are also explained by the fact that the liners of such companies accept low-cost airports that are located near large cities.  In Milan it is Linate or Bergamo, in Venice - Treviso, in Rome - Ciampino.  But there are no direct budget flights from Russia to these air harbors.  We have to get with transfers.  How much to fly to Italy from Moscow in this way?  If you are interested in Rome as your destination, then Air Moldova with a transfer in Chisinau will take you to your destination in just five and a half hours.  Moreover, the issue price is 6575 rubles.  It‚Äôs even cheaper to fly with the Greek company Ecean.  An air ticket costs 4,800 rubles, but the travel time, due to waiting for a connecting flight in Athens, is delayed up to eight hours.  Sicily can be reached cheaply on board the Iberia with a transfer in Barcelona.  In Palermo you will be in eight and a half hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow time italy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2203060.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Time difference Moscow - Italy </h2><p>  The homeland of Petrarch and Leonardo da Vinci, although stretched from north to south, but all fits within the same time zone.  It is called UTC + 1. Plus one hour - this is in relation to Greenwich.  And in relation to Moscow, time in Italy lags behind.  And for the whole two hours.  You should know that time in Western, Central and Eastern Europe undergoes changes in the summer.  On the last Sunday of March, all timepieces move the hands an hour ahead.  And only at the end of October the clock again rearranged 60 minutes ago.  But in Russia there is no division between summer and winter time.  It is always the same.  Therefore, between Moscow and Italy the time difference in winter is two hours, and in summer - only 60 minutes. </p>
