With your own hands you can make massage, floor, developing, sensory, game, bedside, "puzzle", a stylish rug. </p><h2>  Round wicker rugs </h2><p>  For most people, the mat performs only one function - to protect the feet from cold linoleum, tile, floor.  Therefore, the craftswomen knit, weave, sew rectangular, <span>round carpets</span> from different materials, taking into account their location. </p><p>  There are warm, warm rugs by the bed.  One of the options for their creation is weaving.  To do this, cut old knitted things into wide, identical stripes so that you can then process the edges, folding the segments along the long side.  Divide the flaps into three piles to sew three ribbons. </p><p>  Now sew the top of the strips, begin to weave the braid to the end.  Then fold it in a spiral, stitching the sides together.  And so that the rug lasts longer, sew a dense fabric to the wrong side (as for furniture upholstery). </p>

    <p>  You can also make children's floor <span>mats from old things</span> (cotton, chintz, jeans, terry towels), just sort the fabric according to the texture.  Fringes can be sewn to the edges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From fabric </h2><p>  Good old rugs are made from old jeans, and various parts are used (pockets, dense fabric, like on a belt, jeans themselves, labels).  But to get the right amount of these elements, it will take a lot of time, so take the remaining fabric, cut into narrow strips (width about 2-2.5 centimeters). </p><p>  Sew roses from the strips.  The principle is the same as in the manufacture of satin flowers.  Twist the edge of the fabric with a tube, then, twisting and turning the tape, form a petal, fixing it with threads.  Sew the prepared roses to the base of the carpet (maybe also from jeans).  It turns out a dense flower rug. </p><p>  But from the fabric there may be rugs with a pattern.  Just tailor the base of the cover and plot applications.  It can be fabulous favorite characters or an arbitrary, for example, marine, theme.  Then sew the applications to the fabric base.  If you need a dense coating, then sew its upper part with lining filler and the wrong side of the mat. </p><h2>  DIY children's doormat: master class </h2><p>  The developmental mat from the previous ‚Äúpicture‚Äù coating is distinguished by removable, <span>volumetric applications,</span> multifunctionality, and educational orientation.  Depending on the age of the child, his interests, the product will have one or another plot.  The advantage of such rugs is that applications that are bored to the child can be replaced with new elements. </p><p>  To make developing children's rugs with toys for the baby, you will need fabric, a synthetic winterizer, a hoop, fastenings, and other accessories.  First, cut out the outer and inner part of the rug, a synthetic winterizer lining (so many layers to make the baby soft). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, sew different segments of colored fabric to the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the rug.  For example, four rectangles 21.5 cm wide, 63 cm and 100 cm long, a square with a side of 63 cm. In this case, the applications are placed only on the rectangles.  Sew all layers of the carpet. </p>

    <p>  Make two arcs from the hoop, wrap it with a synthetic winterizer, insert it into the fabric stitched "bags".  With the help of fastenings, crossed arcs are stable even with hanging rattles. </p><h2>  The developing rug for younger preschool children </h2><p>  Children's rugs with toys are also good for preschool children.  A cover without arcs is sewn, which simplifies the sewing process.  The rug can be divided into sections that are connected by one plot or are arranged randomly.  For example, it may have the following sectors: </p><ul><li>  an apple with rings diagonally: if you pull for them, the worm looks out or hides; </li><li>  a fence on the buttons, where the crossbars are designed for weaving; </li><li>  a pond with lightning, from where fish can be pulled out by a rope; </li><li>  a house with a closed door (Velcro), behind which the mouse is hiding; </li><li>  seven-flower, in which the petals with different filler; </li><li>  a truck with wheels on buttons and cargo (geometric shapes) on ropes; </li><li>  a mitten with a belt for the development of the sensory sphere; </li><li>  pockets on the buttons, where are the parts of the house and Christmas trees that need to stick on the Velcro bottom. </li></ul><p>  The mat can be sewn with a single plot.  For example, make a story of your favorite fairy tale with removable volumetric applications using all kinds of fabrics, fillers, and fasteners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  DIY massage rug for children </h2><p>  For children, massage coverings are simply needed.  The easiest option is to make a track of squares with different surfaces: </p><ul><li>  plastic caps turned upside down; </li><li>  corks from wine bottles (both whole and cut along the length); </li><li>  flat large pebbles; </li><li>  glass stones "Marbles" (available in flower or handicraft departments); </li><li>  smooth planks; </li><li>  buttons </li><li>  <span>sponges for washing dishes</span> ; </li><li>  plastic grates for the sink; </li><li>  plastic tubes; </li><li>  pencils or casing from felt-tip pens; </li><li>  rubber balls, wooden; </li><li>  artificial grass; </li><li>  a very soft rug with long villi (available in the house cleaning department); </li><li>  fabric pockets with cereals, salt, legumes, chestnut, acorns; </li><li>  pompons from different yarns, polyethylene; </li><li>  rope, ropes laid out by a snake, geometric figure; </li><li>  traces of legs and hands from linoleum, plastic, rubber rugs. </li></ul><p>  Please note that chestnuts, acorns need to be washed, dried in the oven, otherwise they will grow moldy, give off an unpleasant odor.  Natural material, like cereals, is best placed in removable pockets or with zippers. </p><h2>  Another option </h2><p>  You can sew a multi-functional large children's rug with massage and developing bias.  Coverage can be made thematic: seasons, overcoming obstacles, mathematics, a fairy tale ... First of all, think over tasks, their image, material. </p>

    <p>  For example, a mathematical carpet has the following tasks: </p><ul><li>  geometric shapes of Marbles stones, pebbles, covers, corks; </li><li>  large, small, wide, narrow, short, long figures; </li><li>  shapes by color from colored covers; </li><li>  count of daisies with a different number of petals, fabric <span>applications of ladybugs</span> with a different number of spots; </li><li>  numbers laid out by ropes. </li></ul><p>  The material is best done on one square (30 x 30 cm) with fastening (Velcro, buttons, buttons).  That is, if you need to fix the color and shape, construct a geometric field from the details.  Of course, this is painstaking work, but you can supplement the mat with new tasks.  Such small squares can be used to massage the hands, supplementing them with removable ‚Äúsensory‚Äù applications. </p><h2>  Thread Rugs </h2><p>  You can also make a children's <span>rug with your own hands from threads.</span>  This requires yarn, fabric, tools, unlimited patience.  Using cardboard blanks, forks, make dense pompons of different sizes (for stiffness, do not spare the threads).  They need a lot (do not cut off the ends of the pompons). </p><p>  Next, cut a circle on the grid, process the edges.  Hook the ends of the balls through the holes of the mesh, tie a knot.  Place the pompons close together.  Then sew a mesh with pompons to a dense fabric.  The first mat is ready. </p><p>  The second option is easier to implement, but also time-consuming.  In each mesh hole, hook a piece of thread through the hook, tighten it as a fringe.  So you can lay out any pattern.  At the final stage, sew a mesh with a dense fabric. </p>

    <p>  The third version of the rug made of thread is especially painstaking.  Wrap yarn tightly onto cardboard blanks (the width of the cardboard corresponds to the length of the mat pile).  Sew the winding from one edge with a needle and thread, cut from the other (remove the cardboard).  Received the fringe in the center pass the machine.  So make new rows, sewing them tightly together. </p><h2>  Volumetric Models </h2><p>  How to sew a rug in a short period of time so that it is convenient to lie or play on it?  Just take a cloth, filler, zipper, sewing machine.  First, cut the material to fit the mat.  It is better to take a dense waterproof fabric for the bottom. </p><p>  For example, they cut two long rectangles.  From the wrong side, three sides were flashed, turned out.  Now with soap on the long side mark five sectors, sew.  It turned out a bag for five sectors.  Sew a zipper into each section, stuff with a padding polyester.  The first mat is ready. </p>

    <p>  If you are not deprived of time, then you sew a rug from balls.  Cut identical circles from the fabric, make them, put the synthetic winterizer, tighten the thread.  Lay out a pattern of balls.  Measure the dimensions of the rug, cut the fabric under the base.  Sew on balls by treating the edges of the coating. </p><p>  For knitters there is a fashionable and time-consuming option.  Tie the filet net.

The base of the coating is sewn with colored leaves (felt or wool). </li><li>  Summer mat.  The idea is like the previous coating, only the fabric (base) is sewn up with pansies. </li><li>  Puzzle mat with removable applications based on logic games. </li><li>  Glowing in the dark.  Tie a closed LED strip with a rope using a hook, tie in a circle, leaving the end to connect to the power supply. </li><li>  Theatrical mat illustrating the plot of your favorite fairy tale.

    <p>  There are several coating options: </p><ul><li>  flat puzzles from an old carpet, purchased rubber rugs; </li><li>  voluminous fabric parts filled with sintepon; </li><li>  animal puzzles; </li><li>  elements with applications that are on different parts. </li></ul><p>  The mount for these rugs is also different: </p><ul><li>  puzzles are fastened due to their shape (convex and concave parts); </li><li>  connection of elements due to adhesive tape; </li><li>  button fastening; </li><li>  details are connected by buttons. </li></ul><p>  To make a ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù coating, cut out the full-sized shape of the carpet from cardboard.  Draw patterns with recesses and convex details.  Cut them out.  You make two pieces of each puzzle (face and wrong side).  Still cut the same stripes-sidewalls, due to which the volume is created.  Sew the details of the puzzle to the side blank, fill it with a synthetic winterizer, and sew it to the end.  So sew all the details. </p><h2>  Little tip </h2><p>  Do not rush to buy an expensive children's rug.  You can make any coating with your own hands.  For babies, you can only get arcs if the spouse can not help, and you sew the rug yourself better than the store.  And with an adult child, you can choose a design and make a coating together.  Do not spare time, as such a rug can please more than one generation. </p>
