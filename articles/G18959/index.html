However, in addition to the cultural and natural wealth within the city, there are also beauty and architectural ensembles located in the suburbs.

    <h2>  Great unity in all areas of art </h2><p>  The “capital of fountains” and Peterhof are also called Petrodvorets in St. Petersburg.  On its territory there is an amazingly beautiful park ensemble, a huge number of statues of ancient heroes made of gilding and marble, and, of course, numerous fountains.  All this, combined with lush greenery, turns the suburb of the cultural capital into the most attractive sightseeing place for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Petrodvorets in St. Petersburg is known throughout the world.  It acquired its modern name after 1944.  Prior to this, this ensemble was called Peterhof.  The palace and park group is one of the greatest achievements of Russian national culture.  It is worth noting that here architectural, cultural, sculptural and engineering solutions are harmoniously combined in a magnificent way.  This place is located on the Gulf of Finland, thirty kilometers from the city, in a village called Peterhof. </p>

    <h2>  Innovator and founder </h2><p>  Not only the park group itself is interesting, but also the history of its occurrence.  The Petrodvorets Museum in St. Petersburg was built at the beginning of the eighteenth century.  He became a peculiar witness of the victory of Russia in the Northern War and its access to the Baltic Sea.  The founder of the idea of ​​creating a palace and park ensemble is the Tsar and Emperor Peter I. His innovative ideas were famous throughout the world.  Thanks to him, there are many historical and cultural monuments in the country.  It is Peter the Great who owns the artistic decisions and design ideas of the ensemble. </p>

    <h2>  Construction and opening </h2><p>  In 1705, Peter I built the so-called travel mansions on the Gulf of Finland.  Their appearance marked the beginning of the "Capital of Fountains".  The first brick in the construction of the summer front residence was laid in 1714.  And its discovery took place nine years later - in 1723.  During this time, the Upper Garden and Lower Park, the main elements of the Grand Cascade, the Grand Palace and the Monplaisir Palace were erected.  Builders, architects, engineers, gardeners and many other specialists have accomplished a tremendous feat, erecting an unprecedented beauty of a monumental group in a rather short period of time.  To supply the fountains of the park ensemble, a special water supply system was built, the basis of which were storage ponds.  The author of this project is engineer Vasily Tuvolkov.  The main feature of the water system of Petrodvorets is the complete absence of any pressure or pumping elements.  The movement of fluid is due to the difference in levels at which fountains and storages are located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  State ownership </h2><p>  Petrodvorets in St. Petersburg owes its appearance to thousands of mercenary workers, serfs, craftsmen from all over the country.  Foundry workers, jewelers, artists, sculptors and other creators have invested a piece of their soul in the creation of the ensemble.  Petrodvorets in St. Petersburg continued its development for another two centuries.  New monuments and monuments appeared, the first elements of the palace and park group were updated and restored. </p>

    <p>  In the mid-fifties of the 18th century, various princely and tsarist residences began to appear around the complex, among which Znamenka, Alexandria, the English Park and Own Cottage stood out.  The February <span>Revolution of 1917</span> introduced changes not only in the political, but also in the cultural development of the country.  So, many monuments of art have become state property.  This fate did not pass around Petrodvorets in <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Fountains,</span> ponds, buildings and structures - all this has become museum exhibits. </p><h2>  Nazi power </h2><p>  The park ensemble went through great difficulties during the Great Patriotic War.  The sudden invasion of fascist troops was a shock to the government and civilians.  It was ordered to evacuate all possible values ​​from Petrodvorets as soon as possible.  Monumental works of art, if possible, were hidden in the ground.  However, far from everything was saved.  On September 23, enemy troops occupied Peterhof.  For more than two years, the historical heritage was under the rule of the Nazis.  The Grand and English palaces, the Grand Cascade, Marley - all this has turned into ruins.  The Hermitage and Monplaisir were less affected.  Every estate was looted, magnificent parks were cut down, and <span>hydraulic structures were</span> blown up.  What worked for two centuries, perished.  After the retreat of the Nazi groups, Peterhof as a monument of history and culture did not exist. </p>
