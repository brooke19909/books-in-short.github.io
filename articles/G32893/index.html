As a rule, this account is also used to identify hidden manufacturing defects (after sale to the consumer). </p><p>  If fatal flaws are found, the product is actually returned.  This operation is accompanied by the formation of stroning records, through which the sale of defective products is canceled. </p><p>  If goods with defects or their parts can be used (for scrap, for example), they are accounted for.  10 sub-account "Other materials" at the price of possible use. </p><h2>  Penalties from the perpetrators </h2><p>  When establishing the specific employees involved in the marriage, the amount to be recovered from them is transferred from the credit of 28 accounts to the debit of the account.  73, to the subaccount, which reflects information on calculations related to compensation for property damage.  Such a scheme is applied if the employee of the enterprise is guilty of marriage. </p><p>  If a third party is involved in the occurrence of defects, the amounts are transferred to debit 76 of the account, to the sub-account "Claims settlement". </p><h2>  "1C": cancellation of marriage </h2><p>  If defective products are found in the warehouse, it is necessary to draw up a ‚ÄúInvoice Requirement‚Äù.

    <p>  It turns out that when <span>writing off a marriage in trade</span> , the costs of <span>losses</span> from goods with defects can include the costs of internal marriage detected at the stage of production or sale, and external defects discovered by the consumer during assembly, use, installation of the product. </p><h2>  Income tax </h2><p>  When <span>writing off a marriage</span> , as mentioned above, it is included in other expenses associated with the production and sale of products.  In the norms of the Tax Code there are no special restrictions on the accounting for these costs.  Therefore, subject to the general principles of recognition of costs for tax purposes in accordance with Chapter 25 of the Tax Code, documentary evidence, economic feasibility, non-refundable losses from defective products can be taken into account by the manufacturer in costs.  Control agencies adhere to this position. </p><p>  Depending on the rules of the accounting policy of the enterprise for the purposes of taxation, the costs associated with the production and sale of products can be attributed to both indirect and direct costs.  The relevant provisions are fixed in clauses 1, 2 318 of the article of the Tax Code. </p><p>  Indirect costs are fully included in the costs of the current period.  Direct costs form the tax base for the sale of products in the value of which they are already taken into account. </p><p>  Accordingly, in the accounting policy of the enterprise for tax purposes, it is necessary to fix the rules for accounting for the costs of marriage.  In particular, it is advisable to develop a methodology for determining the cost of defective products. </p><h2>  VAT </h2><p>  In paragraph 3 of paragraph 170 of the article of the Tax Code there is an exhaustive list of situations in which the "input" tax, legitimately accepted for deduction, must be restored. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in this norm there is no such reason as the <span>cancellation of a marriage</span> that is not suitable for subsequent use (without identifying the perpetrators).  At the same time, according to control departments, the ‚Äúinput‚Äù tax in the case under consideration should be restored in the period of writing off products.  After all, they will not be used for transactions that are recognized in the Tax Code as a taxable item. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manufacturing defect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2098372.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for judicial practice, it develops in favor of enterprises.  As indicated that in accordance with Article 23 of the Tax Code, the payer is required to deduct established taxes to the budget.  Accordingly, the obligation to pay VAT legally accepted for deduction should be enshrined in law. </p><p>  Meanwhile, taking into account the explanations of the Ministry of Finance, some experts believe that the decision not to restore the tax when writing off the marriage may lead to disagreements with the Federal Tax Service. </p><h2>  Return Operations </h2><p>  Their accounting can be carried out in various ways.  For example, an enterprise may recalculate its profit tax base for the period in which a defective product was sold.  Since the contract between the seller and the acquirer will be terminated, the payer has the right to reduce the profit by the amount of income from the sale of the marriage.  The amount of costs can be reduced by the cost of the product returned by the buyer. </p><p>  The second option is to attribute the costs in the form of the cost of production to losses from the identified defect.  In this case, the cost will be the amount that must be returned to the buyer of low-quality products. </p><p>  According to the Ministry of Finance, the company has already taken into account the costs of manufacturing defective goods in the sale.  Consequently, the price of the returned product is recognized equal to zero. </p><h2>  Compensation for damage </h2><p>  In deciding on compensation for harm, the fact of the identification of the perpetrators will be essential.  They can be not only employees of the enterprise, but also third parties.  For example, equipment was stopped due to a power outage, substandard materials were received from the supplier, etc. </p><p>  Claims to third parties are sent in the manner prescribed by the Civil Code.  Compensation for damage by the employees of the enterprise is carried out according to the rules established by the Labor Code.  As established by Article 241 of the Code, if an agreement was not concluded with the employee on the mat.  responsibility, you can recover from it an amount that does not exceed the average monthly salary. </p><p>  Retention is carried out on the basis of the order of the head of the enterprise.  The order is issued within a month from the date of determination of the final amount of property damage.  If this period is missed, and also if the employee evades compensation for harm, the employer has the right to apply to the court. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marriage deed" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2098373.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Documenting </h2><p>  If defective products are identified, an act is drawn up.  The standardized form of this document is not approved.  Accordingly, the company may have developed its own act form.  The form of the document is fixed in the accounting policy. </p><p>  If internal marriage is detected, the document is filled in by the employees of the technical control department.  If an external defect is detected, the <span>act is drawn up by the</span> consumer. </p><h2>  Features of the act </h2><p>  The following details shall be present in the marriage identification act: </p><ul><li>  The name of the company. </li><li>  Location address. </li><li>  Contact details. </li><li>  Title of the document. </li></ul><p>  The text indicates information about the product in which the defect is revealed, the reasons for the marriage, the perpetrators. </p><p>  The document must be executed in 3 copies.  The first is transferred to the accounting department, the second to the division where the low-quality goods were released, the third receives a materially responsible employee.  If an external marriage is detected, a consumer claim is attached to the act. </p><p>  The confirmation of the fact of revealing a marriage is carried out by a special commission. </p><h2>  Quality Management Mistakes </h2><p>  Some manufacturers do not quite understand the goals of accounting for manufacturing defects.  They believe that the occurrence of defective products is a natural process, without which production activities can not do. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the creation of a competent accounting system allows you to timely identify the circumstances that cause the appearance of deficiencies in the goods.  Accordingly, based on the available data, the manager can take measures to reduce the number of defective products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marriage accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2098374.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Quite often, shop managers complain about the obsolescence of equipment.  By this they explain the appearance of marriage and believe that buying modern machines can improve the situation.  However, not every enterprise has the means to do so.  Of course, working on old equipment is also impossible.  The best way out of the situation could be the modernization or rental of machines. </p><p>  Managers and technologists often say that identifying the causes of marriage can be difficult.  Of course, different situations may arise at the enterprise in which it is really problematic to determine the circumstances of the occurrence of defects.  But in most cases, it is possible to identify the causes of the production of products with defects by grouping them according to common features.  Typically, the causes of defects are violations of technology, negligence, oversight of responsible persons. </p><p>  When grouping signs of substandard products, proper accounting of products is of particular importance. </p><h2>  Remedy Methods </h2><p>  They depend on the causes of defects in the products.  If the shortcomings are associated with the use of low-quality materials, you should identify the supplier of such raw materials.  In addition, it is necessary to create a system of control of the values ‚Äã‚Äãreceived by the enterprise.  A clause on liability for the supply of low-quality raw materials should be included in the agreement with suppliers. </p><p>  If defects are associated with the operation of machines, it is necessary, first of all, to determine the period of their maintenance.  In the workshops, it is necessary to establish personal responsibility for the operation of equipment, non-compliance with operating rules.  It is important to identify on which machine the defect is made. </p><p>  If the production of defective products is related to the lack of professionalism of personnel, the employee motivation system should be reviewed.  For example, the company may establish additional bonuses and incentives to minimize marriage.  The introduction of automated process control makes it possible to reduce the influence of the human factor on the production process.  Currently, such systems are used in all large industrial enterprises. </p>
