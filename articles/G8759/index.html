There are positive responses, and there are also negative comments.  The low cost of entry tickets and rental services is explained by the deterioration of equipment. </p><p>  Visitors complain about old skates, poor quality ice.  Due to the abundance of potholes on the surface of the arena, beginners fall and get injured.  Medical staff are often absent or far away.  One session lasts only fifty minutes.  This is not enough to feel confident on the ice.  Plus there are a lot of people on the weekend.  A crush forms. </p><p>  In the daytime, those who wish to ride are left without the right size skates.  The most popular models are quickly disassembled, you have to wait an entire hour.  The queue is moving slowly.  Dressing rooms are small.  A queue is also piling up next to them.  To get skates, you need to present a civil passport of the Russian Federation.  Two documents are issued per document. </p><p>  It is said that teenagers ride alongside young children.  They do not comply with the speed limit and perform sharp turns.  Many rooms require updating and repair.  In some places the paint has peeled off, it smells of damp.  Visitors indicate the absence of supervisors and instructors on the ice. </p><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of comments.  Here is just a short list of unpleasant moments: </p><ul><li>  queues in the locker rooms and wardrobe; </li><li>  insufficient number of places to relax; </li><li>  shabby skates; </li><li>  lack of proper sizes; </li><li>  crushing; </li><li>  non-compliance with rules of conduct on ice; </li><li>  old rooms; </li><li>  low quality ice; </li><li>  lack of doctors, instructors and supervisors on the rink; </li><li>  uncomfortable schedule; </li><li>  lack of modern cafes; </li><li>  a lot of restrictions. </li></ul><h2>  Positive experience </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hockey" class="if uuid-2408010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2408010.jpg"></div><p>  There are also many positive reviews about the arena.  Numerous photos of the Crystal rink in Togliatti testify to its popularity among citizens.  <span>The sports complex is in</span> demand among those who live in the center.  Visitors to the ice arena are pleased with the low prices.  Everyone has the opportunity to skate freely. </p><p>  Families come here, bring small children.  Parents believe that fifty minutes is the best time on the ice.  The presence of benches allows you to relax while riding.  Another advantage of the ice arena is the presence of children's sizes of skates.  Shoes are new and dry.  There are no complaints about them. </p><p>  Strengths of the "Crystal": </p><ul><li>  availability; </li><li>  flexible pricing policy; </li><li>  proximity to public transport; </li><li>  developed infrastructure; </li><li>  cheap skate rental; </li><li>  wide size range of shoes; </li><li>  pleasant music; </li><li>  good ice quality; </li><li>  the possibility of a guest visit; </li><li>  convenient locker rooms; </li><li>  the presence of a wardrobe. </li></ul><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Beginners who do not know how to ride are advised to first attend a few personal training sessions.  An experienced instructor will teach you how to confidently stand on ice in just a couple of hours.  They train not only children, but also adults.  Perhaps training a whole family.  According to the instructors, with safety precautions, you can start skating even at an advanced age. </p>
