    <h2>  Small class for the city </h2><p>  One of the most popular car manufacturer's classes.  There are only two models in the class - Picanto and Rio.  The cost of the first starts from 500 thousand rubles.  It is produced in five-door and three-door versions.  This is ideal for city driving.  It will pass even in the narrowest place of the yard and allows maneuvering in traffic jams.  The design is authentic and attracts the eyes of passers-by.  "Picanto" can be equipped with an engine of 1 or 1.2 liters capacity of 66 and 85 horsepower.  The three-door hatchback can be equipped with an automatic or manual gearbox.

    <h2>  Compact middle class </h2><p>  The main car of this group, of course, is the Sid, which represents a very diverse lineup.  The main model is a five-door hatchback with a rather bold design.  This model went through two restylings and acquired many additional improvements.  The Sid SV model is produced in a station wagon body. </p><p>  The second restyling led to the appearance of the three-door KIA Sid Pro.  Five and three-door sports versions were also released for both models, which are indicated by the addition of the letters "GT".  The cost of the latter starts from 1.2 million rubles, but their functionality is wider.  They are equipped with 1.6 liter turbocharged engines with a power of 204 horsepower.  That is, in addition to the standard five-door hatchback, this model range consists of four modifications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also another model in this class - the ‚ÄúSerato‚Äù, which is essentially a ‚ÄúSid‚Äù, but in a sedan-style body.  Before restyling, the car was produced in a coupe type body.  This model is available in three trim levels: comfort, luxury and prestige.  In the maximum version, the price of a car starts at 1.1 million rubles.  According to customer reviews, the KIA Easy! Loan program  very popular. </p>

    <h2>  Business Class </h2><p>  It is represented by two models of executive cars "Optima" and "Quoris".  The first is not particularly pretentious and luxurious; it is a completely ordinary business class car.  In appearance it is close to Rio.  However, their similarity is misleading.  The cost of Optima starts at 1.2 million rubles.  The second model of representative cars of the KIA brand is Kvoris.  It is a large and comfortable car.  In Korea, he can only become a rival to the Hyundai Ekus.  Korean automakers have learned how to make really <span>good</span> business class <span>cars</span> at a relatively low price - from 2.4 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Minivans </h2><p>  This class is represented by only one Weng model.  It is small in size, comparable to the Picanto, but inside is quite spacious.  Cost - from 800 thousand rubles.  Reviews on the program "KIA easy!"  Interested in many. </p>

    <h2>  Crossovers and SUVs </h2><p>  The most popular crossover of the KIA brand is the Sportage.  The increased demand for this car is created by its low price, comfort and good quality.  ‚ÄúSoul‚Äù is the youngest in the line of crossovers and, due to its angular forms, is more like a minivan.  The car is rather unusual, but, unfortunately, underestimated and rarely bought.  Sorento has been around for a very long time, it's a KIA veteran.  There was already more than one generation of these cars and several restylings. </p><p>  There is also a luxury version in the line of models, namely, Prime.  "Mojave" is the flagship of the Korean automobile industry among SUVs.  In the simplest configuration, its price starts from 2.3 million rubles.  It is considered a large car and feels confident on all roads and surfaces, under any conditions, even outside the asphalt.  What the reviews say, is it worth taking the KIA Easy! Program  car?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  The program "KIA is easy!" </h2><p>  Since mid-June 2016, KIA representative offices launched a new loan program in St. Petersburg and Moscow, combining the efforts of KIA Finance and Setelem Bank.  A loan called "KIA is easy!"  based on a residual value guarantee.  You can get it by acquiring the most popular and popular Rio and Sid models.  The purpose of this <span>loan program</span> is to attract a new customer base due to the availability of payments.  Campaign to issue a loan "KIA easy!"  will give customers the opportunity to purchase additional options or accessories without significantly increasing the amount of the monthly payment.  This rule also applies to the choice of vehicle equipment, as the program allows you to purchase a package of options that is better than cash.  Reviews on the loan program "KIA easy!"  This is confirmed. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Unlike conventional lending programs, ‚ÄúKIA is easy!‚Äù  It has three significant advantages.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Minimum down payment on a loan, starting from 20% of the cost of the car. </li><li>  Minimum monthly payments.  Approximately half less than with conventional lending schemes. </li><li>  Warranty on the residual value of the car.  Issued by a banking organization. </li></ol><h2>  Two options to choose from </h2><p>  The loan term is 2 or 3 years under the contract.  As soon as this period passes, the buyer has two ways: </p><ol><li>  Make an exchange of a car under the trade-in program for a new one and continue to use it, closing the balance of the loan amount (approximately 45%). </li><li>  Make a return guarantee car to the bank.  The residual value of the guarantee is slightly less than half of the original price of the car and, as a rule, it becomes enough for full early repayment of the loan.  Reviews on the loan program "KIA easy!"  presented below. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Good step </h2><p>  Alex Gurin, Sales Director, KIA Finance, called the new lending program ‚ÄúKIA easy!‚Äù  a key tool to maintain a high level of sales in the second half of 2016.  The launch of the program was a successful step on the part of KIA along with the advent of new models.  The KIA car loan program is an advantageous offer for several groups of buyers.  The terms of the program are understandable and attractive even for those buyers who have not thought about buying a car, especially with a loan.  And for more experienced car enthusiasts, the program is interesting in that it provides the opportunity to choose a more complete set or a car of the highest category than what was originally considered.  ‚ÄúKIA is easy!‚Äù  It helps customers to update their car more often, which significantly increases brand loyalty. </p><h2>  Reviews on the program "KIA easy!" </h2><p>  There are a lot of reviews of those who took a direct part in the KIA Easy! Program on the Internet.  People complain mainly about the right of the bank to change the conditions under which a loan is issued, as well as interest rates.  The presence of mandatory life insurance when applying for a loan also increases the loan amount by an order of magnitude.  Some describe the situation when an online calculation of the loan amount and monthly payments was made on the official website, and when contacting the car dealership or bank directly, the amount changes. </p><p>  This directly depends on the individual conditions of the bank and the borrower's credit history, as well as on the package of documents provided to them.  It is possible to refuse life insurance, but, as follows from the reviews, quite often serves as the basis for disapproving a loan with a residual payment of ‚ÄúKIA is easy!‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  As for the residual value, many questions also arise; customer opinions differ.  Some call this a definite advantage, since this option of lending allows you to exchange a car for a new one after a certain period.  Others consider this paragraph of the program a drawback, since not everyone can afford to pay loan payments every month, while postponing the remaining 45% of the original amount. </p><p>  We reviewed the terms of the KIA Easy! Program. </p>
