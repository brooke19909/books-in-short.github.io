It is not recommended to allow delays: the penalty for missing the mandatory contribution is 20% of the debt. </p><h2>  Reviews about the credit card "Lightning" </h2><p>  Information on the official website or at OTP offices does not allow us to evaluate the real conditions of the card in the way that user reviews allow.  Potential borrowers are interested in whether to open a credit card OTP "Lightning". </p><p>  There are practically no negative descriptions of the product on the Web, as the credit card conditions correspond to the information on the site.  The only thing that does not suit customers is a high interest rate (up to 49.9% per year).  But OTP does not hide the conditions of lending, and interest is set depending on the reliability of the client.  Therefore, a credit card can be attributed to a banking product, after registration of which the borrower will not regret his choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiplinger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is a credit card open?" class="if uuid-3253988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253988.jpg"></div><p>  Regular borrowers with a good credit history and a stable income of 30,000 per month can count on a minimum interest rate - from 26.9% per annum.  But even new customers can become the owner of "Lightning" on favorable terms.  The bank makes the final decision on the application within 48 hours after processing the documents. </p><h2>  Credit card payment terms: user reviews </h2><p>  The owners can redeem the Lightning card in several ways: online, at the bank‚Äôs offices or through partners, in terminals, by money transfer, via SMS.  The most favorable conditions are using the services of OTP Bank. </p><p>  In OTP credit card reviews, owners indicate the features of using OTP Direct.  The application does not always work quickly, it freezes periodically, which can cause delays in payments.  Therefore, it is recommended to deposit a minimum amount 2-3 days before the payment date.  An alternative to payments through OTP-Direct is online payments on the official website.  The commission depends on the method of payment. </p><h2>  Clear Card: Credit Product Overview </h2><p>  The new OTP credit card is distinguished by a unique offer: the client can choose the condition for using a credit card - to withdraw cash or pay at retail outlets.  Depending on the chosen option, the interest rate for withdrawing a credit limit at ATMs or payment from a card will differ. </p><p>  Benefits of the "Clear Card" product: </p><ul><li>  release and maintenance without commission; </li><li>  selection of credit card use conditions - for cash withdrawal or payment; </li><li>  free SMS information on all operations; </li><li>  bonuses up to 30% of the MasterCard payment system. </li></ul><p>  For cash withdrawals from OTP credit cards, the interest rate per year is 39.9%, for payments for purchases (including online stores) - 27.5%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emerging-europe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate a credit card from a bank" class="if uuid-3253984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253984.jpg"></div><p>  "OTP Bank" free of charge notifies the client about the status of the account once a month and provides the opportunity to request a report at the ATMs of the network.  There is no commission for spending on the card, as well as for transferring funds when replenishing a credit card through the official website or the OTP-Direct application. </p><h2>  Customer opinion about the product </h2><p>  The terms of the "Clear Card" are attractive, and the design is available to all citizens of the Russian Federation from 21 years old with a good credit history.  But the limit is not always satisfied with customers.  On the Web, users of the "Clear Card" complained about the undeservedly low limit set by the bank. </p><p>  Not everyone who wrote a negative review was able to prove their high level of income, so the opinion of such users about the bank and credit card is subjective. </p><p>  Of the positive aspects about the credit card, customers noted: </p><ul><li>  compliance with the loan rate stated in the contract.  OTP Bank does not overestimate the terms of lending and does not charge customers more than what is required by the agreement; </li><li>  quick clearance.  There are no negative reviews on the Web about how to apply for an OTP credit card.  All conditions are simple and spelled out on the bank's website, the rules are followed by company managers.  You can get a "Clear Card" on the day you submit the documents.  Application can be submitted online on the official website of OTP Bank; </li><li>  convenient calculation of the grace period, which the owner can check in the OTP-direct, ATM or with the help of support staff. </li></ul><p>  The product is inferior in benefits to cashback cards, so it is recommended to open a ‚ÄúClear‚Äù credit card to those who prefer to withdraw cash.  First, you should choose a tariff with minimum interest for regular withdrawal of a credit limit. </p><h2>  How to make payments?  Redemption of the "Clear Card" </h2><p>  The owner of the credit card "Clear Card" can deposit used credit funds in any available way: at the bank and through OTP terminals, online, through the OTP-Direct application, by money transfer using other banks or from partners.  Commission is not charged only when paying through OTP. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.romania-insider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Otp credit card cash withdrawal" class="if uuid-3253985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253985.jpg"></div><p>  The term for crediting money is from 1 minute to 5 days.  The fastest way money comes to a credit card when sending from the bank's website.  It is allowed to pay online from another bank card. </p><h2>  Credit card activation: conditions, features </h2><p>  OTP credit cards are not automatically activated.
