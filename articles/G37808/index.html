  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magnetic generator</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Free energy is a process in which more energy is released than was expended, or was not expended at all.  As an example of obtaining free energy, one can determine its generation using a wind generator that converts wind power into electricity.  For the same purpose, magnetic free energy generators are created that produce it to a much greater extent.  They are necessary to obtain a cheap and environmentally friendly source of energy. </p><p>  The development of such a generator was undertaken by John Searle, who discovered that if the number of rollers located around equals a specific minimum number, they begin to rotate independently and the speed increases until a dynamic equilibrium occurs.  The energy generated by the generator is due to the effect of magnetism, based on magnetic fields, causing the magnetic rollers to rotate continuously around the magnetic rings, thus generating electricity. </p><p>  Searle‚Äôs invention opened up access to a new method of generating energy that does not require material costs for the process.  Searl's magnetic free energy generator is the most important mechanism that can form a <span>gravitational field</span> and break away from the earth.  Similar properties were discovered as a result of his research.  He developed a high speed and soared into the air, which led to the loss of several experimental generators (disks). </p><p>  There are many patents for creating magnetic generators.  They are needed to generate cheap electricity.  In addition to being environmentally friendly, they do not create any vibration, heat or noise.  Nevertheless, the magnetic generator is practically not used, since a number of oil companies are not interested in the appearance of such inventions.  In addition, getting cheap energy can negatively affect the people themselves, as many of them will lose their jobs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Main components</strong> </p><p>  The magnetic generator is made from: </p><ul><li>  a movable rotor consisting of magnets, the number of which should equal the number of stator magnets, as well as paired magnetic cores; </li><li>  a fixed stator, also consisting of magnets, as well as 3 magnetic cores (or one solid transformer iron).  A removable coil is installed on the magnetic circuit. </li></ul><p>  Neodymium mineral, consisting of neodymium and boron alloys, is often used as <span>permanent magnets</span> when creating generators.  This mineral is quite rare, it can be found in China.  It is highly resistant to external demagnetization fields, which ensures uninterrupted energy production and is therefore ideally suited for creating such devices.  The power of a generator with neodymium magnets can reach 1 quatt. </p><p>  <strong>Principle of operation</strong> </p><p>  The magnetic generator operates due to the magnetic field, which as a result of movement is converted into electricity.  With the constant rotation of the coils of <span>copper wire</span> located near the magnetic field <span>,</span> an electric charge is generated in the wire.  Generators with static coils and a moving magnetic field can be created to generate energy.  Magnets are used to obtain constant movement.  Due to their polarity, repulsion occurs and movement occurs. </p><p>  A magnetic generator uses three types of magnets.  The first two are used to create polarity, and the third is necessary to create a field that drives the motor in continuous rotation.  Moreover, in order for the magnetic generator to work, there is no need for another source of energy. </p>
