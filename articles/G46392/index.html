It always causes a tremulous feeling, which is associated with the realization that legendary heroes, poets and philosophers walked the same land thousands of years ago, here the gods descended from Olympus to experience all the charms of earthly life.  Today, any traveler can come to experience the centuries-old history of this country, and possibly become part of the new Greek myth. </p><p>  An important point in deciding which part of the country to choose for an unforgettable vacation is the selection of a hotel.  Club Elephant Simantro Beach - this is the option when the client chooses a vacation exclusively luxury. </p><h2>  Halkidiki </h2><p>  The Halkidiki Peninsula has everything in order to be one of the most favorite places for a quality holiday: </p><ul><li>  Its location is such that there is no debilitating heat in summer or cold days in winter.  The average temperature in high season is +28, and in the offseason +12 degrees. </li><li>  This is one of the most beautiful natural places in the country.  Having a trident shape, the Halkidiki peninsula has ‚Äúgrown‚Äù with various versions of its origin.  The most durable one turned out to be the one about the rivalry between the titans and the gods of Olympus.  Trying to appease the giants, claiming their rightful place on Olympus, Poseidon threw a trident at them in anger, in the place of which this area was formed.  Each of the ‚Äúteeth‚Äù of the peninsula is beautiful in its own way, and together they represent an amazing natural ensemble.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li>  Each peninsula, which is part of Halkidiki, has its own history and unique charisma.  For example, its coast is recognized as the best resort region of <span>Greece.</span>  <span>The beaches</span> here stretch for 500 km, covered with golden sand, which is gently caressed by blue waves. </li><li>  Here are located the best hotels of the country, for example, Club Elephant Simantro Beach 5, which meets the most demanding requests of sophisticated tourists. </li></ul><p>  The peninsulas of Halkidiki are called Kassandra, Sithonia and Athos.  This area is truly the cradle of humanity on the European continent.  Here were found the remains and site of an ancient man, whose age is 700,000 years, but he already had primitive tools of labor and hunting, which helped him survive.  Bonfires were discovered in a cave near the village of Petralona, ‚Äã‚Äãtheir age exceeds one million years and they are recognized by the most ancient evidence of human use of fire. </p><p>  Here in such an amazing place is the Club Elephant Simantro Beach 5 * hotel, annually meeting thousands of guests from all over the world. </p><h2>  Kassandra Peninsula </h2><p>  It is very difficult to choose among the three ‚Äúfingers‚Äù of the Halkidiki Peninsula the most beautiful.  Each of them has its own unique features, but behind the scenes Kassandra is considered the best Greek resort, where only the highest class is expected in advance. </p><p>  Its width is less than 15 km, but the coast is recognized as the most ideal.  There are beautiful bays, hills covered with emerald greenery and the cleanest sandy coast. </p>

    <p>  Kassandra perfectly coexists old houses, churches and monasteries with modern hotels, for example, Club Elephant Simantro <span>Beach 5 * (Greece, Halkidiki).</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the peninsula there are several resort villages in which the <span>best</span> <span>hotels of Greece</span> are built <span>.</span>  Each locality is proud of its history and age: </p><ul><li>  <em>Kallithea</em> is a place that will not disappoint those who are used to an active nightlife and around-the-clock noise and fun.  This village has only one drawback - a steep and long staircase leading to a beautiful beach.  If going down is even more or less pleasant, then the climb usually does not add enthusiasm. </li><li>  <em>Nea Potidea is</em> especially popular among young people, as you can spend all the time on local beaches - in the afternoon sunbathing or practicing water sports, and moving from bar to bar at night, or changing discos located on the coast here. </li><li>  <em>Nea Fokia</em> is a gourmet paradise.  40 years ago there was a fishing village here, and today it is a chic resort, where there are the best restaurants offering fish dishes for every taste.  Hotel Club Elephant Simantro Beach (Greece), as its customers note in their reviews, is also famous for its cuisine, which can be enjoyed in one of its restaurants or in a tavern by the sea.  In addition to food, the village is famous for the chapel of St. Paul, in the dungeon of which, according to legend, there is a source that fulfills desires. </li><li>  <em>Nea Moudanya</em> is a temptation for shopaholics.  It is here that the best boutiques, markets and shops of the Kassandra Peninsula are located, and since it is small, the distance between the villages is purely symbolic. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs worth choosing this peninsula for relaxation because here you can decide for yourself how to spend your leisure time.  I wanted noise and fun, you can go to clubs and bars, I want to stay in silence - no problem, one of the many bays or a pine forest will become a place of solitude. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beaches on the Kassandra Peninsula </h2><p>  Halkidiki has long won the glory of the best beach region of Greece.  For many travelers, it is the availability of quality recreation on the coast that is the reason for coming to the country.  It also happens that the sea is disappointing, but not in Halkidiki. </p><p>  According to vacationers, from hundreds of beaches on the peninsula you can choose the one that will be to your liking, but if you are planning a family vacation with children, then Kassandra will be the best option. </p>

    <p>  Among them, we can distinguish those that meet the highest quality criteria: </p><ul><li>  The beach, located near the campsite near the resort of Sani, is free for everyone and ideal for families with children.  It is fully equipped with everything that a vacationer may need - bars, shops, showers, changing rooms, toilets and sun loungers with umbrellas.  Entrance to the crystal clear water with such a slight slope that in order to reach the depths, adults will have to somewhat move away from the shore.  But for the kids there is complete expanse in such shallow water. </li><li>  The beach in Kallithea is located on the shore of the bay, so there are no big waves.  The infrastructure is also developed here, and the mandatory coffee ritual will appeal to lovers of this drink, especially since the Greeks brew it perfectly.  The whole family can eat in the tavern without leaving the beach.  Unusual sand is the attraction of this place.  There are so many sparkles in it that it seems as if a radiance emanates from it, which delights the children, because castles of extraordinary beauty are obtained from such sand. </li><li>  The beach at Club Elephant Simantro Beach Hotel near the village of Nea Fokia is one of the most equipped, and sun loungers and umbrellas are available to guests free of charge.  It is also famous for its children's leisure programs, which this hotel specializes in. </li></ul><p>  For couples with children, a number of hotels in Greece and Cyprus have created a unique type of vacation, which is aimed at the most dense interaction of adults and kids throughout the vacation.  Club Elephant Simantro Beach also belongs to this category.  Feedback on this innovation is the most enthusiastic. </p><h2>  Club Elephant Project </h2><p>  The uniqueness of innovations is to occupy hotel guests and their children with the maximum number of interesting programs in which all family members can participate.  The entire project was created solely for one purpose - to make parents and children as close to each other as possible, identifying interests that will be unifying for the family. </p>

    <p>  Previously, vacationing with children brought little joy to parents who wanted to gain freedom, albeit briefly, so they left children with nannies or animators, today Elephant Holiday Club projects are chosen by families who want to spend as much time with their kids as possible, not forgetting about to myself. </p><p>  To bring such a complex idea to life, the organizers had to find an individual approach to people of different ages, offering new games, contests and art programs every day that would be interesting to both adults and children.  Animators working in one of the program departments (Halkidiki, Club Elephant Simantro Beach) do their job perfectly, each time inventing new adventures for kids and their parents. </p><p>  Children by age are united in groups where separate classes are held for them, where they play and study, giving their parents the opportunity to take care of themselves. </p><h2>  Animation in the project </h2><p>  The organizers approached the implementation of the project very responsibly.  All animators working in it undergo special training on copyright programs, which provide for such forms of training as: </p><ul><li>  lectures; </li><li>  trainings; </li><li>  practical lessons. </li></ul><p>  The course is conducted by high-class specialists with extensive experience working with children.  In addition, how to organize leisure activities for children and adults, future animators take courses in first aid and safety during sports games on the beach and water. </p><p>  Only people who have a pedagogical education, or students of 4 courses and above can enter the training, and hiring is carried out if there is experience working with children under 4 years old. </p>

    <p>  This approach provides a high-quality level of training, which, in turn, ensures that the child left in the care of the animators is in safe hands. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Club Elephant Simantro Beach Hotel enjoys a very scenic location amidst a pine forest that goes down to the beach.
