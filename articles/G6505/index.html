This makes it possible to visit almost both hotels at the same time and compare their level of service and design. </p><p>  The Gloria Golf Hotel has several buildings built in different parts of a vast territory.  The main building consists of four floors and it houses restaurants, lobbies and cafes.  In addition to the main building, guests are accommodated in two two-story blocks, as well as villas with different floors and comfort.
