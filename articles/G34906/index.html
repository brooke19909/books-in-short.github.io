This news did not leave anyone indifferent.  Conversations, disputes, discussions do not subside today.  This is a global event.  In honor of the accession of the peninsula, holidays appear, songs are sung and poems are written.  The president decided to celebrate this event in his own way, and at the state level they adopted a draft of a new hundred-ruble building.  The bill quickly became popular, and due to the limited edition, enterprising citizens sold it at exorbitant prices. </p><h2>  One hundred ruble note.  Design, circulation </h2><p>  The Bank of Russia after the accession of the Crimean Peninsula announced the issue of another currency.  The ruble bill, according to the state‚Äôs plan, is issued one-time to capture the glory of the Crimea and Sevastopol.  The circulation throughout the country is not too large.  A hundred-ruble bill is an image of the well-known <span>Swallow‚Äôs Nest</span> castle on the front side and a monument to the scuttled ships - on the reverse.  This monument is located in Sevastopol and is also reflected in the famous painting by I. K. Aivazovsky "Russian Squadron at the Sevastopol Raid".  The symbolization on both sides is oriented strictly vertically. </p><p>  A one-ruble note has a significant difference from the well-known notes, it is dominated by olive shades and a QR code is added in its lower part, which leads directly to the Bank of Russia website.  According to the design plan, one side is fully devoted to Sevastopol, and the other to the whole Republic of Crimea.  The new hundred-ruble notes in 2016 were developed by the staff designers of the Goznak Federal State Unitary Enterprise and the Central Bank of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A photo of a hundred-ruble note is presented to your attention below. </p>

    <h2>  Discussions caused by the emergence of new notes </h2><p>  The fall of the ruble and the new hundred-ruble bill with Crimea coincided in their manifestation, which could not but provoke active, lively discussions on the Internet.  For example, the well-known Mikhail Golub declared: "Russia issued its one hundred rubles with Crimea, and they will soon be cheaper than even one dollar!"  In this spirit there were many statements, another example: "Russia issued a hundred-ruble note, devoting it to the capture of Crimea. And its cost has become 2.2 times lower than before the capture!"  There is also a lot of controversy about the armed capture of Crimea, but, as Moscow and, most importantly, the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Crimea, say, there was no capture.  Crimea became part of Russia by decision of the indigenous population.  The new hundred-dollar bill is not the only one of its kind, a limited series of banknotes was also issued in 2013 in honor of the Olympic Games in Sochi.  These notes depict snowboarders. </p>

    <h2>  Changing the usual format? </h2><p>  Since 1995, the overall design of Russian banknotes has not changed much, the last change affected the zeros, which were taken away during the denomination.  The appearance of banknotes was already so boring to the population that many hoped for a change.  The view of the Kremlin, cities, rocks, hydroelectric power stations is not the best option.  He is associated with the USSR.  Elena Kitaeva, the chief designer of the Kultura television channel, presented a new design of banknotes, which will feature faces of famous people, heroes.  For example, Yuri Gagarin.  Everyone knows this astronaut.  Kazimir Malevich, Fedor Dostoevsky, Dmitry Shostakovich - these names are heard even from the youngest representative of Russia.  But, unfortunately, Goznak rejected this idea, and the notes remained the same.  Elena Kitaeva was terribly disappointed in how her idea was disgraced by higher authorities.  It was called "kindergarten", "children, would you come from here", "sandbox".  And all the Russians remained with banal and boring bills.  But at least for memorable events, interesting banknotes are issued. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cost of storing </h2><p>  The ruble bill with the image of Crimea caused a stir, it was bought and resold, its value reached thousands of rubles!  This is so implausible, but true.  Selling to collectors and people who want to have an unusual bill, sellers raised prices to the ceiling.  As a result, 100 rubles were equal to 1000. This is due to the fact that there are a lot of inhabitants in Russia, and the circulation of this banknote was only 20 million pieces, much more people wanted to have it.  In addition, the Sochi banknotes had the same story.  Their circulation was exactly the same.  In everyday life there are no such banknotes; they were sorted into their collections by numismatists, resellers and just lovers of everything exclusive.  An ordinary resident will probably be very surprised if in a simple store they hand over the change to him with a new hundred-ruble note in the same denomination that it was issued.  At the moment, the hype has subsided a bit, and the average cost per bill is around 200-250 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Refusal to accept a bill </h2><p>  In Khakassia, the following incident occurred: residents in stores refused to accept new banknotes.  Naturally, this caused a wave of indignation from people.  Most likely, these notes came to them from other objects of the Russian Federation.  And ignorant sellers simply blamed everyone for making counterfeit bills.  The Government of Khakassia assured everyone that this is not a fake, and it is possible and necessary to work with them.  The official birthday of the bill is considered to be March 26, 2016, then it fell into general use.  But in fact, we are not talking about any use of all, after all, this is a collector's edition.  The official birth took place in 2015, December 23.  Despite its collection status, all sellers, without exception, are required to accept it in accordance with the face value. </p>

    <h2>  How to distinguish a fake bill </h2><p>  Naturally, everyone is afraid of fake notes, I don‚Äôt really want to blunder so much and give real money, having received a fake in response.  It is possible to distinguish a fake bill from a real one without special, complex examinations.  It is enough to know some rules.  The first and most important thing is to feel the bill with your hands; there are certain factors.  On real bills, the version for visually impaired people (located at the bottom of the bills) is more pronounced than on fakes.  The density of the banknote should not cause you doubt.  Next, we examine the bill with our eyes.  Inspect carefully!  Be sure to pay attention to the inscription: "Modification of 2010".  The increased relief in some places of the bill will also tell about its authenticity.  Be careful, it is very difficult to prove that you are not the manufacturer of fake money. </p><h2>  Can I buy a banknote now? </h2><p>  A lot of Internet users who had been addicted at one time bought up a certain number of notes.  And the easiest way out is if you did not buy the bill in time, find it on the Internet.  There are enough sellers, you just need to search. </p><p>  You can contact the banks, perhaps in the offices they are.  But this is not a fact, more enterprising users have already fussed over and bought everything that is possible.  The attempt is not torture, it is still worth trying luck. </p><p>  To ask your friends, maybe a good friend will sell you an extra bill from his collection or exchange for something else from your arsenal of treasures. </p><h2>  Comments and suggestions </h2><p>  Negative reviews about the bill, most likely, are left by those who did not manage to get it.  For this category of citizens, this is sheer nonsense.  But the lucky owners, on the contrary, are proud of the acquisition and are eagerly praising the banknote with the Swallow's Nest. </p>

    <p>  There are many offers.  As, for example, one of the winemakers of the Crimea was not satisfied with the hundred ruble bill and submitted a draft with a bill of 200 rubles, which will have beautiful views of the peninsula.  The profession leaves its mark, and he wanted his grapevine clusters, views of the Crimea vineyards and Ayu-Dag mountain to be depicted on his individual design.  The offer is due to attracting attention to the craft of winemaking in the Crimea. </p>
