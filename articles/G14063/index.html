But the latest reorganization made this hotel more comfortable, and it was upgraded to four.  The hotel is very well located, so tourists rated it as a city and beach at the same time.  It is more or less convenient to get from it to entertainment in the center of Pattaya, and to the sea.  The place is quite isolated and suitable for a decent rest.  Below we will consider how Mountain Beach attracts travelers, including Russian beach tourists.  We conducted the analysis based on real reviews. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Pattaya and to the hotel </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to the Mountain <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya).</span>  <span>Pattaya</span> (Thailand) has its own Utapao (former military) airport, which is located very close to the hotel.  But you can use the traditional way - first fly to the international hub of Bangkok, and then take the bus to Pattaya.  Moreover, getting here from the capital of Thailand is just a couple of hours.  The transfer will take you to hotels, but independent travelers will need a taxi. </p><h2>  Pattaya, Pratamnak District </h2><p>  If you come here, you might be surprised.  This area is completely unlike typical Pattaya.  This area is located between the city center and Jomtien.  This is a sleeping area, so you have to get to some particularly party places either by taxi or tuk-tuk.  But in the evening you can get enough sleep, and no noise is heard.  Pratamnak is named for the hill on which it is located.  Therefore, the Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya) is also located on a hill.  Photos of the city from some of its rooms come out just wonderful.  Since tourists from the Russian Federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union love this area, the owners of local cafes and shops, not to mention the tour bureaus, post inscriptions in Russian.  The beach at this area is separate, and on its sides are high cliffs.  The place is good, calm, suitable for families with children.  Pratamnak has its own infrastructure, so there are markets, massage parlors, and all kinds of rentals.  But on the other hand, this area is quite isolated, and cheap tuk-tuks bypass it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * Thailand (Pattaya):" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2096680.jpg"></div>

The city center is about three kilometers, but to get there on a tuk-tuk, you need about a quarter of an hour to walk to the nearest stop.  Therefore, many choose a taxi or motobike as a means of transportation.  Hotel Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya) is a single building of seven floors.  It is located with the letter “G.”  There are several shops in the lobby, including souvenir shops.  Near the hotel there are many food outlets (cafes, shops with food), pharmacies, exchangers, spas, ATMs.  And the prices are cheaper than in other areas of the city.  There is a Seven-Ileven chain store, travel agencies are located just at every step.  The hotel area is modest, but since it is located in the city, the pool and terrace, as tourists believe, is quite enough.  It is well maintained, clean and beautiful.  Most of the rooms have a pool and neighboring streets, but there are some with sea views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2096683.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya) is located across from Cliff Bay Beach.  Go there for about three minutes at a slow pace, and then you need to go down the stairs.  Cliff Bay is a sandy coast.  Like many Pattaya beaches, it belongs to the city municipality.  This means that admission is free, but sun loungers and umbrellas can only be used for money.  On the beach there is the opportunity to ride a catamaran, "banana", "bun" and try yourself in other water sports.  There are a lot of places here, but tourists are still advised to arrive early when the sun is not too active.  In addition, after 11 am, the tide begins there, and swimming is not too convenient.  Well, if you are reluctant to spend money on a comfortable vacation at sea, then the hotel has a large and clean swimming pool with a sunbathing terrace.  It is also surrounded by sunbeds and umbrellas, the use of which is included in the price.  As a rule, there are not too many people near him, but he works until the evening.  It is very good for children to swim there: the water is warm, safe.  There is a jacuzzi in the pool, and a refreshment bar is available on weekends.

Photo of the surroundings is best done from the observation deck, which is a quarter of an hour on foot.  At about the same distance is a statue of the Big Buddha.  Now for long excursions.  Of course, any tourist who has visited Thailand will tell you that it is better to buy trips not at the Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya).  Pattaya is such a city where it is much cheaper to get an excursion in a street travel agency.  The quality will be the same, but the price will pleasantly surprise you.

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  What are the guests of the Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya) taking home.  Tours to this hotel are bought not only for relaxation, but also for good shopping, and in Pattaya this is not a problem.  As is often the case in Thailand, tourists buy everything they need either at the night market or at the Tesco Lotus supermarket.  There are many good shopping centers in the city, and small but interesting shops are concentrated mainly on the streets of Beach and Second.  There are clothes for every taste and budget, but connoisseurs purchase different products from the “hand-made” series, as well as ceramics and jewelry.  But it’s better not to buy the latter from hand, because it is very easy to “run into” a fake.  There is nothing to buy something special, it’s from Pattaya, that’s why they bring home the usual set of Smile Country - coconut oil, soaps, balms, scrubs, toothpastes and various bamboo knick-knacks. </p><h2>  Mountain Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists rate the hotel as comfortable and welcoming.  Settlement is fast.  The rooms are clean, comfortable.  True, the air conditioning is very noisy, and there are no dryers for things.  Hearty breakfasts, food is always fresh.  There were no poisonings or stomach problems.  The beach, as for Pattaya, is clean enough, you can sunbathe and even swim on it.  Even splashing around in a huge pool is a pleasure.  The hotel has good sound insulation, it is not noisy, even when it is fully populated.  The infrastructure around is developed.  Not only satisfied are young people who long for the specific pleasures of Pattaya.  But for most tourists who choose this hotel, holidays usually succeed for the glory for not too much money.  It is decent, and this is another factor explaining why a trip to Thailand brings travelers positive emotions.  Many write that when vacationing in Pattaya, they would choose this hotel again. </p>
