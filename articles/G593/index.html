    <p>  Curls are obtained in the same size, the styling process is reduced.  The main drawback of the curling iron is that the hair is sometimes tangled, and pulling them out of the tongs is quite problematic.  Girls who happen to get into such an unpleasant situation argue that the locks can get stuck quite badly.  The forceps must be pulled out of the socket so as not to burn the hair.  Another feature of the styler is its high cost compared to conventional curling irons.  Babyliss Fashion Curl Secret is an order of magnitude higher than manual models in which curls need to be wound on their own, but at the same time almost all owners claim that this is a reasonable payment for convenience.  Complaints sometimes cause the dimensions and weight of the device.  Compared to conventional curling irons, Babyliss Curl Secret is rather massive and bulky.  Owner reviews indicate: when using additional styling products (foam or air conditioning), the effect of the styler is much more noticeable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features and specifications of Babyliss C1100E Curl Secret </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Babyliss c1100e Curl Secret IONIC is a modification of the previously released Babyliss</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">C</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">901</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">PE</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">curling iron</span> <span data-mce-mark="1">.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In many ways, these stylers are similar.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The principle of action is identical, identical to the shutdown system.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The main modes of operation differ.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The maximum heating of these forceps is 230 degrees, while in the previous model it was only 205.

If you need to get soft curls, the locks can withstand 10 seconds.  At the end of the work, the curling iron will emit 4 signals.  And finally, if you need cool, tight curls, choose a heating time of 12 seconds.  The device will inform you that it‚Äôs time to let your hair go with a five-fold beep.

The maximum heating temperature of the device is 230 degrees.  There are three modes of curling, differing in their duration.  A long cord (2.7 meters) allows you to maneuver during installation: go to the mirror, pick up the forgotten hairpin from the shelf.  The main difference from previous models is the ability to choose the direction of the wave.

Many girls claim that the desired curls are obtained far from the first time - you need to get used to the curling iron.  The main drawback of the model is the price.  Since the curling iron is the last modification in the series of automatic stylers "Babybis", then its price is higher than that of its predecessors.  Given that this technique is not cheap, it‚Äôs far from everyone decides to purchase it.  Attracts customers and the opportunity to choose the direction of curl curl.  Not everyone needs natural hair scattered on the shoulders.  Strict uniform curls are in demand no less.  The protective coating does not cause complaints, on the contrary, the owners note that the curling is done very carefully, and even with frequent use, the hair remains soft, does not burn.  Some complain that the device chews hair, but such cases are rare. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Babyliss Curl Secret IONIC" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1955943.jpg" width="600"></div>  This mainly happens if locks of different lengths or hair are tangled.

    <h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  On sale there are many analogues of the Babyliss C01PE Curl Secret model and further modifications of this curling iron.  They cost significantly less and at first glance are no different from the original.  However, as the experience of buyers shows, the difference in assembly quality is quite significant, despite the fact that China is the manufacturer in all cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Babyliss Curl Secret. Reviews" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1955942.jpg" width="600"></div>  Cheap counterparts are much more likely to fail after several uses, while the original model for many works for several years.  In addition, budget tongs from little-known manufacturers are much more likely to chew hair during styling, often several times in a row.  Given this feature, the buyer needs to weigh all the risks, deciding to purchase a particular model.
