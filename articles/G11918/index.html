Many Russian streets were named after him, and stamps with his image adorned Soviet envelopes for a long time.  Such a glory was quite justified, given the number of awards that he managed to receive during his service in the ranks of the Red Army. </p><p>  However, today, historians do not always agree with what Fabrizius Jan Fritsevich appears before us.  The biography of this person has many controversial points that can fundamentally change the opinion of him.  So let‚Äôs try to understand who Fabrizius really was: a fearless hero or an obedient punisher? </p>

    <h2>  Adolescence </h2><p>  Fabricius Jan Fritsevich was born on June 14, 1877 in the city of Zlekas, Courland province.  His parents were hired peasants and because of this constantly felt the need for money.  From a young age, Jan sought to help his family, as he understood that otherwise they would not be able to escape from this pit. </p><p>  Thanks to joint efforts, the mother and father were able to save enough money to send their son to the local gymnasium.  This step played an important role in the life of the boy, since it was during his studies that he first heard about revolutionary ideas.  At that moment, Jan Fabricius found the meaning of life - the goal for which he was ready to fight to the very end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Revolution to the masses </h2><p>  After graduation, in 1903, Fabricius got a job at a machine-building plant in Riga.  Here he conducts active agitation among the workers, urging them to revolutionary action.  In the same year, the young man joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. </p><p>  Alas, Jan Fabricius did not take into account the fact that such high-profile speeches will certainly arouse interest among local authorities.  Indeed, in 1904 he was convicted of antisocial behavior and sent to hard labor in Yakutia.  However, such a twist of fate does not frighten the hot youth, but only tempers his character. </p><p>  As a result, Fabricius Jan Fritsevich continues his revolutionary activities even after serving his sentence.  As a result, in 1913 he was again sent into exile, but this time to Sakhalin.  Here he meets new friends who advise him to join the ranks of the army, thereby shortening his term. </p>

    <h2>  Underground in the army </h2><p>  In the summer of 1915, Private Fabricius Jan Fritsevich was enrolled in the 1st Latvian battalion.  Of course, the former convict is given the rank of private and sent to serve in the hottest spots.  However, such an attitude is only in the hands of the revolutionary, since in such places one could always find those who did not agree with the ideas of the ruling elite. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Over time, he became the head of the local underground, which is actively recruiting new candidates.  Naturally, among the higher officers were those who doubted the loyalty of Jan Fabricius.  But he always dispelled their suspicions with his fearless behavior on the battlefield. </p>

    <h2>  Finally among my </h2><p>  After the October Revolution, Jan Fabrizius becomes chairman of the regimental committee.  In 1918, he was appointed commander of the Gdov detachment, thanks to which he manifests himself as an excellent strategist and fearless leader.  In general, the chronicles portray Jan Fritsevich as a brave man, ready to go into fire and water. </p><p>  Similar traits allowed him to quickly move up the career ladder.  So, in 1921, he was already the head of the United Courses of the Red Army command staff.  Moreover, he became the first Soviet officer to receive the Order of the Red Star, the highest award of the time. </p><p>  Jan Fritsevich died on August 24, 1929.  According to the official version, he drowned, trying to save the passengers of a sinking aircraft. </p>

    <h2>  Criticism and Controversial Facts </h2><p>  In Soviet times, historians did not need to delve into archives that could ruin the party‚Äôs reputation.  However, in our time there is no such problem, therefore, in recent years, scientists have found some inaccuracies in the biography of the Red Army hero. </p><p>  Thus, experts found some mention that in 1918, the Fabricius regiment fired on their compatriots who fled from German troops.  Also in these archives there is evidence that Jan Fritsevich tracked all those who disagree with the Soviet regime in the city of Gdov, and then they were shot. </p><p>  Also, historians have doubts about the ‚Äúheroic‚Äù death of Fabricius.  There is an opinion that he accidentally fell into the water during an airplane crash.  At the same time, the accident itself was allegedly caused by his own order, which was given to the pilot for spectacular maneuvers in front of the public. </p>
