    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the disadvantages of the Green Hill Resort and SPA 3 * hotel.  Reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  not the most convenient road to the sea; </li><li>  there are a lot of jellyfish in the sea, and therefore it is not always possible to swim; </li><li>  there is no animation, and therefore it can sometimes be boring in a hotel; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is located in close proximity to the sea, almost all the beaches are the property of neighboring hotels, and therefore it takes a long time to look for a wild area where you can swim; </li><li>  upon registration, the administrator picks up the passports that are stored in his safe until the time of eviction; </li><li>  on the way to the beach there is a busy track, which is not so easy to cross, given that drivers do not particularly stand on ceremony with pedestrians; </li><li>  standard rooms are just tiny; aka relocation to the best apartments requires an extra charge; </li><li>  throughout the hotel (except for the area around the pool) wireless Internet is not working well; </li><li>  right during the guests' rest, the hotel is undergoing renovations (it would be more logical to temporarily close the institution or reduce the cost of living); </li><li>  the institution needs a complete reconstruction; </li><li>  the bathroom is very dark (need more lighting); </li><li>  it is alarming that the water in the pool does not smell like bleach at all (the suspicion creeps in that it is not disinfected at all); </li><li>  the hotel looks rather inconspicuous from the outside, making it difficult to find upon arrival; </li><li>  use of the safe in the room is paid ($ 5); </li><li>  hygiene items have to be requested several times at the reception; </li><li>  the area is too small for walkers; </li><li>  upon check-in, you may find that there was no cleaning in the room (the situation is corrected by the reception); </li><li>  the trip from the airport to the hotel takes about 5 hours, which is very tiring after a long flight; </li><li>  there are no curtains on the bathroom windows, but on the contrary are residential buildings and a construction site. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Despite its many shortcomings, the Green Hill Resort SPA makes a pretty good impression.  Reviews mark a cozy green area, being on which you can feel complete unity with nature.  It is also worth noting a hospitable meeting by the staff and the Russian-speaking hotel owner.  Here guests will find a cozy overnight stay and delicious food. <br><br>  The greatest number of complaints is the lack of a private beach.  Official sources indicated that the sea can be reached in a minute, and in fact it takes at least a quarter of an hour to find a place to swim.  And, of course, the unpleasant moment is the need to hand over passports to the administrator.  But persistent tourists manage to defend their rights and avoid this procedure. </p>
