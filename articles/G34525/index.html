This area is rich in minerals, valuable wild animals and energy reserves in the rivers.  Convicts and exiles were sent to it.  Today we are met by a completely different Siberia.  The sights are worth seeing. </p>

    <h2>  Facts </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSiberia is about 10 million square kilometers.  In the north of the region is the tundra, empty and endless.  The central regions are occupied by the world-famous taiga, rich in furs, fish, forage grasses and much more. </p><p>  Research and a detailed description of these territories began shortly after joining the Russian Empire.  A huge contribution to the compilation of maps and atlases of Siberian lands was made by Semyon Ulyanovich Remezov.  He and his follower sons published many maps and drawings of these places.  The researchers indicated information about the population and nature. </p><p>  Altai is rightfully considered one of the most beautiful places on the planet.  Huge rivers originate in its mountains: the Ob, Irtysh and Yenisei.  There are thousands of mountain lakes in Altai. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of Altai has thousands of years, and evidence of this is found everywhere: mounds of stone, ancient writings, statues of stone.  At the end of the last century, the remains of a woman who died 2400 years ago were found in a glacier.  The nature and landscape of this region are almost untouched by civilization.  Here you will find rivers transparent, glaciers clean, and taiga - pristine.  There are such regions of Siberia that the human foot has not set foot on. </p><p>  Mount Belukha is the highest in Altai, its height is 4506 meters.  Near it are the resorts Belokurikha and Teletskoye Lake, which are among the objects of national heritage.  The healing waters of Belokurikha are known throughout the country for their wonderful properties.  The center of Siberia is the Novosibirsk region. </p><h2>  Tunguska meteorite </h2><p>  He flew over the territory of Eastern Siberia and fell on this territory on June 30, 1908.  This is a planetary phenomenon.  Scientists have collected many facts about this phenomenon and put forward several hypotheses.  However, the mystery of this event remained unsolved. </p><p>  Siberia is famous for its many secrets.  The sights here are special.  Some of them were created by nature itself, without human intervention. </p><h2>  Lake Baikal </h2><p>  This is the largest lake in the world with volumes of fresh water unattainable by others.  It is the pride of the country, a symbol of its endless expanses and natural beauty.  Its area is commensurate with the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa small state - Belgium. </p>

The zoo was created on the territory of a pine forest and has a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 hectares.  The animal park continues to expand: construction work has begun on the construction of the dolphinarium and penguinarium.  The city in which it is located is the center of Siberia. </p><p>  Its origins should be sought in 1933, when a small agricultural station in the city began to expand gradually.

Later, the symbol included a dressing, which belongs to the <span>family of martens.</span>  Employees of the zoo were able to place in it a huge number of animals from these families.

    <h2>  Pine Ribbon Burs </h2><p>  These are forest shelter belts reaching many kilometers across and located along river banks.  There are a lot of them in the south of the region.  They grow for a reason, their function is to protect soils from weathering and sand storms from the Republic of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  These forests also create a microclimate favorable for humans and animals.  The names of pine forests often come from the rivers in which they are located.  The main enemy of the tape forests is currently forest fires.

    <h2>  Pillars Preserve </h2><p>  It is located in the northwest of the Eastern Sayan.  It has about a hundred rock outcrops, whose height reaches 600 meters.  They were born thanks to the activity of volcanoes.  About 450 million years ago, hot magma, breaking through to the surface of the earth, pushed piles of limestone and sandstone.  Over time, rains and wind destroyed soft rocks.  So above the ground appeared these huge pillars, consisting of solid rocks. </p><p>  Each pillar was named after its own name.  These places have gained popularity among climbers and proponents of hanging out in the lap of nature. </p>

    <p>  The real fortress appeared here in 1800.  Construction work was begun by order of Peter I and lasted 20 years.  The fortress occupied 2.5 hectares of land and was necessary to protect the south of Siberia from the threat from China. </p><p>  The fortress did not serve military purposes for long.  By the thirties of the same century, it had lost the status of a strategic object, and in 1846 it was excluded from the list of military installations.  For more than half a century, the fortress has been used as a prison.  In 1919, it was destroyed and burned by partisans.  Now there are museums in Siberia. </p><h2>  Wooden architecture of Tomsk </h2><p>  This city has a remarkable and unique building of the historical center.  Founded Tomsk in 1604.
