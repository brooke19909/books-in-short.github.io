  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social organization</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The concept of social</span> organization can be considered in a broad and narrow sense.  In the first case, this is any organized community of people or a set of social groups interconnected.  In the second, it is a social subsystem.  In a social organization, various <span>social groups</span> interact <span>, whose</span> members are united by common interests, values, norms and goals that arise in connection with joint activities.  So, the social organization of an enterprise is a system of social groups (consisting of workers) that perform <span>production functions</span> aimed at achieving a common goal - obtaining products and subsequently material resources.  Thus, it is formed in connection with the interest of group members in obtaining material benefits. </p><p>  <strong>A social organization has certain characteristics:</strong> </p><ul><li>  the existence of a management system and power, the subordination of employees to the leadership of the enterprise; </li><li>  the presence of a common goal - the provision of services, production, etc. </li><li>  distribution of duties and powers between employees interacting with each other. </li></ul><p>  <strong>The structure of social organization</strong> </p><p>  Any organization is one of the elements of a social system.  Society includes a set of interacting organizations.  The latter is an intermediary between society and man. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of the social structure is the obligatory hierarchical ordering, which allows regulating social positions at different levels.  That is, depending on the posts, subordination of lower employees (employees) to higher ones takes place.  <span>Social roles</span> and positions that are part of the structure are fixed in the documentation, in which each assigned a certain range of responsibilities.  One of the important conditions for the functioning of the organization is the possibility of promotion through the ranks.  The second condition is the availability of a well-established communication system.  Mutual exchange of information is necessary to coordinate the activities of people and make important managerial decisions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Social organization and its types</strong> </p><p>  There are several approaches to typology. </p><p>  In the first of them there are 3 types: </p><ol><li>  institutions (cultural, financial, educational, scientific, managerial); </li><li>  enterprises (trading, manufacturing, serving); </li><li>  public organizations (voluntary, professional, religious). </li></ol><p>  In another approach, the classification is based on <span>public relations,</span> namely: </p><ul><li>  economic; </li><li>  cultural; </li><li>  social; </li><li>  managerial. </li></ul><p>  In the third campaign, the following groups are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  forced, when members of a social society become forced.  These include, in particular: the army, medical labor dispensary, prison, etc .; </li><li>  voluntary when membership arises on a voluntary basis.  These are various trade unions, parties, political movements, religious associations; </li><li>  utilitarian, when members are united to achieve some common and individual goals.  These include firms, banks, enterprises. </li></ol><p>  A social organization may also be: </p><ul><li>  public - these are mass associations to meet social, economic, cultural, political and other needs.  These include <span>social movements, political</span> parties; </li><li>  business - thanks to which workers are provided with livelihoods.  These are firms, banks and enterprises; </li><li>  associative - arises for the mutual realization of interests.  <span>These are informal groups</span> and clubs; </li><li>  intermediate - combines the features of public and business organizations.  These are cooperatives and partnerships. </li></ul>
