It seems to cling to the top of a sandy hill, smoothly descending straight to the coast of the Red Sea. </p><p>  Here you can relax on a beautiful quiet private beach with wonderful sand but no crowds of tourists.  Brightly lit at night, the resort looks spectacular and is great for taking a walk along it in the evening! </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Nada Marsa Alam Resort 4 * is a four-star hotel, decorated in ancient Nubian folk style.  It is located near the Red Sea, in the Shawnee sector. </p>

Around the hotel, beyond the road, an endless desert stretches.  To the airport (international) Marsa Alam you need to drive 20 kilometers, which is some 20-25 minutes by comfortable bus.

    <h2>  Guest Accommodation </h2><p>  Hotel Nada Marsa Alam Resort 4 * has a housing stock consisting of three buildings, in which there are a total of 260 standard rooms and four family suites.  The view from all rooms opens onto the turquoise waters of the sea, so it makes no sense to pay extra in the hope of choosing a better room - they are all equally good. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you wish, you can go for a swim in the outdoor pool directly from your room or take a walk in the green garden. </p><p>  In all standard rooms you will find: </p><p>  - a double or two twin beds; <br>  - dining / dining area; <br>  - mini fridge in which you can leave fruit or drinks; <br>  - telephone and satellite television for those who, even on vacation, do not want to lose touch with the outside world; <br>  - in a personal safe your documents and money will be safe during the whole rest time; <br>  - a manually controlled air conditioner will become a real salvation during the day, if it suddenly gets too hot, and at night it helps not to freeze; <br>  - each room has a bathroom with a hairdryer; <br>  - a terrace (for the first floor) or a balcony (for floors above) in each room is what you need if you want to breathe air alone.  Under a wooden canopy there are two sun loungers with mattresses and a small table, so right from here you can comfortably enjoy the views. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists who have been here, the Nada Resort Hotel consists of three buildings (A, B and C), the rooms in which are approximately the same in terms of convenience.  However, those who settle in Building A should be prepared for constant noise outside the window, especially at night.  The fact is that nearby, across the road, are the hotel‚Äôs diesel generators.  But if you do not sleep too lightly and do not plan to spend too much time in the room, then this will not become an obstacle. </p><p>  Food from the hotel is also praised: a choice of various dishes for every taste three times a day, plenty of fruits, meat and fish, alcohol (beer without restrictions, wine - one glass in the afternoon and evening).  And the taste of the offered sweets does not leave indifferent neither adults nor children. </p><p>  Tourists respond positively to the unobtrusiveness and courtesy of the staff.  Among the animators and attendants there are also Russian speakers, so when problems arise, there is always where to turn. </p><p>  The beach, judging by the words of those who visited the Nada Resort 4 * hotel, is located very close to the hotel.  The edge of the beach is framed by a strip of sand, and the bottom of the sea is a continuous coral plate.  The sea is very shallow, and you can enter the water on a convenient pier.  The lifeguard on duty vigilantly monitors safety and will definitely warn you if suddenly sharks have come close. </p>
