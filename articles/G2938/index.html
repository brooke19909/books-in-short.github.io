    <p>  Life on Earth has arisen for a long time.  It arose under the influence of various complex factors, which over time led not only to the appearance of life, but also to its manifestation in various forms.  Thus, the complexity of the formation conditions has led to the fact that wildlife is composed of various systems, which, combining and subordinating to each other, form a multi-level integral structure, which is unthinkable without one of the links. </p><p>  <strong>Key levels of wildlife organization</strong> </p><p>  To correctly understand this system, it is necessary to understand that the proposed <span>structures are hierarchically</span> subordinate.  Each of them can be considered as a separate system or subsystem, however, a holistic perception of living standards from a biological point of view is very important in the development of this material. </p><p>  <strong>Levels of organization of wildlife</strong> </p><p>  Before proceeding to the description, we note that a universal list of biosystems does not exist, and we have proposed the most general: here are 8 levels of organization. </p><ul><li>  Levels of organization of wildlife: molecular and cellular </li></ul><p>  Molecular.  <span>This is an archaic</span> level, which is the boundary between <span>living and non-living nature.</span>  The elementary units here are <span>chemicals:</span> proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, etc. It is here that genetic information is transferred, biosynthesis and energy conversion occurs.  Information coding is the main task of the molecular level, which, in turn, has two components: molecules of organic and inorganic compounds, as well as complexes of chemical compounds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cellular.  Here the elements are cellular associations - organelles.  He is responsible for the reproductive function, participates in the regulation of chemical reactions, and energy consumption also occurs here.  It consists of one component - a complex of molecules of chemical compounds.  At this level, biosynthesis, cell division and photosynthesis occur. </p><ul><li>  Levels of organization of wildlife: tissue and organ </li></ul><p>  Tissue.  It is represented by tissues that combine different cells with an identical structure.  In <span>multicellular organisms,</span> tissues are created during ontogenesis due to the <span>division of cells</span> into different groups.  In animals and plants, they differ, due to the specialization of cells. </p><p>  Organ.  In this system, the elements are organs of organisms.  In a number of cases, one can observe entire organ systems (in more advanced organisms), and in the simplest, movement, respiration, digestion, etc., are carried out at the expense of individual organelles. </p><ul><li>  Levels of organization of wildlife: organismic and population-specific </li></ul><p>  Organized.  This <span>level of organization of life is</span> typical for unicellular and multicellular.  Here, the possibility of various ways of nutrition is provided, a different structure is found (animals, birds, fungi, bacteria).  It also reveals the connection of the organism with the environment, which is also involved in the formation of structural features.  The main component is the cell. </p><p>  Population and species.  It is represented by a kinship that forms populations, and they, in turn, into species.  The main functions of this level are fertility and mortality, abundance, and density.  Here, a strong connection is established between the species and its habitat. </p><ul><li>  Levels of organization of wildlife: biogeocenotic and biospheric </li></ul><p>  Biogeocenotic.  This level is also referred to as the ‚Äúecosystem.‚Äù  Here we see the organization of life from the point of view of the population: this is a wide coverage of the same type (similar) creatures.  The ecosystem level has many properties: population structure, types of <span>biotic relationships, its</span> quantitative and species composition.  The main components are: environmental features and food systems. </p><p>  Biosphere.  This is the highest form of ecosystem organization.  The main elements are: ecosystems and their environment, which is understood as soil, atmosphere, hydrosphere and other global parameters.  Here the interaction of living and nonliving, as well as the circulation of substances. </p>
