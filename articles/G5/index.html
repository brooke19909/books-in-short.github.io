The walls of the structure withstood many enemy sieges during their lifetime, never once submitting to the invaders - Livonian knights. </p><p>  The enormous fortresses of ancient Russia that have reached us, like the one that stands in Izborsk, amaze contemplators with their power.  A great determination is read in the walls of antiquity to defend their lands.  To make you admire the unique Russian character.  To inspire respect for the unbending will and stoic spirit of the Russians. </p><h2>  Izborsk: history and sights </h2><p>  <span>The oldest Russian</span> settlement - the city of Izborsk - is now considered a large village bordering Pskov in the west.  In its vicinity are the famous <span>Slovenian Keys</span> and Lake Gorodishchensky. </p><p>  This place in the eighth to tenth centuries was inhabited by a Slavic tribe - Krivichi.  Tradition claims that initially the town was called Slovenian (by the name of the founder).  The current name of the settlement appeared much later.  The first mention of it was found in the annals. </p>

    <p>  Then these lands were owned by the Varangian prince Truvor, who was the younger brother of the legendary Rurik.  On the territory of ancient Izborsk, the Truvorovo settlement was preserved.  The ancient village is spread out on a small peaked plateau, abruptly breaking off above Gorodishchensky lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the water system connected with the city, in ancient times a trade route was laid that required protection.  For its safety, the townspeople built outposts on the banks of the Obdeh River.  In the X century, Izborsk began to lose ground.  The status of the shopping center is gradually shifting to Pskov. </p><p>  However, military significance remains enormous.  Its historical past is closely intertwined with the Novgorod-Pskov lands.  In the XIV century, they enclose the city with powerful walls.  The fortress never fell under the onslaught of the Livonian knights. </p><p>  To this day, the ancient town has transformed into a village where the <span>sights of Pskov are</span> preserved <span>, the</span> photos and descriptions of which contain multiple sources.  Tourists are interested in a not too damaged fortress; they go to Slovenian keys and in Truvorovo settlement. </p><h2>  The construction of Izborsk fortress </h2><p>  It is logical that a new city was founded on Zheravia Mountain.  During the siege period, all the inhabitants did not fit in the Izborsk fortress.  The attacks of the Livonian knights did not stop.  The activities of the <span>Livonian Order</span> portended new battles, the victory in which meant one thing - the independence of the Russian lands.  The problem of building powerful fortifications was acute. </p><p>  The Pskovites and the Izborians with a native stone fortified the city.  The fortress, built from lime slabs formed in the Paleozoic era, was an impressive sight.  After all, local limestones of dark gray shades are not porous and loose, but dolomitic and overly dense. </p>

    <p>  The new defense line, as well as the outpost of the Truvorov hillfort, was erected for reasons of a favorable location - on a high flat mountain plateau.  On the north, south and east sides, the ancient fortress was impregnable due to the natural steep cliffs formed by dolomite plates and a huge ravine.  From the tall cape, crashed into the Smolka coast and overhanging the Izborsk depression, panoramic views are opened. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before the construction of fortifications on a plateau, their layout was marked.  Fortress walls grew along the edge of a mountain plateau, above the very cliff.  The natural base of powerful rocks allowed the construction of incredibly high walls.  The convex reinforcement exactly repeated the local relief, protecting the site of maximum size.  The besieged fortress, whose photo is striking in beauty, housed not only the Posad people, but also the population of the surrounding villages. </p><h2>  Strengthening Transformation </h2><p>  In the middle of the <span>XIV century, the</span> fortification was an impressive form of outposts.  A triangular plateau around the perimeter was enclosed by gigantic stone walls.  In the XV century, the building undergoes significant reconstruction.  Perestroika was caused by firearms that did not exist until then, replaced by tactics of sieges and defensive actions. </p><p>  First of all, they converted the towers, where the innovations of military equipment were placed.  Then they further strengthened the north side.  However, these alterations did not significantly change the initial appearance of the structure. </p><p>  An unbreakable colossus looks like a fortress.  Photos of her are presented in our article.  From the place where Truvorovo settlement was located, the outpost seemed to have grown from a gigantic rock, becoming its integral continuation. </p><p>  Chronicles reflect the great importance of this defense structure.  They described a vivid episode.  Priests made a procession along the ‚Äúwall place‚Äù.  Near the towers and gates they celebrated prayers.  So the confessors consecrated the city, a fortress that saved a piece of Russian land from enemies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Description of the fortress </h2><p>  The majestic Izborsk fortress, erected on top of the Mount of Zeravia, outlines the shape of a triangle, the corners of which are rounded.  It is impregnable by two steep cliffs and specially dug ditches.  The grandiose lime walls are 623 m long, high, fluctuating in the interval of 7-10 m, and 4 m thick. </p><p>  This fortification fortification was originally a perfection that did not require restructuring.  Only minor adjustments were made to it, which made it possible to introduce technical and military innovations that appeared in one or another century.  The fortress, now included in the sights of Pskov, the photos and descriptions of which are quite accessible, developed and changed as the ancient town grew. </p><h2>  Fortifications </h2><p>  They get into the fortress overcoming Nikolsky Zahab - a narrowed long corridor with which the southern wall is equipped.  The first thing that appears to visitors is the Temple of St. Nicholas, crowned with a silver dome.  In ancient times, locals called the settlement "City of St. Nicholas", and the cathedral was called "his home."  Attaching thereby special significance to the St. Nicholas Church. </p><p>  In addition to it, Izborsk fortress has a lot of other significant structures.  The map clearly indicates the location of each of them. </p>

    <h2>  Lukovka Tower </h2><p>  Kukovka (and Lukovka has such a name) is the most mysterious tower.  This is the only tower structure embedded inside the thick fortified fence.  The tower has been preserved since the time when the Izborsk fortress was a wooden outpost. </p><p>  Much later, it literally becomes a "fortress in a fortress."  She was assigned the role of the last refuge if the enemy took possession of the main defensive structure.  At the bottom of Lukovka, an <span>arched opening was</span> created <span>,</span> which once served as an arsenal - a powder storage. </p><p>  In addition, she was assigned the function of a sentinel.  The top of Kukovka is equipped with a viewing platform, from where panoramic views of the immediate surroundings open.  Onion, having undergone multiple reconstructions, lost its original internal appearance, created in antiquity.  But the panoramas remained almost the same. </p><h2>  Talav tower </h2><p>  Talavskaya tower - a rectangular structure, adjoins the eponymous zaba, which in the old days had the terrible name "corridor of death."  The entrance and exit of the passage closed the gate.  The enemy, breaking the outer gate, fell into a narrow trap, in which he was overtaken by an inevitable defeat. </p><h2>  Brandy and Darkness Towers </h2><p>  Rabinovka - a hexagonal defensive structure of a frightening appearance.  Dark-hearted silhouette is similar to Ryabinovka.  Both towers took the main enemy strike from the west.  Namely from here, as it seemed to the enemy, from the most accessible side, it is necessary to attack the gigantic fortress. </p><h2>  Bell tower </h2><p>  The traditional <span>fortification structure</span> dating back to the early firearms era is represented by the Bell Tower.  The construction was equipped with a bell, announcing the arrival of "uninvited guests" - enemy troops.  The rumble emanating from the bell reached Pskov. </p><h2>  Tower </h2><p>  And of course, Izborsk fortress is equipped with a tall tower.  The tower is a review post.  Its top was once crowned by a lookout, assembled from wood and consisting of two tiers.  Almost right next to the Stone Tower, a cross is laid out - the inspirer of the outpost warriors and intimidation for the enemy. </p><h2>  Hawks </h2><p>  The narrow passage corridors - Nikolsky and Talavsky - were excellent obstacles for the penetration of enemy forces through the outer gates into the fortress yard.  In addition, they played the role of a dangerous trap.  Locking the enemy in a tiny space from which there was no move, they led to the inevitable death of the invaders. </p><h2>  Temple structures </h2>

    <p>  In the icon case of the Korsun Chapel, the name of the creator of the building, architect-artist A.I. Vladovkovgo, is inscribed in Old Slavonic language.  And on the site of the burnt wooden cathedral of St. Sergius of Radonezh, the temple complex of St. Sergius and Nikander was rebuilt.  It just so happened that the new ensemble turned out to be outside the fortress. </p><h2>  Sights of Truvorovoy fortification </h2><p>  The ancient settlement was named after Prince Truvor, who ruled Izborsk lands.  The first defense building, surrounded by ravines, which ceased to meet the requirements of wartime, was transferred to the neighboring rock - Mount Zheravyu.  An ancient cemetery has been preserved in the place of the ancient outpost. </p><h2>  Truvorovo cemetery </h2><p>  At the end of the gloomy ancient necropolis stands a huge cross built of stone.  On its surface are inscribed letters that have almost faded under the influence of time.  The Izborsk fortress is amazing, its history is overgrown with unfounded myths.  In particular, two legends have a right to exist about the cross. </p><p>  One claims that the cross is an attribute of an ancient outpost, the first settlement that marked the beginning of the defense of Russia.  According to another legend, the cross is installed on the grave of Prince Truvor, whose body is lowered to rest to a depth of more than two meters. </p><p>  In a word, the giant stone pedestal is the keeper of the secrets of the fortress, the roots of which are rooted in ancient times.  Next to the monument are old slabs dotted with obscure geometric ornaments.  There is an assumption that under the "Babylon" are hidden military graves. </p><h2>  Temple in the Truvorov settlement </h2>

    <p>  Near the cemetery is a hill, the top of which is crowned by the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  The sight of her white-stone walls, mottled with black crosses, is intimidating, especially in the thick twilight.  Initially, a wooden church stood on this site, which was later replaced by a stone church.  A few steps from the sanctuary a huge stone is erected - a symbol of a truce with the Estonians. </p><h2>  River of life </h2><p>  In the lowlands of the hill, in the place where the border of the Truvorov hillfort merges with the foot of the Mount Zheravia, from the cliff formed by dense limestones, many thousands of Slovenian keys spring.  They, merging among themselves, formed a sonorous stream, nicknamed the "River of Life." </p>
