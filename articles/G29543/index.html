However, now manufacturers have taken into account flaws and produce devices with a specially built-in element that eliminates a similar effect.  Experts recommend choosing <span>energy-saving</span> high-power <span>lamps</span> with warm light, the glow of which is not lower than 2400K.  Such light has a pleasant yellowish tint, reminiscent of the usual light from an incandescent lamp. </p><p>  If you decide to study the question of the dangers of these devices, you can enter in the search engine the query ‚Äúenergy-saving harm lamps‚Äù, the system will certainly produce at least 10 pages with the answer to your question.  Almost on each of them, the effect of light bulbs on the skin will be surely noted. </p>

    <p>  For people with sensitive skin, light from an energy-saving lamp can cause irritation, rash, and even eczema.  According to studies by scientists from Britain, such devices can even cause skin cancer.  Here you have <span>energy-saving lamps.</span>  The harm caused by them is irreparable, their radiation is not recommended for infants to avoid allergic reactions to the skin. </p><p>  Another scientist, but already from Israel, confirms the previously expressed fears that an energy-saving fluorescent light that burns at night can disrupt the production of melatonin (maximum production occurs at night).  It prevents cancer of the prostate or breast.  It is noteworthy that even if a person is sleeping, that is, his eyes are closed, the light from the lamp still affects him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Often, <span>energy-saving bulbs</span> burst with strong heating.  And since there is mercury inside them, it is released and can poison the surrounding air, since the amount of poison released per cubic meter is 20 times higher than all permissible standards for rooms.

    <p>  Are there any other negative aspects of such a lighting method as energy-saving lamps?  Their harm has been proven by not one or two scientists, more and more studies are being conducted every month, which indicate that such devices have a bad effect on human health. </p><p>  Here is another fact that energy-saving lamps adversely affect health.  A research team of scientists from Israel has proved that the bright light that bulbs give is capable of becoming a carcinogen due to its brightness.  And this leads to an increased risk of <span>cancer cells</span> in the body. </p><p>  Oddly enough, the energy-saving lamp emits electromagnetic radiation.  Violation of the norms is observed within 10-15 cm from the device.  Of course, when using it on the ceiling or to illuminate the street, nothing bad happens.  However, what if the light bulb is screwed into a lamp or a night lamp?  And if a child is similar, who is very sensitive to various kinds of radiation? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that with so many shortcomings and a negative impact on human health, the world is in no hurry to return to ordinary bulbs, on the contrary, ordinary incandescent bulbs disappear from the sale.  All this leads to the fact that the market is filled with energy-saving lamps, the harm from which, although proven, is currently not taken into account in the pursuit of imaginary savings.  This is fundamentally wrong. </p><p>  Energy-saving lamps.  Reviews </p><p>  We suggest you consider the list of cons of energy-saving light bulbs, which their users made: </p><ul><li>  Price.  It is much higher than the cost of an ordinary light bulb, when calculating it can be noted that for the amount for which an energy-saving lamp is purchased, you can buy several ordinary ones, which in total will last as much as energy-saving. </li><li>  Sizes.  In this case, they are of great importance, since not all energy-saving lamps are able to fit in small shades that are not designed for such large sizes. </li><li>  It is quite difficult to choose the right color, and it does not always suit users. </li><li>  The inability to properly dispose of burned out lamps as they cannot be thrown into the trash.  But handing them over for processing is quite problematic. </li><li>  Low and high temperatures adversely affect the operation of modern lamps.  In the first case, they do not work, and in the second, the quality of lighting decreases. </li><li>  Lamps are not intended for luminaires with dimmers, which many people have switched to because of savings. </li><li>  The more often they turn them on and off, the faster they burn out.  They are designed for continuous burning. </li></ul><p>  Of course, as a conclusion, it is worth noting that all these diseases can occur in people with poor health or after suffering serious illnesses.  However, this does not mean that energy-saving lamps are safe for healthy people. </p>
