This is Toronto - the industrial center of Canada, often called the tourist mecca.  Many consider it the most Americanized city, sometimes comparing it with New York. </p><h2>  Man-made monuments </h2><p>  The bustling metropolis, based on the intersection of water and land routes near <span>Lake Ontario,</span> has long attracted the attention of tourists from around the globe. </p><p>  The North American city has much to be proud of, and annually a huge number of travelers come to fall in love with the unusual look of Toronto, the sights of which are built by talented human hands. </p><h2>  The world's largest zoo </h2><p>  The city is famous for its quiet corners, where you can relax from civilization in nature, having received a charge of vivacity.  Toronto Zoo, located on more than 300 hectares, is one of the three largest in the world. </p><p>  It is not possible to get around such a huge natural corner located a few kilometers from the city in one day.  The zoo boasts not only the presence of <span>animals in North America.</span>  Pavilions of the tropical jungle and African savannah gather a huge number of adults and children looking at the freely moving pets of the zoo. </p>

    <p>  But the most popular holiday destination is the territory, chosen by beavers, - the national pride of Canadians.  Only here, having forgotten about all the problems, one can observe how these cute animals build dams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Zoo employees are committed to instilling in their children a love of wildlife.  A special camp has even been created here, in which each kid learns a lot about the animal world, touches it, staying for the night in an amazing reserve. </p><h2>  Music park </h2><p>  Another picturesque place that attracts tourists is located in the heart of Toronto.  Sights known around the world appeared due to the work of the famous cellist, who presented a tape about Bach's works to the audience.  One of the parts of the film was called ‚ÄúThe Musical Garden‚Äù and spoke about the amazing harmony of a person who came into contact with classical music.  The landscape designer who helped with the filming got the idea to create a similar park in his city. </p><p>  After the approval of the project by the local authorities, a well-thought-out musical garden appeared, consisting of several corners, representing parties from the suite. </p><p>  The most original sights of Toronto (Canada) is a favorite vacation spot of all local residents, which gives an incredible opportunity to be alone not only with nature, but also with live music that sounds everywhere.  And the organizers of the stunning park, which has no analogues, were awarded the international prize. </p><h2>  High park </h2><p>  However, the largest park, occupying 160 hectares of land, is High Park, located within the Toronto.  Sights, photos of which, unfortunately, do not convey all the grandeur and beauty of the territory preserved in a natural state, were discovered back in 1876. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The high park with dedicated picnic areas is ideal for family vacations and various cultural events.  In summer, a large-scale Shakespeare festival is held here, gathering not only Canadians. </p>

    <p>  Visitors note the special art of gardeners, expressed in the unusual form of colorful flower gardens.  Only here tourists can enjoy the picturesque gardens, consisting of baskets suspended in the air, and the sunken greenhouses are of particular interest to everyone who first came to Toronto's most famous park. </p><p>  Sights open to all visitors are unusually beautiful in winter, when iridescent fluffy snow turns a gigantic territory into a real fairy tale.  Kids are attracted by the flooded skating rink and the numerous slides from which it is so fun to ride.  An ideal service park has long been Toronto's national treasure. </p><h2>  Sightseeing: Rideau Canal (Canada) </h2><p>  Speaking about Canadians' favorite time of the year, one cannot fail to mention the world's largest natural ice rink, located in the capital of Canada - the city of Ottawa, which many mistake by mistake from Toronto.  Winterlude festivals are held annually in a pond carefully prepared for visitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  And in the summer, gateways open and fascinating boat trips, popular among tourists, are held along the canal. </p><h2>  Medieval castle </h2><p>  What historical sites should I look for in Toronto?  The sights of Casa Lomo - a grand castle erected in the best traditions of the Middle Ages - will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  The palace complex, built at the beginning of the last century, consisting of three floors, a hunting lodge and an impressive basement, perfectly reflects the excellent taste of the former owner - the famous city broker.  The main secret of the castle that attracts attention lies in secret underground passages that permeate the entire territory of the magnificent structure and connect the house with the outbuildings.  And the exquisite decoration of the palace will shock everyone with incredible luxury. </p>

    <p>  It is not so difficult to enjoy the beauty of the historical castle: now it is a famous tourist attraction that has opened its doors to all visitors.  The museum, existing since 1937, tells a lot of new things not only about the grandiose construction, but also about the history of Toronto. </p><h2>  Sightseeing: RANT Shopping District </h2><p>  It is believed that the main tourist highlight of the city is hiding underground.  Without exaggeration, we can say that this is the most ambitious architectural project of our time. </p><p>  The fact is that all the skyscrapers of huge shopping centers have underground floors connected by thirty-kilometer crossings.  These are heated rooms, which house business offices, famous restaurants, grandiose parking lots, and magnificent fountains and green parks strewn with greenery amaze with their beauty. </p>

    <p>  The RATN underground commercial center is a real work of architectural art, combining more than 50 high-rises and the six most popular hotels in the city.  There are five metro stations on the territory of the subway, allowing quick access even to distant areas. </p><p>  And the townspeople are trying to buy apartments in those skyscrapers in which elevators descend to the underground floors of the PATH.  In fact, you can move around without even going to the surface, and enthusiastic tourists believe that this is a futuristic city of the 21st century. </p><h2>  City cemetery </h2><p>  Toronto, whose attractions are very unusual, is famous for Mount Pleasant Cemetery - a favorite place for walks of local residents.  In the 19th century, the church decided to bury all heretics far beyond the borders of the political and economic center. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, the city expanded, and a huge cemetery appeared in its very center.  At the moment, more than 150 thousand people are buried there, and among them there are very famous people. </p><p>  There are no graves in the cemetery, and there are only small gravestones made of stone, on which only the initials are knocked out.  Residents of Canada are philosophical about the necropolis, without sorrow and pain, believing that walking on the green carpet pacifies and gives the necessary peace. </p><h2>  Chinese Lantern Festival </h2><p>  The brightest holiday, regularly held near Lake Ontario, is the Chinese Lantern Festival, held for the first time in 2006 and attracted 200,000 curious spectators.  The colorful celebration, which begins at night, impresses with colorful lights that illuminate the lanterns of the most bizarre shapes. </p>
