It was opened in 2006, so, by local standards, is quite young.  Kranevo impresses vacationers with its gorgeous beaches, as well as well-developed infrastructure. </p><p>  The hotel is well located: only 800 meters to the sea and 10 minutes at a calm pace to the resort center.  All potential tourists care about Hotel Randevu reviews and prices.  Kranevo (Bulgaria) is a small resort town, so it can offer a budget vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Randevu 2 * (Kranevo, Bulgaria)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1537713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is located on the last street of the resort village, and almost on its very edge, so those tourists who expect a comfortable and quiet holiday away from the hustle and bustle will like it.  Quite often, families with small children come here, because Bulgaria with its excellent sandy beaches is considered one of the best places for recreation for the smallest tourists. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  All tourists and vacationers celebrate the hospitality and hospitality of the owners of the hotel - a married couple.  In general, the attitude towards the guests is excellent: not all luxury hotels have such friendliness and a desire to do everything for the most comfortable and memorable pastime of the guests.  Many enthusiastic reviews speak about the efficiency of checking in the room.  They certainly will not leave anyone sleeping on the street.  Tourists who arrive at the hotel late in the evening are never left without a delicious dinner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During their stay at the Randevu 2 * hotel (Kranevo, Bulgaria), many tourists get so used to the owners who meet and escort them as their next of kin.

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is represented by only 10 double and 5 triple rooms. Reviews of the hotel Rendezvous 2 * (Kranevo) tell us that the rooms are very small, simple in design, but quite comfortable.  Some tourists note that, once in their room, they immediately remembered the Soviet hotels: everything here is so consistent with the spirit of that time.  Each room has a balcony, a set of furniture, satellite TV and a private bathroom with a shower, hairdryer and necessary amenities.  For a fee, wireless high-speed internet and a minibar are available.  The condition of the equipment is satisfactory, in some rooms the air conditioning is buzzing, in others tourists encounter interference with the operation of the television.  But all this does not in the least violate a calm and measured rest in Bulgaria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Randevu 2 * (Bulgaria, Kranevo): reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1537729.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You should not expect a chic decor, modern furniture and designer interiors from a 2 * hotel.  Furniture is far from new, but quite solid.  Comfortable mattress and clean linens - what else do tourists who spend only a night in their room need?  Shower is another story.  Unfortunately, in no room there is a curtain, so the spray during washing flies in different directions.  You have to get used to the constant puddle on the floor, but the budget option can be forgiven for this drawback.  Sometimes there are problems and interruptions in the supply of hot water, but they, according to the guests, are of a short-term nature. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Of course, all vacationers planning their stay in a 2 * hotel do not count on a huge landscaped area.  Randevu 2 * (Bulgaria, Kranevo) is no exception.  Reviews of tourists indicate the presence of a small territory, which is typical of urban-type hotels, and parking for cars.  It will become a real salvation for those vacationers who decide to rent a car and travel around the entire coast on it.  Sometimes tourists come here by private car, so the presence of a guarded parking space will also please them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews for the hotel Rendezvous 2 * (Kranevo)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1537735.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a good children's playground for the youngest guests.  This is not surprising, because in Bulgaria hundreds of thousands of tourists with small children relax every year - the best conditions are created for them. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily (by the way, quite high quality), bed linen and towels are changed as necessary.  Cleanliness and order are maintained everywhere.  For an additional fee, the hotel staff will tidy up your things: wash and iron them.  Everyone can order breakfast, lunch or dinner with room service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Randevu 2 * (Kranevo, Bulgaria): reviews and prices" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1537754.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  You can eat in the restaurant with a chic summer terrace.  It prepares dishes of European cuisine, and it will be possible to taste the masterpieces of national Bulgarian cuisine.  Guests can take breakfast, half board and guest house.  What do the reviews say about food at the Randevu 2 * hotel (Kranevo, Bulgaria)?  Both the prices and the menu are quite satisfactory, but ... according to tourists, in local restaurants the offers are so interesting that it is better to refuse meals at the hotel.  If you are counting on a Swedish tol, similar to what you are accustomed to watching in Turkey or Egypt, you will have to disappoint: you certainly will not see this.  This is a "kopeck piece".  Portioned food: what you bring, then you will eat.  That is why it is better to eat in local restaurants and cafes: there are plenty of them.  On average, lunch or dinner for two with beer or wine will cost 20-30 leva.  The kitchen is excellent, the products are fresh. </p>

    <p>  Fruits and vegetables can be purchased in the market and in any supermarket.  Boiled corn, seafood, soft drinks and ice cream are sold on the beach.  Many tourists are limited to breakfast and dinner, and lunch is replaced by fresh fruit. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach is only 15-20 minutes.  The path will run through several small shops where you can buy soft drinks, fresh fruits and vegetables.  Hotel Rendezvous 2 * (Bulgaria, Kranevo) has largely won its rating due to its excellent beach.  White sand, gentle entry into the water and crystal clear sea water are just what you need for an excellent beach holiday. </p><p>  On the beach you can rent sports equipment, do water sports.  For an additional fee, you can use sun loungers and parasols.  Enough vacationers gather here in the season, all lovers of a secluded, even wild vacation can take a walk along the coast: you will surely find a quiet and secluded place. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you are looking for the most affordable option, the hotel Hotel Randevu 2 * in Kranevo (Bulgaria) will be a good option.  Of course, this hotel cannot offer impeccable service, and the rooms are extremely simple, very modest, but they are quite suitable for an overnight stay.  Tourists who are picky and spoiled by Turkish service and comfort are likely to be horrified by what they saw, but we suggest closing our eyes to some of the shortcomings and remembering that this is a hotel awarded only 2 stars.  This is a good budget option for those tourists who appreciate the human attitude, hospitality and want to save on the place of residence, so that you can spend hard-earned money on excursions and other types of cognitive, active pastime. </p>
