  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pedagogy as the science to which the future belongs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sciences are different.  Among them, a special place today is given to pedagogy, which, after <span>faith in God,</span> is that niche that can save the world from moral death, since pedagogy, as the science of education, that is, the transformation of a person into a real person, is called to create, not destroy. </p><p>  What is understood by the term ‚Äúupbringing‚Äù?  This is not just the formation of a human personality.  Under the influence of a proper educational process, a person becomes controlled in the good sense of the word.  The qualities and abilities inherent in man by nature in the process of education are being improved.  There is a mandatory progressive transition from the lower to the higher, more noble and valuable.  All actions of a man brought up are aimed at introducing into the life of society such moments that make life easier, but not complicate it.  This is the task that professional pedagogy as a science performs. </p><p>  Pedagogy as a science is the cornerstone for the preparation of a teacher who knows how to use a word, example or reproducing new conditions to encourage a student to take positive actions, discreetly preventing unwanted processes.  Moreover, what is the goal of the teacher brought up by the person is done quite consciously, based on internal feelings and motivations.  That is, the external stimulus created by the educator becomes the engine of internal needs and desires, into the conscious need to perform good actions formed in the brain.  There can be no talk of any pressure in the process of education.  And pedagogy as a science of education with its theoretical principles and practical developments is called upon to realize the formation of a conscious personality. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, professional pedagogy as a science is not a supporter of the influence on pupils of only educating personalities in the person of parents or teachers.  The direct impacts they provide are, of course, invaluable.  But one cannot but take into account the indirect influences to which the individual is exposed in the process of upbringing.  These include the impact of the team and the environment in which the person grows and develops.  Unfortunately, this influence does not always carry positive aspects, as a result of which an uncontrollable personality can grow.  This is where the process of life organization comes into force, to which pedagogy as a science assigns a special place. </p><p>  The interaction of adults and children occurs in contact with various situations that arise in life.  And on how skillfully the teacher in these conditions knows how to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù the problem, how actively he influences the formation of the right concepts in a growing person and the level of upbringing of a new personality depends on. </p><p>  Pedagogy as a science, along with education, assigns an important place to learning.  This concept is two-sided.  The teacher transfers his knowledge to the students, and they, in turn, must learn it and then apply it in their lives.  And the skilled teacher makes the main emphasis on the transfer of the knowledge and experience that humanity has accumulated not only in the field of science and technology, but also morality and ethics, politics and culture.  Thus, we see that the concept of learning cannot exist separately from the educational process. </p><p>  Pedagogy as a science understands the processes of education and training as an active cognitive activity of a person.  You can not automatically take and use knowledge.  You need to understand their meaning, to test them in your practice and apply them in life where appropriate.  That is, the formation of a worldview of a person who is ready to benefit society - this is the main task of such a science as pedagogy. </p>
