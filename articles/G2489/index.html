Then, in 1948, the country tried to break out of the "fraternal" embrace of the Big Brother - the Soviet Union.  This is also the name of the music festival, which has been held annually in the Czech capital since 1946.  And we, wandering through the narrow streets of the ancient city, will be imbued with the freedom-loving spirit of this people, its harmony and cheerfulness.  Spring Prague pleases tourists not only with a music festival dedicated to the anniversary of the composer Smetana (May 12).  Walpurgis Night and the <span>celebration of the Czech</span> Uprising, Annunciation and Easter - secular holidays mixed with religious.  The richest in folk festivals is May.  In addition to the traditional Days of Workers' Solidarity and Victory, a gypsy festival takes place at the beginning of the month in Prague.

The second reason is the weather.  May in Prague is a truly summer month.  Cafes and restaurants <span>open up</span> to outdoor <span>terraces</span> .  Parks are full of fragrant flowers.  <span>The daylight hours are</span> long, and even after sunset it is nice to stroll through the old streets on a warm evening.  And the third reason, the most important: the city is just getting ready for the opening of the tourist season, there is still no summer crowd on the streets that makes it difficult to take a high-quality picture of local attractions.  Prague in May is not yet full as in July.  True, the first decade of the month is considered the "high season", but then the flow of tourists goes into decline.  And you can reduce the cost of a trip to May to the capital of the Czech Republic thanks to early booking of hotels or, on the contrary, by buying a ticket the day before departure.

The Czech Republic is not a subtropical, but winters are milder there than ours, and therefore spring comes earlier.  In the afternoon, even at the beginning of the month, the temperature is kept at +20 degrees.  As everywhere in the temperate climate zone, May is a time of thunderstorms.  An umbrella, or even a raincoat, is not placed.  But showers quickly sweep, giving the air freshness.  The temperature in Prague in May is very comfortable - not hot, but not cold.  Of course, there are anomalies, as, for example, in a very rainy spring of 2013, when there were floods in the Czech Republic, and throughout Central Europe.  From shoes, we advise you to grab sneakers or comfortable shoes with low soles, because the historical center of Prague is covered with paving stones that can break off heels.  Just in case, take a warm sweater, windbreaker or raincoat.  But in any case, due to the weather, your vacation will not be spoiled. </p>

    <h2>  Prague for the May holidays </h2><p>  Are you planning to use the long weekend at the beginning of the month to travel to the Czech capital?  Although this vacation option cannot be called budgetary (since many compatriots will go on a trip with you), a colorful parade and other interesting events await you.  May Day demonstration in Prague takes place without unnecessary officialdom.  Nobody drives away a voluntary-compulsory event, so the real atmosphere of the holiday is felt in the air.  The solidarity of the workers in the afternoon is expressed in noisy gatherings on the summer terraces of the cafe with a glass of beer.  Prague on May holidays pleases tourists <span>with an open day</span> at museums.  For example, in 2014, free admission was announced in Prague Castle.  Usually a ticket there is not cheap.  But on May 3, not only the main exposition will be open to all comers, but also those rooms that are closed to sightseers at other times.  You have a wonderful opportunity to see the Rudolph Gallery, the Habsburg Salon, walk through the Spanish, Rothmeier, Throne, Brozhikov halls, get into the south wing of the New Palace.  So use this chance: free tours on this day will be held from 9.00 to 16.30. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Walpurgis Night </h2><p>  The eve of May 1 in Western Christian tradition is considered a time of rampage of evil spirits.  To expel her from the face of the earth, the Czechs arrange colorful ceremonies.  The fun lasts all night from April 30 to May 1.  The culmination of the holiday is the burning of the effigy of the sorcerer - the collective image of all evil.  They say that Walpurgisnacht (Witches' Sabbath Night) came to the Czech Republic from Germany, but researchers believe that the Paleni Sorceress custom has pre-Christian roots.  Prague in May gives you the opportunity to admire other spectacles.  For example, no less colorful gypsy festival. </p><h2>  What to do in spring Prague </h2><p>  First of all, buy a so-called tourist card.  It provides an opportunity not only to save on public transport, but also to get to the capital's museums at a discount, or even free of charge.  So <span>what to see in Prague</span> in May?  We recommend starting with a city tour.  If you arrived in the Czech capital on your own, go to any travel agency and purchase this bus and pedestrian tour.  Do not like to follow a guide in an organized manner?  Then there is another option.  From the end of March, a special tram begins to run in Prague.  It is called "Numer 91" or "Nostalgic."  For 25 CZK (children and seniors are asked 10 each), you can drive to all the important places in the city.  The tram leaves every hour, from noon until six in the evening, from Vozovna Stresovice. </p><h2>  Prague on foot </h2>

Prague in May - reviews reiterate this with one voice - completely not filled with tourists.  At least you will be able to take pictures of the Old Town Square without a crowd in the frame.  From this place - the heart of the city - almost all excursions begin.  After all, here are the ‚ÄúOrloi‚Äù watches, which have become a distinctive hallmark of Prague.  Pay attention also to the monument to Jan Hus - the famous humanist and religious figure in the Czech Republic.  From Old Town Square, you can head towards Charles Bridge, the Jewish Quarter, Zlata street or simply delve into the labyrinth of a medieval city.  At any time, whether you are thirsty or hungry, you will find numerous characteristic pubs and cafes with summer terraces.

Do not forget about this in the Czech capital.  To enjoy sakura blossoms, aromas of lilac and jasmine, go to Petrin.  Despite the fact that this hill is indicated as a ‚ÄúMust see‚Äù on all tourist maps, there are very few people here.  This is for the best.  From May Petr≈°√≠n observation deck all of Prague in May - at a glance.  If you are scared by the prospect of climbing up on foot, you can climb the top of the hill by cable car.  If you came to Prague with a different heart, be sure to find a monument to Karl Hink Mach on Petr≈°in.  This poet in the Czech Republic, like St. Valentine, is considered the patron saint of all lovers.  And if you come on vacation with a child, be sure to visit the city zoo with him.  And in any case, do not miss the opportunity to admire the singing fountains.  The play of light music and falling jets alternates with the performances of ballet troupes.

    <h2>  Prague in bad weather </h2><p>  Spring sun moody.  It will show a ray, then hide behind a cloud.  What can Prague give us in May?  Reviews of tourists who came to the city in the rainy spring of 2013 were not at all dull.  Go to the Strahov Monastery, which was erected in 1141.  Here is a library of old books and an art gallery.  Even on a rainy day you can go to the Cathedral of Loretta, in the treasury of which is a collection of donors.  Of greatest importance is the Prague Sun, adorned with six thousand diamonds.  In 2014, throughout May, the Moscow collection of dinosaur fossils will be presented to the general public at the local Vistavishte Exhibition Hall.  On this tour, you can safely go with the baby.  The concept of Czech museums is such that it will be interesting to both old and small.  Paris Street in Prague is a shopaholic's paradise: boutiques, branded clothing stores and an endless number of interesting shops. </p><h2>  Festivals </h2>

Some festivals take place every year, and some every few years.  What does May 2014 promise us?  From the eighth of this month to the third of June, the sixty-sixth annual Prague Spring Music Festival will take place in Prague.  This event pleases citizens and tourists with concerts not only performed by reputable creative groups, such as, for example, the National Chamber Orchestra.  Along with them, young musicians and young talents can demonstrate their talent.  If the ticket for the Prague Spring costs 200 CZK, then you can participate in the Beer Festival for free.  From May 15 to May 31 at Vistavishte lovers of a foamy drink will be simply fascinated by the choice that opens before them.  Czechs are big beer lovers.  But they do not forget and have a bite!  Together with well-known Czech breweries, Prague's confectioners, butchers and cooks from leading restaurants in the capital will present their products.

The Czech Republic in this sense is no exception.  Prague in May - this photo is clearly demonstrated - beautiful, but small resort towns drowning in the lush green of blooming gardens look even more beautifully and castles towering proudly on the rocks.  If you do not spend the weekend in the Czech capital, but spend your whole vacation, it will not be superfluous to go to the travel agency and book a one-day excursion to Cesky Krumlov.  A standard trip includes a visit to another castle on the road - Hluboka nad Vltavou.  <span>On May 2,</span> 2014, the holiday season will be inaugurated in the most famous Czech resort of Karlovy Vary.
