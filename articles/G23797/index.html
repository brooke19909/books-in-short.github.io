    <h2>  Why choose Antalya resort for relaxation? </h2><p>  The choice of this Turkish resort is explained very simply.  First of all, it is the proximity to the airport and the lack of a long transfer.  Important for many tourists is a small distance from a large city.  Especially for lovers of vibrant resort life and connoisseurs of Turkish shopping.  The presence of sandy beaches here is also important, which is especially appreciated when traveling to the sea with small children.  And most importantly, especially in times of crisis - this is the cost of travel.  Of course, here ahead of Europe in the first place, Turkey. </p><p>  Antalya, whose vacation prices are pleasantly different in the rating lists, has another advantage - a wide selection of hotels in the middle price segment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Turkey <span>(Antalya):</span> 3 star <span>hotels</span> </h2><p>  The middle segment is the famous Antalya "three rubles".  They are small, comfortable, meet all the necessary conditions for relaxation and budget.  Usually, when choosing them, tourists are guided by the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  Location (distance from the sea). </li><li>  The presence of the concept of "all inclusive". </li><li>  Hotel reviews. </li></ul><p>  In order to evaluate the quality of this type of accommodation, we will look at one of the hotels that belongs to this category of leisure - Isinda Hotel 3 *.  Based on the analysis of the quality of rest, it is possible to draw practical recommendations for the right choice of hotels in this category. </p><p>  This is a typical city hotel with a small territory, convenient location and, which is uncharacteristic for most "three rubles", with its own beach in the immediate vicinity of the coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Antalya 3 star hotels" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/678800.jpg" width="442"></div>  It belongs to the category of "strong three rubles", that is, hotels that match the quality of the services provided to those indicators that are taken into account during certification.

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Isinda Hotel (3 stars) is located <strong> </strong>  five kilometers from the resort center, the city of Antalya.  This is convenient because, being remote from the city, the hotel provides a good rest.  On the other hand, regular bus service makes it easy to get to the center of vibrant metropolitan life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The advantages of choosing a hotel include a tireless transfer, since Isinda is located 16 kilometers from the airport.  Even with a group transfer, you don‚Äôt have to wait long for all arriving tourists to be delivered to their place of residence. </p><p>  The hotel is 90 meters from the sea, its own beach, across the road.  Isinda is an excellent option for those categories of vacationers for whom staying in a hotel is not the purpose of travel, but only an element of a good night's rest.  Especially for those who value the proximity of the sea and the low cost of rest. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is included in the price of the tour.  Regarding the concept of food, the hotel offers lunch and dinner in a restaurant with an indoor hall and an open section, designed for 56 seats, according to the ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turkey antalya prices" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/678791.jpg" width="500"></div>  A fairly large selection of dishes of oriental (Turkish) and international cuisine is presented.

    <p>  The hotel, having a three-star level, has a rating of 3.61 out of 5 possible.  72% of those who made the review report a good and average level of indicators in terms of service, accommodation and food. <strong></strong></p><p>  The rest left negative reviews about the hotel in the TOP Hotel system.  Mostly comments were made regarding the uniformity of food at breakfast, lack of entertainment, modest equipment of rooms.  This only speaks of the high expectations of tourists and their ignorance regarding the requirements for the level of service of a three-star hotel. </p><p>  Isinda Hotel 3 *, reviews of which more than sixty visitors left in the system, corresponds to the level of service of a three-star hotel. </p><h2>  Recommendations for choosing a three-star hotel for a vacation in Turkey </h2><p>  Appraising Isinda Hotel 3 * (Antalya) based <strong> </strong>  reviews of vacationers and the information provided in the public domain by the hotel itself, a number of conclusions can be made that will help the traveler make the right choice with a three-star hotel in Turkey: </p><ol><li>  If you want to improve the quality of rest, it is better to choose a 3 * hotel at a certain distance from the sea.  The farther from the coastline, the higher the quality of rooms and service. </li><li>  When choosing an option of the middle price segment, you should not count on a wide selection of entertainment in the hotel itself. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="isinda hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/678785.jpg" width="550"></div>  As a rule, these services are present in higher-level hotels and are included in the price of the tour. </li><li>  The concept of rest on an all-inclusive system should not be chosen in a three-star hotel.  As a rule, it does not differ in the quality and variety of dishes for this price segment.  It is more appropriate to limit breakfast. </li><li>  When choosing a 3 * level option with a desire to get good service, you should look for fresh hotels that have recently opened.  In this case, you can get excellent quality at the lowest price. </li></ol>
