    <p>  The holiday season begins here in mid-June, when the air temperature warms up to 25 degrees.  The best time to relax is July.  This month, the weather is hot here, and the sea warms up the most.  It is worth considering that the heat near the sea is easier to carry than in the city, because the coast is blown by light breezes.  It is worth visiting Golden Sands in early September, when most tourists left the resort.  Warm weather lasts until early October. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important hotel information </h2><p>  The tourist complex Luna 4 * (Golden Sands) was opened in 1997.

    <p>  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  the plumbing in the rooms needs to be repaired: taps flow, leaving behind a lot of water on the floor, the water in the wash basin does not leave well; </li><li>  old and heavily washed towels and bedding; </li><li>  in case of problems, the administrator can ignore the guests, boorish behavior of girls working at the reception; </li><li>  the pool is poorly cleaned and the water in it is very cold. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  After reading the description, we can say that the Luna 4 * hotel (Bulgaria, Golden Sands), the photo of which is presented above, is suitable for people with limited means.  If you are looking for cheap rooms with more or less quality service, you can undoubtedly arrange a ticket to this hotel.  It is also well suited for older people and couples.  But the youth here will be bored. </p>
