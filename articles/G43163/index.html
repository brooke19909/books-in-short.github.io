And often it is not possible to prove their case in a particular situation due to the banal lack of evidence.  It was to solve disputes on the road that DVRs were invented.  These devices are capable of fixing everything that is happening.  Such a video recording will become a weighty evidence in court. </p><p>  Modern DVRs are equipped with a bunch of additional options and can record high-quality videos.  One of the most interesting is the DVR Digma Freedrive 300. User reviews about it are mostly positive.  Therefore, you need to consider its technical characteristics and understand how good it is.  Or not good.  This is how it goes.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lightbearers.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma freedrive 300 reviews" class="if uuid-2985963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985963.jpg"></div><h2>  About Digma </h2><p>  This manufacturer entered the world market not so long ago.  The company is engaged in the production of various small goods from the category of electronics: flash drives, MP3 players, headphones and other devices necessary in our time.  Relatively recently, the company began to produce more serious electronics: tablets and DVRs.  The latter, by the way, are in fairly steady demand.  But on tablets, users respond negatively.  But the heroes of today's review are the DVRs.  They are distinguished by high quality performance and the presence of very advanced technical characteristics.  It is not clear how such a company managed to produce such a high-quality product.  However, we begin to review the Digma Freedrive 300. User reviews will be sorted a bit later.  In the meantime, consider the scope of delivery of the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr digma freedrive 300 black reviews" class="if uuid-2985970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985970.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  So, what will users offer along with this registrar?  Nothing interesting.  The product comes in a simple cardboard box made from recycled material.  In a prominent place - a colorful display of goods and the company logo.  Inside, the Digma Freedrive 300 car recorder itself (reviews of which we will discuss a bit later), user instructions in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian is also present) and a warranty card.  There is nothing else in the box.  A very modest set.  But what else could you count on?  The device is a budget.  Naturally, there will be no ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù in the delivery set.  It‚Äôs good that there is an adequate and detailed instruction in Russian.  It is written in a simple and understandable language.  No one will have problems in using the product.  With the delivery, everything is clear.  Now consider the appearance of the DVR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr digma freedrive 300 dvr reviews" class="if uuid-2985966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985966.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  This DVR looks interesting.  It resembles a mirrorless camera of miniature size.  On the front panel is a large lens, which is made of plastic.  The recorder case itself is quite thin.  The back panel is almost all occupied by a bright information screen.  There are some buttons for controlling the recorder.  They are made of plastic.  However, like the whole device.  At the same time, the build quality is at a rather high level.  Mounting the DVR allows the device to spin all 360 degrees.  This means that he can shoot and what is happening in the car.  A very useful option.  On the side there is a memory card slot and the necessary connectors for connecting the DVR to the network and computer.  This is what the device looks like.  His design is definitely not bad.  However, the time has come to consider other features of the Digma Freedrive 300. The reviews will be discussed in subsequent chapters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma freedrive 300 owner reviews" class="if uuid-2985967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985967.jpg"></div><h2>  Main technical characteristics of the device </h2><p>  So, what can this DVR please users with?  Firstly, he can shoot Full HD video at a speed of 30 frames per second.  If you reduce the resolution to HD, then the speed will increase to 60 frames per second, which is generally wonderful.  The device has a shock sensor, that is, the recorder can start recording immediately after the car was hit.  There is also an option to automatically start recording.  When connected to a computer, another function appears: the recorder can be used as a webcam.  Moreover, the sound and video when using such a camera will be simply excellent. </p><p>  All options of the DVR can be configured using a fairly logical menu.  In general, the recorder provides high quality video.  On it, you can easily make out the numbers of the front cars.  Thanks to the cool lens, the picture is high-quality even at night.  And this cannot but rejoice.  Now let's continue talking about the Digma Freedrive 300 dashcam. Owner reviews about the quality of the video are very interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technomode.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma freedrive 300 black reviews" class="if uuid-2985969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985969.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner reviews on video quality </h2><p>  Users who purchased this device leave comments about its operation.  You need to consider them in order to understand whether this device is so good.  It should be noted right away that the quality of the videos is mostly positive.  Almost all motorists notice that the video is clear, detailed.  And the resolution Full HD allows you to even consider pretty small details.  Those who used HD for recording claim that watching videos at 60 frames per second allows you to notice even more features.  In general, the video quality is excellent with the Digma Freedrive 300 dashcam. Reviews have confirmed this.  Now let's talk about additional device options.  What do users think about this? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.123.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma freedrive 300 dvr owner reviews" class="if uuid-2985971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985971.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner reviews on additional options </h2><p>  And now we will consider reviews about additional options of this DVR.  How do they work?  Should I use them at all?  I must say that the reviews of the owners in this case are ambiguous.  For example, users respond very unflattering about the G-sensor (shock sensor).  They write that you need to hit the DVR well in order for it to start recording.  And that is the perfect truth.  This sensor is really very tight.  What force should there be a blow to the car body?  Even the built-in sensor settings do not give the desired result. </p><p>  Also, users note that when connected to a computer, the registrar behaves inappropriately.  Communication is lost all the time.  So there can be no talk of any use as a webcam.  Even dropping records to a computer is already a problem.  Now about the night shooting mode.  Everything is in order here.  Car enthusiasts report that the video quality in low light is actually high.  This mode allows you to shoot at any time of the day, and all the details will be clearly distinguishable.  And now for the look and feel of the Digma Freedrive 300 Black.  User feedback on design and ergonomics is also crucial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technomode.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma freedrive 300 black reviews" class="if uuid-2985977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2985977.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner reviews on design and ergonomics </h2><p>  As for the appearance of the device, here, it seems, everyone is happy.  Motorists note that the strict and modern design of the device allows it to fit perfectly into any interior.  At the same time, the device looks quite modern.  One lens is worth it.  Many also liked the high-quality plastic case.  And the display is quite large for such a device.  As for ergonomics, there is also an enviable unity of opinion.  Almost all motorists claim that the suction cup mount is very convenient.  With it, you can securely mount the recorder on the windshield and rotate it in all directions.  That is, with the ergonomics of the gadget everything is in order.  But how reliable is the Digma Freedrive 300 dashcam (black)?  Reviews of its reliability, we will consider right now. </p><h2>  Owner reviews on device reliability </h2><p>  Among the owners of the device there are those who have been using it for more than a year.  It‚Äôs worth listening to their opinion about the reliability of the gadget.  However, we immediately note that there is no consensus.  Some motorists say that this DVR worked for them for a year without a hitch.  And nothing happened to him.  This can not but rejoice.  But there are about the same number of statements that the DVR worked for only a month, and then did not turn on again.  And in the branded service they said that it can not be repaired.  What is it like?  Apparently, the company has a lot of factory defects.  Those who still use the registrar probably got a model without marriage.  And motorists that announced a quick failure of the device, clearly ran into a marriage.  But even in this case, the manufacturer does not recognize the marriage and does not want to return the money.  It‚Äôs good that the DVR is not so expensive. </p><h2>  Owner reviews on the ratio of "price-quality" </h2><p>  What does the Digma Freedrive 300 (black) look like on this side?  Responses of owners in this regard are precisely ambiguous.  Some believe that its price corresponds to quality.  That is, all functions work fine, the registrar looks good and performs its task.  So, you can pay for it.  But there are those who think otherwise.  Many motorists agree that this rug, reminiscent of cheap "China", is a pity for the ruble.  They base their comments on the fact that the recorder has a very tight G-sensor and is not able to work normally with a computer.  But these are its main functions. </p><p>  Video quality is already a secondary factor.  If the registrar does not know how to start recording on time, then why is he needed?  And it‚Äôs hard to disagree with them.  But then again, the whole thing is factory marriage.  It's like a game of Russian roulette.  You never know from which party the gadget will get you.  If we exclude factory defects, the device turns out to be very worthy.  But it cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, the verdict will be appropriate. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So, the Digma Freedrive 300 video recorder, the reviews of which we reviewed a little higher, could turn out to be a very good device at a decent price.  Could.  If not for the terrifying sizes of factory marriage.  Every third device (according to users) has some kind of defect.  So a reasonable question arises.  Is it worth it to purchase such a product?  If you need cheaper, it‚Äôs worth it.  But you need to be prepared for various troubles.  But if you need a really high-quality and reliable video recorder, then it is better to overpay a little and choose something really worthy.  For this DVR will not work for a long time.  It is a fact.  Though unpleasant. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Above, we analyzed the budget car DVR Digma Freedrive 300. User reviews about the device are ambiguous.  However, we came to the conclusion that it is not worth buying a device.  There are problems with the G-sensor, inadequate work with the computer when connected and a huge amount of factory defects.  The latter fact is most frustrating.  After all, it can be seen that the manufacturer tried to create a high-quality and inexpensive device.  But, apparently, in the manufacturing process (or even design), something was not taken into account.  A producer should work on bugs.  Then, the considered DVR would become very popular among motorists.  The technical characteristics of the device are excellent.  You just need to refine something.  But for now, you should not buy a DVR (albeit a budget one).  But the second and third generation will need to first look.  But this will be a completely different story. </p>
