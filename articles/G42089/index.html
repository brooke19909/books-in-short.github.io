And to prevent this from happening, in the first place it is important to know the three most important things about the camera. </p><h2>  Verification Instructions </h2><p>  The buyer is sure, having come to the store that he will definitely buy new equipment, but it turns out that this is not always the case.  For example, a returned product under warranty can be returned to a service center and put up for sale again.  Of course, most often on the price tag this will be indicated.  But there are cases and worse, for example, if the goods during transportation get wet.  Yes, that happens. </p><p>  How to check the camera when buying?  As already noted above, you need to take only three steps, and the first thing to do is to find out if it is wet. </p><h2>  Water contact </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera in water" class="if uuid-3059570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059570.jpg"></div><p>  In order to determine if the camera was wet or not, it is first of all important to look at all its metal nodes.  First you need to inspect the hot shoe - this is the place where the flash is inserted. </p><p>  As a rule, when a photographer attaches light, small micro-scratches appear on the adapter.  Even if the runners of the hot shoe are painted, there will still be damage.  And if there is any rust on the metal, then you should refuse to buy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, there are much fewer complaints about the quality and appearance if the question is about buying a used camera.  In this case, everyone decides what to pay attention to.  Traces of use will be clearly visible even on a new, at least on a used device.  On store technology, micro-scratches are rarely seen.  When you purchase a new device, you should check other characteristics. </p><p>  It is necessary to unscrew the lens and inspect all the connections.  First of all, you should pay attention to whether there is any rust on the ring.  And also view all connections and contacts.  And if a small oxide is found on them, then it is worth giving up the purchase.  Contacts made of non-ferrous metals do not rust, but they tend to oxidize.  And if the device was in high humidity or it was bought somewhere during transportation, then a plaque appears in these places. </p><p>  The next step is to open the battery compartment and be sure to remove the battery.  Here you need to inspect the contacts that are inside.  If in other places it is possible to remove rust or oxide using special chemistry, then, as a rule, the battery compartment is not processed, since it is very difficult to do this.  Therefore, this particular place will demonstrate whether contact with water has occurred. </p><p>  You can also inspect the memory card slot.  There are also contacts and a lot of iron metal elements.  If there is no extraneous pollution, rust or oxide, then this point has been passed.  You can proceed to the next part of the answer to the question of how to check the camera when buying. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Was the equipment repaired </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.consumerpsyche.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="damaged camera" class="if uuid-3059568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059568.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, if the camera has some kind of factory defect and it was returned under warranty, then there is a chance that it was well repaired.  And it is quite possible that the equipment will continue to work perfectly.  But it should be borne in mind that if there was some small marriage, then after some time the situation may repeat itself.  For example, if a flash stops working after 3-4 shots and you have to carry it to the workshop, then in 80% this will happen with enviable constancy.  That is, if the assembly was of poor quality, the problem may pop up again or another, more global reason to carry the camera for repair will appear. </p><p>  How to understand if the camera was disassembled or not?  To begin with, it is worth inspecting all the bolts.  If there are any burrs or micro scratches on their caps, this means that the camera was opened with a screwdriver.  Even worse could be the situation when everything was being repaired by the artisanal method, that is, there will be obvious signs of interference on the screws. </p><p>  Most often, such a technique comes with a good discount, so everyone must decide for himself whether to take risks or not.  The second stage of how to check the camera when buying is passed, and you can go further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The number of frames that was shot </h2><p>  Most often, when checking in the store, mileage will be zero.  But if the camera was delivered under warranty or you used the previously used option for purchase, then you should not skip this step.  This will be the third stage of testing equipment. </p><p>  Before determining how many shutter releases the selected technique had, it is worth learning about some of the features.  The cheaper the camera, the lower the shutter warranty.  As a rule, unprofessional equipment may not even live up to this number of frames. </p><p>  And the more expensive, the better the camera will be and, accordingly, it will be able to make more frames.  Given the practice, we can say that the final numbers are multiplied by 2-3 times.  And sometimes the number of frames made is 10 times more than the warranty period.  For example, the Canon-600D is a semi-professional camera in which the manufacturer claims the ability to carry out 50 thousand frames.  However, reviews say that the shutter holds 500 thousand or more. </p><p>  If we talk about a more professional camera, then we can distinguish the Canon-6D.  For many, it also works for many years without replacing the shutter and passes, as they say, fire, water and copper pipes. </p><p>  Briefly summarizing the number of shutter releases, we can say this: </p><ul><li>  Canon 1000, 1100, 1200 or Nikon 3000, 5000 are those brands that are not considered semi-professional.  Accordingly, the shutter will work, most likely no more than what is written in the guarantee. </li><li>  But the smaller the number in Canon, that is, 600D, 550D, 6D, the more frames the camera takes before replacing the shutter. </li></ul><p>  To find out how many frames the camera took, you need to download a special program.  After that, the camera is connected using a USB cable to a laptop or computer.  The application immediately displays how many shutters were made using it. </p><p>  Of course, this step can be carried out only after the acquisition of equipment, but how to check the camera before buying?  If we are talking about used cameras, then you can ask to take a picture on this camera.  When the seller sends a photo, you need to upload it to a special program and see the number of operations. </p><p>  So that the seller does not deceive, you can ask to take a frame with the lid closed, with a shutter speed of 10 seconds, in order to look at the broken pixels, whether they are or not. </p><h2>  The choice of technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="various cameras" class="if uuid-3059564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059564.jpg"></div><p>  Above we talked about how to check the camera before buying.  But it is also important to know how to choose it and what parameters should be paid attention to. </p><p>  In the modern world, in the age of the Internet and the development of retail chains, buying a camera in principle is not a problem.  Since you can buy equipment in online stores and offline. </p><p>  Photographic equipment usually has a wider choice, so you can always find something suitable for all indicators.  But still, any technique needs to be checked.  If it is not possible to examine at least the basic parameters of the camera before purchasing, it is better to refuse such a lottery.  But still, it is very simple to check the camera when buying from hand, as in the store, of course, if the seller allows you to inspect the camera. </p><p>  In any supermarket there are consultants who can help with the choice.  In addition, the purchase in the store is better in that sellers always give a guarantee on their goods.  Of course, many buyers claim that employees are not always competent, and their goal is simply to sell more expensive, rather than demonstrate equipment.  But still, you can check the camera when buying in the store with or without the help of a consultant.  In any case, the employee can familiarize with the functional side of the technique and explain each value of the characteristic. </p><h2>  Store selection </h2><p>  Before talking about how to check a new camera when buying, it is worth choosing a suitable salon.  If the buyer wants to purchase used equipment, then it is better to look for it on sites such as Avito and Yula.  And when choosing a camera in the distribution network, you need to try to get into a specialized photo store.  The consultants of such an institution are savvy people, and will be able to answer all questions more or less tolerably, to tell something useful.  In network markets, employees usually read stickers on the product they are selling on the go. </p><h2>  How to check a mirrorless camera when buying </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check the camera when buying" class="if uuid-3059571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059571.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, there is practically no difference between the technology.  Both mirror options and ordinary soap dishes should first be checked for mechanical damage. </p><p>  To begin with, it is worth inspecting the packaging and the camera itself.  The body itself should not be worn or dusty, there should be no fingerprints on the lens.  And also it is worth checking the complete set of delivery, make sure that all wires and laces are present.  The instruction must be separately packed and not opened. </p><h2>  Tip </h2><p>  Among other things, you can see if the camera contains already taken pictures.  Of course, if there are photos from the trading floor, then there is nothing to worry about.  But there are cases that on the purchased cameras were whole photo sessions of unknown people. </p><h2>  Extra options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to look for when buying a camera" class="if uuid-3059565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059565.jpg"></div><p>  In order to check the new camera when buying as high quality as possible, you need to make a test shot in one of the automatic modes.  Having worked with the settings, you need to make sure that the autofocus is clearly and quickly aimed at the target.  After taking a few more photos with a flash, with a fully enlarged zoom, and so on, you need to view the captured frames for image defects. </p><p>  All parts of the camera must be clearly selected, without gaps.  And the lens is better to work silently, without unnecessary sounds. </p><p>  When filling out purchase documents, you must carefully read the warranty card.  And having learned about the conditions of return and repair, you must always carefully and carefully handle the purchase. </p><p>  If the buyer wants a deeper inspection of the camera, then you should seek help.  The camera is best tested by a photographer or a keen amateur.  Only a professional will be able to check the equipment on the spot for such things as running and front focus, as well as hot and broken pixels. </p><p>  When you purchase a second camera, there will no longer be a question how to check a digital camera when buying. </p><h2>  User's manual </h2><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clean lens" class="if uuid-3059566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059566.jpg"></div><p>  Certain skills and manipulations with the camera must be studied in advance, since a novice photographer cannot do without them. </p><p>  What to look for when buying a camera?  This question is quite common.  But it is worth remembering that all cameras undergo quality control at release.  The most important thing is not to overlook the obvious marriage that arose during transportation or storage in the distribution network.  For the owners of the camera, there are several more mandatory rules: </p><ol><li>  After the camera is purchased, it should be remembered that amateur cameras are afraid of water and sunlight. </li><li>  With careless handling, even the best equipment will not last long.  It is necessary to periodically take care of the camera, from time to time wiping the lenses with a special marker for optical elements and in no case handkerchiefs or clothes. </li><li>  Do not leave the equipment in the sun.  It is necessary to protect it from dust and moisture, do not change the lens during rain or in dusty places. </li><li>  <span>Clean the</span> camera <span>matrix</span> once a year.  We should not do this ourselves, since the equipment itself is very high-tech.  It is very important to understand what is coming and why.  It is best to take it to a service center for cleaning. </li></ol><p>  A well-groomed camera will repay any user with its reliable operation and high image quality. </p><h2>  Optional accessory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dtd-deals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag for the camera" class="if uuid-3059572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3059572.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the camera itself, you must purchase a bag or backpack for carrying.  Today in any store there is a choice of different types, sizes and colors.  It all depends on personal preferences and plans for further development. </p><p>  The requirements for a bag or backpack for carrying the camera look very simple - it's reliability and safety: </p><ul><li>  Carrying must be with thick walls and a solid bottom.  If a person uses an ordinary bag or backpack, the safety of an expensive camera will be a big question. </li><li>  The larger and heavier the camera itself, the more reliable the bag should be.  And the larger the carrying, the more accessories will fit into it. </li><li>  In any case, a bag or backpack should be comfortable.  Another excellent quality will be the speed and ease of folding in the equipment. </li><li>  At the same time, the bag itself should not cause discomfort.  The belt should be wide and comfortable, give the opportunity to change the length if necessary. </li></ul><p>  After a person begins to take pictures, he himself will understand what he still needs from the equipment. </p><h2>  Brand difference </h2><p>  You can often hear the question of how to check a Canon camera when buying.  In fact, there will be no trademark difference when acquiring equipment.  Of course, Canon and Nikon have a different lineup and excellent characteristics.  But if we talk directly about the acquisition itself, then the answer to the question of how to check the Nikon camera when buying will be exactly the same as for the purchase of goods from other companies. </p>
