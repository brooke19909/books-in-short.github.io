    <h2>  Church Regents </h2><p>  Managing the choir, conducting it and achieving the desired sound is not an easy task.  It is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the timbre of the voices of each of its participants, connecting in certain places the scores of those who are currently most appropriate.  Spiritual singing is very difficult in itself.  To create a prayer atmosphere in which each of the parishioners reaches for God with their soul is a real art that requires talent and inspiration.  The church regent sets himself the task of forming a choir in this way, selecting singers, teaching them the peculiarities of vocals, and achieving a coordinated performance of quite complex musical parts.  Previously, until the eighteenth century, <span>this post</span> was called differently - the ‚Äúinstaller‚Äù.  The Russian root of the term meant the installation or staging of the entire part of the priesthood performed outside the altar.  The choir regent is a specialty that has always been taught in special classes (St. Petersburg) and the Moscow Synodal School of Church Singing.  To enter these institutions, it requires extraordinary musical data, and Orthodox beliefs, and true faith, without which it will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why there is no regency in a democracy </h2><p>  You can manage not only the church choir, but also the state, in particular having a monarchical structure.  Under the republican system, presidential-parliamentary, or, conversely, parliamentary-presidential, all possible cases are taken into account by the constitution, that is, the main law.  In the event that the president is unable for some reason (for example, due to a serious illness or death) to perform his duties, there will always be a high-level official who will take responsibility for the fate of the country.  Example: After the murder of J. F. Kennedy, <span>Lyndon Johnson,</span> vice president, almost immediately took the oath of office and began acting as head of state. </p>

    <h2>  Regents under the monarchy </h2><p>  Another thing is if the power belongs to the monarchist dynasty according to the principle of divine origin (or any special relationship with the Almighty) of its representatives.  So, say, an autocrat (king, king, sheikh or sultan) died, and no elections are provided for by law, and the heir did not grow even years before the throne, <span>scepter and power.</span>  And in this case there is a way out.  The Regent of the Sultanate is the person who will rule (but not rule) in an exotic Asian or North African country until the rightful heir reaches the age of sixteen.  The same applies (and in some states such orders have been preserved to this day along with kings) and European monarchies.  But there have been cases in history when quite autocratic autocrats brought in regents to rule, for the good of the cause. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Supreme Regents </h2><p>  Widowed after the death of Peter the Great, Catherine the First was forced to take up state affairs.  She did not have enough experience, she did not know the Russian language at that time well enough.  But, being a clever woman, she realized that things would go well if she turned to some advisory body, with the help of which decisions could be made, balanced and wise, taking into account all aspects of the problems that arise.  One regent is good, but where is the guarantee that he will show due competence in all matters?  No, the body must be collective, consisting of those statesmen who have shown themselves well under the late sovereign.  Taking this son-in-law (supreme and secret) of her son-in-law, Karl Golshtinsky, the empress did not forget Apraksin, Golovkin, Osterman, Golitsyn, Tolstoy, and, of course, Menshikov.  These seven people gave Catherine, and later Anna Ioannovna, valuable advice until the need for them was exhausted, namely until 1830.  For all its usefulness, its members encroached on the main monarchist privilege - autocracy.  They dared to invite the empress to sign certain ‚Äúconditions‚Äù, according to which she became virtually powerless, for which they paid.  Everyone was exiled, and far away. </p><h2>  Russian Regency Institute and its traditions </h2><p>  There were other cases of regency in Russian history.  For example, in the years of childhood and early youth of Dmitry (later received the title of "Donskoy") the country was ruled by Alexy, Metropolitan.  Until Vasily Vasilievich grew up, his monastic <span>duties were performed by</span> his own mother - Sophia.  Ivan the Terrible also did not manage in childhood without a temporary substitute, also his parent.  He later created a regency council, headed by Boris Godunov.  They fought for this post, sometimes ruthlessly, showing cunning, because the regent is an actual ruler, and his position promises great opportunities to quench the passion of power-hungry and enrichment. </p>

    <h2>  Regents of all countries </h2><p>  In both Europe and Asia, the traditions of regency also have a long and dramatic history.  <span>Catherine and</span> Maria Medici at different times performed these difficult but sweet duties for them during the infancy of their sons, Charles IX and Louis XIII, respectively.  <span>Anna of Austria</span> also whiled away, regenting in anticipation of the maturity of Louis XIV.  There were other examples. </p><p>  In Europe of the XX century, the Hungarian regent scandalously distinguished himself.  It was Hitler's ally in World War II - Horthy, who took advantage of the absence of the king (he simply was not in the kingdom at all), and became a dictator of an extreme nationalist sense.  It lasted 24 years, until the arrival of Soviet troops in 1944. </p>

    <p>  But the citizens of Siam were lucky.  The illegitimate daughter of Rama IV, Salvabha, the mother of nine children, the first regent queen in the history of this country, did a lot for public education and for women (previously almost powerless).  She was a talented, wise and kind ruler. </p>
