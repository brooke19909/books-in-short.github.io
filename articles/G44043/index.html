  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Residential complex "Birch alleys" ("Botanical Garden"): description, infrastructure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main city of the state - the huge metropolis of Moscow - does not cease to please its residents and those who come for permanent residence with new residential complexes.  The vast territory allows them to be erected in areas convenient for transport accessibility and comfortable for living.  One of these complexes is ‚ÄúBirch Alleys‚Äù (‚ÄúBotanical Garden‚Äù). </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroiki-m.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Birch Alley&quot;" class="if uuid-2342838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2342838.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the North-Eastern district of the capital is located the street - Birch Alley.  Only about a kilometer separates it from the Botanichesky Sad metro station, and 3 kilometers from the Yaroslavl and Altufevskoe shosse.  This gives future residents of the complex the opportunity to walk to the metro station or in about 10 minutes to get to the Moscow Ring Road.  In addition, along the nearby streets, such as Agricultural, Olonetskaya, and along Serebryakova passage, a lot of public transport runs. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8496612" data-lng="37.61763559999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/8/7/1687.png"></div><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  The deadline for the delivery of the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Alleys‚Äù (‚ÄúBotanical Garden‚Äù) is the third quarter of 2019.  Fully built, it will consist of five buildings of 18-story residential buildings, united by a common courtyard.  The facades are ventilated, using modern technologies and from the corresponding materials.  The adjacent territory is implemented on the principle of ‚Äúa yard without cars‚Äù, which makes it possible to implement the project thanks to the construction of an underground parking for 960 cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure: external and internal </h2><p>  Birch Alleys (Botanical Garden) will have their own infrastructure.  In addition to the underground parking described above, it is assumed that the lower floors of the houses will be non-residential premises, and they will house social infrastructure facilities such as a medical center, beauty salon, shops, and a pharmacy.  All this will allow residents of the complex not to go beyond it in search of the necessary things and products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abydom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex project" class="if uuid-2342839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2342839.jpg"></div><p>  For the recreation of adults and for the leisure of children, the construction of a preschool institution, children's playgrounds and sports grounds was designed.  The courtyard will be landscaped.  There will be walking and bicycle paths, recreation areas. </p><p>  Since the quarter "Birch Alley" ("Botanical Garden") is located almost in the very center of the capital, the services of its residents are not only their own infrastructure, but also all the institutions of the district.  Five educational complexes are accessible, almost each of which is recognized as the best in the rating of schools in the capital.  A lot of shops, supermarkets, bank branches, educational institutions.  At a distance of about 200 meters, <span>the Yauza River</span> flows and the Sviblovskie Ponds are located, which are a wonderful place to relax. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroyki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House territory" class="if uuid-2342840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2342840.jpg"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The developer of ‚ÄúBirch Alleys‚Äù (‚ÄúBotanical Garden‚Äù) made sure that future residents of the complex felt safe when buying apartments.  The entire territory will be under round-the-clock surveillance.  The territory of the LCD is equipped with an electronic access system. </p><p>  All buildings of the complex will be equipped with modern engineering systems, the control of which is carried out by the dispatch service.  For residents will provide such benefits of civilization, such as connecting to the Internet, television and telephone. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBirch alleys‚Äù (Botanical Garden) offer apartments for any budget.  From small studios (32 square meters) to three-room apartments to 79 square meters.  The cost of one meter starts from 131 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Alleys‚Äù is a unique complex that, by its location, gives residents the opportunity to live in an urban environment, but in the most favorable ecological region, surrounded by parks and the Yauza river valley.  That is, here you can enjoy real country life. </p>
