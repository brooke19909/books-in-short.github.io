Description and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Are you going on vacation again?  Want to visit something new and different from popular tourist destinations?  Is this time a familiar culture?  Then it is best to opt for the city of Mozyr in Belarus, whose attractions are described in this article. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A couple of hours drive from Gomel on the green hills of the Pripyat River is the city of Mozyr, which can safely be called the oldest in Belarus.  The history of his formation goes back to the distant 1155.  Then these lands were the possessions of the Principality of Kiev, in the XIV century passed to the Principality of Lithuania.  In the XVII century, Mozyr survived a strong fire, which almost completely destroyed the city.  After this tragedy, military attacks fell on him, which did not allow to restore the infrastructure.  In 1793, Mozyr joined the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  mound of Glory </h2><p>  The celebration of the 23rd anniversary of the final liberation of the city from fascist aggression was timed to coincide with the grand opening of the Memorial complex.  The occupation of Mozyr lasted 875 days.  Only on January 14, 1944, the courageous Belarusian people managed to free the city.  This landmark of Mozyr, the photo of which can be found below, is a stele rushing into the sky at a height of 45 meters.  The howitzer of the war years, the mass grave and the eternal flame - all this combined the monument of history "Mound of Glory". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mazyr.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mound of Glory" class="if uuid-2559975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2559975.jpg"></div><p>  A mass grave was created here before the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution.  The remains of the soldiers were exhumed and solemnly reburied.  A mourning rally reaching for trucks with the dead gathered almost the entire city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2012 was marked for the ‚ÄúMound of Glory‚Äù with the installation of a memorial to the Afghan soldiers.  A capsule filled with Afghan soil was buried here, on which the blood of Soviet soldiers was spilled. </p><p>  Today, meetings are held here, parades of combatants, and honoring veterans. </p><h2>  Mozyr Castle </h2><p>  This landmark of Mozyr and Mozyr district was built in the 15th century on the site of an old wooden kid.  The fortresses of the structure survived more than one attack.  For many centuries, the palace, utility and residential buildings, a well and a temple have been sheltering behind walls and defense towers. </p><p>  In 1576, the expansion of the castle began due to a strong increase in population, it already housed 5 towers.  Residents of the city still continue to divide the castle into ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mozyr Castle" class="if uuid-2560004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2560004.jpg"></div><p>  Now this wonderful attraction of the city of Mozyr attracts a large number of young people at festivals of medieval and ethnic music, as well as during renovations.  Everyone can return to the past and feel like a real knight.  In addition to festivals, various art fairs are also held here - another opportunity to experience the whole atmosphere of the Middle Ages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  On June 18, 1948, a local history museum was opened in the city, originally called Polessky.  In 1977, the building of this landmark of Mozyr was demolished.  In the 80s, archaeological research of the city took place here.  Many unique items found in the above-described sights of Mozyr. </p><p>  The modern united museum of local lore has several branches.  Found in the historical exhibits found in the vicinity of ancient household items and more.  You can get acquainted with the national traditions of the city residents in the museum "Paleska Veda".  Clay sculpture masterpieces can be seen in the museum-workshop of N. N. Pushkar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="probelarus.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Local Lore" class="if uuid-2560037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2560037.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument to the victims of Chernobyl </h2><p>  Currently, over 2,000 people living in the Mozyr district participated in the aftermath of the terrible accident.  The republic does not forget about them, providing material support in the form of pensions and various benefits.  Four state programs have been established to help victims of Chernobyl.  On April 26, 2006, a monument to the victims of Chernobyl was unveiled in the city, which immediately became a landmark of the city.  Every year, various rallies gather at this place.  The monument is a construction in the form of a conventional white chapel, which symbolizes an invisible, barely perceptible danger.  Inside is a commemorative sign made of stone with the date of the accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mozyrisp.gov.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the victims of Chernobyl" class="if uuid-2559877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2559877.jpg"></div><h2>  Cistercian monastery </h2><p>  In 1647, thanks to the initiative of the Novogrudok chestnut Anton Askerki, a male Cistercian monastery was created.  The reigning monarchs of the Commonwealth later repeatedly donated funds for the development of this architectural landmark of Mozyr. </p><p>  This monastery, like all Cistercian ones, was quite strict and secluded.  There were no any elements of decor, utensils and decorations.  The Cistercians wore white robes with a black hood, scarlet, and woolen belt. </p><p>  In 1745, a convent and the Church of St. Michael were built here.  In 1864, the monastery was closed.  In 1893, the same fate befell the female.  The church was given to the Orthodox Church and reconstructed, removing all the Baroque decorations and completely destroying the wall murals.  At the end of the 19th century, a match factory was opened on the site of the monastery.  In 1990, the temple was transferred to the Catholics and is still operating today, and the locals call the beautiful valley near the monastery the Valley of Angels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.radzima.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cistercian monastery" class="if uuid-2559987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2559987.jpg"></div><h2>  Theatre of Drama </h2><p>  In the 90s, many theatrical traditions were criticized.  New trends were created, creative groups formed.  A group of young artists as an experiment formed the new theater "Verasen".  He grew and developed, in 1994 he was awarded the name of the writer <span>Ivan Melezh.</span>  The theater ceased to be experimental and became dramatic.  Charity performances in honor of the liquidators and victims of the Chernobyl accident are often given. </p>
