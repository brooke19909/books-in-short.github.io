    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The problem of breathing under water has been of interest to man for a long time.  The world-famous artist, anatomist, engineer, and simply a comprehensively developed person, Leonardo da Vinci, also sought to create a design that would allow you to be under water for a long time.  Da Vinci was born in 1452.  You can imagine what a long history of scuba gear.  After all, the diver‚Äôs pipe was invented by the great Renaissance artist. </p>

    <p>  When visiting da Vinci in Venice, the city senate asked him to come up with a device for attacking enemy ships from under water.  It is impossible to say exactly in which year scuba gear was invented, but it was then that the artist developed a special diving kit, which consisted of a mask, two reed tubes and a diving bell made of cork.  Air was supplied to the tubes through this bell, which floated on the surface of the water.  Leonardo da Vinci came up with the famous J-shaped tube.  Its length was 61 cm, it was necessary to swim close to the surface, but it did not make it possible to fully enjoy the <span>beauty of the underwater world</span> .  Da Vinci also came up with a bag filled with air.  He created the likeness of fins - only they were not intended for legs, but for hands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Charles Spaulding and Maurice Furnes </h2><p>  Another historical figure who has contributed to the improvement of scuba design is Charles Spaulding.  He was a pastry chef and lived in Edinburgh.  But he was also an amateur engineer: Spaulding made many useful changes to the bell of divers.  He died when diving in the Dublin Bay in 1783. </p><p>  Maurice Furnes is already a Frenchman who <span>invented respirators, gas masks</span> and improved the underwater breathing apparatus.  He equipped the helmets with a one-way valve, took part in the creation of autonomous equipment for diving under water. </p><p>  And yet, why is it universally believed that the inventor of scuba gear is Jacques-Yves Cousteau?  It is to him that divers are grateful for the scuba gear that is used today throughout the world. </p><h2>  Developments of Rukeroil and Deneyruz </h2><p>  Back in the mid-nineteenth century, Rukeroil and Deneiruz tried to create such an apparatus that would lower the pressure when immersed to a depth.  They acted independently and were not familiar.  The created membrane made it possible to inhale air from the tank and exhale it into water.  The device turned out to be decent, but still had many drawbacks: it did not become autonomous and depended on hoses for supplying air for a longer stay under water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Many inventors worked on equipment for scuba divers.  After all, the whole suit has undergone changes, in which the diver is immersed, and a mask, and a spacesuit, and even flippers.  Everyone contributed to the improvement of scuba gear.  But the main thing is the moment associated with the respiratory system, which provides air to the diver.  A famous French oceanologist made his contribution - he invented scuba gear, which is still used today. </p><h2>  Yves Cousteau and Ganyang </h2><p>  The young officer Cousteau married the daughter of the owner of Air Liquid Corporation.  His wife's father provided financial assistance to Cousteau for research and introduced him to the company's full-time engineer.  Together with Emil Ganyang, an engineer at the corporation, he worked on the creation of a scuba gear in which the breathing system automatically supplied air of the required pressure.  Air supply occurred at any depth.  It was this development that gave the diver comfort and the possibility of long swimming. </p>

    <p>  In 1943, equipment was tested on the Marna River.  In the summer, Jacques-Yves Cousteau continued to test it already in sea water.  After several more modifications, Cousteau brought to the condition the apparatus, which today is called scuba gear.  And the name was patented - Aqua Lung.  In many countries, such equipment is referred to as "scuba" - Scuba. </p><p>  Now there is no doubt who <span>invented modern</span> scuba gear.  After the release of Cousteau‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe World of Silence‚Äù, in 1953, the device was given the name Aqua Lung.  Now Air Liquid Corporation owned the rights to manufacture all types of equipment for immersion in water. </p>

    <h2>  Diving Saucer </h2><p>  It became clear about the year in which scuba gear was invented, which is used by modern <span>divers and divers.</span>  It was in 1943, and it was Yves Cousteau who improved it to its current state.  But this is not the only contribution of the French oceanologist to the creation of diving apparatus.  In addition, he owns the invention of the underwater house, the ‚Äúdiving saucer‚Äù, he shot an interesting series about the underwater world. </p><p>  Many were interested in who invented the scuba diving "diving saucer"?  And some still do not know that this is a very small submarine, which they nicknamed the saucer.  Cousteau is a keen nature: he loved the sea very much, built dwellings under water, studied the language of fish.  He graduated from the Naval Academy and was to build an officer career.  But he had another passion - sports cars.  Passion for them became fatal for him - he had an accident on one of them, and he had to heal for a long time and restore his health.  Spending a lot of time near the sea, swimming and diving to improve the body, Cousteau no longer imagined himself outside this abyss. </p>

    <h2>  Palm </h2><p>  Despite the fact that for several hundred years, humanity has been working on improving the apparatus for immersion in water, it is worth noting that the key inventions belong to Leonardo da Vinci and Jacques-Yves Cousteau.  Without <span>breathing tubes,</span> da Vinci would not have continued the further development of scuba gear.  And without the system developed by Cousteau, it would be impossible to dive offline and be under water for such a long time. </p>

    <p>  In what year did scuba invented?  There is no single answer to this question.  In its improvement over the centuries and years, a lot of inventors and engineers took part.  I don‚Äôt want to give someone one palm: the main thing is that now there is such a technique that allows you to study the underwater world.  And this will help scientists, archaeologists to learn the secrets hidden from man at the depths of the seas and oceans. </p>
