An analog signal, of course, extends over large distances compared to a digital signal, but the image and sound quality deteriorate with increasing distance to the broadcast antenna.  There was only one way out of the situation - to encrypt the signal so that it could be received and processed tens of kilometers from the translator without loss of quality.  So the choice settled on a digital method of transmitting information. </p><h2>  The history of digital television </h2><p>  For more than 60 years, analogue television has been the only means of delivering news, films, and entertainment to the homes of millions of viewers around the world.  If the receiver, that is, the TV, is located near the repeater, then the signal and sound have acceptable quality.  When removed, it becomes necessary to amplify the signal with various antennas.  The farther the repeater, the larger the antenna should be.  At a distance of 50 kilometers, these receiving antennas are huge, like a multi-story building.  All for the sake of several channels in mediocre quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 digital tv antenna" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58628/1935927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Finally, in 2009, after many experiments with various formats, the modern digital DVB-T2 digital television was launched.  A number of questions arose immediately.  For cable and satellite TV users, nothing has changed, but the recipients of the analog signal have a new problem.  To decrypt a digital signal, you need a TV with a built-in digital signal reception module or set-top box.  The cost of the latter reaches $ 50, which not everyone can afford. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The issue is partially addressed through government subsidies, and perhaps in the next few years, digital television will completely replace analogue television. </p><h2>  What you need for high-quality digital television reception </h2><p>  The quality of a digital television signal, like analog, depends on the distance to the repeater.  The difference is that the analog picture will blur when the signal is poor, and the sound will hiss.  In digital television, the image will either completely disappear or will be displayed on the screen in rectangular blocks.  That is, for high-quality reception of a digital television signal, an antenna is also needed, but not as cumbersome as in the case of an analog signal. </p><p>  The television signal is distributed in two ranges - meter (English designation VHF) and decimeter (UHF).  The first does not allow the signal to spread over long distances, its waves do not cope well with obstacles in the form of buildings, walls inside the apartment.  Therefore, most channels broadcast in the decimeter range.  Accordingly, for high-quality reception, you need a <span>decimeter antenna</span> for digital television DVB-T2. </p><h2>  Types of decimeter antennas </h2><p>  All antennas for receiving digital television are antennas of decimeter range, as well as meter.  Thus, they can be divided into enlarged groups - indoor and outdoor. </p>

    <p>  Both types of antennas can be both passive and active.  The latter has a built-in amplifier, which allows you to pick up a weak signal.  But it is more narrowly focused, it needs to be directed towards the signal source.  The passive amplifier does not possess, but receives a signal from all directions for its subsequent supply to the signal amplifier in the TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up the antenna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58628/1934211.jpg" width="500"></div>

A professional approach to installation involves measuring the signal level using a portable sensor.  It will be very useful in areas with dense buildings, where the signal comes not only directly from the repeater, but also reflects from the terrain or comes from several repeaters at once.  After obtaining the characteristics of the signal, it is necessary to study the instructions for the antenna so that the reception quality is guaranteed. </p><p>  If it is not possible to use a portable sensor, then you can, using general recommendations, select the antenna using the sample method.  The recommendations are simple.  For an apartment in an area with loose construction, a usual, but high-quality indoor antenna for DVB-T2 is suitable.  In an area with dense buildings, it is necessary to use an <span>indoor antenna with a</span> signal <span>amplifier</span> .  In an open area, that is, in cottage villages, in cottages, the use of an outdoor antenna is already necessary.  Using the opportunity of free replacement of goods in the store, you can independently configure several models of antennas until a suitable one is found. </p><h2>  UHF antenna tuning </h2><p>  Before installing a decimeter antenna for digital television DVB-T2, you must configure it to receive a signal.  By connecting the antenna output to the TV or set-top box to decrypt the signal, you need to direct the antenna in the direction where the repeater is located.  Then you need to perform automatic channel tuning from the device menu.  The entire frequency range will be checked. </p><p>  By turning on any channel, if its quality is insufficient, you can, slowly rotating the antenna, find the ideal position in which the signal will be the best.  Typically, receiving devices show the signal level for each specific DVB-T2 channel.  Do not think that in the ideal position for receiving one channel, all the others will be in sufficient quality.  Having configured the reception of one channel, you need to go to the next and so on until all the channels are broadcast. </p><p>  If the receiver during automatic tuning did not find any channels or found less than half, in this case how to configure the antenna?  It should be rotated 180 degrees to receive the reflected signal.  This is often found in sleeping areas, where a large number of houses interfere with the signal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decimeter range antennas" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58628/1934235.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In an open area, the antenna should simply be directed towards the repeater and automatically configure the DVB-T2 channels on the signal receiver. </p><h2>  UHF antenna installation </h2><p>  After successfully tuning the channels, the result must be fixed, that is, fix the antenna in the position in which the signal reception turned out to be the best.  Indoor antennas are usually installed on cabinets, cabinets, but this is not aesthetically pleasing.  The stands of modern antennas provide places for fastening with screws and screws, which can be installed directly on the wall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor antenna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58628/1934247.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  External decibel antennas for digital television DVB-T2 are mounted on brackets or poles.  The scope of delivery of the outdoor antenna usually comes with fasteners that will allow you to securely mount the outdoor antenna on a support.  When outdoor antennas are used in apartments, usually mounting is done outside the home: on balconies or exterior walls.  Then, as in the case of a room antenna, you will need to drill several holes in the wall for reliable mounting. </p><h2>  Decimeter antenna operation process </h2><p>  A few more comments regarding the operation of decimeter antennas for digital television DVB-T2.  Depending on weather conditions (even the time of day), the signal reception quality may vary.  Therefore, the mounting of the antenna should provide for the possibility of its rotation to configure better signal reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indoor antenna for dvb t2" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58628/1934194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Correct selection of the antenna will allow you to enjoy the digital quality of the television signal.  The DVB-T2 network is constantly evolving, new channels appear.  This is a great alternative to cable and satellite television, as it does not require a monthly fee. </p>
