  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Full-frame "Nikon": list, model range, technical characteristics of operation features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In today's world, cameras are gaining more and more popularity.  Photography is a new art that everyone can do.  With the help of pictures we convey emotions, feelings, fix the history of our life, as well as the world around us.  Most people take pictures for themselves, just capturing something important.  But there are real professionals in creating pictures, they live their photos, and in order to convey the mood as much as possible, they wait for hours for the right moment, go on special trips, chasing sensual and emotional photos.  Millions of sites are being created with photos as their main theme.  People convey their experiences in this way. </p><p>  Due to its simplicity, this type of art is deeply embedded in the hearts of many.  And progress does not stand still, and people come up with a new one, improve cameras, making the picture better, more natural.  Full-frame cameras are now gaining popularity, which provide good detail, show excellent quality and a gamut of colors. </p><h2>  Briefly about devices </h2><p>  The name of the cameras comes from the phrase ‚Äúfull frame‚Äù.  The full frame is the size of the photosensitive matrix, which is responsible for the quality of the image.  The larger the matrix, the better the picture quality will be, the less noise will be with a lack of light.  In cameras, the half-format size, that is, the APS-C matrix 23x15 mm, is most often used.  APS-C is the generally accepted designation of matrices with crop factor (truncated size).  In full-frame <span>cameras, the dimensions of the matrix</span> coincide with the dimensions of a 35 mm film camera (35x24 mm).  Pictures taken with a full-frame camera are 1.5 times larger than with a half-format camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the popularity? </h2><p>  Film cameras appeared in the 19th century, but why are full-frame devices gaining popularity just now?  The fact is that when the active production of digital cameras began, they most often used smaller matrices due to the too high cost of full-frame sensors.  Now such matrices have become more affordable, so the demand for them is growing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.43rumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Matrix dimensions" class="if uuid-2659692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659692.jpg"></div><h2>  Do you really need such cameras? </h2><p>  Although full-frame photographic equipment has become quite affordable and cheap compared to previous decades, many large companies still prefer cameras with a reduced matrix, simply improving and improving them.  The question begs: "Since <span>half-format cameras</span> are more popular <span>,</span> does it make sense to buy full-frame equipment?" </p><p>  First you need to figure out why you need a camera at all.  Most often, people buy cameras in order to leave a memory of some significant event in their life, for example, about any holiday or a pleasant trip.  It is clear that in the family archive or social networks no one will look at the size of the matrix of the camera on which the photo was taken.  If you use the camera only for yourself, then you should not spend money, the main thing to remember is that not only quality is appreciated in photography, but also composition and the meaning in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to be the one who earns a living by photography?  This is the same profession where you need to improve your skills and improve, work on the quality of work, color depth.  In fact, many manufacturers managed to create full-frame models with a resolution of more than 16 megapixels, while the quality remains at its best even with an ISO sensitivity of 1600. </p><p>  Indicators of narrow depth of field (depth of field) is always a hallmark of full-frame technology, with which you can create a bokeh effect, but now, using lenses with ultra-fast aperture 1.2, you can achieve the same picture. </p><p>  At the same time, full-frame cameras are much more expensive than full-frame cameras, as well as they are heavier and take up more space. </p><p>  The difference between cameras with a crop factor and full-frame people who are not professionally involved will not notice, therefore, whether to buy full-frame cameras is up to you, weighing the pros and cons.  Retro lovers appreciated this undertaking, as the film technique laid the foundation for many. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of full-frame cameras </h2><p>  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, modern half-format cameras can well compete with full-frame in picture quality, size and price.  What are the benefits of full-frame photography? </p><ul><li>  The size and photosensitivity of the matrix help to create very high quality images with good detail. </li><li>  Work with low noise, which is good for photographers who, for example, conduct photo hunting on rare animals. </li><li>  The presence of serial shooting, this allows you to catch the natural movement. </li><li>  With the help of fast autofocus, a sharp switch from an object to an object is possible, which will prevent the photo from getting blurry. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the disadvantages of full-frame cameras are also available: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Dimensions of cameras.  Weight and size do not always allow you to easily transfer equipment, and without a tripod, your hands get tired quickly enough. </li><li>  Slow shooting speed.  Despite the fast autofocus and continuous shooting, instantly capture the moment still will not succeed. </li><li>  The cost of cameras and additional equipment. </li><li>  A careful approach to the technique and selection of optics.  Many full-frame cameras do not accept lenses of a different brand. </li></ul><p>  As we can see, the number of pros and cons of full-frame technology is the same.  So, everyone is free to choose, based on their tastes and preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photographylife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon cameras" class="if uuid-2659689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659689.jpg"></div><h2>  Company "Nikon" </h2><p>  The history of the company began in 1917 in the Japanese city of Tokyo.  Since then, Nikon has been one of the leading manufacturers of optics and various photographic equipment. </p><p>  This manufacturer makes cameras for different tastes: there are budget, amateur and professional cameras.  Since Nikon is responsible for the quality of its products, even the cheapest cameras up to two thousand rubles have good filling for their money.  As for very expensive equipment, the price of professional cameras, for example, varies from 200 to 400 thousand rubles.  Interestingly, Nikon produces not only equipment for photo and video shooting, but also microscopes and other devices necessary in medicine. </p><p>  The main competitor of Nikon has always been and will be Canon, they often share the first place in the ratings of the best cameras.  Both firms are located in Japan, have a similar appearance and assembly. </p><p>  What are the features of Nikon?  This manufacturer pays great attention to the quality of shooting in low light.  Another advantage is the large size of the sensor, making high-quality photos with a small number of pixels.  The company also adds small details that greatly facilitate the work.  Nikon, even in the most basic and cheapest models, has good autofocus, many modes, and an HDR effect (which is not found on all cameras, not even Canon). </p><p>  Everyone chooses a camera to their liking, and Nikon is one of those companies with millions of fans around the world.  Among its products, you can choose a good camera that will be convenient and easy to use. </p><h2>  Features of Nikon full-frame cameras </h2><p>  The Nikon company was one of the first to launch full-frame cameras.  And many users of photographic equipment prefer this particular manufacturer.  What is the difference between the full-frame Nikon and its other brands?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  Firstly, since the company already has experience in creating such equipment, the quality of the Nikon full-frame camera is very much appreciated on the market.  Such a device will appreciate the long work.  Not many manufacturers can compete in performance with Nikon.  The full-frame cameras of their production are distinguished by high resolution of more than 35 megapixels, striking with their detail.  And this is very important for amateur photographers. </p><p>  Secondly, the full-frame Nikon has a lower price compared to Sony and Canon, which cost at least 150 thousand rubles.  As for Nikon cameras, up to 90 thousand professional devices can be found. </p><p>  In the end, the cameras of this company are very affordable.  Full-frame Nikon can be found in so many popular stores, you don‚Äôt have to constantly look for cameras on various sites, re-buying already used goods. </p><h2>  List </h2><p>  When choosing a Nikon camera, remember that this company has its own designations.  How to determine which "Nikon" is full-frame?  We illustrate with an example.  FX is a full-frame Nikon, and the DX has a matrix size of 23.6x15.7 mm. </p><p>  So, below is a list of Nikon full-frame cameras in terms of price and quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D610" class="if uuid-2659691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659691.jpg"></div><p>  <em><span>Nikon D610.</span></em>  <em>One</em> of the most affordable models: </p><ul><li>  The screen resolution for this model is 24.3MP. </li><li>  The screen of the device is 2 inches, it is fixed, it has 921,000 points. </li><li>  The viewfinder is present, optical. </li><li>  Maximum with burst shooting: 6 fps. </li><li>  Video Resolution: 1080p. </li><li>  The camera is one of the cheapest on the market - 80 thousand rubles </li></ul><p>  Additional advantages are the presence of an SD card slot, as well as water protection.  But of the minuses it is worth highlighting too close to the center of the autofocus points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amateurphotographer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D750" class="if uuid-2659693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659693.jpg"></div><p>  <em>Nikon D750</em>  <em>This</em> model is far from new, but is still in great demand: </p><ul><li>  Resolution is 24.3MP. </li><li>  The screen is also two-inch, but already inclined, has 1,228,000 pixels. </li><li>  The viewfinder is also optical, like the previous model. </li><li>  Burst Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãCamera: 5 fps. </li><li>  Maximum available video resolution: 1080p. </li><li>  Cost - 120 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  It is also possible to tilt the touch screen.  A clear minus is not such a high-quality video. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intpicture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon DF" class="if uuid-2659695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659695.jpg"></div><p>  <em>Nikon Df.</em>  <em>This</em> model has: </p><ul><li>  Retro design. </li><li>  The resolution is less - 16.2MP. </li><li>  The number of inches is 3.2, the screen is fixed, 921,000 pixels. </li><li>  The viewfinder is optical. </li><li>  The maximum speed of this model in serial shooting is also 5 fps. </li><li>  The camcorder does not shoot. </li><li>  The cost of the model is 160 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  Inexpensive and beautiful camera, but the lack of video upsets. </p><p>  <em><span>Nikon D810</span> is the best</em> full-frame Nikon.  Why? </p><p>  Among the full-frame Nikon models, the D810 leads with the highest resolution.  This camera was released in 2014.  Despite this, she still remains the best Nikon model in the list of full-frame models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D810" class="if uuid-2659694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659694.jpg"></div><p>  And that's why: </p><ul><li>  The resolution is one of the largest on the market - 36.3MP. </li><li>  The screen is large - 3.2 inches, fixed, 1,228,800 pixels. </li><li>  The viewfinder, like previous models, is optical. </li><li>  Burst speed is 5 fps. </li><li>  Available video resolution - 1080p. </li><li>  The cost is relatively small - 120 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  This camera is not very cheap, but its characteristics are fully true, as well as an additional plus is the AA filter.  If you are not afraid of the lack of Wi-Fi, then this camera is for you. </p><h2>  The differences between mirror and mirrorless </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worthwhile to understand the difference between SLR and mirrorless cameras.  The main difference lies in the fact that the former have a mirror, while the latter do not, therefore, the mechanism of operation for such models will be different.  Mirrorless cameras are a more budgetary and convenient option, respectively, the quality is a little worse, but good mirrorless ones can compete in quality with SLR cameras. </p><p>  Now let's move on to full-frame cameras.  Is there a difference between them in mirror and mirrorless models? </p><p>  Since full-frame technology requires an additional purchase of optics, in the case of mirror models it will be possible to save.  Here the rule works: buy one large body and many small lenses or one small camera and a considerable number of large lenses.  This also applies to weight.  For mirrorless cameras, you will also need to carry extra batteries with you. </p><p>  As for built-in optics, mirrorless cameras also lose here, since not all lenses have, for example, IBIS, so it will be easier to find Nikon lenses for full-frame DSLRs, but you need to know that a non-native lens may not work. </p><p>  If small-scale cameras do not have special differences in SLRs and mirrorless cameras, then in the case of full-frame cameras, it is better to give preference to mirror models, so as not to suffer with a lot of lenses and batteries. </p><h2>  Lenses for full-frame Nikonov </h2><p>  It is worth starting with the fact that all full-frame photographic equipment requires the purchase of additional optics.  Care must be taken in acquiring a lens because lenses play an important role.  Sometimes they are even more important than the camera itself.  You can‚Äôt save on optics, because a non-native lens may simply not be suitable, especially if you purchase a full-frame camera.  Nikon has a very large optics list, so choosing is easy.  It is worth remembering that on lenses specifically for full-frame technology there is an FX marking.  There are more than 70 such lens models on the market for different tastes and colors, all of them are marked with special markings with company abbreviations, for example: </p><ul><li>  There are type G and type D lenses.  On type D lenses, aperture can be adjusted.  Type G lenses have a focus motor. </li><li>  VR - stands for optical image stabilization.  There is a version of VR II, working on new models. </li><li>  AF-labeled lenses use a focusing motor, which makes focus faster. </li><li>  The inscription AF-S means that the lens also has a focusing motor. </li><li>  SWM stands for Silent Wave Motor, which means an ultrasonic motor. </li><li>  N - Nikon proprietary nanocrystalline coating.  Such a coating is necessary to get rid of glare and glare. </li><li>  If there is an ED marking, then ultrafine lenses are inserted into the lens, which reduce the number of chromatic aberrations in the photo. </li><li>  FL stands for fluorite glass lenses that reduce chromatic aberration and weigh less. </li><li>  Micro at Nikon stands for macro lenses. </li></ul><p>  So, we decided on the full-frame "Nikon".  Which 2.8 lens is the most advanced and inexpensive?  2.8G Nikon (24-70mm f / 2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor).  As the reviews show, it is the most complete and versatile, its price starts from 90 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Although Nikon offers a large selection of full-frame lens cameras, there are still several manufacturers whose optics are also quite suitable, and such companies include Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Samyang. </p><p>  On average, the price of lenses fluctuates around 40 - 120 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nikonrumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Lenses" class="if uuid-2659711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99207/2659711.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, combining all of the above, we can say that full-frame cameras are an indispensable thing for professional photographers.  Such cameras significantly increase the quality of shooting, making the picture clear, rich and natural.  Of course, full-frame photographic equipment has a number of minuses, the main of which are price and interchangeability, since modern SLR cameras can compete with full-frame ones, not inferior in quality, color or even winning in price. </p><p>  Should I buy full-frame cameras?  Most users still tend to answer ‚Äúno,‚Äù since there is no point in overpaying for the same functions.  However, the number of fans of full-frame cameras is increasing.  As already mentioned, this is a matter of taste. </p><p>  As for Nikon, it is one of the few that has succeeded most in creating full-frame cameras.  The equipment of this company is of high quality and relatively low price.  Another plus is the variety of choices for both the cameras themselves and the optics.  Therefore, Nikon is the undisputed leader in the world of modern cameras, therefore, it is worth giving preference to this particular company, which already has millions of fans, since the company is very responsible in creating even simple <span>cameras for beginners.</span> </p>
