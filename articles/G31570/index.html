    <p>  A smartphone is sold in two colors: gray and gold.  The gadget is coated with an oleophobic substance, but it is ineffective.  The prints are too noticeable, the finger glides over the panels very easily. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the back there is a bezel made of plastic.  It is a shock absorber, which plays a role when the device falls on the side face.  The border is polished, the surface itself is matte. </p><p>  On the front side there is a flash for the camera, which allows you to take a selfie.  You can immediately notice several sensors, a battery indicator and notifications.  The speaker received a good volume, intelligibility at an average level.  You can verify this when reading reviews on the ZTE Blade V7 Lite smartphone.  On the same front side there are return keys to the previous menu, to the desktop and application calls.  All of them received a highlight, for which users thank the manufacturer separately. </p><p>  The bottom panel has a charger input and a microphone.  At the top there is a headset jack, and on the left is a swing to change the volume level.  The latter is made of metal.  On the right side are the keys to turn on the phone and slots for SIM cards. </p><p>  On the back there is a flash and a camera lens.  The latter protrudes slightly from the body.  The fingerprint sensor is round.  It works slowly but clearly.  The bottom panel has two special holes.  They are covered with a net.  On the left is the speaker, on the right is a dummy for symmetry. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  This device works with a screen whose size is 5 inches.  Users claim that it is covered with anti-reflective material.  The resolution of the HD quality device is 720 √ó 1280.  For such a diagonal, this indicator is considered normal by buyers, judging by the reviews on the ZTE Blade V7 Lite phone.

    <p>  The brightness of light shades reaches a maximum parameter of 250 cd / m <sup>2</sup> , which is due to dark, then - 0.30 cd / m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  The viewing angles of this smartphone are good.  Have a clean picture.  Color reproduction at the best level, there is no distortion.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãhigh-quality.  The owners note that the contrast is good, but the brightness is not enough. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the display is small and the side faces <span>are thin,</span> it is convenient to use the <span>phone</span> .  Buyers in reviews of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite 16 GB note that you can reach the opposite corner with one hand.  It lies perfectly in the palm of your hand.  The back panel does not slide much, and there are simply no sharp corners.  When compared with other phones that have all the buttons on one side only, here the unlock key and volume rocker are on different surfaces.  Owners like this approach: it is difficult to make a mistake with the level of the button‚Äôs location, and you can even change the sound without removing the phone from your pocket.  The main thing is to remember which key is on which side. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  This model works with a non-removable lithium-ion battery.  The battery received a capacity of 2500 mAh.  The manufacturer did not provide any official data on the life of the batteries without recharging, so we will draw conclusions based on comments. </p>

    <p>  Buyers in reviews of ZTE Blade V7 Lite Gold / Gray notice that the device does not stand out among competitors in its ‚Äúsurvivability‚Äù.  In active mode with the 3 / 4G network turned on, the smartphone will last 7 hours.  During this time, the owner will have time to talk for half an hour, 60 minutes.  use the camera, watch the same period of time and spend several hours on social networks, mail.  If you want to play the game at maximum brightness and high volume, you need to expect that the phone will be discharged in an hour.  In video viewing mode, it will last up to 6 hours. </p><p>  About 3 hours from the charger, 6 hours from the computer. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Unfortunately, with regard to communication issues, there is nothing interesting here.  Users of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite reviews notice that GPS works well, but its sensitivity is still not perfect.  The only thing that pleases the owners is the support of the 4G network at different frequencies. </p><h2>  Memory and memory card </h2><p>  The device works with 2 GB of RAM.  For a device of this type, this indicator is considered good.  But many users of ZTE Blade V7 Lite in the reviews notice that for 14 thousand you can find an option and better. </p><p>  What about the built-in storage, then its maximum figure is 16 GB.  Only 10 GB is available to the user.  The shell and system applications occupied as much as 6 GB, which many owners did not noticeably like.  You can use a memory card with a maximum capacity of 32 GB.  But, again, for such a cost, there are many better options. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device has two modules, like any of its rivals.  The main one works with a resolution of 13 megapixels (received autofocus), the front - 8 megapixels.  The latter has a wide angle function. </p>

    <p>  In the daytime, in good weather, the rear camera will show itself perfectly.  This was reported by customers in reviews of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite.  The detail is beautiful, the colors are transmitted as naturally as possible, the dynamics of the photos is preserved, you can blur the background.  Focus is fast and clear.  Of the minuses, buyers highlight that there is noticeable blurring in the corners.  Owners also do not like that in poor lighting artifacts and various noise distortions can appear. </p><p>  There is a flash for both the rear camera and the front camera.  The first reaches a distance of up to 1.7 meters, the second does not exceed 50 cm. </p><p>  The front matrix has a wide-angle lens.  However, buyers notice that when opening on the computer, the face is too blurry, there is no sharpness.  Everything else works fine. </p><p>  As for the video, its resolution is HD.  Per second, 30 frames in daylight, in the night - the rate drops to 16 fps.  All owners declare that the quality of the videos is terrible.  You can focus the picture, the speed of the sensor is slow, but the accuracy is perfect.  The sound in the video is clear, but there can be certain problems with the volume.  The front camera clip is also made in HD quality. </p><h2>  Performance and hardware platform </h2><p>  The phone runs on the Taiwanese MediaTek platform.  The chipset is 64-bit, operates on 4 cores.  The clock frequency does not exceed 1 GHz.  All owners note that even when using resource-intensive processes, the case does not heat up.  You can learn about this from customers in reviews of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite. </p><p>  The interface has a good level of performance, and lags and brakes are not noticed.  Users are advised to immediately set the minimum graphics settings when opening heavy games.  Lighter utilities work great. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The phone runs on the sixth version of Google Android.  On top of it is a shell called Mifavor.  It is developed by ZTE. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone is equipped with several desktops.  Reading reviews of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite phone, we can say that not everyone liked this idea.  On tables it is allowed to install icons of various applications.  To open the settings, swipe from the bottom to the top.  There you can choose a picture for the home screen, types of icons, effects for scrolling tables, as well as background shades.  If you make a long tap, the widget menu opens. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  A player is installed, which is standard for Google.  In the headphones, the volume is great.  In reviews of the smartphone ZTE Blade V7 Lite Gold they write that the sound is average.  Buyers note that low frequencies are not enough.  The speaker received a good volume.  At the same time, some tracks on high ranges noticeably wheeze.  This model is equipped with a radio.  More details below. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The model sounds uninteresting.  This is confirmed by the specifications and reviews of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite.  Both in the headphones and through the main speaker, the playback is faded and without any colors.  Distortion and noise effects are too audible.  Only high frequencies are pulled to a good level.  The higher the volume, the worse the track will sound.  Because of this, it is difficult to make out which instrument is being played.  However, users also find advantages: the volume margin is large, and the external speaker has loudness. </p><p>  To play a melody, you need to go into the player.  It is a standard utility from the Google Play service.  If you need to improve the sound of the track, you can use the special system from Arkamys.  Previously, it was installed in smartphones ZTE Blade.  There are no additional options or functions.  It can only be activated.  Settings do not change.  The system player has a regular equalizer, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof which are already predefined.  The speaker used for conversations has a muffled sound, but the timbre and interlocutor's speech are understandable. </p><p>  Built-in radio.  You can record programs from the air.  This menu works only with headphones that act as antennas.  The recorder is not sensitive, it does not suppress noise.  The auxiliary microphone is not integrated. </p>

    <h2>  Compare ZTE Blade V7 and Lite </h2><p>  Both phones are powered by MediaTek.  However, the models are different.  The V7 version is equipped with a chipset for 8 cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz, and Lite operates with 4 components.  The Mali-T720 graphics system on both smartphones.  RAM is also the same - only 2 GB.  What about the built-in, then 16 GB for each smartphone.  Supported work with a memory card. </p><p>  The display is better with the V7.  It has a diagonal of 5.2 inches.  Resolution - 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  The camera is also the best with this modification.  There is autofocus, the speed of the sensor is less than five seconds.  The flash is double.  The matrix has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  The Light version was distinguished by the best front camera.  The previous modification has only 5 megapixels. </p><p>  Both phones are running the sixth version of Android.  The V7 modification does not have a fingerprint scanner.  Both devices are not protected against moisture and dust. </p><p>  The version "Light" was very popular.  This is due to the lower cost of devices.  Initially, at the start of sales, the price difference was about $ 100. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The phone is considered controversial.  He received controversial reviews too.  In general, there are all the necessary parameters and options for work.  However, they function slowly and sometimes slow down.  The processor is too weak, the cameras, although they have good indicators, are actually terribly removed, the front flash is almost useless, the slowing down fingerprint sensor, the low volume of the speakers and the presence of a touch shell - all this is not very popular with customers.  Reviews about the ZTE Blade V7 Lite perfectly understand all the subtleties of the device. </p><p>  If we talk about the benefits, then allocate the matrix of the device.  Although it has a small brightness, it shows itself perfectly.  The appearance of the device is not bad, the case is made of metal, and two SIM cards are also supported. </p><p>  If a person wants to buy a high-quality device for 14 thousand rubles, then it is better to give preference to the Meizu M3S mini model.  Buyers notice that for such money the phone functions well, the cameras are stronger, the battery life is longer, the case is made of better materials, and the fingerprint scanner is clear and faster. </p><p>  Of the rivals, Highscreen Tasty can be noted.  It has 3 GB of RAM, good cameras and a useful life.  Got a great design. </p><p>  Another worthy competitor is Xiaomi Redmi 3. This gadget is famous for its long life. </p><p>  In general, there are a large number of Chinese in this price category who have the best characteristics. </p>
