Product Patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You think to sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands?  You do not know how to build patterns and are afraid that you will not succeed?  The road will be overpowered by the walking one.  This article contains 5 <span>patterns of cardigans</span> that even a beginner seamstress can make.  Be patient and start the creative process. </p><h2>  Cardigan with waves </h2><p>  Knitwear is moody material.  On the one hand, it has many advantages: it drapes well and rarely creeps.  And on the other hand, knitwear is very inconvenient to sew.  In order to make any product from this material, you will need a special sewing needle.  But if you try, then the result can exceed all expectations.  How to sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands?  A pattern of one of the variants of such a product is attached below.  We print out the image, scale it and transfer it to the fabric.  Draw on knitwear should be soap, as the chalk will quickly erase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands patterns" class="if uuid-2235175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235175.jpg"></div><p>  How to sew a cardigan from knitwear?  The pattern of parts is completed, now you can begin the manufacturing process.  First you should grind together the front and rear shelves.  Be sure to treat the side seams with a zigzag or overlock.  Now you need to sew the sleeves, and then attach them to an almost finished product.  When the cardigan is fully assembled, all edges should be finished.  This can be done both with the help of an overlock, and by bending one or two cm to the wrong side.  The finished product can be decorated with beads or embroidery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Extended cardigan </h2><p>  Such a thing can complement almost any image.  How to sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands?  The product pattern is attached below.  We print it out and customize it to our sizes.  If you want the cardigan to keep its shape, then it should be made of thick knitwear, but if you want to make a soft tight-fitting cloak, you should take thin material.  Transfer the pattern to the fabric and cut out the details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to sew a cardigan from knitwear do-it-yourself patterns photo" class="if uuid-2235176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235176.jpg"></div><p>  The sewing process begins with the manufacture of sleeves.  We sew the details.  Now you should grind the shoulder seams of the front and rear shelves.  Sew the sleeve into the open armhole.  In this way, putting the part in place is the easiest.  It should be remembered that things from knitwear are sewn without lining, therefore, the wrong side should be perfect.  After the sleeves are sewn, you can lay the side seams.  Now, using the overlock, you should process all the edges of the product.  If the knitwear is tight, then you can process the cardigan with a slanting inlay. </p><h2>  Lightweight cardigan </h2><p>  One of the easiest ways to sew a summer wrap is to make it from three parts.  One of them will be a front and a back shelf at the same time, and two other spare parts are sleeves.  In just an hour, you can sew a cardigan out of knitwear with your own hands.  The pattern of such a product is located below.  We print it and transfer it to the fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands" class="if uuid-2235362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235362.jpg"></div><p>  Since the cardigan will be very simple in style, you should beat it with an interesting print on the material.  We cut out the details.  Now you need to sew in the sleeves.  We sew them, as in the previous version, into the open armhole.  Now you should process all the edges of the product.  There are two ways to fix a cardigan: either sew buttons on the jacket and make holes for them, or make a belt. </p><h2>  Rectangle Cardigan </h2><p>  The easiest way to make a summer sweater is to make it out of a rectangle.  There is no need to draw a pattern.  Sewing a knitted cardigan with your own hands will be incredibly simple.  A rectangle should be cut out of any, preferably plain material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cardigan from knitwear pattern" class="if uuid-2235178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235178.jpg"></div><p>  Now you should divide it into three parts in two lines.  We retreat from the top of the strip of 15 cm and make a cut of 20 cm. Now you need to overcast the product.  It will be difficult to do without an overlock.  But, of course, the edge can be finished with a zigzag.  Cardigan is almost ready.  It remains to put on the product and decide in which place to sew the buttons.  One of the options for how to wear the product is shown in the picture. </p><h2>  Circle cardigan </h2><p>  To make such a cloak is as simple as the previous one.  How to sew a cardigan from knitwear with your own hands?  You can see the photo of the pattern below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cardigan from knitwear pattern" class="if uuid-2235179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235179.jpg"></div><p>  Print a circle.  It will be difficult to draw such a geometric figure by hand without a pattern.  Now you should divide the circle into four parts.  We postpone from the center 25 cm to the right and left.  From this mark, a 25 cm cut should be made at the top of the circle.  Now you need to overcast the edges of the product.  Cardigan is almost ready.  It remains to come up with a way to fix the product on the body.  You can sew a zipper into a sweater, you can sew buttons, and you can wear a cardigan with a belt or wide open. </p>
