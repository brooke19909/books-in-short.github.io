    <p>  When choosing a place for a vacation, I want the hotel to be conveniently located to places of recreation and entertainment.  The hotel complex Club Marmara Hammamet Beach 3 * is located in the northern part of Hammamet, almost on the seashore.  This is a calm resort area, reserved mainly for the development of hotels.  And there are many shops, catering establishments, entertainment complexes.  By the way, there is a taxi rank and a bus stop very close by, so moving around the neighborhood is unlikely to turn into a problem.  The center of North Hammamet is about 7 km away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Airports are a little further.  For example, the distance to <span>Enfida Airport</span> is about 60 km, and the city of Monastir is 120 km.  The capital of Tunisia is located 75 km from the hotel, so tourists often go there on excursions. </p><h2>  Hotel Club Marmara Hammamet Beach (Tunisia): what does the area look like? </h2>

    <p>  This is a rather large hotel complex, which consists of several two- and three-story buildings - snow-white walls and interesting architecture of buildings gives the hotel a peculiar flavor.

What awaits the guests of the Club Marmara Hammamet Beach 3 * hotel?  Reviews say that the food is really good here - there‚Äôs nothing to complain about.  As is customary in most cities of Tunisia, the hotel offers an all-inclusive scheme - these are daily breakfasts, lunches, dinners that take place in the main restaurant, as well as light snacks throughout the day (they are served in the pool bar).  The menu here is not bad, the dishes are delicious, and the cooks go out every evening to the guests of the restaurant to inquire about their opinions and wishes. </p><p>  There is a cafe on the beach throughout the day, and many more guests spend time in the lobby bar or pool, where staff offer refreshing drinks.  By the way, imported products, as well as alcoholic beverages, must be paid separately (prices from local manufacturers, of course, are much lower).  And tourists are invited to a stylized, colorful Moorish cafe, where you can not only enjoy the delicacies of local cuisine, but also plunge into the atmosphere of the East. </p><h2>  Convenience and entertainment by the sea </h2>
