  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pension deposit: comparison of conditions in different banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Banks offer a wide variety of financial services for people of retirement age.  This is both consumer lending and income generation through deposit processing.  Today we will consider the proposals of commercial banks for pensioners in which financial institution it is most profitable to make a deposit. </p><h2>  Home Credit Bank </h2><p>  The Pension deposit in the Home Credit Bank is offered for registration for a period of 18 months.  The interest rate on the deposit is 6.2% per annum.  The down payment should not be less than 1000 rubles.  According to the terms of the deposit, the client has the opportunity to replenish in the first 90 days, while the amount should not be less than 1 thousand rubles.  Further replenishment is not possible.  Payment of accrued% is carried out at the end of the deposit term.  Partial withdrawals are not possible.  If the client wishes to carry out early withdrawal from the deposit account, the interest rate will be only 0.01. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deseretnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contribution for retirees" class="if uuid-3123238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3123238.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a contribution “Pension Plus”.  Its duration is 18 months.  Down payment - from 1000 rubles.  The deposit rate is 7.7% per annum.  Replenishment is possible during the first 90 days of the deposit term, but not less than 1 thousand rubles.  Partial withdrawal is not possible.  It is important to note that both the Pension deposit and the Pension plus deposit can be opened exclusively in rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bank opening" </h2><p>  Otkritie Bank’s <span>pension card</span> holders are offered higher rates on standard deposits.  For example, “Reliable” is opened for a period of up to 6 months, the interest rate for pensioners will be up to 6.32% per annum.  The amount of deposit is from 50 thousand rubles.  Replenishment and partial withdrawal is not possible.  You can open in rubles and dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wi-fi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank opening&quot;" class="if uuid-3123242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3123242.jpg"></div><p>  Also, pensioners have access to the “Free Management” deposit, which allows them to earn income up to 5.41% per annum.  Its term is designed for a period of up to 2 years.  The minimum amount to be paid is from 50 thousand rubles.  Possible replenishment and partial withdrawal. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Binbank, which is affiliated with Otkrytie Bank, offered customers a separate option for senior citizens.  The “Pension” deposit in Binbank made it possible to get a fairly high income, but today this one will not be available. </p><h2>  Deposits at Rosselkhozbank </h2><p>  This bank has two offers for pensioners.  Namely: the contribution “Pension Plus”, as well as “Pension income”.  Let's consider the first option in more detail, as it is more profitable for customers.  What are the conditions for the Pension Plus deposit?  The minimum investment is from 500 rubles.  There are several deadlines for registration: 395, 730 and 1095 days.  Possible prolongation.  In addition, customers can replenish their deposit all the time, but not less than 1 ruble.  A partial withdrawal of funds is also allowed, however, at least 500 rubles must remain in the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vseon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Rosselkhozbank" class="if uuid-3123240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3123240.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the proposed interest rates in more detail.  For a period of 395 days - 6.25%, for a period of 730 days - 6.45%, for 1095 days - 6.65%.  Monthly withdrawal of interest is not provided. </p><h2>  Savings deposit at Gazprombank </h2><p>  The bank in question also offers several options for accumulating funds for pensioners.  The most beneficial is the contribution “Pension savings”.  Clearance is available in several currencies.  Replenishment of the financial account is not provided.  The term of the deposit can vary from 91 days to 3 years.  The minimum amount for investment is 15 thousand rubles, or five hundred dollars or euros.  Opportunities to replenish the account and partial withdrawal of savings without loss of interest is not provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravdaurfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Gazprombank" class="if uuid-3123241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3123241.jpg"></div><p>  Interest rates for deposits in rubles vary from 5.8% to 6.2%.  For dollar contracts - from 0.4% to 1.5%.  The interest rate for deposits in euros is 0.01%.  Interest accrual at the end of the deposit term or at the end of the year. </p><h2>  “Millennium Pension” deposit from “Bank of Kazan” </h2><p>  Deposit term - 367 days.  The deposit amount can vary from 50 thousand rubles.  <span>Replenishment of the deposit is</span> possible, but not later than 90 days before the expiration of the term.  You can replenish the deposit in the amount of 1 thousand rubles.  The interest rate is 5.25% per annum.  Payout% at the end of the deposit term.  In case of early withdrawal of the amount of the minimum balance, the interest shall be recalculated and paid at the deposit rate “Demand”.  An account can be opened both in the bank branch and through the personal account of the Internet bank. </p><h2>  Deposits from Sberbank </h2><p>  The largest commercial Russian bank also did not leave pensioners unattended.  First of all, we will consider in detail the Pension Plus contribution.  It is designed for retirement income.  Deposit term: 3 years.  The minimum amount of the minimum balance in the financial account is 1 ruble.  The deposit can be replenished, in addition, partial withdrawal is possible.  The annual rate is 3.5%.  Interest is accrued every 3 months.  It is important to note that the accrued% is added to the principal amount and increases the depositor's income in the following periods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarmarka-center.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PAO Sberbank" class="if uuid-3123239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3123239.jpg"></div><p>  To make a deposit, a pensioner should apply to any branch of Sberbank, providing a document proving his identity.  The account is opened after the contract  Then you need to make the initial amount.  You can monitor interest accruals in your Sberbank Online account. </p><p>  Also, pensioners are offered special conditions when making such deposits as “Save” and “Replenish”.  For example, consider interest rates at the “Recharge” tariff for senior citizens.  For a period of 3 to 6 months, the interest rate will be from 4.6% to 4.62% per annum.  For a period of 6 to 12 months, the% rate is from 4.7% to 4.75% per annum.  When making a deposit in dollars: for a period of up to six months, the interest rate of 0.55% per annum, for a period of up to a year - 1.25% per annum.  The deposit amount may begin with a value of 1 thousand rubles (or from $ 100). </p><p>  What special conditions can pensioners receive by applying for a “Save” deposit at Sberbank?  When concluding an agreement for a period of up to 2 months - 4.35% per annum.  With an increase in the period, the% rate also rises.  For example, with a deposit term of 3 years - up to 5.65% per annum. </p><p>  When choosing which deposit to make, pensioners should pay attention not only to the interest rate, but also to the term, as well as the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal of funds during the term of the deposit.  For example, if a pensioner wants to make a one-time amount for a year and subsequently receive income, he must choose one tariff, but if you want to save and sometimes still withdraw part of the amount, pay attention to other offers.  It is also important to clarify the possibility of prolonging the contract. </p>
