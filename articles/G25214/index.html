  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Permogorsk painting: from the origins to the present day</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In ancient times, painting dishes and various household items was the most popular craft.  Colorful pictures adorned things literally in every house and it is noteworthy that simple peasants brought out patterns of stunning beauty.  People put their whole soul into the creation of their small paintings, which is probably why ancient drawings admire their picturesqueness even today. </p><p>  Permogorsk painting, which arose in the 18th century, is one of the simplest, but at the same time, the most beautiful types of folk art.  The Permogorye pier, located on the highest bank of the Northern Dvina, offers breathtaking views of green fields with golden flowers, majestic tree crowns and mirror surfaces of water bodies.  Northern nature is especially beautiful during sunsets and sunrises, when the whole sky is filled with crimson colors.  It was these natural colors that in ancient times inspired the masters to create a vibrant mural, now called in honor of the meta of its origin. </p><p>  Permogorsk painting is based on several motifs, the most important of which is a floral pattern symbolizing well-being and happiness.  Most often, artists depicted spreading trees, on the branches of which flaunted sweet-voiced virgins-birds - Syrins.  Another common element of Severodvinsk drawings is scenes from the life of peasants.  It could be a girl's get-togethers, a family tea party or, for example, sleigh rides. </p><p>  The main colors of this <span>type of painting</span> were red, black, green and white, sometimes additionally masters used golden tones.  Before starting work, the wooden object was primed with glue and chalk, then covered with whitewash (it was they who later became the background).  After the white paint dried up, the black outline of the pattern was drawn with a magpie or goose feather.  Then the drawing was filled with bright colors and in the end everything was covered with drying oil. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Permogorsk painting was most often present on wooden household items such as spinning wheels, cradles, bread boxes, tueski, dishes, and children's toys.  Painted utensils passed on from generation to generation, it is thanks to this that some products have survived to this day. </p><p>  Today Permogorsk painting takes on a second life: craftsmen decorate <span>household utensils</span> with it and create separate, independent paintings.  Tableware with folk patterns has become not only a table decoration, but also an element of decor.  Especially popular is the <span>painting of plates</span> - picturesque saucers bring unique flavor to the home interior </p><p>  If you wish, everyone can master the technique of this type of folk art.  To create a picturesque pattern, you just need to practice a little on paper or even use a ready-made stencil. </p><p>  To create a <span>pattern on dishes,</span> special indelible <span>paints (stained glass</span> or acrylic), several brushes and some free time will be required.  It should be noted that although the paints are waterproof, they should not come in contact with food.  Therefore, if the dishes are intended for food, and not for decoration, it is better to display patterns on its outer side. </p><p>  Beginning artists are encouraged to master the technique of painting with one stroke.  This method of drawing is based on color stretching: lighter tones smoothly turn into dark and, accordingly, vice versa.  Thanks to this effect, even the most unpretentious drawings turn out to be ‚Äúalive‚Äù. </p><p>  Painting with one stroke is very simple: a wide flat brush is completely dipped in the paint of the <span>main color,</span> and then its edges are immersed in tint tones.  When applying such a smear, the main shade is dominant, and the <span>complementary colors,</span> merging with the main one, form a smooth transition from one color to another. </p>
