  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose the best tablet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It seems that only yesterday Apple released its first tablet computer called the iPad, and today the tablet boom has begun in the computer technology market.  Following Apple, analogies of tablets such as the iPad were introduced by the giant electronics and computer companies Samsung, Asus, HP and LG.  Needless to say, if Chinese craftsmen joined in the work, they immediately came up with their IPed tablets.  These IPed's are dozens of times cheaper than a real iPad and have fewer useful features, but nevertheless, they have also started to enjoy quite good popularity, although it is impossible to say that the IPed tablet is the best tablet in the world. </p><p>  If you choose a high-quality and tested tablet, stop your attention on several models, such as Apple iPad, Motorola Kzum, BlackBerry Playbook or Android tablet.  Nevertheless, even when buying a tablet computer from this line of models, there may be some disagreement and difficulty in choosing.  Therefore, if you want a <span>tablet computer,</span> carefully think over some of the proposed points. </p><p>  To begin with, think about whether you really need a tablet computer, because due to its lightweight functionality, it will not be able to fully replace your personal computer.  The tablet itself was conceived as a lightweight version of a regular laptop, necessary to view pages on the Internet, view all kinds of media files, install and run small games and applications. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In any case, you have to choose any operating system from the proposed ones.  Apple devices such as iPad, iPhone, and iPod Background work on the iOS operating system.  The advantages of this operating system are very convenient and easy to use.  In addition, various applications and games for iOS written a huge amount, about sixty-five thousand.  The Android operating system from Google is fundamentally different from Apple's iOS.  Google has released several versions of Android, but for tablet <span>computers,</span> only the version of Honeycomb is <span>optimized</span> .  It is not as good as iOS, but, nevertheless, has excellent multitasking and a well-thought-out notification system. </p><p>  If you need a tablet for games and applications, buy the best tablet, that is, an iPad, because other Android tablets have many less games and applications.  This advantage of the iPad is that the iPad is made exclusively by one model, so the display on it is always the same size.  While Android is developing applications for most tablets supporting this OS, that is, for tablets with different display sizes. </p><p>  The screen sizes of a tablet of different brands range from 7 to 10 inches, so first of all try holding different tablets in your hands in order to determine the <span>screen size</span> that is suitable for you <span>.</span>  Pay increased attention to the dimensions and weight of the tablet, yet you still have to carry it everywhere with you, and I don‚Äôt want you to get tired of it. </p><p>  You can fill your good inexpensive tablet with any kind of information, but only insufficient memory of your device can limit this process.  However, do not chase too much memory, because such a desire may entail the need for a surcharge of half the price of a tablet.  Pay attention to the presence of a WiFi module in your device, just some tablets have WiFi + 3G, and this is a completely different level compared to traditional communications. </p><p>  As for the camera and video communications, the Motorola Kzum tablet is well designed in this area, the camera of which has good photo quality and high resolution.  But in any case, in terms of photo quality, not even one of the best tablets can be compared with a simple digital camera. </p><p>  When buying a tablet, you need to focus on the amount of money that you are really willing to spend on the purchase of the device.  Therefore, if you are going to save on a purchase, think twice.  Do you want, then ask on the forums, <span>how to flash a Chinese tablet?</span>  I think it‚Äôs unlikely.  Therefore, buying the best tablet for yourself, do not skimp, over time, it will surely pay for itself, working efficiently and productively. </p>
