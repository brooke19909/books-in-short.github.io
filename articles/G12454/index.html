Among its owners in the history of Russia there are retired major general, deputy of the State Duma, and colonel general of higher officer courses.  From childhood, a minimum program was laid down for each of them - to justify their last name.  This is the case when you want to do not want, but inevitably you will strive for the high rank of <span>General Generals.</span>  <span>The biography of</span> each of our heroes is vivid proof of this. </p>
