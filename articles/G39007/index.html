One of them, of course, is the cost.  In the category of inexpensive tablets, there are gadgets of the domestic manufacturer Irbis.  Of course, it is impossible to call them impeccable, but it is also not necessary to ignore them. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of these devices is the price.  For less than 3000 rubles you can buy a pretty nimble tablet that will do a good job of fulfilling the tasks.  The article provides an overview of the characteristics of the Irbis TX69 model.  Owner reviews will help evaluate its real capabilities, as well as talk about the weaknesses of the gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817414.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  This tablet model is packaged in a white box.  On the front panel there is a photo of the device with an extravagant image on the screen.  We are talking about the snow leopard, which represents strength and power.  Such a move can be interpreted in different ways, but most buyers believe that the image of the animal is used for advertising purposes.  After all, the snow leopard is the second name of the snow leopard. </p><p>  Under the photo of <span>the Irbis</span> TX69 <span>tablet</span> are brief characteristics.  The logo of the MTS operator and the name of the model are printed in the upper left corner.  On the side panels there is information about belonging to the Irbis brand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You should not have high hopes for a set of components.  Each buyer should immediately remember the price of the gadget.  The critically low cost has influenced the fact that in the box the buyer will find only a USB cable and a power adapter.  The manufacturer also provided for the availability of instructions and other documentation.  All other elements will have to be purchased separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817410.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <h2>  Irbis TX69: appearance review </h2><p>  From the first glance at the tablet, it is impossible to clearly state that it belongs to budget devices.  Although the case is made of plastic, it looks pretty decent.  The side edges are slightly rounded, which makes the tablet visually thinner.  From the right angles, the developers also refused.  However, the rectangular shape of the body is clearly visible.  The surface of the back cover is matte, slightly rough, which prevents slipping.  In design, the developers focused on minimalism.  This decision was well received by users. </p><p>  The location of the speaker and microphone is made according to the standard scheme.  Given that the gadget has a cellular module, this is an indisputable advantage.  It‚Äôs definitely impossible to judge the convenience of talking on a 7-inch tablet, but at least there‚Äôs no need to carry a phone with you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the front panel, in addition to the screen, there is also a front camera lens, an indicator.  On the right side end are the power and volume keys.  Near the first, the manufacturer used a special designation that shows the purpose of the button.  It also serves as a lock.  On both sides of the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù are ‚Äú+‚Äù (increase volume) and ‚Äú-‚Äù (decrease).  Above these keys, the developers brought out a port for installing a memory card.  On the upper edge are connectors for connecting a USB cable and audio equipment. </p><p>  The manufacturer used the upper part of the rear panel to display the LED flash, the output speaker and the main camera lens.  The company logo is located in the center of the battery cover, and the model name is at the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 3g reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817409.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Irbis TX69: specifications and description of the screen </h2><p>  The main element of the tablet can safely be called a screen.  It is its characteristics that allow you to fully use the potential of the gadget.  For example, play games or read e-books.  In this tablet model, the manufacturer used a display that meets modern requirements.  It is capacitive, supports widescreen mode.  There is also a multi-touch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Screen size - 7 inches.  It is able to display a picture with a resolution of 1024 √ó 600 px.  This is pretty good, but the pixel density is small - only 170 ppi.  For this reason, the Irbis TX69 tablet screen reviews are not getting very good.  With the naked eye, users can notice graininess, blur. </p><p>  The brightness is enough for indoor use.  On the street, the display fades greatly, which significantly reduces the level of readability.  There are also some problems with viewing angles.  If you tilt the device along the transverse axis, then the color changes slightly.  But when you rotate along the longitudinal picture becomes almost invisible.  Therefore, when watching a movie, you will have to hold the tablet at an angle of 90 ¬∞. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  In Irbis TX69 3G, the processor characteristics are not as impressive as a modern user would like.  It is based on the MediaTek budget chipset.  The developers chose the MTK 8312 model. It is based on two computing modules.  Under heavy load, each core can accelerate to 1300 MHz.  For graphics meets the graphics card ARM Mali-400. </p><p>  According to users, such characteristics are already very outdated.  The only thing that calms is low cost.  The tablet is able to perform only simple everyday tasks.  The owners of this device will have to abandon modern games and resource-intensive applications.  You also need to be prepared for the fact that when you run multiple programs at the same time, the device may freeze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817413.jpg" width="429"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Speaking about the performance of Irbis TX69, you can not keep silent about the main element characterizing the performance.  We are talking about the amount of RAM.  Its dimensions indicate what potential the owner can count on.  Unfortunately, the parameter "RAM" provided by the developers is only 512 MB.  By modern standards, this is very small.  Now even in the budget class you can find devices with 1 GB of storage. </p><p>  With the dimensions of the integrated memory, everything is not going smoothly either.  To download software and other files, the user has less than 3 GB available.  In the specifications declared by the manufacturer, this storage is 4 GB.  However, some of it is occupied by system folders.  Therefore, the user will have to limit himself or install a memory card.  The device is able to work with drives, the volume of which does not exceed 32 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 specifications" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817411.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  When choosing any mobile device, the buyer pays attention to the terms of autonomy.  After all, few people want to work with the tablet without leaving the outlet.  In Irbis TX69 3G 7 ∫, the battery specifications are fully consistent with the segment in which it is sold.  The battery is made using a lithium-polymer chemical composition.  Battery capacity is 2500 milliamps per hour. </p><p>  The owners have no reason to rely on great potential.  When watching a video or using it as a music player, the device‚Äôs battery runs out quickly.  The same thing happens during games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 3g specifications" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817412.jpg" width="600"></div>

Works with networks of the second and third generations.  There are two interfaces for accessing the World Wide Web.  The first is Wi-Fi.  Support for 802.11b / g / n standard.  The signal is stable.  Also, the user has the opportunity to use the mobile Internet 3G. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a GPS function.  However, users claim that the search for satellites is quite a long time.  You can use Bluetooth to transfer data.  With it, small files are indulged.  For heavier ones, it is better to use a USB cable.  It is also used to connect to other devices, such as a PC, laptop, phone and others. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Irbis TX69 has both disadvantages and advantages.  The most important advantage is the price.  The retail price is 2690 rubles, and MTS mobile phone shops offer it for 1990 rubles.  However, for the promotion, you can only buy a tablet working with one operator, for the rest it will be blocked. </p><p>  A significant advantage can be considered the ability to support two SIM-cards, 3G.  The Wi-Fi module did not go unnoticed either. </p><p>  The presence of two cameras, of course, can be attributed to the advantages, but if not for their resolution.  The frontal optical module is limited to only 0.3 megapixels.  The main camera also will not please.  It is based on a 2-megapixel sensor.  The quality of the pictures is poor.  Their maximum resolution is 1600 √ó 1200 px.  Although there is a flash, but photos taken in poor lighting turn out blurry, with highlights and lots of noise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irbis tx69 3g 7 specifications" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1817415.jpg" width="600"></div>
