  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Youth Hotels Turkey</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Long gone are the days when rest for youth abroad was available only to a few.  And young tourists travel around the world, to different countries, seas and oceans.  But even with the modern variety of offers, youth hotels in Turkey leave the feeling of a dream come true in their guests' memory.  Rest here is a gentle sea and comfortable pools, sailing, diving, surfing, gambling <span>beach volleyball,</span> indoor football, basketball, tennis and other sports.  All day long, numerous animators organize various entertainments in which everyone is interested, and in the evening incendiary discos begin, which are always crowded and fun. </p><p>  Youth hotels in Turkey not only do not let their guests get bored, they also give them the opportunity to communicate with peers, make new friends and hobbies, from which serious feelings can then arise.  Turkey hotels for youth recreation, as a rule, provide all-inclusive services, meals in upscale restaurants, included in the price of the tour.  All these hotels meet the requirements of international standards, always have friendly staff and are distinguished by impeccable service.  Prices for leisure services here allow you to choose a hotel for any wallet: for those who decide to do without much chic, there are fairly simple hotels, and for the most picky tourists there are five-star palaces in which there is everything in almost every room.  Many hotels have televisions with a Russian channel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the specific Turkish resorts and hotels that are fighting for the title of ‚ÄúTurkey‚Äôs most youthful hotel‚Äù, three districts need to be highlighted here - Bodrum, Side and Marmaris.  First of all, Bodrum should be noted, which strikes with a unique feeling of a mixture of antiquity and modernity.  <span>St. Peter's Castle,</span> located on the site of one of the seven wonders of the world - Halikarnassus Mausoleum, a unique historical monument, the temple of Apollo in Didim, where you can see a grandiose sculpture of <span>Medusa Gorgon, a</span> unique museum of underwater archeology.  And nearby, on countless streets and a wide promenade, the bustling and cheerful resort life of one of the best party places throughout Europe is seething.  Here is the Halicarnassus disco, it is the largest, fun and bright in the country.  The best DJs and musicians perform at it, laser shows shock with magnificent beauty.  Near a large number of other discos and nightclubs. </p><p>  Numerous restaurants and cafes are scattered throughout the town, spreading the smells of oriental cuisine.  During the day you can have fun at the water park, go on a boat trip or go diving.  Youth <span>hotels in Turkey are best</span> represented by the Club Flipper HV1 located here.  In the small town of Side, there are also many hotels for young people, among them Club Voyage Sorgun Select HV1 and Club Hotel Turan Prince HV1 can be distinguished.  This resort is rightly called the Turkish Riviera, there is always a high demand for recreation here.  The reason for this is the atmosphere of antiquity in the neighborhood of sea beaches, night clubs and discos.  Here is located one of the most popular disco ‚ÄúOxid‚Äù in the country. </p><p>  Closes the top three most popular resorts where the youth hotels of Turkey are located Marmaris.  This resort has hidden in a picturesque bay surrounded by mountains among eucalyptus forests.  He is widely known among those who are looking for the most vibrant hangouts.  Numerous discos make it possible to spend dazzlingly bright nights here, drag into the pool of ultramodern music and dance until you drop.

And the good location of Marmaris at the confluence of the Aegean and the Mediterranean Seas makes it the main yacht center of the country. </p>
