  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types and functions of public administration</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any state possesses natural resources, financial capitals, as well as intellectual potential, characteristic only of it.  The level of its economic and social development directly depends on the skillful <span>organization of public</span> administration.  In other words, the management organization consists of the composition of social institutions, representatives of state power and territorial structure. </p><p>  Government management may include the activities <span>of authorities</span> in the exercise of legislative, judicial and executive functions. </p><p>  The main goal of public administration is to achieve optimality in the conditions created to ensure a decent level of social status.  When considering this issue in the economic prism, we can say that the management activities of the relevant bodies should be aimed at determining strategies for long-term economic development and creating suitable conditions for its implementation in order to improve the living standards of the population. </p><p>  The implementation of these goals should be based on the following <span>principles of public administration:</span> general, revealing the content and <span>target direction of</span> management activities, organizational, technological and private, which are the direct management of the activities of people. </p><p>  The social essence of any state is known through the functions of public administration, since any country without its interaction with society loses its essence. </p><p>  These functions have sufficient versatility and depend on a specific goal in a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãmanagement activity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main functions of public administration: </p><p>  - political - a function that ensures the integrity and security of society in the form of a state; </p><p>  - social - a function aimed at ensuring the rights and freedoms of citizens throughout its territory; </p><p>  - economic - a component of the function of public administration, responsible for creating the necessary prerequisites for an effective and orderly activity of society in the economic sphere; </p><p>  - maintaining the sovereignty and freedom of the state within the international community. </p><p>  There are other functions of government, reflecting the interaction of the subject and the <span>object of management</span> (functions of organization, forecasting, planning, motivation and control). </p><p>  Types of public administration are widely reflected in the scientific literature.  Depending on the structure of the central authority and the bodies of administrative units, coordination and subordination management can be distinguished.  The first type is a characteristic feature for federations, within the framework of this department quite wide powers are given to the regions.  Subordinate management characterizes unitary states in which the functions of public administration at all levels are implemented in the form of uniform standards, while the strict subordination of regions to the center can be noted. </p><p>  The next criterion for highlighting the types of government is its impact on the object.  In the specified spectrum, one can distinguish: </p><p>  - industry management, assuming a vertical subordination from the center to any business entity; </p><p>  - functional management, which is carried out by the executive branch in such important areas as economics, defense, social development and security.  Thanks to this management activity, an effective foreign and domestic policy of the state is ensured. </p>
