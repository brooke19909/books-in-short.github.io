    <p>  Guest houses and hotels in Sevastopol year-round are waiting for travelers.  There is housing for every taste and budget.  Read about the best accommodation options in our review. </p><h2>  "Aquamarine" </h2><p>  The closer to summer, the more difficult it is to book hotels in Sevastopol.  Today, the service on the Black Sea coast is practically no different from that in the resorts of Greece, Cyprus and Montenegro. </p><p>  One of the best places for families with children is considered a five-star hotel “Aquamarine” (Sevastopol, ul. Parkovaya, 11).  The complex is located in a park area on an area of ​​2 hectares.  Walking paths, magnificent gazebos, a small waterfall, sports fields, swimming pools, a private beach, restaurants and a huge lawn for active children’s games - here, every guest will find entertainment to their liking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the room fund there are categories: “Superior Standard”, “Designer Junior Suite”, “Two-room Suite” and “Apartments”.  Spacious rooms with panoramic windows decorated in bright colors.  It offers guests - a safe, internet, a minibar, toiletries, a hairdryer, a set of dishes, satellite TV.  Linen is changed daily and housekeeping is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sevastopol hotel bay" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233989.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gastronomic journey </h2><p>  The price of the reservation includes breakfast (buffet) in the restaurant “Lavender”, in which guests will certainly be introduced to the variety of aromas and tastes of Crimea. </p><p>  There are several more restaurants on the territory: </p><ol><li>  “Temari” is a paradise for fans of <span>Pan-Asian cuisine.</span>  On the luxurious terrace you can enjoy the colorful sunset. </li><li>  Madera Grill Club - the establishment is located on the seafront, and an open kitchen and an unusual Spanish stove add even more color. </li><li>  “Boarding” - an exciting journey into the gastronomic world promises a restaurant-ship.  The original interior and a huge selection of seafood dishes will be a pleasant addition to any company. </li></ol><p>  The Aquamarine Hotel has a poolside bar, as well as phyto and lobby bars.  The number and variety of restaurants justify not only the "star" status of the hotel, but also its location. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to guest reviews, the complex is located far from the main attractions of Sevastopol, so getting out to the city for lunch and dinner is quite problematic.  Fortunately, the institutions on the territory of Aquamarine are ready to satisfy even the most demanding tastes.  The only drawback is the high prices. </p><h2>  Water activities </h2><p>  Not all Sevastopol hotels by the sea have their own beach.  The Aquamarine complex is located on the first line - the beach adjoins the park zone, the distance to it is no more than 100 meters. </p><p>  For vacationers are equipped with shower columns, changing cabins, sun loungers, deck chairs, umbrellas and awnings.  The Mayak Bar offers refreshing drinks and sweets for children. </p><p>  Fans of active pastime will enjoy sports grounds, as well as a water amusement park (pedal boats and skis, <span>sailing catamarans,</span> windsurfing and jet skis). </p><p>  In the courtyard of the hotel there is an outdoor pool (389 square meters) with a children's area.  However, the main attraction for guests is the water park, where you will find seven pools (for adults, teens and kids), waterfalls, a hydromassage, a fountain and twelve slides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel aurora" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233990.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  It will not be boring </h2><p>  Hotel “Aquamarine” (Sevastopol) offers entertainment for every taste.  Young guests enjoy spending time in the games room in the company of animators.  For adults, contests and other events are held.  For the evening, open-air movie shows and parties at the Aqua Dance Beach Club are planned. </p><p>  Rest in Crimea is impossible to imagine without a cultural program.  Walking tour of Balaklava, a visit to the Livadia Palace and the Swallow's Nest viewing platform, Bakhchisarai and the magnificent <span>sights of Sevastopol.</span> </p><p>  After an exciting trip, be sure to check out the SPA center.  Thanks to peeling, massage or body wraps from fatigue, there is no trace left. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  “Aquamarine” is the only hotel complex of the “5 star” category in Sevastopol.  Unfortunately, the service at the hotel does not always correspond to high status.  Based on the reviews of vacationers, we were able to objectively evaluate the “Aquamarine”. </p><p>  Pros: </p><p>  - a large and green area; </p><p>  - infrastructure; </p><p>  - friendly staff at the reception; </p><p>  - great job maids; </p><p>  - spacious rooms and their equipment; </p><p>  - Breakfast at the Lavender Restaurant. </p><p>  Minuses: </p><p>  - in some rooms plumbing with rust; </p><p>  - employment of the indoor pool with water aerobics classes; </p><p>  - remoteness from the city center; </p><p>  - adjacent doors to adjacent rooms; </p><p>  - high prices in the hotel and restaurants; </p><p>  - weak Wi-Fi signal. </p><h2>  "Aurora" </h2><p>  Mini-hotels in Sevastopol are in demand among travelers.  In the heart of the city is the cruiser Aurora, more precisely, a hotel stylized as a famous ship. </p><p>  Instead of the usual rooms, guests live in superior and standard single, double and quadruple cabins.  Thanks to boilers, there is always hot water in showers.  Modern TVs, a set of toiletries, a hairdryer and a refrigerator await travelers, regardless of room category.  The <span>interior in a marine style</span> creates a special mood <span>,</span> which is not at all typical of budget hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest house Sevastopol" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Aurora Hotel (12 Kozhanova St.) is located a five-minute drive from the center, there are several cafes and restaurants, a clothing and grocery shopping center nearby.  By public transport you can easily get to any part of the city or to one of the beaches. </p><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  Affordable prices, comfortable rooms and attentive staff - despite the advantages, travelers are advised to choose the Aurora Hotel for a short time.  In the refrigerator there is only a small set of inexpensive drinks and snacks, there is the opportunity to drink tea or coffee. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings most often noted the lack of breakfast and not the most prosperous area of ​​the city - in the evenings it is better not to walk here.  The rooms can be quite noisy due to the proximity to the road. </p><h2>  In the artillery bay </h2><p>  Sevastopol hotels by the sea are in special demand among tourists.  Even in the city, you can arrange a full beach vacation. </p><p>  In the center is the Artillery Bay - here you will find many offers.  It so happened that the two hotels were named the same, so guests often get confused.  We will talk about both accommodation options. </p><p>  The first mini-hotel “Art Bay” is located at ul.  Kapitanskaya, house 2. Within walking distance of guests the city beach “Crystal”, as well as the area of ​​the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet, next to which there are many restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  The rooms are available for booking: single and double, double TWIN and double VIP. </p><p>  According to reviews, this is a small budget hotel, the service in which is at an average level.  The declared daily cleaning, as well as a change of linen, is absent.  In the cold season, no heating, except for the air conditioner, is provided.  Perhaps the only plus is the location. </p><h2>  Hollywood style </h2><p>  Another hotel - “Art-bay” (2 Sinyavina St.) earned only the best ratings.  Most likely, the designer, while decorating the rooms, was guided by the word “art” in the meaning “art”. </p><p>  <span>Kylie Minogue,</span> Shakira, Demi Moore, Enrique Iglesias, Philip Kirkorov, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Alla Pugacheva, Elvis Presley, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio and others - each issue is dedicated to one show business star.  In addition to colorful images on the walls, it offers comfortable furniture, free Wi-Fi and a flat-screen TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sevastopol hotels by the sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The price includes breakfast.  In the free access - a kitchen with all necessary equipment (including a washing machine), an iron and ironing board, secured parking.  For stays of more than ten nights, airport transfer is free. </p><p>  Not all hotels in Sevastopol can provide guests with meals.  Art Bay offers breakfast in a cafe located 20 meters from the hotel.  In addition, within walking distance there is a spa and fitness center, a children's entertainment town, a dolphinarium, several mini markets and a grocery market, restaurants and night clubs, public transport stops. </p><p>  Planning a trip to Sevastopol?  Hotel “Bay”, according to travelers, is an ideal place to relax.  Attention and care of the staff, a memorable interior, compliments from the owners, the location is suitable for sightseeing and fans of nightly entertainment.  Even some domestic difficulties could not spoil the impression of relaxation. </p><h2>  "Old city" </h2><p>  “Old Town” is the most popular guest house (Sevastopol, 32 Lomonosova St.).  The facility is located in the city center, a walk to the nearest beach (Crystal) takes only ten minutes. </p><p>  There are three categories of rooms available for booking: </p><p>  - double; </p><p>  - junior suite; </p><p>  - apartments. </p><p>  It offers guests - TV, air conditioning, wireless internet and refrigerator.  The apartments have a kitchenette with a set of necessary utensils.  There is a small pool in the patio. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel aquamarine sevastopol" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233988.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A huge number of leisure options are offered in this city by hotels (Sevastopol).  Reviews advise you to pay attention to the “modest” guest house “Old Town”.  Comfortable and spacious rooms, friendly staff and a friendly atmosphere.  In the morning, a hearty and varied breakfast is served.  Despite its location near the Artillery Bay, it is always very quiet here. </p><p>  The main shortcomings were noted by travelers with kids - the lack of highchairs and beds.  Sometimes there are problems with booking through third-party resources. </p><h2>  Admiral </h2><p>  The highest ratings were awarded to the “Admiral” - a guest house (Sevastopol, st. Shcherbaka, 22A).  This object is more reminiscent of a luxury villa with a SPA center, located in the heart of the city. </p><p>  Travelers prefer the “Admiral” for several reasons: </p><ol><li>  Cozy and comfortable rooms with an elegant interior. </li><li>  Proximity to the beach. </li><li>  Bath complex (pool, Finnish sauna and hammam). </li><li>  High-quality housekeeping and attention to detail. </li><li>  Free wifi. </li><li>  Delicious homemade breakfast. </li></ol><p>  In addition, the guest house organizes excursions to the main <span>attractions of Crimea,</span> transfer and car rental. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Sevastopol" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1233995.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Pros: </p><p>  - A quiet place within walking distance of the promenade and the market; </p><p>  - <span>parking in the yard</span> ; </p><p>  - Free access to the bath complex. </p><p>  As for the minuses, guests note very poor sound insulation and the lack of an elevator. </p><p>  Guest house “Admiral” very clearly conveys the “spirit of Sevastopol” - interior details in a marine style are connected with the history of the Black Sea Fleet.  As on the deck of a ship, cleanliness and order always reign here.  The hotel is more suitable for a tourist trip than for a beach holiday. </p>
