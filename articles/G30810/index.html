    <h2>  Roman patricians: origin </h2><p>  An interesting translation of the word "patrician" - it means "paternal", since it comes from the Latin pater (father).  This is due to the fact that patricians lived according to the laws of strict patriarchy, where inheritance takes place only along the male line.  In ancient Rome, the father of the family had <span>absolute power</span> over the household <span>,</span> and no one had the right to challenge his decisions.  He could punish a family member in any way, sell him into slavery, or even kill him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to tradition, in Rome there were 300 patrician clans.  Each representative of a separate family had a generic name.  The Romans, belonging to the number of representatives of the aristocracy, bore three names.  The first was personal; a small number were used in Rome.  The second is just a generic name.  And the third - the so-called family.  For example, <span>Guy Julius Caesar.</span>  Julius is the patrimonial name of one of the ancient patrician clans. </p><p>  Patricia is also the very first <span>population of Rome.</span>  In ancient times, the tribes of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines became the first full-fledged inhabitants of this city.  Over time, they turned into a privileged estate and began to be called patricians.  This word has become synonymous with “aristocracy.  Patricians were the largest landowners in the country. </p><h2>  Functions and responsibilities of the privileged class </h2><p>  Patricians are not only the ruling class, but also the highest officials of Ancient Rome.  Initially, only they could be elected to the Senate and hold the posts of priests.  Conducting religious rites and ceremonies was also the exclusive right of the patricians.  Of these, military leaders and judges were elected.  Much later, when the number of patrician clans was significantly reduced, the rulers of Rome had to give the opportunity to participate in the administration of the empire and representatives of the lower class. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient Rome: patricians and plebeians.  Long standing confrontation </h2><p>  Almost the entire history of the great empire is the internal contradictions associated with the struggle of its two main classes.  The plebeians, who represented the common people, constantly sought to improve their plight.  Since it was they who made up the bulk of the Roman army, they had something to blackmail the aristocracy.  Several times they refused to participate in the battles if their conditions were not accepted.  Patricians could not change this or somehow affect the plebeians, and were forced to make concessions.  Gradually, the plebs managed to achieve the right to elect their own officials, who ensured that their few rights were not infringed upon by the patricians. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, representatives of the ancient Roman clans became less and less.  First, their number decreased to 18, then to 14 families.  This was facilitated by the long <span>wars of Rome,</span> which killed the patricians and a strict ban on marriages not with representatives of the genera - the founders of Rome.  In the end, by the first years of our era, the ancient patrician families had disappeared.  If earlier it became possible to become a patrician only by birthright, now the emperor could give the title to a patrician. </p>
