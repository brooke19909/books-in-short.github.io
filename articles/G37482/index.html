  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Water park in Achinsk - envy of the entire Krasnoyarsk Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is in full swing.  The sun burns mercilessly, and everyone dreams of being near the sea, on the banks of a river or lake.  And in extreme cases - in the pool, and better in the pool of the water park.  That's right, the water park in Achinsk is now called the brand new, not so long ago open center for water entertainment, designed for families, amateur and professional fitness classes. </p><h2>  A tour of the recent past </h2><p>  In the fifties of the twentieth century, near the small former merchant city of Achinsk, the construction of a huge giant plant, the Achinsk alumina refinery, began.  Together with the plant, in less than 20 years, microdistricts of modern Achinsk have grown, which provided housing for 180 thousand new settlers.  The young city needed an entertainment infrastructure.  By the end of the sixties, when the Palace of Culture, which still holds city festivals and concerts, and a sports stadium for 11,000 people, had already built a network of cinemas in Achinsk.  Each major district of Achinsk had its own cinema: Siberia (the main cinema of the network), Yunost, cinema clubs Komsomolets and Stroitel and a specialized children's cinema Orlenok. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinema &quot;Youth&quot;, in this building is now equipped with a water park" class="if uuid-2660701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93581/2660701.jpg"></div><p>  In the nineties of the twentieth century, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the entire cinema network of the country was in a deep economic crisis, and the halls in Achinsk were empty.  The rooms of cinema clubs eventually occupied gyms.  In the former main cinema "Siberia" the youth center of the same name was located, but the building of "Youth" was empty for a very long time.  So far, the city‚Äôs entrepreneurs have not come here with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãturning a spacious room into an aquacenter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Swimming in the Chulym river closest to the city is prohibited due to its rapid flow, and the city is located in a sharply continental climate zone, and this means that it is even hotter in summer than in the south.  Given these circumstances, the ability to relax with children in large spacious pools equipped with all kinds of water slides and pipes, no worse than in the southern resorts, was considered absolutely necessary for Achintsy and visitors.  And the work began to boil. </p><h2>  Cinema on water attractions in Achinsk "waved without looking" </h2><p>  A little more than two years and about 150 million rubles (according to media reports) were spent on the re-equipment of the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="directmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua-center &quot;Form&quot; in Achinsk" class="if uuid-2660693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93581/2660693.jpg"></div><p>  In the spacious room of the Achinsk water park (in the former cinema), a large pool and water attractions are very conveniently located.  In addition, there is still a fitness room with fitness equipment, a sauna, comfortable locker rooms and showers. </p><p>  Twenty years ago, families came here for movie shows.  The premiere days when film actors and directors came to creative meetings were a whole event for the townspeople. </p><p>  Today, the Forma aquacenter in Achinsk is also gathered by families and companies, but in order to have a good time near the water.  Time does not stand still, technologies and capabilities of people also change, develop, expand.  Today, movies are in almost every home.  But far from everyone has the opportunity to often travel to the sea, river or lake.  And not all, for example, with the kids will go to the open water.  And in the Achin water park there are attractions for the smallest, safe and exciting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A water park in the city of Achinsk is now one of the popular holiday destinations not only for locals, but also for visitors, because even in Krasnoyarsk, the regional center, there is still no water park of its own. </p><p>  In order to feel the whole range of impressions, of course, it is most beneficial to take a family subscription (for a company) or an individual for a day.  But in the list of services of the Achinsk water park there are various offers for individual, collective and children's visits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family Waterpark" class="if uuid-2660697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93581/2660697.jpg"></div><h2>  Hot weekend by the water </h2><p>  Achinsk water park is ready to receive guests on weekdays from 9 am to 9 pm, on weekends (Saturday, Sunday) - from 10 am to 10 pm.  In the halls, police officers and medical personnel are constantly on duty.  Occupations with professional trainers in the pool and gym are possible. </p><p>  Water park in Achinsk at the address: Krasnoyarsk Territory, city of Achinsk, st.  Lebedenko, 12 (former Yunost movie theater) - it‚Äôs not difficult to find, the townspeople will always tell you. </p><p>  In that case, if you are a guest of the city, it is most convenient to use 2GIS electronic cards.  Recently, Achinsk is included in this largest search engine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location of the water park in Achinsk" class="if uuid-2660717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93581/2660717.jpg"></div><p>  The aquatic center hosts themed birthdays for children, yoga and fitness classes, aqua gymnastics </p><p>  There is a cafe here, so you can not leave here at least all day.  Positive emotions are provided to you. </p>
