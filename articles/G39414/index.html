How to increase internet speed on a mobile phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In today's world, many people cannot imagine life without the Internet.  One of the advantages of a mobile device is the ability to always and everywhere connect to the World Wide Web.  However, there are cases of a noticeable decrease in page loading speed, which prevents full operation.  There can be many reasons for this, as well as solutions.  In the article, we consider the situation when the Internet does not work well on the phone. </p><h2>  The speed of mobile networks and how to measure it </h2><p>  It’s worth to clarify right away that when connected to a Wi-Fi network, the Internet works faster than from a mobile operator.  The latest 4G standard under optimal communication conditions is capable of supporting the maximum allowable speed on a cell phone from 100 to 130 Mbit / s.  On a tablet, these numbers are lower than those described in the 4G technology specification.  Many customers are unhappy with the speed of the Internet from MTS, but the above is true for such a large provider of communication services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viet-systems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internet setup on the phone" class="if uuid-3131952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131952.jpg"></div><p>  Before proceeding with the acceleration of mobile Internet, it is necessary to measure the rate of data transfer.  To do this, you can simply download a special application.  It will track the current and average value of the Internet speed in the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some mobile phones let you know this indicator online.  To do this, go to the “Settings” tab, select “System Settings” and “Notification Settings”.  Then find the "Status Bar" and activate the function "Display the current network speed."  After that, the corresponding data transfer indicator will be displayed at the top of the screen. </p><h2>  The device has low internet speed </h2><p>  Among the reasons to understand why the Internet does not work well on the phone, the following are called: </p><ol><li>  The mobile phone operates in a low-speed network (2G or 3G).  Better if it will be 4G. </li><li>  Started updating applications, systems or downloading files. </li><li>  On the phone - free internet.  As a rule, operators provide low-speed traffic as part of such a service. </li><li>  Bad network signal. </li><li>  The daily rate of high-speed traffic within the Internet tariff on the phone has been used up. </li><li>  The network is overloaded with nearby users. </li><li>  The Internet resource that the user is trying to connect to is overloaded. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="rocketspeedlevelinternet.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mts internet" class="if uuid-3131927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131927.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet speed master </h2><p>  To increase the speed of the Internet on a mobile phone, you can use this utility.  The program is one of the most popular in its category.  Its use is possible with and without Root rights.  You can configure them using special applications: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  On the Play Market or App Store, they find and download the Internet Speed ​​Master utility.  It is important that its developer is Nez Droid. </li><li>  Before starting the program, a window appears with a warning about its possible failure or acceleration of the mobile device.  If the application does not fit the shell of the smartphone, you can always delete it, so you need to click "OK" and continue. </li><li>  If the user does not have Root rights, then only one “Improve Internet Connection” button will be available in the program.  If available, select “Apply Patch” from the proposed options.  Then the device is rebooted and the speed of the mobile Internet is checked.  Even with administrative rights, you can choose the first option and the speed of data exchange will increase. </li><li>  After installing and activating the program, the mobile Internet will work as quickly as possible.  After these steps, the problem of poor Internet performance on the phone will need to be resolved.  But if for some reason the result does not suit the user, the settings can be returned to their previous state or the application can be deleted. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.ammonnews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="set up the Internet manually on the phone" class="if uuid-3131933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131933.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet booster </h2><p>  Another mobile application can help if the phone does not work well on the Internet.  The principle of operation of this program is similar to the utility described above, however, the result is slightly different: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The application is found on the Play Market or App Store and downloaded to a mobile device. </li><li>  When you open the program, a window immediately appears with a notification about the absence of Root rights. </li><li>  You must click on the round button in the middle of the screen with a zipper. </li><li>  After that, another window will appear with a notification about the completion of optimization. </li><li>  After clicking the “Cancel” and “Installation Complete” buttons, you can check the quality of the Internet connection. </li></ol><p>  If the speed remains the same, the utility is deleted so that it does not occupy the device’s memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobi-bank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone internet rates" class="if uuid-3131935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131935.jpg"></div><h2>  Disable upgrades </h2><p>  Often the Internet does not work well on the phone due to applications in the background for updating the system.  If you configure the device correctly, this problem can be eliminated.  To disable the update function, do the following: </p><ol><li>  The "Settings" tab opens, then the "Data usage" item. </li><li>  Then select the line "Background" and move the slider opposite the inscription "Enable". </li><li>  In the window that opens, a list of all applications installed on the device will appear.  Unnecessary or rarely used utilities are disabled.  Thus, they stop spending Internet speed. </li></ol><p>  If necessary, the desired application can be connected again. </p><h2>  Clear cache, change network settings </h2><p>  Consider two more methods that will help to increase the speed of mobile Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vdicommunications.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the internet does not work well on the phone" class="if uuid-3131931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131931.jpg"></div><p>  The first one is clearing the cache: </p><ol><li>  In the “Settings” tab, find the “Smart Manager” column and select the RAM line. </li><li>  A list of all programs that consume traffic is displayed here.  Near applications that are not used, the slider is turned off. </li><li>  After that, they go to the "Memory" section, where information about the occupied and free space in the phone RAM is indicated. </li><li>  The line “Unnecessary data” appears at the bottom of the window, click the “Delete” button, and then check how much space is freed up in the device’s memory. </li></ol><p>  The second method affects the Network itself.  In some cases, changing its settings helps speed up the mobile Internet.  To do this, in the main menu of the device find the tab "Mobile Networks" and select the line "Network Mode".  Among the proposed values, “Auto LTE / WCDMA / GSM” is set.  Thanks to this option, the device will automatically connect to the network with the best signal quality. </p><h2>  Removing applications and disabling images </h2><p>  Some installed programs on your smartphone use mobile traffic while running in the <span>background.</span>  To control its consumption and improve data transfer, you must turn off the background mode or completely remove unnecessary programs.  You can find them in the "Settings" tab, in the "Applications" section.  In the window that appears, uninstall or disable unused utilities.  To deactivate some applications, the “Forced Stop” key appears.  You can safely press it and not be afraid that this will lead to a deterioration in the operation of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internet speed on a mobile phone" class="if uuid-3131943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131943.jpg"></div><p>  Slowing down the mobile Internet can be caused by downloading images that, due to their resolution or size, consume traffic.  To improve the quality of data exchange, it is desirable to disable the download of images from the Web.  To do this, go to the settings of the Internet browser, find the corresponding line and disable the download of images. </p><h2>  Browser settings </h2><p>  You can optimize the functioning of programs on a mobile device without resorting to outside help or downloading additional utilities.  To do this, you need to configure the Internet on the phone manually.  One of the most popular browsers - Google Chrome - has an extended settings database, allowing the user to change them according to personal needs.  It is designed for use on a mobile device and tablet.  To set up Google Chrome on your phone, follow the steps below: </p><ol><li>  Launch the Google Chrome app. </li><li>  Go to the "Options" tab in the upper right corner. </li><li>  In the window that opens, select the "Settings" section, and then "Reduce traffic." </li><li>  Move the slider to the side until the “On” icon appears. </li><li>  After the manipulations are completed, a graph appears showing the changes in the traffic of the Android-based smartphone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.colourbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="free internet to your phone" class="if uuid-3131939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3131939.jpg"></div><p>  For users of the Opera Mini browser, the function of self-regulation of incoming and outgoing mobile traffic is also available.  To increase the speed of the Internet on the device, you need to download and install the Iite version.  With its help, sites load faster, traffic is spent more economically, while this does not affect the quality of the display of tabs. </p><p>  We hope that in the article you found the answer to the frequently asked question about why the Internet MTS does not function well on the phone.  Not always in this situation, the operator that provides mobile services is to blame. </p>
