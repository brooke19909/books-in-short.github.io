Natural attractions of the Urals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If the rest for you is associated with the sea, the sun and the beach, then the Urals is hardly suitable for these purposes.  But for those people who want to see the beautiful mountain nature, historical monuments and visit wonderful places, it is better not to find a piece on the planet.  The nature of the Urals, whose photos are unable to convey all its charm and freshness, helps everyone to improve their health, because it is not in vain that there are a lot of medical sanatoriums.  The Ural ridge is located in a unique place - just on the border of Europe and Asia.  Naturally, this influenced the formation of fauna and flora.  I must say that all the sights of the Urals (photos of some of them you can see below) can be divided into historical and natural.  In this article we will consider the most famous and popular of them, which are desirable to visit at least once in a lifetime.  So what to see in the Urals? </p><h2>  Kungur cave - a unique natural monument </h2>

If you are already in these parts, then such natural sights of the Urals can in no way be ignored.  The length of this cave is about 6 thousand meters, and they call it ice.  The fact is that even in summer it can be used as a refrigerator (local residents did just that), because the temperature during this sultry time does not rise above -3 degrees, and in some grottoes it reaches -30 ¬∞ C!  Despite such an impressive age of the cave, today there are grottoes that have not yet been studied by people, but perhaps with bats, who are permanent residents here.

It was inclined from the very beginning, as the architect had intended, but which had not settled down from time, as some have suggested.  The name of this creator is unknown to this day, but there is a legend that Demidov threw him from this very building so that he would not build the same unique tower for any other person.  This attraction has a unique room with unusual acoustics.  If, for example, you say a word even in a whisper in one of its corners, you can clearly hear it in the opposite, but it is completely impossible to understand in the middle of the room.  And to this day, not all the secrets of the tower are revealed, researchers still find skeletons, cellars, flooded stairs in its rooms.  In a word, it is not clear why Demidov built this building.  These are mysterious sights of the Urals. </p><h2>  Is Arkaim the homeland of the Aryans or not? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the southern urals" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/390895.jpg?1399441497549" width="452"></div></h2><p>  Relatively recently, in the Chelyabinsk region, the ancient settlement Arkaim was discovered, but its age, as it turned out, is approximately the same with the Egyptian pyramids.  This place has a special energy, which attracts an endless stream of tourists, among which there are many yogis and followers of astrology, psychological teachings.  To believe in such esotericism or not is up to you, but visiting such historical monuments of the Urals is simply necessary, if only for a general acquaintance with ancient civilizations.  Some scholars believe that Arkaim is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans, but at the moment there are no unambiguous facts proving this theory.  This fortified city was discovered in the late 1980s, during an expedition.  Scientists had to study the territory, since it was planned to build a reservoir there, however, the found ruins of Arkaim did not allow this project to be realized.  Today, there is a reserve, including more than 70 <span>monuments of archeology.</span>  The sights of the South Urals are not only Arkaim, but also many other places that will be interesting to visit for everyone.  These are <span>Turgoyak</span> and Uvilda <span>lakes</span> , included in the list of the most valuable reservoirs in the world, and the Iremel mountain range, which Mamin-Sibiryak once compared with a huge ship, <span>the Hadelsha</span> and Atish <span>waterfalls</span> , and much more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scribbles in the Urals - a unique sight! </h2><p>  The nature of the Urals (photos you can see here) is beauty: mountain ranges, lakes, rivers, caves.  It is really fabulous and beautiful, but such a monument of ancient art as the Ural writings is unique and inimitable!  They are rock paintings right on the banks of the rivers and occupy the territory, the length of which is more than 800 km!  Artists in ancient times applied drawings to those rocks that are located vertically or at an angle to protect art from precipitation.  It depicts people, and birds, and animals, and various geometric shapes.  Such memorable places of the Urals attract an inexhaustible flow of tourists, who are simply breathtaking from such drawings left by ancient ancestors. </p><h2>  Swim in the winter in the Urals?  This is real </h2>

The water here is not only medicinal, but also really hot - its temperature is always in the range from 40 to 45 degrees.  So in the Urals you can swim not only in numerous lakes in the summer, but also in the thermal springs in the winter.  According to experts, such water has an excellent effect on the body as a whole, and it is especially useful for people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases and ailments of the nervous system.  As you can see, the sights of the Urals are also a kind of exotic, because swimming in hot water under the open sky in winter is hardly a regular pastime.

This place is located in the Sverdlovsk region, and the paths there are trodden by pilgrims, and not only from Russia.  The nature of the Urals, the photo of which cannot convey the blessed silence of these places, is truly pure and pristine, and the birds singing is broken only by a bell ringing.

All figures presented in the park were ordered in China.  They are made of rubber, and the outward resemblance to living things is simply amazing!  Here you can see not only extinct species, but also a zebra, a camel, a gorilla, a lion.  What is most surprising - all the figures are made in full size, and they can also move and make sounds!  There is a mini-express on the territory of the park, from which the children will surely be delighted.  Animators conduct interesting excursions.  There is also a children's town, a trampoline, a restaurant, a hotel.

It is located in the <span>Chelyabinsk region.</span>  It‚Äôs almost impossible to miss the entrance to the cave, as one Lenin fan once knocked out the leader‚Äôs profile on a nearby rock.  In total there are 3 halls in the cave, the floor of which is covered with ice at any time of the year.  However, to get into them, it is necessary to overcome the grotto at the entrance, full of ice stalagmites and crystals in the winter.  Not far from the cave there is a spring with the amazing name ‚ÄúMaryina Tears‚Äù, and the water in it is very tasty and clean.  Photoshoots are often arranged here for newlyweds who are not indifferent to the picturesque nature.  Every year, at the foot of the cave, the Russian Round Dance festival is held, which you can witness in June. </p><h2>  Do not visit Taganay - do not see the Urals </h2>

If you translate the name of this mountain range from the ancient Turkic, it means "Reliance of God", the chum called this place "Stone of Light".  It is in these environs that nature presents to the attention of everyone the turquoise taiga and colorful tundra, clean and cold lake water, turbulent rivers, and picturesque edges with cranberries.  Some people come here to breathe in the unique aromas of nature that can turn their heads, others visit Taganay in search of the alluring oracles of Hyperborea, mythical lands, ancient riches.  It is in these parts of the world that there are forests, tundra, swamps, where the human foot has never set foot.  And fishermen are attracted here by exotic trout, whose scales shimmer in clear water under the sun's rays.  However, old-timers do not recommend independently mastering these lands, as they are sure that mystical power lives here, and people can disappear.  By the way, do not be surprised if you meet Buddhist monks in Taganai.  After all, they believe that Buddha stopped in the Urals.
