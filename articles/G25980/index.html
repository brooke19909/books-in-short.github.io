Many people wear jeans to holes, then they put them on at home or leave them in case of going out into the country, at barbecue, at a summer cottage.  In the article, we will offer readers another option for using old jeans, namely sewing a fashionable bag.  Basically, such a cotton bag is used in the summer or in the warm autumn-spring off-season. </p><p>  Bags from <span>old jeans are</span> easy to sew, because most of the product is already ready-made.  Often for sewing choose the upper half, in which pockets are sewn.  Some types of bags are sewn from trousers.  It is not difficult to draw a bag pattern from old jeans; in most products it is a bottom rectangle and thin strips of which the handles are made. </p><h2>  Simple flower bag </h2><p>  As you can see in the photo below, for sewing this version of the bag, the upper part of the jeans is cut, namely, the distance from the belt to the beginning of the legs is cut.  Front and rear pockets remain intact.  The bottom of the bag from old jeans can be made separately by cutting out a strip of 10 cm trouser legs. From the wrong side, you must first draw it on the front and back of the bag, and then sew it on with a sewing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fashion.allwomenstalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful jeans bag" class="if uuid-2379017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379017.jpg"></div><p>  If overlock is included in the set of paws, then all seams must be additionally processed so that the fabric does not split.  If you expect to fully load a bag of old jeans, then the bottom can be sealed by adding a strip of dense fabric.  It remains to sew the pens, which are composed of a wide strip, folded four times.  Do this so that the raw edges do not peek out.  The length of the handles can be different, depending on the wishes of the hostess of the product.  After all, bags can be worn on the shoulder and in the hands.  Seams are made on both sides of the handles.  In places of attachment to the belt, reinforcement of the seams is made on them.  The photo shows that the line has the shape of a square with a cross inside.  To bag from old jeans had a bright element, on the front you can sew a beautiful red flower made of fabric.  It can simply be sewn to the bag itself, or you can fasten it on a contrasting button color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shoulder bag </h2><p>  The next version of the <span>bag from old jeans with their own hands is</span> made similar to the previous version.  The bottom is not sewn separately, and the bottom cut is simply attached with a double seam from the inside.  The handle is designed to be worn on one shoulder, so instead of two strips, one is cut out, but long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shoulder bag" class="if uuid-2379025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379025.jpg"></div><p>  Its length can be measured on another bag.  She breaks out of her jeans leg.  A handle is attached on both sides of the bag, sewn with a similar seam.  A decorative element of a denim bag is a thin scarf or scarf threaded into the straps of a belt.  Changing the color of the insert, you can change the appearance of the bag. </p><h2>  Product with wooden handles </h2><p>  A pattern of a bag <span>from old jeans with your own hands</span> is made from two rectangles of the front and back.  To form the bottom, you need to cut a strip from the leg, the length of which is equal to the width of the bag, and the width is taken at your discretion.  However, the middle variant of the bottom width will be 10 cm. The edges of the strip can be made rounded, then there will be no corners on the bottom.  The bag itself is cut out either whole or from several parts.  You can use fabric from different pants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picmia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag with wooden handles" class="if uuid-2379078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379078.jpg"></div><p>  The combination of different types of denim looks very impressive.  One of the flaps can take the wrong side of the denim, then the piece will be almost white.  When all the flaps are assembled according to the pattern, the rectangle of the front and back of the product is cut out.  At first it is more convenient to sketch all the seams manually.  These are the side seams and the bottom.  Then work is done on the pens.  These are round wooden sticks.  They can be covered with a layer of stain, and then clean well with sandpaper and re-open with acrylic varnish.  So that the bag fits well on wooden handles, you need to sew two valves.  Four identical squares are cut out, folded in half and the back of the pocket is attached.  At the end, all four parts are attached to the top of the bag.  Sticks are inserted before work, so that they are tightly held inside and do not fall out when moving the bag. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Small strap bag </h2><p>  To make such a bag from old jeans (the photo is located below in the article), you need only one half of the pants.  Starting from the waistband, we make an incision to the end of the pocket.  You do not need to get to the fly; the pattern is done to it.  Next, two sides are sewn together - the lower and the side.  Seams are made on the wrong side of the craft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small jeans bag" class="if uuid-2379021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379021.jpg"></div><p>  The bag is small and flat.  However, all the necessary things for a woman will fit in completely there: a wallet, a phone, cosmetics, documents for a car, keys and other little things.  Even in such a small product, there are three pockets.  This is a semicircular front pocket of jeans, a square back and a little hood for little things.  To make the bag close, a button strap is sewn onto the jeans belt.  The bag in which the clasp and strap are made of leather looks interesting.  You can use an unnecessary leather bag.  Her handle is perfect for denim, and you can sew a clasp from the leather of the bag itself.  A button is best chosen metal, in shape resembling rivets. </p><h2>  Leg bag </h2><p>  You can sew a bag of old jeans with your own hands not only from the upper part of the pants, where the belt is located, but also to cut out the fabric from the pants.  Side seams are already there, it remains to bend the fabric from above so that the threads do not come out, and stitch the bottom.  The seams on the bottom of the crafts are double.  First, two legs of the leg are attached on the wrong side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.dawanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leg bag" class="if uuid-2379060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379060.jpg"></div><p>  Then, small seams are made on the sides of the bottom.  To do this, on the inside, the jeans fabric is straightened and stitched about 6 cm perpendicular to the bottom seam on one and the other side of the bottom.  Externally, the seams at the bottom look as follows: I ----- I. </p><p>  It remains to sew in the center strap with a clasp.  Such a bag is carried under the armpit, since it does not have handles.  If the master has a desire, they can be sewn on the sides of the product. </p><h2>  Woven Stripes Bag </h2><p>  If you have not yet chosen the option of how to sew a bag of old jeans, consider the following type of product.  This bag is made of strips of denim cut from the same size of pants.  In the photo below you can clearly see the step-by-step execution of fabric cutting.  First, identical strips are cut from long parts.  Then they need to be ironed with a hot iron and laid out on a flat surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stylishboard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strip weaving" class="if uuid-2379014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379014.jpg"></div><p>  Weaving is performed with alternating arrangement of strips above and below.  So that during attachment the strips do not crawl out, it is better to mark all the edges with a thread with a needle manually.  When the rectangles of the front and back sides are assembled, seams are made.  Bending of the fabric is done on top of each detail, the sides are sewn along the wrong side, like the bottom.  It remains to carve out long strips for pens.  Sew them in the same way as the first method already described earlier.  With such a spacious bag, you can go not only to the store, but also go sunbathing to the beach.  The clasp can be made at will, but in such bags they are usually not sewn. </p><h2>  Pleated bag </h2><p>  You can sew a bag of old jeans according to the pattern and the next style.  It is sewn from the extended part of the legs.  Two segments 25-30 cm long are cut off at the same level. Seams from one side are cut off to make the fabric smooth.  The same details are cut from the lining fabric according to the available patterns.  Then, all four patterns are first sewn with manual stitches, then attached to the sewing machine.  The bottom is made out as follows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pleated bag" class="if uuid-2379084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379084.jpg"></div><p>  On denim, the bottom of the pieces is sewn along the wrong side.  The lining is sewn separately and is applied inward, face up.  Further work takes place on the planks.  First, two wide strips are cut from the legs of old jeans, which are wrapped around the front and back of the bag.  Then the workpiece is rotated laterally forwards.  Seams are obtained in the middle of the future bag. </p><h2>  Pen work </h2><p>  The next stage of work on the bag consists of measuring the rim with a handle.  A long strip of fabric is cut from the trouser leg, equal to the length of both sides, plus space for pens.  The photo shows how the work is performed step by step.  The bezel is collected immediately on the bag, the raw edges of the fabric are bent inward.  Finally, a button is sewn and a loop of thick dark blue rope is gathered.  It will be a clasp for a bag. </p><h2>  Dressing jeans bag </h2><p>  When sewing this option, the bags used only the top of the jeans with a belt.  You need to cut it carefully to keep the pockets intact.  The bottom, handles and upper rim of the bag are made of bright contrasting fabric.  In our example, this is a red cloth.  We will not repeat the description of sewing.  Let's stop the reader's attention on decorating do-it-yourself crafts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jeansbagpattern.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating jeans bags" class="if uuid-2379096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379096.jpg"></div><p>  From other cotton pieces of fabric, petals and green leaves of flowers are cut out.  The middle of the flowers are made of buttons covered with contrasting fabric.  Owl is made according to the drawn patterns.  First, the front and back of the craft are cut along the contours.  Do not forget to leave 1 cm on each side at the seams.  A lace ribbon is sewn in the center of the front.  A place for the eyes is cut out of white felt.  A synthetic winterizer is inserted in the middle.  Black buttons act as eyes.  The wings are also cut according to the drawn pattern of four identical patterns.  The cooked parts are fastened with buttons.  It remains to open the legs of the bird.  Each finger is pulled by floss thread.  You can come up with your own bag decoration option.  It all depends on the wishes of the master and the age of the hostess of the bag. </p><h2>  Pattern bag from old jeans </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can sew such a spectacular bag that combines jeans cut at the top and inserts from another contrasting fabric.  The application is done on top of denim.  The schematic drawing clearly shows in what place you need to cut the jeans pants, what the pattern of handles looks like, where the inserts are located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jeansbagpattern.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim bag pattern" class="if uuid-2379098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2379098.jpg"></div><p>  One side remains virtually unchanged, and on the opposite side, the denim is replaced by a floral fabric.  On the back of the jeans, the pocket is carefully cut off with a blade and sewn onto the front of the bag.  Handles are cut out of dense canvas or raincoat fabric.  The color is chosen contrasting, but harmoniously combined with the rest of the details of the pattern. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The article describes in detail the manufacture of independently bags from old jeans trousers.  You can also use the top of denim skirts.  These things never go out of fashion, work options can be very diverse.  Here you can fantasize endlessly.  Good luck </p>
