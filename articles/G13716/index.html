This process is completely dependent on which device will be configured.  If you are using a laptop or a regular computer, you must use a network cable connection.  It can be found in the kit.  Next, connect the router to power.  The cable from the provider must be installed in the <span>WAN port.</span> </p><p>  If you want to connect to the Tenda N301 via a Wi-Fi network, you just need to turn on the device.  By default, the device is configured to distribute a factory network that does not have a password.  It will need to be installed later in the configuration process.  If you still have a password request, you must enter the numbers from 1 to 8. Sometimes, on some devices, the manufacturer sets such a code.  Thus, you can connect to the device even from a tablet or phone, then directly from them and perform the configuration.  The main thing is that the device is connected to the network. </p><p>  For those who do not know how to work with a router and do it for the first time, the main thing is to understand that there will be no Internet immediately after connecting the device.  To get the correct work with the network, you must configure the device to connect to the provider. </p><p>  In order to enter the settings of the router, the Internet is not needed.  On the computer, do not enable any connections.  But then how to <span>configure the Tenda</span> N301 <span>router</span> ?  To enter the settings you need to launch any browser and go to a special address.  It is standard and has the form 192.168.0.1.  Next, a page opens where you need to log in.  There you should enter the same character set in the column password and login: admin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sticker Options </h2><p>  It should be noted that the address for entering the panel, the factory password (if any) from Wi-Fi, as well as mac addresses are indicated on the sticker, which is located on the bottom of the device.  Next, click OK.  If you can‚Äôt get into the control panel, you need to slightly change the computer settings.  Typically, this problem occurs if the device does not automatically receive IP addresses.  As soon as this parameter is set, then access to the control panel of the router will be immediately configured.  There is also an IPTV mode in the Tenda N301. </p><p>  Next, the owner will see the main settings.  Here you can specify the type of connection, change the password, set any other parameters that are necessary.  It is advisable to open the basic settings and advanced options.  This is where the adjustment itself will be carried out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure tenda n301 router" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2163883.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Setting Up Internet Connection (WAN) </h2><p>  First you need to make sure that the Internet cable is connected to the WAN port.  This wire can be purchased either with a modem or directly from a service provider.  Next, you need to do the most important thing - setup.  You should set the parameters, thanks to which the router can connect to the Internet without any difficulty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If these <span>Tenda N301 parameters</span> are set incorrectly, a Wi-Fi network will be created without access to the Internet.  It is imperative to find out what type of connection a particular provider uses.  Next, you will need to specify data that depends on the specified parameter.  You should also check with the company if it uses MAC address binding.  If the connection is dynamic and address binding is not used, then no additional settings need to be made.  The router will automatically set the desired type of connection and the Internet will be available.  Recall how to connect the Tenda N301 described above. </p><p>  If we are talking about binding by MAC address, then in the settings, press the clone mac address key.  If this is difficult, then you can call the company itself and ask them to register new data in the settings.  Additionally, the operator will need to dictate the address of the router itself.  After that, you can proceed to configure the network itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenda n301 iptv" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2163911.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Router Reviews </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, you can make sure that all the characteristics of the device are as much as possible declared by the manufacturer.  In networks, the cost of a given device sometimes changes.  It can vary from 500 to 1500 rubles.  Many buyers note that it would be possible to install a radiator on the chip.  Then the device would work much better.  LAN ports are not designed for gigabit information, but for many 100 Mbps is enough. </p><p>  The device works freely with Smart TV, stationary, also pulls both a laptop and a computer via a network cable.  Many note that the device has never been restarted during the entire operation period.  However, there are still certain disadvantages.  Which ones?  Sometimes, customers note that when working with PPPoE mode, a connection problem occurs.  On old device firmware, sometimes there were problems with ping.  Due to the fact that there is no heatsink on the chip, the device will not be able to work with a heavy load.  There is no screen on the board. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the device cannot be installed on the wall; there is no possibility of vertical installation.  The manufacturer has stopped releasing new firmware, and on the w3bsit3-dns.com forum this device is of no interest to anyone.  Therefore, no one optimizes old firmware.  Considering that it works with two megabytes of memory, you still can‚Äôt do anything on your own with the software.  In general, the device maximally matches its value.  It is configured quickly, does not heat up, there are many options.  The manufacturer gives a 2 year warranty.  Many people recommend the device for purchase.  Do not underestimate the device, you should pay attention to it when choosing a modem. </p>
