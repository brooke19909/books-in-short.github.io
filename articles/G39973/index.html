    <h2>  Rope park </h2><p>  But for real extreme sports and outdoor enthusiasts, this park was built.  A unique place is part of the Partisan Glory Park.  Here you can have a great time, feel like a conqueror of the peaks and revive the ancient instinct for the conquest of nature!  Special cable ladders and ropes stretched high above the ground will allow you to enjoy the movement and go in for sports.  Such entertainment will suit both experienced climbers and children.  Various equipment allows you to perform tricks of varying difficulty.  Feel how it is, to go over the abyss or climb a tallest tree - this is such a unique Rope Park.  Kiev never ceases to amaze its guests with a variety of entertainments, so be sure to visit this complex.  Even if you yourself do not want to climb cable cars, there is always something to see here. </p><h2>  Shevchenko park </h2><p>  Kiev parks are very diverse, have different infrastructure and boast all kinds of entertainment.  But one of the most comfortable complexes, perhaps, can be called Shevchenko Park.  Kiev has created a real masterpiece: despite its small size, this corner of nature has become a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  The history of its creation is very interesting: it is located near the university, and when the institution was visited by the emperor of Brazil Don Pedro, he was horrified that such an unsightly wasteland, on which cows grazed, flaunted near the main entrance of the institution.  And so this square came into being, which was laid back in 1890. </p><p>  The famous gardener Karl Christian very skillfully approached the arrangement of space.  He was able to create a park that harmoniously connected with the botanical garden and emphasized the greatness of the university.  Two alleys merged into a duet in the center of the park, and in 1896 a monument to Nicholas the First was erected here.  Walking paths were decorated with sculptures made of white stone, they delighted the eye with their purity and grace.  But in 1920, the Soviet government considered them a hotbed of vulgarity and destroyed. </p><p>  And only in 1939 a monument was erected here to the great writer Taras Shevchenko. </p><p>  The main attraction is a unique fountain in the form of the Black Sea.  The park has become a favorite place for amateurs, real tournaments are unfolding here. </p>
