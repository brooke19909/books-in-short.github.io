Let's start with the question of what to do when you need to upgrade, but there is no money to buy a top-end smartphone for 2 SIM cards?  In fact, there are many options.  In addition, if you approach the choice wisely, it becomes clear that most of the capabilities of modern top-end smartphones are simply not used.  It is for such situations that HTC has released several available models. </p><h2>  First impression </h2>

    <p>  The new devices of the company are so well made that you can‚Äôt immediately determine whether the top gadget is in your hands or a representative of a budget class.  In most cases, it turns out that the smartphone looks much more expensive than it actually is.  This also applies to the development of HTC Desire 400 Dual.  The device is created in the style of the latest models of the company: a rectangular shape and almost imperceptible slots for speakers.  By the way, this has changed the design of the smartphone for the better.  Think of the Desire V or SV models.  However, the Taiwanese company surprised not only the appearance of the device.  And now this is not about technical specifications (we will talk about them later), but about the color under the cover - acid-green.  Look at it once - and you are in a good mood for the whole day, even if today is Monday.  Although this is just a trifle, but still nice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design Details </h2>

The dimensions of the device will be convenient for most users - 131.8 x 66.9 x 9.9 mm with a weight of 123 grams.  Thanks to this, you can hold and control it with one hand.  For example, answering a call, scrolling through a feed on social networks, etc. For the rest, you will have to use both hands: reply to a message, work on the Internet, view notes.  The reason for this is sharp corners - if they were slightly rounded, typing would be much more convenient.  Although you can get used to it in a couple of days.

For example, when you click on the sides or back cover, a creak appears.  Although the fastening of the latter is just excellent: even when you need to insert a SIM card, you need to make enough effort.  The wealth of materials is also pleasing: the front glass is protected with a metal frame, soft-touch plastic (which, incidentally, is considered the most pleasant among all existing).  In addition, he keeps a good appearance for a very long time.

Because they are almost completely recessed into the case, and finding them by touch is very difficult.  So get ready to suffer this week or two.  The rest of the components are familiar: on the bottom there is a microUSB and a microphone, on top there is a headset jack, a power button and a notch to remove the back cover, on the right there are volume keys, and on the left there is nothing at all.  On the back cover of the HTC Desire 400 Black smartphone, there is a camera with a flash in a corrugated frame, a company logo, another trademark (this time BeatsAudio) and a speaker slot.  Most of the front panel is occupied by glass, under which there is a 4.3-inch screen.  Under the display are touch buttons, and above it is another company logo, as well as proximity and light sensors.  Ergonomics can get used to very quickly, although the mechanical creaks of the device are annoying.  Nevertheless, the HTC Desire 400 Dual Sim phone looks much more expensive than requested in stores, which pleases buyers.

The screen was manufactured using Super LCD 2 technology and has maximum viewing angles.  He also received a sufficient supply of brightness, which is enough even for operation in direct sunlight.  Although the minimum value I want a little less - in the evening and at night it hurts my eyes a little.

Yes, it‚Äôs inconvenient for video calling, although it‚Äôs like someone.  For example, often users have a front camera on their smartphone, but they practically do not use it.  So it is individual for everyone.  The main camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Yes, this is not a record, but it is enough for a good picture or for HD-video (provided that there is sufficient lighting indoors or outdoors).  Therefore, during the purchase you need to consider this.  Also, you must understand that the photos will be a little noisy, and to make a clear frame the first time also does not always work.  Thus, if the quality of pictures is one of the decisive factors when choosing a smartphone, this model is not for you.  If video calls are important to you, also pass by.

    <h2>  Specifications and autonomy </h2><p>  Although the users of smartphones with two SIM cards do not need an exorbitant hardware, I don‚Äôt want to watch attempts to launch any application either.  Unfortunately, HTC does not yet know about this.  Perhaps that is why they installed a 2-core NovaThor U8500 processor with a clock frequency of 1 GHz, 1 GB of RAM and 4 GB of internal memory.  And if the last 2 parameters are pleasing, then the first is somehow a bit old.  It is worth noting that 4 GB can be supplemented with a memory card.  In general, the HTC Desire 400 smartphone works more or less, but hangs a little during switching between applications.  The same applies to games - only undemanding ones will start normally (after all, the Mali 400 Mp graphics).  Nevertheless, you can play an hour or two in Cut the Rope. </p><p>  The built-in OS is Android 4.1.1 with the proprietary HTC Sense.  Please note: shell version 4+.  In addition, the company is unlikely to release an update.  Of course, this does not please those who are used to using or experimenting with the latest versions, but the smartphone was created for a different category of users.  The battery capacity (1800 mAh) is enough for a whole day, and in some cases for two. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  I was pleased with the presence of two radio modules in the smartphone, so you are really constantly in touch.  But the presence of mechanical creaks and backlashes returned us from heaven to earth.  Yes, and the software in it is outdated.  But on the other hand, the smartphone has a beautiful design, beautiful display, good sound and excellent materials.  Thus, this model for those who value reliability is an ideal solution.  In addition, if you take into account its price (only $ 260), then you will probably purchase this particular device. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2>

For starters, the good.  In general, the phone is considered quite successful in its price category.  It is called unusually thin.  Praised for comfort while in the hand.  Some reviews refer to the fact that the device has a very harmonious metal edging of the case.  Music lovers emphasize its good sound.  Users recognize the responsiveness of the screen as decent, as well as the battery life.  Praise has been achieved and excellent viewing angles.  Some people are happy even the lack of unnecessary pre-installed software.  A number of comments say that the presence of two radio modules is a fundamentally correct decision by the manufacturer.  The good sides also include the quality of communication and the operation of GPS.  Let us also pay attention to the reviews of those who purchase a smartphone for active creation of images, they say that the camera is excellent and it fully realizes the full potential of the sensor's capabilities of 5 megapixels.  Also noted is the high quality of plastic and the speaker.

    <p>  Among the shortcomings, they often mention insufficient build quality, the operating system, frequent reboots when activating a wireless network.  Also, a weak battery, overheating are recorded in cons.  Some users are unhappy with the lack of a front camera and a branded case in the kit.  Often it is called short-lived, but it depends on the intensity of use.  Some users think that the display is unreasonably small.  In general, we can conclude that this is not an entirely appropriate entertainment solution, but ideal for work. </p><p>  Speaking briefly about HTC Desire 400, its characteristics are as follows: platform - Android 4.1, classic case, touch control buttons, micro SIM card (two working simultaneously).  Dimensions 66.9x131.8x9.9 mm, weight 123 grams.  Screen - touch multi-touch.  Diagonal 4.3 inches, resolution 800x480 pixels.  The function of automatic screen rotation is implemented.  5 megapixel camera, complemented by flash and autofocus.  Video recording is carried out with a maximum resolution of 1280x720 pixels in MP4 format.  Audio capabilities are represented by an MP3 player, FM radio.  There is also a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.  Among the interfaces are USB, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, as well as GPS satellite navigation technology.  There is also a dual-core processor at 1000 MHz, 1 gigabyte of RAM and 4 built-in. </p>
