The vast majority of its buildings are painted in various shades of blue or blue.  Brief information about the city, a photo of Chefchaouen (Morocco) will be presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.civitatis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Morocco Chefchaouen City" class="if uuid-2955673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955673.jpg"></div><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The city of Chefchaouen (Morocco), the photo of which can be seen in the article, was founded in 1471 by an emir who came from Andalusia named Moula Ali-bin-Moussa-bin-Rashid al-Alami.  The city was to serve as an outpost on the path of a possible invasion of the Portuguese.  Earlier on the site of Chefchaouen, the ‚Äúblue city‚Äù, in Morocco, a small Berber settlement was located. </p><p>  After the Granada decree of 1492, signed by the ruling royal couple of Spain, also called the Alhambra Edict, all Jews were to be expelled from Spanish territory if they did not accept Christianity.  Many of them, as well as Muslim Moors left the country, in large numbers moved from the province of Andalusia and settled in Chefchaouen.  This relocation of peoples gave a new impetus to the development of the city.  Thanks to the new inhabitants, he acquired the appearance characteristic of the <span>Spanish province.</span> </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="BuWL-pq-QH0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=68&amp;v=BuWL-pq-QH0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/4/9/7/11497.jpg"></div><p>  Since the city has been considered a sacred place for several centuries, its appearance has practically not changed.  The first European to examine him at least partially was the monk, African explorer Charles-Eugene de Foucault.  He arrived in Chefchaouen in Morocco at the end of the 19th century and lived there for some time, posing as a rabbi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result of the long-term so-called ‚Äúfight for Africa‚Äù between the imperialist countries of Europe, the protectorate over Chefchaouen in 1906 was established by the Spanish government.  Thanks to this, the city became accessible to non-believers and gained fame.  50 years later, in 1956, after Morocco gained independence, this was the last city to fly the Spanish flag.  Here, many still know Spanish, and tourists from this European country arrive in Chefchaouen (Morocco) in large numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelwithjennats.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen morocco" class="if uuid-2955693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955693.jpg"></div><h2>  Location, how to get </h2><p>  Chawen (Chefchaouen) in Morocco is located on the slopes of the Reef Mountains (Air Reef).  This administrative center of the province of the same name Morocco is located in the northwestern part of the country.  Geographical coordinates - 35 ¬∞ 10‚Ä≤17 ‚Ä≥ s.  W, 5 ¬∞ 16‚Ä≤11 ‚Ä≥ W  d. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.168796" data-lng="-5.268364099999985" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/4/9/8/11498.png"></div><p>  Due to the mountainous terrain, there is no railway connection here.  According to tourists, the easiest way to get to Chefchaouen in Morocco is by bus from Casablanca, Tangier, Fez or Rabat (from two to five hours).  They run daily.  The ideal option is to travel by car, but if for some reason it is not available, you can rely on bus services in Morocco. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen morocco photo" class="if uuid-2955678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955678.jpg"></div><p>  The Jews who settled in this small town painted houses in blue - divine, in their opinion, color that reminded the inhabitants of Chefchaouen of heaven and God.  This tradition has become so rooted over time that it has become decisive in the appearance of the city, so it has gained popularity among tourists.  The tiled red-brown roofs of the houses contrast with the walls, which generally creates a very picturesque picture.  There are not too many attractions as such in the city, but, in fact, it is all a large museum exhibit that you can simply wander around while looking at the buildings.  It is especially picturesque in April-May, when it is time for flowering. </p><p>  The center of modern Chefchaouen is the square of Mohammed V. Not far from it there is a market, transport parking.  A walk from here to the old town can be reached in 10 minutes (from the bus station - 20).  You can navigate through the town thanks to two mountain peaks - Megu and Tisuka.  To them, according to legend, Chawen (in the lane - ‚Äúhorns‚Äù) owes its name.  On the opposite side of the city are valleys that go down to the coast. </p><h2>  Kasbah Museum </h2><p>  This small fortress museum is readily visited by tourists.  Entrance here costs only 75 rubles.  In the museum you can climb the tower and admire the views of the city and the Reef Mountains.  You can go down to the dungeon dungeon.  There is a small collection of national costumes, but visitors complain that the exposition is framed only in French and Arabic.  The real pearl of the museum, according to tourists, is the garden.  Once here in the midst of the flowering of jasmine, you will get an unforgettable experience.  In general, 10 minutes is enough for inspection. </p><h2>  Medina </h2><p>  A walk through the old city will bring an unforgettable experience.  According to tourists, this is an ideal place for bloggers and photographers.  Incredibly juicy shades of old houses fascinate, make you forget about everything in the world.  Almost every house has unique, specially decorated doors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pinosy.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://pinosy.com/media/340795896795867456/"><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen blue city in morocco" class="if uuid-2955676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955676.jpg"></div><p>  In Medina, life goes on, crowds of people walking do not distract anyone from business.  There are numerous shops and markets, workshops of artisans.  Here you can buy souvenirs, for example, all kinds of dyes, beautiful fabrics, carpets, as well as dresses, scarves and jellabs - traditional Berber clothes, which are a long bathrobe made of wool or cotton, with a pointed hood.  Near the famous source of Ras Al-Maa, beyond the gates of the Medina, which supplies the whole city with water, things are still being washed, as they were many centuries ago.  There are mills and arched bridges across the river. </p><p>  Tourists recommend arriving in Chefchaouen to stay here for a few days and stay in the Old Town, in one of the many traditional houses, in order to imbue the spirit of this unusual place.  It will also provide an opportunity to stroll around Medina in the early morning, avoiding the heat and collision with many tourists.  Arriving in Chawen only for one day, it is better to do this not on the day off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen city morocco photo" class="if uuid-2955689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955689.jpg"></div><h2>  Religious buildings </h2><p>  One of the hiking trails leads out of town to the hill where the Spanish mosque is located.  It got its name because it was built by the Spaniards as a sign of tolerance for the faith of the indigenous people.  It was subsequently destroyed by a lightning strike, but is being restored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conversanttraveller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen morocco attractions" class="if uuid-2955687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955687.jpg"></div><p>  The main mosque of the city is located on the main square of Place Outa el Hammam &amp; Kasbah, but non-Muslims can only admire it from the outside.  Representatives of other faiths are not allowed to enter it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eyeflare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chefchaouen morocco photo" class="if uuid-2955684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19126/2955684.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels and restaurants </h2><p>  The city has many <span>hotels, mini-hotels</span> and hostels for every taste.  The top five, according to traveler reviews, include Casa Sabila, Casa Perleta, Lina Ryad &amp; Spa, Riad Assilah Chefchaouen, Dar Echchaouen.  In these places, the optimal ratio of price and quality.  There is free Wi-Fi, breakfast is included. </p><p>  Where to have lunch or dinner for a tourist in Chefchaouen in Morocco?  You can explore the sights of the city in one day, but if you want to stay here longer, this question will certainly arise.  Tourists recommend visiting for this purpose the main square of the city - Place Outa el Hammam &amp; Kasbah, where there are many cafes and restaurants.  In them you can both have lunch and dinner, or just have a cup of coffee.  Particularly distinguished are the reviews of Cafe Restaurant Sofia, Restaurant Beldi Bab Ssour, as well as Pizzeria Mandala.  Although the latter of them offers Mediterranean (Italian) cuisine, it may be worth choosing other restaurants to try authentic Moroccan dishes. </p>
