  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Semantic analysis of the text - the basis of the quality of the article</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A high-quality article is not just a literate and unique text, designed in the same style, it must be optimized for indexing by search engines.  And also a really good text should be easy to read and allow the recipient to easily understand the essence of the problem. </p><p>  It may seem to many that writing an article that ideally meets all of the above requirements is a matter of five minutes and does not require much effort.  But the reality is that most novice journalists and copywriters have to work hard to achieve a good result.  The essence of the problem is that only the article that has undergone a deep semantic analysis can be called quality.  This concept includes comparing the presence of a specific list of indicators with acceptable standards.  If the indicators do not exceed the permissible limit, the article can be considered successful. </p><p>  The first indicator is the so-called ‚Äúwater‚Äù.  This concept includes that part of the text that has little to do with the essence of the issue or problem raised in the article and does not carry any special semantic load.  The maximum limit of ‚Äúwater‚Äù in the text is 40%, otherwise it will be simply uninteresting and meaningless.  But, of course, it is also impossible to do without it, otherwise you risk getting a dry and complex text.  However, there are copywriters who intentionally achieve such dryness in order to give credibility and scientific character to the text. </p><p>  The <span>semantic analysis of the text</span> also includes such a concept as ‚Äústop words‚Äù.  This category includes conjunctions, prepositions and other words-connectives that are not recognized and not perceived by search robots.  When working, it is necessary to take into account that ‚Äústop words‚Äù are necessary, but their number should be no more than 5% of the content of the article. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main indicator in the analysis of the text is its "nausea".  It is necessary to refuse it, as such articles look illiterate and unreadable.  From the very first sentences, a real reader is able to get unpleasant impressions of the text.  This indicator includes tautology, which is striking.  Within the norm, the indicator of "nausea" of the text should not exceed 10%. </p><p>  For true copywriters, semantic <span>keyword analysis is</span> also important <span>.</span>  They are the basis of any optimization and are simply necessary for website promotion using articles.  In modern search engines, there is already a special type of search - semantic.  It is a technology designed to determine what exactly the user wants to say when entering certain words in the search bar.  The basis for the semantic search system is directly the meaning of words. </p><p>  This technology determines how the words in your query are related, and also takes into account their location and other parameters. </p><p>  Let's look at a small example: you used a search engine from a smartphone in search of a service.  The semantic analysis of the word, which is the key in your request, allows you to determine your approximate location and produce results that are suitable for you based on the data received. </p><p>  There is also such a thing as a <span>semantic core.</span>  It includes the analysis of the task and the creation of so-called ‚Äúrequest masks‚Äù, that is, a list of phrases by which the project will advance.  When creating a ‚Äúquery mask‚Äù, it is necessary to conduct a semantic analysis of the main words directly related to the topic of the article being promoted, and list the synonymous and common phrases. </p><p>  After that, for each individual ‚Äúmask‚Äù it is necessary to select the mid-frequency and low-frequency queries.  Be sure to also take into account jargon and borrowing from other languages, which allows you to maximize the number of possible key phrases.  The lexico-semantic analysis of the word in this case will be especially useful, since breaking the word into components helps to search for words with the same or similar meaning, which can also be used in the semantic core. </p><p>  The last stage is the exclusion from the list of too rare and inappropriate requests. </p>
