Making a plan for walking around this city is very simple, because the sights there are on almost every street.  Some of them deserve special attention. </p><h2>  Lindenhof, or the best view of Zurich </h2><p>  Sights of the city include not only architectural monuments.  Lindenhof, which is translated into Russian as "Linden Yard", is also definitely worth a visit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zurich - Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/371805.jpg" width="500"></div>  This beautiful place is located in the city center, on a hill.  It offers a magnificent view of the Limat River, and in good weather you can see the Alps.  In addition, the towers of Grossmunster and other beautiful buildings of Zurich will be visible.  To get to Lindenhof, you need to go from <span>St. Peter's Basilica</span> towards the station.  Sch√ºssel-Gasset Street will lead straight to the right place.  From the station you can get to the hill by turning right to the big Rennweg street.  After a while, you will need to turn right again, this time at Fortunagass, and soon you will find yourself in Lindenhof.  If you want to see the surroundings of the city, you should climb a higher hill.  Mount Uetliberg is perfect for you, which can be reached in twenty-five minutes from the central station.

This is a very beautiful place where it is easy to feel the spirit of the city.  In summer, there are plenty of vacationers, musicians and clowns perform, and swans are so tame that they can easily go for a treat themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zurich - attractions, photos" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/371806.jpg?1397203419379" width="600"></div>  The lake has an original Granite ball, which anyone can easily rotate.  This is one of the most unusual sights of the city.  Water that smooths the friction during rotation enters the form containing the ball.  Not the worst place to relax is the Limmat Embankment.  There is a bar nearby, there is a volleyball court, so here you can meet not only tourists, but also many locals.

    <h2>  Squares of the city </h2><p>  If you are interested in financial Zurich, you should look for sights on Paradeplatz.  It is here that the representative offices of the main state banks are concentrated.  In addition, there is a famous cafe on the square called ‚ÄúConfiserie Spr√ºngli‚Äù.  Many tram lines stop at Paradeplatz, and the Bahnhofstrasse shopping street, where many boutiques and shops are located, starts nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zurich sights on the map" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/371811.jpg?1397204185582" width="600"></div>  On Tuesdays and Fridays it's worth a walk to the Burkliplatz square.  It opens a farmer's market, where you can buy fresh flowers or fruits, as well as try Swiss delicacies.  On such a day you can see a calm, cozy Zurich.  Sights, the photographs of which are amazing, surround these squares and the street, so that even going for vegetables, you can see the historical architecture of Switzerland.

In many European cities there are such corners of antiquity in which narrow streets and buildings that have not changed for several centuries have been preserved.  In Zurich, you can find houses that are more than ten centuries old, and people still live in them.  An interesting fact is also associated with them.  Before Napoleon came, the locals gave the houses names, not numbers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zurich sights: description, photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/371812.jpg?1397204332886" width="600"></div>  The French invaders could not memorize complex German words and numbered the buildings in their own way.  This numbering has been preserved to this day.  Zurich, whose sights are quite diverse, can boast of ancient Roman baths.

    <h2>  Famous churches of the city </h2><p>  Of course, many tourists are interested in seeing medieval religious buildings.  Three of them are considered the most famous: Grossm√ºnster, St. Peter's Church and Fraumunster.  Construction of the first began in the twelfth century.  Grossm√ºnster belongs to the Protestants and is closely associated with the history of the formation of this religious movement.  It was here that Ulrich Zwingli, a priest, wanted to reform the church.  The college of theology founded by him eventually became the basis of the University of Zurich.  Thus, it is quite fair to call Zurich the center of the Reformation.  Attractions associated with this also include a museum where you can visit excursions in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand climb the towers, from the height of which you can see the surroundings of the city. </p><p>  The crypt and capital of the church, the bronze doors of Munch's work and the church choir deserve no less attention.  Fraumunster begins its history with the year 853, once it was a convent, and in the thirteenth century it even minted coins.  It‚Äôs worth visiting the church for the sake of the stained glass windows of Marc Chagall.  Finally, you can look at the oldest temple in Zurich.  St. Peter's Church has more than a thousand years of history, but only in 1880 did bells appear in it.  An amazing attraction is the local clock, the largest in Europe.  They were installed in 1538.  Finally, fires were previously monitored from the high tower of the church, and at the first sign of smoke a special flag appeared from the window. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zurich, Switzerland: Attractions" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/371813.jpg?1397204562867" width="550"></div>  The signal began to be transmitted differently only in the twentieth century, when phones turned out to be a more convenient way of communication.

    <h2>  Cultural Zurich </h2><p>  <span>Switzerland, the sights</span> and masters of art of which are known throughout Europe, attracts many tourists precisely because of its culture.  For example, the Zurich Opera House is one of the best, and the Drama is not inferior to it.  Schiffenbau showcases contemporary productions.  The very premises of this theater deserve attention - it is made in a neoclassical style and is surrounded by busts of composers and writers.  In addition, in the warm season, on the streets of the city you can also see performances of various kinds.  Therefore, Zurich, the sights of which can satisfy the most demanding taste, will surely appeal to everyone. </p>
