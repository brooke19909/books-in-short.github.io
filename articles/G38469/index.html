  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting - Bootees for Toddlers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most pleasant expectation in life is the expectation of the birth of a new man.  The moral preparation of parents for birth and the purchase of children's furniture, a stroller attached to a newborn are connected with this moment.  Many future mothers and grannies try to do some things with their own hands, rather than buying them in stores.  Moreover, items of own production are often more interesting and original. </p><p>  Women especially like a process like knitting.  Booties are the simplest little things for cute babies, so mom can knit them with her own hands.  There are many different ways to make these soft slippers: crochet and knitting.  Even that question of <span>how to knit booties</span> on knitting needles has a lot of different solutions.  For example, you can knit on five needles.  Booties in this version can be performed according to the pattern of socks, with subsequent decorations in the form of design with special finishing seams of the sole and upper part of the lift. </p><p>  But there is a second way to knit booties on five knitting needles.  You need to start the execution of this model from the sole.  For its manufacture so far only two knitting needles are needed.  First, 7 loops are dialed, and 1 loop is added to each row by double-knitting the last hem.  So knit 4 rows until 11 loops are formed in the row.  They usually knit the sole with the sole.  When the desired size is reached, in the row you should make a decrease at the beginning and at the end.  This algorithm is repeated 2 times, as a result, the initial number of loops remains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we proceed to the set of loops for three more knitting needles, so that the knitting of the booties is located on four knitting needles, and the fifth would be working.  To do this, on the rim of the sole, you need to type 7 loops on each of the three knitting needles.  If suddenly it turns out that the right amount is typed, and the rim of the sole is still not fully used, then you can get extra loops, evenly placing them subsequently on all knitting needles.  You should record the number of loops so that knitting the booties with the left does not differ from the manufacture of the right, otherwise slippers can be of different sizes. </p><p>  The next stage is the design of the welt or boot height.  It consists in knitting so many rows in a circle of the sole so that the boot height is 3-4 cm. The first row should be tied with purl loops to highlight the sole. </p><p>  Then comes the most difficult stage - <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  directly lifting.  This step involves knitting on two knitting needles.  It is necessary to highlight the front 7 loops on one spoke.  In each row, you need to knit 6 stitches in the usual way, and knit the last loop together with the adjacent loop, which must be transferred to the working knitting needle.  After this, the knitting is deployed and knitted in the opposite direction by the same algorithm. </p><p>  This should be done until the moment when on all knitting needles 7 stitches are left.  Then the knitting goes back to circular.  Now you can knit with an elastic band or transfer it to crochet.  If you have the skills to work with this simple device, then you will be able to tie beautiful openwork lapels that easily turn booties into over the knee boots.  The ankle can be wrapped around a cord or sewed from the inside out with an elastic band.  Only you should be very careful not to squeeze the baby leg too tight: booties should only be easily held on the leg, and not tightened tight on the ankle! </p><p>  But some mothers do not know how or simply do not like knitting on 5 knitting needles.  For them, you can offer a description of the method, telling <span>how to knit booties</span> on two knitting needles.  A simple model of such booties consists of two parts, which subsequently need to be sewn with a sewing needle.  The first part is the sole.  About the method of its manufacture was described above. </p><p>  For the second part, the main one, dial 40 loops and knit 3-4 cm. Then, carefully select 6 loops in the middle and knit only them, at the end of each row after knitting the main 6 loops, knit the next two loops together.  Thus, the bow part of the booties is obtained. </p><p>  When 30 loops remain in the spoke together in the hem, the rows begin to be knitted to the end.  This will be a knit lapel product.  It can be made of any size.  After closing the loops and ending the knitting, the <span>edge loops are</span> sewn together, and the sole is sewn to the extended end.  Booties can also be decorated with pompons or bows, embroidery or appliqu√©s.  Do not forget about the ties! </p>
