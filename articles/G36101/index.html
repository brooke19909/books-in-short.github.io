    <h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Balaklava stretches for 42 kilometers along the western part of the southern Crimean coast.  The city is located near Sevastopol, on a rare spit, in the valley "Big Bay".  A special aura reigns there, riddled with riddles and romanticism.  Famous Russian writers and poets rested and worked in Balaklava: Chekhov, Kuprin, Pushkin, Bunin, Tolstoy, Green and others.  Centuries changed, and they fell in love with the city more and more, giving him literature and filling it with historical light. </p><p>  Balaclava - what is it?  The legendary city.  It was first mentioned in ancient myths when the ship of Odysseus arrived on the shores of Tauris and anchored in its harbor.  Since then, stories about the exploits of the Argonauts have been walking along the rocky coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most romantic region of the Crimean peninsula </h2><p>  An invisible Balaclava border runs between Cape Sarych, Laspi Bay, <span>Cape Ayia</span> and Boteleman.  Many temples were laid back in the Middle Ages.  Eastern European temples first appeared on the outskirts.  There is evidence that in one of the Balaclava estates, the first Pope Klymene I received martyrdom.  In different years, Balaclava was called "Little London", "Chembala" and "Yabole." </p>

    <p>  Many are interested in the question: Balaclava - what is it?  The answer is different for everyone.  For some it is a storehouse of sights and natural beauties;  someone loves her for her serenity and mystery, while someone writes poetry and prose about her.  It seems that time froze there for centuries over the majesty of the <span>Genoese fortress.</span>  Five hundred years have passed since the development of Balaclava.  Since then, the Turkish sultans, Mongol princes and Messrs. Theodora have sunk into oblivion.  And England is still grieving about the event that happened on October 13, 1854, when the entire British army was laid on the battlefield of Balaclava. </p><h2>  Holidays in Balaclava </h2><p>  Balaklava is a contender for the title of the most popular Crimean resort.  This place is loved by tourists and yachtsmen due to the wonderful scenery, clear sea and historical sights.  The name of the city is translated as ‚Äúfish bag‚Äù, because its life is directly related to fishing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You should know, going here on vacation, <span>Balaklava (Crimea)</span> is located in one of the calmest bays of the Black Sea.  That is why this place was chosen by yachtsmen.  The water depth reaches 17 meters.  There are practically no storms in Balaclava. </p><p>  It will also be interesting to know that earlier the base of submarines was located under the bay, and now it is a museum.  Due to the abundance of luxury yachts moored along the coast, Balaklava was nicknamed the Crimean Monte Carlo, but so far the resort does not have such developed infrastructure as in the capital of Monaco. </p><h2>  The main attractions of the city </h2><p>  Holidays in Balaclava should begin on pebble beaches.  When you get tired of basking in the sun, be sure to visit the main attraction - the ancient <span>fortress of Chembalo,</span> which can not be ignored.  Unfortunately, today only ruins are left of it, which are literally riddled with history.  It should be noted right away that getting to Chembalo is not easy.  The fortress rises on Mount Kastron.  If you want to admire the magnificent scenery, you should conquer it. </p>

    <h2>  What to visit? </h2><p>  A beautiful view opens from the promenade bearing the name of Nazukin, where you can often see strolling tourists in the evening.  The social life of the whole city is concentrated there.  You can visit expensive restaurants, fun bars, a movie theater or a yacht club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is impossible to keep silent about the famous Balaklava Bay, which is surrounded by grottoes and mountains.  It is protected from heavy storms thanks to the winding fairway and mild climate, which is close to the Mediterranean.  The duration of the swimming season is five months.  Not far from Cape Ayia are the "golden" and "silver" beaches.  So they were called by the locals.  Tourists love Ayia, because it is located near the city and is famous for the magical beauty of the majestic mountains and relict pines. </p><h2>  Former submarine base </h2><p>  Opens the Balaclava submarine museum for every tourist.  This is a unique place that you can talk about endlessly.  At the entrance you can see a stunning view of the bay, inside which once was a <span>military base</span> of submarines.  They represented the power of the Soviet fleet.  And now along the promenade you can see luxury yachts lined up in a row.  The road to the museum extends along the metal bridge and goes deep into the cliffs.  The entrance is unremarkable.  From a distance you can see concrete columns with a canopy.  Against the background of numerous construction sites, he does not stand out. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion </h2><p>  You have the opportunity to visit the tour, which runs every hour.  Its cost is 130 rubles.  If you wish, you can inspect the entire room yourself.  Inside the museum are stands with descriptions for each model of the submarine.  You can also admire the paintings on which Balaclava flaunts.  The submarine museum begins with a platform located near the bridge.  There is a large poster that remains from the time of the Soviet Union.  The door is masked by a stretched fabric that creates a masonry effect. </p><h2>  How did the museum appear? </h2><p>  The opening took place in 2003 on the territory of the top-secret base of the anti-nuclear facility.  It was intended for carrying out dock repairs of submarines of the fleet of the Soviet Union.  The construction of the facility was carried out in such a way that the structure could withstand the direct hit of an atomic bomb within a radius of 50 kilometers. </p><p>  The museum can be divided into two parts, in the middle of which there is a water channel.  On the right is a <span>hydraulic structure</span> where you can see mines and torpedoes, and on the left is an arsenal of 820. </p>
