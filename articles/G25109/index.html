    <h2>  Anapa Hotels with a Private Beach </h2><p>  The most populated in the summer are hotels that have access to the sea and the beach.  Among them there are large, designed for hundreds of tourists, and small, comfortable hotels, which are very nice to relax from the hustle and bustle.  Almost all Anapa hotels are located in close proximity to the sea.  The maximum distance is 300 meters.  Most of them offer visitors organized meals, room cleaning, video surveillance, security, a cafe.  Many have their own saunas and baths, spas, hairdressers, massage rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All hotels in Anapa have their own specifics.  Some of them were built in the resort area, and some on adjacent private territories.  The first have a well-developed infrastructure.  Their star level ranges from 3 to 5, which in itself speaks of the quality of service.  Private hotels most often have only the minimum set of options necessary for relaxation: refrigerator, TV, air conditioning, Internet, organized meals.  They usually do not have room service, a pool, a sauna, massages and spa treatments, a cafe or a restaurant.  Private hotels are most suitable for a quiet family vacation.  Another disadvantage of such hotels is that they are usually located at a considerable distance from the sea. </p><p>  All Anapa hotels are located near sandy or rocky beaches.  When choosing a future vacation spot, this also needs to be considered.  For children, it is better to choose hotels near which there is a clean sandy beach.  Pebbles are more suitable for lovers of swimming and diving in clean water. </p>
