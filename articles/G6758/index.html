    <p>  Italy itself is a very rich country.  An incredible number of animals are found here, natural landscapes are stunning with their beauty, and rare species of fish live in the Mediterranean.  Speaking specifically about the town of Portofino, then it is a nature reserve, which gathered all the <span>natural beauty of</span> Northern Italy.  Walking in a local national park, you can meet the most diverse Mediterranean plants, look at the inhabitants of these latitudes, and also see the most valuable architectural monuments that played a key role in the development of European history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portofino on a map of italy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/292785.jpg" width="389"></div>

Italy and France intersect approximately in the region of Liguria, so all the villages that are here have absorbed the traditions of two countries at once.  On the one hand is the large city of Genoa, where you can go for shopping or just for a walk.  On the other hand, beyond the French border, there is a chic Nice - a place of concentration of luxury hotels, cottages and the most expensive restaurants. </p><p>  If you look at Portofino on a map of Italy, we can assume that it is in the summer that the climate here will delight everyone.  The temperature is kept within +25 ... + 30 <sup></sup> , the amount of precipitation is minimal, and the sun warms those who are here every day.  There is no heat here, since a light cool breeze always blows from the sea.  In winter, this resort can be visited just to see the local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy portofino tours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/292786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth saying a few words about the cuisine of Portofino.  Italy is a country where seafood and fish are at a premium.  Amazing salads are made from small sea inhabitants here, and they also provide everyone with dishes of fried fish of different breeds.  Of course, eating in this region, you can replenish your vitamin supply as much as possible - here all dishes are seasoned with aromatic herbs, and pine and walnuts are attached to them.  Do not forget to order delicious wines to such exquisite dishes.  Dry white - the main horse of Portofino. </p><p>  Italy in the past centuries was the Roman Empire, so many antique architectural monuments are still preserved on its territory.  You can examine them literally in one day, and at the same time amazing churches, monasteries and chapels that were born here during the Middle Ages.  All other buildings in the town are low residential buildings, which Italy is famous for. </p><p>  Portofino, tours of which are sold at any agency, is one of the most amazing cities in Europe.  It is small, but at the same time it is very peculiar and colorful.  Various parties are held here, boutiques are opened and all tourists are welcomed with open arms. </p>
