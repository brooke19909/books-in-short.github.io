This legal system has the following form: first a normative act, then a precedent.  That is, an act not described in the legislative framework of the state is not a crime.  And in general, Ancient Rome had a huge impact on our world.  Take the same Latin, the actual variations of which are many West European languages.  However, today we‚Äôll talk a little about another phenomenon that has come to us from Antiquity in a somewhat modified form.  And his name is the people's stands.  Let's talk about this in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  What are folk stands? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that at first the kings ruled Rome, then the consuls - the actual dictators, and then the system completely changed to the imperial one, there was always an element of democracy in the political system of Ancient Rome. </p><p>  The people's stands are an elected position among the plebeians.  He was engaged in the protection and patronage of the humiliated and offended.  The Latin word by which the tribune called its authority is sacrosancta potestas, which means "power received by spiritual sanctification." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of this post dates back to the most ancient conflict of the patricians - the descendants of the first Roman kings - and plebeians, i.e., ordinary <span>inhabitants of Rome.</span>  Initially, only patricians were represented in the Senate, while the plebeians did not have the opportunity to be elected there and were in fact in the position of the lower class.  However, despite legal restrictions, some people from ordinary people were so rich that they overshadowed (as for property) noble gentlemen, thereby increasing their influence in aristocratic circles.  Also sometimes plebeian riots broke out in Rome, which led not only to mass casualties, but also to temporary economic decline due to the devastation caused during the uprising. </p>

    <h2>  How did the rostrum appear in Rome? </h2><p>  In order to prevent constant bloodshed, under pressure from the plebeian community, the Senate was forced to establish a post of the people's tribune, elected by the "plebeians from the plebeians."  This had a huge impact on the whole system, on the whole of Ancient Rome.  The people's stands could veto decisions of the Senate, which, in his opinion, infringed the plebeians, had the right to judge persons who insulted the <span>honor and dignity of</span> ordinary people, and also had personal inviolability.  Thus, after some time, through the efforts of the plebeian community, through such statesmen in the Senate, the decision to equate the estates was lobbied, however, even after that, the people's tribunes did not cease to exist.  He began to deal with the affairs of ordinary citizens: the poor, peasants, and poor artisans, regardless of their origin.  The Latin word by which the national stands was named among its clients is patronum, which means "protector".  The election for this position was held in two stages: first, each chicken commission selected its own candidate, and then applicants were selected at the level of the tribute commission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Modern echoes of the social institute of folk tribunes </h2><p>  The principles by which the people's stands worked are now embodied in the civil institute of human rights.  For example, in many countries, including Russia, there is an ombudsman authorized in this area, whose duties include protecting and monitoring the observance of human rights by the state.  Thus, he does what the tribunes of the people did in his time.  However, the powers of the modern Ombudsman are significantly reduced in comparison with the ancient Roman figure: he cannot veto, does not have immunity, and does not have the right <span>to initiate legislation.</span>  Its only function is to control state bodies and, in case of non-compliance with human rights, initiate a trial, that is, the so-called judicial initiative.  By law, the Ombudsman is not subordinate to any of the branches of government: neither legislative, nor executive, nor judicial. </p>
