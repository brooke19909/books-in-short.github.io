In Belarus, which is already used to living in the world of millionaires, such changes made a splash.  Even after six months after the announcement of the denomination, when the old money should finally be withdrawn from circulation, many continue to count as they used to for many years.  So what kind of new <span>Belarusian money are they?</span> </p><h2>  What changed? </h2><p>  To begin with, the samples of new money in Belarus were developed long before they were put into circulation - the banknotes themselves were already printed in 2009 and locked in secure vaults.  As part of the denomination, four zeros were cut off, that is, if in old bills the minimum denomination was one hundred rubles, now it‚Äôs one penny. </p>

    <p>  For Belarusians who had not previously used coins, such innovations were not a very pleasant surprise: not only did they have to change their wallets (after all, there were no special branches in old purses), there were also automatic machines, ATMs and other machines that even used to accept the most small bills, not reconfigured for cents.  It is also worth noting that even the acquisition of new wallets did not help people adapt to new money, but more on that later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Yes, new money in Belarus, unlike old ones, is more reminiscent of European than Soviet.  Moreover, denominated rubles (that is how the new currency was called in the country at a time when it still coexisted with old money) was even criticized for their excessive similarity to the euro. </p>

    <p>  A separate plus was the fact that Belarus retained the concept of depicting historic buildings on new banknotes, although now, with a reduction in the number of denominations of paper money, some sights had to be abandoned.  Each region of the republic has been immortalized on banknotes, and not only famous places, but also those whose image evokes positive associations among Belarusians, were chosen as symbols. </p><h2>  Missed projects </h2><p>  Of course, there were those who wanted to see completely different new money in Belarus.  Photos of possible options for banknotes appeared on the Internet even a year before the denomination.  Many offered to put portraits of famous Belarusians on <span>paper money</span> , it was true, however, about who deserved to represent the country on its banknotes: some turned to fighters for Belarusian statehood, others turned to rulers of different eras, and others turned to scientists and artists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another interesting concept that has never been implemented is the use of images of old household items and jewelry that would remind people of their roots.  The third option suggested reorienting banknotes, that is, making them not horizontal, but vertical, in the manner of Israeli or Swiss currency units.  The most radical of all that has been proposed is the renaming of the currency into thaler, in the manner of the currency of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, depicting on banknotes people who gave their lives for the sovereignty of the state. </p>

    <h2>  Protection system </h2><p>  Before being put into circulation, no one could say what new money would be in Belarus.  It was known that in their manufacture new protection technologies were used that would make it almost impossible to counterfeit <span>banknotes.</span>  On banknotes there are special signs in the form of geometric figures, by which visually impaired people can recognize the face values.  In addition, a special method of strengthening the corners was used, thanks to which the bills will be more resistant to abrasion, which could not be said about the old-style money.  Another difference is the change in the pattern: not abstract patterns are visible in the lumen, but the building depicted on the bill.  From the traditional, the following has been preserved in what the new money of Belarus looks like: firmware with a special tape embossed with the acronym NBRB (National Bank of the Republic of Belarus).  It is also aimed at improving the protection of the bill against counterfeiting. </p><h2>  Coins </h2><p>  But the most anticipated and anticipated <span>new money</span> in Belarus is coins.  Eight denominations were issued - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 kopecks, 1 and 2 rubles.  You can divide coins into three groups: red (the smallest, the ornament applied to them is a sign of wealth and prosperity), yellow (10-50 cents with an ornament symbolizing vitality) and silver (to be more precise, the ruble coin is completely silver, and two-ruble - silver with a wide golden edging; the applied ornaments indicate freedom and freedom). </p>

    <p>  However, despite the originality and unusualness, today, six months after the introduction of new coins, it is difficult to say how these samples of new money in Belarus will look in five to ten years.  The fact is that coins of small denominations are made so unsuccessfully that it is difficult to discern what is written on them for a young man, not like the one who sees poorly.  In addition, the denominations are very quickly erased, and the small coins themselves are corroded.  As for the two-ruble coins, which the republic is so proud of, it turned out that when a very small force is applied, the coin easily splits into two components - all this clearly does not contribute to the popularization of new money among the population. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  Yes, the time has already passed when people wondered what new money will be in Belarus.  Photos of price tags that didn‚Äôt have the usual zeros, at first incomprehensible conversions between old and new money, which baffled even those who are good at mathematics, all this has already subsided. </p>

    <p>  Starting January 1, 2017, six months after the official introduction of the 2009 model notes (this is why the adjective ‚Äúnew‚Äù next to them sounds so paradoxical), the use of old money ceases and its withdrawal begins.  The population is given another five years to completely get rid of obsolete monetary units and finally get used to how the new money of Belarus looks. </p><h2>  Attempts to understand </h2><p>  What changed when new money appeared in Belarus?  Photos of banknotes immediately after the denomination were flooded with the Internet, for which a whole flurry of jokes fell on the country about long-forgotten banknotes with images of animals nicknamed ‚Äúbunnies‚Äù (they were popular in the mid-nineties). </p><p>  Has the financial well-being of the population changed?  No, on the contrary, from the country of millionaires, Belarus has turned into a camp where a person can receive the entire salary in several bills. </p>

    <p>  When there was talk about what new money will be in Belarus, the photo of the bill, the face value of which is equivalent to 50 dollars, it was surprising to speak of a bill of 100 and 250 dollars (although it should be noted that the bill is not available to the general public).  For people who are used to the fact that ‚Äútwo rubles‚Äù (which was what 2000 old rubles used to be called) is a tenth of the dollar, now the stable ‚Äúdollar - two rubles‚Äù sounds a little even encouraging.  In addition, due to the confusion with prices (especially at a time when it was possible to calculate and receive change both with new and old money), the state was able to increase them unnoticed by the population.  It‚Äôs easier to say that new money in Belarus, despite the fact that it pleased the eye, brought more difficulties and problems.  And perhaps this is all a temporary phenomenon that will disappear when the state finally gets rid of old money in its mind. </p><h2>  PS </h2><p>  Today we already know the answer to the question what will be the new money in Belarus.  It remains only to understand whether they will bring the country the very benefits for which those who released them advocated. </p>
