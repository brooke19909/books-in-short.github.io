This city is geographically related to the province of Han Hoa.  A trans-Vietnamese highway passes through it.  From the resort to the capital of the country - about a thousand kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden lotus hotel nha trang" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1127370.jpg" width="430"></div>  The hotel itself is a tall and narrow ten-story building with a bright red-yellow facade.  It takes only 5 minutes to go to the nearby beach (in Vietnam all beaches are communally owned). Some reasonable distance from the sea has its advantages: the rooms in the hotel complex are less noisy and more calm.  The hotel complex enjoys a good reputation among tourists and travel agencies as a solid economy-class hotel.

    <h2>  Recommendations for tourists </h2><p>  However, for those who arrived at the hotel, some general recommendations taken by us from the reviews of Golden Lotus Hotel Nha Trang (Vietnam) guests are not out of place: </p><p>  - Refrain from traveling during the rainy season (December to February). </p><p>  - Have a sunblock with a protection factor of at least 30. </p><p>  - When walking the streets, do not carry bags, cases, etc. It is better to have a backpack.  Cunning Vietnamese thieves on the run, or even on a motorcycle, snatch everything that can be taken from their hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - For tourists who want to enjoy the nuances of Vietnamese cuisine, it is advisable to bring with them the usual medications that help with indigestion (activated charcoal, smecta, etc.). </p><h2>  In a hotel </h2>

They are divided into Standard, Superior, Deluxe, Twin, Family. </p><p>  Rooms at Golden Lotus Hotel Nha Trang are furnished and renovated in a classic economy-style minimalist style.  Before checking in, guests should make a deposit.  There is a necessary set of furniture: beds, wardrobe, bedside tables, two chairs, a coffee table.  The room provides appliances: air conditioning, hairdryer.  A safety deposit box and a minibar are also provided for a fee. </p><p>  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  By purchasing a tour and moving into the room, the guest can use the hotel infrastructure.

They are fully used by guests of the Golden Lotus Hotel Nha Trang.  Reviews of beach lovers are extremely positive regarding the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãa nearby beach: convenient sand entry into the water, warm, gentle South China Sea, etc., etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden lotus hotel nha trang reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1127420.jpg" width="600"></div>  The second healing factor of Nha Trang is therapeutic mud and mineral water, more precisely, therapeutic procedures with their use.  They even treat people with chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system.

    <p>  Famous massage salons Nha Trang.  According to the guests, the best of them is Our Russia.  The massage therapists Niyin and Fo simply work wonders. </p><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  It is not for nothing that Golden Lotus Hotel Nha Trang guests prefer to buy a tour with breakfast only.  The abundance of nearby inexpensive restaurants turns Nha Trang into a real gastronomic paradise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden lotus hotel nha trang vietnam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1127415.jpg" width="600"></div>  Moreover, the closer to the sea, the more expensive the food.  Therefore, we strongly recommend eating on the third or fourth line.  So cheaper with a similar quality of food.  On average, a Japanese restaurant check is $ 15, an Italian restaurant - $ 18, a dinner of freshly prepared seafood - $ 24.

    <p>  Almost all the guests find their food options, and, we assure you, they rarely coincide.  Nevertheless, starting from the reviews of guests, we can recommend, without embarking on long trips, to buy semi-finished exotic dishes, bring them to a hotel restaurant and ask them to cook individually.  Thus, at a price of $ 10, guests can freely pickled pickled seafood of their choice: shrimp, squid, oysters, mussels, shells, crabs, all kinds of fish. </p><p>  Cheap, tasty and satisfying cooked in the restaurant "Sailor", the owners of which are former Russians. </p><h2>  Shopping in Nha Trang </h2><p>  The shopping formula in Nha Trang comes down to the market dollar / dong rate, determined on the basis of this proportion: $ 100 is approximately equivalent to 2.1 million dong.  The prices of goods at this resort are relatively low. </p><p>  The guests of Golden Lotus Hotel Nha Trang 2 * are advised to buy clothes here: silk, leather, bamboo, cotton.  The price here is three times cheaper than the one we are used to.  A wonderful thing can be bought for $ 40-50.  Leather products are generally cheap: a wallet - $ 10, a bag - $ 15! </p><p>  Cheap souvenirs are sold at Cho Dam market.  Moreover, one should bargain there, knocking down the price at least three times.  Very beautiful wood products, all kinds of caskets.  You can buy crocodile leather products relatively cheaply.  (Fortunately, these animals are not uncommon here, and are even widely used as food). </p><p>  Those who wish to make a more expensive purchase are advised to purchase pearl jewelry from jewelers. </p><p>  It also makes sense to buy coffee and tea.  They are quality and cheap in Vietnam.  Taxis in Vietnam are inexpensive.  Payment is made by meter.  On average, the price per trip ranges from 1 to 5 US dollars. </p><p>  Even cheaper you can travel around the city by bus 4 (ticket price - 7 thousand dongs). </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Guides in Vietnam introduce tourists to the traditional attractions of Tiam Cham Pagoda and San Bong Bridge, Thong Mountain of Unique Shape, Yangbei Waterfall, the unique natural complex of Yen Island, and the city of Dalat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel golden lotus hotel nha trang" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1127413.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tourist who has landed in <span>the Golden Lotus Hotel</span> Nha Trang, every time he looks out the window, is attracted by the chic resort complex ‚ÄúWinperl‚Äù located on the coastal island.  Guides urgently invite him there, convincingly advertising their services.  Finally, the tourist agrees, along with the guide and the group overcomes this distance, and then regrets.  It's not about Winperl: he's really great.  The point is the organization of excursions. </p><p>  Often, guides recruit a group and bring it to the island only closer to dinner.  Moreover, they objectively do not have enough time to link lunch with attractions.  As a result, tourists only have dinner, while realizing that they only got to know Vinperl by 15%.  Judge for yourself.  At their service: </p><p>  - many rides; </p><p>  - A huge, one of the best in Asia, water park; </p><p>  - A comfortable white sand beach in the Bounty style; </p><p>  - dolphinarium, where seals are also given by seals; </p><p>  - Mermaid show enriched with laser effects; </p><p>  - The most interesting oceanarium; </p><p>  - ultramodern 4D cinema; </p><p>  - Singing Fountains. </p><p>  Thus, the best option for enjoying Winperlom (according to tourists' reviews): having agreed, unite two or three families and independently get by cable car to this chic resort complex by its opening.  Moreover, the impression will be complete if you get acquainted with its infrastructure gradually, in two or three days. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to some experienced tourists - guests of the Golden Lotus Hotel 2 <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang),</span> Europeans who get to know Asia for the first time are more comfortable initially visiting Nha Trang (Vietnam), and then Pattaya (Thailand). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden lotus hotel 2 vietnam nha trang" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1127366.jpg" width="430"></div>  Their reasoning is not without logic.  In Vietnam, <span>cultural shock</span> from the presence of transvestites and obsessive prostitution, fried scorpions, beetles and all sorts of larvae is not so felt.
