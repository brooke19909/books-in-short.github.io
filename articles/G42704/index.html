It is visited annually by millions of tourists.  Almost every Petersburger with a Schengen visa has ever been to this northern Scandinavian capital. </p><p>  The first information about this wonderful city appeared in the middle of the thirteenth century.  The territory developed very quickly and became one of the most popular and respectable settlements in Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cozy streets of Stockholm" class="if uuid-2251693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2251693.jpg"></div><p>  Not everyone knows that Stockholm is the place where famous corporations are based.  Among them are Swedbank and H&amp;M.  And the Nobel Prize committee since the beginning of the twentieth century sits here. </p><p>  In addition, Stockholm is full of attractions.  By right, this settlement is often called the capital of all of Scandinavia and the pearl of Europe.  By the way, local residents like to make fun of the fact that the city is mostly composed of water.  Indeed, many cruise liners arrive and sail to the Baltic Sea daily.  Due to this, residents of central Russia can visit Sweden inexpensively, because huge ships are constantly plying from St. Petersburg and several cities in Finland, and the price for such a trip is quite affordable. </p><p>  In addition, you can get to Stockholm by plane.  There are several airports in the city, but all of them are far away from the village.  The largest of these is Arlanda Airport.  In this article, you will learn about Stockholm Arlanda Airport and how to get to the city in the most convenient way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Arlanda Airport </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mastercard.veryvip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arlanda Airport" class="if uuid-2251679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2251679.jpg"></div><p>  The airport appeared in the region in the mid-twentieth century and was initially used to train pilots.  By the early sixties, Arlanda began to take flights, and in 1962 there was a large-scale opening.  By the way, the name was awarded as a result of the competition. </p><p>  The terminal is the largest in all of Sweden.  Interestingly, all airports are very far from the village.  Stockholm Arlanda Airport is located forty kilometers from the city.  More than eighty airlines from all over the world fly out of it.  Compared to other airports in Europe, it can be called medium in size.  There are thirty boarding gates, as well as ninety terminals for check-in before the flight.  Of course, in addition to everything, there is also Duty Free, where passengers waiting for their flight can enjoy shopping.  If you need to apply for Tax-Free, then this is also done here.
