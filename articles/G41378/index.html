It is noteworthy that this version comes out a year after the release of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 smartphone. </p><p>  Until this day, there was no model phone with a platform from Mediatek, which was released in August last year, so the Indian version is called in principle - Redmi Note 4. In the Russian Federation, as in European countries, this phone will probably be on the shelves of specialized stores be called Redmi Note 4X.  In this regard, buyers have a logical question: which smartphone is better - Redmi Note 4 or Redmi Note 4x?  What is their fundamental difference? </p>

    <p>  When comparing Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4x, we will try not only to give answers to questions about which smartphone is better based on the beliefs of autonomy, saving battery power and other fundamental parameters.  The main goal is to determine whether such a difference in value is justified.  Which is better - Redmi Note 4 or 4X?  Maybe add a few thousand and buy Redmi Note 4, or prefer an older option with a smaller display size and more moderate internal characteristics? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hardware component of models </h2><p>  Let's continue the comparison: <span>Redmi 4x or Redmi Note 4?</span>  To begin with, we note that the smartphone of the fourth version operates on the Snepdragon 626 motherboard. This motherboard meets all modern technical parameters, although it is not the most productive option, but it stands out from the competition by its balanced characteristics. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone was produced according to the standards of 13 HM-technology.  Thanks to this component, the device can work for a long time without recharging.  When activating the latest and capacious applications in the weight category, the phone‚Äôs body does not heat up.  This model is also pleasing in terms of performance.  With simple and standard functions, the smartphone does an excellent job.  The fact that the phone copes with modern 3D shooters at high graphics settings also confirms the level of good productivity. </p><h2>  Smartphone motherboard Redmi Note 4X </h2><p>  This model operates on a different motherboard from Qualcomm's manufacturer - Snapdragon 420. The main differences between the two platforms lie in the technical process of manufacturing the device and the core frequency of the platform.  The Snapdragon 420 motherboard was produced according to the standards of 20 HM process technology, so this smartphone is more prone to overheating.  To get out of this situation, the company's technical specialists made the clock speed of the motherboard core 1.2 GHz lower.  That is why this model will be a little slower in the speed of reproducing tasks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Device Graphics Adapter Feature </h2><p>  Speaking about the graphics adapter of two smartphones, it is worth noting the actual equality.  The standard fourth version of the model is equipped with Adreno 505 graphics, and the more recent version of X - 506 with a graphics adapter.  Choosing Redmi Note 4 or Redmi Note 4X, we can lean towards the first model from Redmi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is better redmi note 4 or 4x" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2033328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Due to the higher processor clock speed, this smartphone performs much faster than its opponent.  Which is better - Redmi 4 Prime or Redmi Note 4X?  For this parameter, it is better to choose a four. </p><h2>  The internal components of Redmi devices </h2><p>  Some features of both smartphones have already been affected, namely: </p><ul><li>  The motherboard of the smartphone 4 is Snepdragon 626, and the option 4x has Snepdragon 420. </li><li>  The technical processor of the first device is 13 HM, the second model has 20 HM. </li><li>  The number of cores on both devices is 8. </li><li>  4x RAM - 2 or 4 GB LPDDR2 930 MHz, and 4 - only 2 GB LPDDR2 930 MHz. </li><li>  The memory of the X-model phone is 32 or 63 GB + a built-in microSD slot for a memory card, and the usual fourth is 16 GB + a built-in slot for a flash card up to 150 GB. </li></ul><h2>  Hardware Findings </h2><p>  So, when analyzing the internal characteristics, choosing a smartphone Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 or 4X, we will give preference to the second option.  A special positive side of this smartphone is that it operates on 2 and 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB or 64 GB of internal memory.  And for the rival of the fourth Redmi model, only one kit is available with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory.  In the framework of today's technologies, such indicators, frankly, are quite small and inefficient for a smartphone.  This is especially manifested in the sense that if you have several applications running on your device at once, the smartphone will cause frequent crashes and freeze. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Phone Screens </h2><p>  This characteristic will be easier to consider using the example of the same two models.  On these smartphones, even with an unprofessional look, you can see significant differences.  The Redmi Note 4 gadget is characterized by a five-inch IPS screen with a resolution of HD 720 by 1280 pixels.  However, such indicators today cannot demonstrate the fullness and clarity of the image.  The screen will be able to give only 295 ppi pixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi note 4x or 4 pro" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55843/2027918.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The phone screen of the X-version of Redmi in this case is also not very good.  The display here is slightly larger - 5.7 inches, the optimal image resolution in this model is 1930 by 1080 pixels.  The sparseness of the image can reach 400 ppi, which is slightly higher than that of the competitor, but only slightly reaches the average values.  For convenience, both icons, text, shades, and so on, are clearly visible on both screens.  Which is better - Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x or 4 Pro?  The average user is unlikely to see differences that would really "cut the eye." </p><h2>  Image quality based on smartphone specifications </h2><p>  Image quality is an integral part of a modern smartphone, wondering which is better - Redmi 4 x or Redmi Note 4x, you need to pay special attention to this parameter.  User reviews indicate that the image on the Redmi 4 model is good, the display brightness reaches about 480 nits.  Consequently, a contrast ratio of about 1,500: 1 is possible - this is an indicator of many market leading brands. </p><h2>  In which smartphone model is the camera better? </h2><p>  Considering these models, one can notice the relative similarity in this parameter.  The camera for the two models of smartphones is the same - thirteen megapixels with phase autofocus.  The gadgets in question also have a panoramic mode in HD quality.  The difference can only be seen in the aperture of the lens of the device.  The smartphone of the fourth version has focus with f / 2.3 indicators, and the new X-smartphone has f / 2.0.  It should be noted that the lower this indicator, the better the shooting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="redmi 4x or redmi note 4 comparison" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2033325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the camera is the fundamental function of the phone for you, you very often plan to take pictures and require good image quality, then you need to focus on gadgets with indicators from 6 to 8 megapixels and, of course, higher.  A special place today is occupied by the front camera.  It should have indicators higher than 4 megapixels, just such an option will be quite suitable for making video calls in Skype and good pictures from the front camera.  A phone with a good camera should also be equipped with several photo modes, autofocus and a good flash. </p><h2>  Conclusions on the characteristics of the camera </h2><p>  Thus, it is safe to say that with shooting in these devices, everything is fine, especially in daylight.  The pictures are bright, intense, with a good moving spectrum and a clear translation of color shades.  The only minus is a small detail of objects both in the fourth standard version and in the Pro model.  Critical deterioration of shooting occurs in poor or insufficient lighting - immediately aggravated by the already not differing detail, there are many noise effects when shooting video.  Landscape shooting is also not happy, although the comparison of frames is stable.  A 5 megapixel front camera for these indicators removes well. </p><h2>  Comparison of smartphones by autonomy </h2><p>  When comparing the batteries of smartphones, you can see the perfect parity - 4200 mAh for both phones.  Customer reviews suggest that both devices can withstand up to five days without additional recharging, which is a very impressive indicator by current specifications.  With continuous operation in standard applications, the phone‚Äôs charge lasts about 15 hours - that is, the active screen creates a large load. </p>

    <p>  Which phone to choose - Redmi Note 4X or Redmi 4 PRO?  The battery is the same.  Therefore, if for you the ability to hold the battery for a long time is the key when choosing a smartphone, you can safely purchase any model - Redmi 4 or Redmi Note 4x. </p><h2>  Smartphone operating system </h2><p>  Both smartphones operate on the basis of the sixth Android with proprietary firmware from MIUI 8.0.  Therefore, we advise you to purchase these models only in specialized stores, since this version of the firmware is often tried to fake, which, of course, will negatively affect the performance of the device. </p><p>  Fans of compact smartphones are advised to stay on the standard fourth version.  In size, it is much smaller than the model of a new competitor.  The case of both phones is made of high quality metal and very well equipped.  It is worth noting that both devices are quite similar in appearance; their design will be liked even by modern users who are legible in this regard.  The equality of smartphones can be noted in terms of network parameters.  Redmi devices operate at WI-FI 2.5 GHz, but do not work on 6 GHz networks. </p><h2>  So what is still better - Redmi Note 4 or Redmi Note 4x? </h2><p>  When deciding in favor of one of the models, it is worth starting from the device parameters that are significant for you.  If good performance is important for you and working immediately in a dozen programs on a smartphone, then you should buy a new phone model.  If you can well be content with standard applications and working on the Internet, you can purchase the fourth version, provided that its resolution of 720 px suits you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="redmi 4 prime or redmi note 4x" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2033333.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the end, it is worth saying that if the buyer is unable to choose which characteristic in the phone is most important for him, what order of use is suitable for the client, you should not skimp and add a few thousand to the cost.  In this case, it is better to purchase Redmi Note 4x.  The cost of the new smartphone model is fully justified (the first model will cost the user $ 145, and the X-version will cost 155 cu).  For a surcharge of only $ 100, you have: a larger amount of internal and external memory, an excellent display with a good size and Full HD resolution, one of the best economical and non-heating processors. </p>
