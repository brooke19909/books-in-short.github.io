There's an answer!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Relatively recently, an invention of technology such as a smartphone quickly burst into our lives.  Now there are many manufacturers of "smart phones", but the most famous company for the production of such gadgets is Apple.  Her smartphone is called the <span>iPhone (iPhone).</span>  "What it is?"  - you ask.  This article is dedicated to the answer to this entertaining question. </p><h2>  First generation iphone <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone what is it" class="if" height="491" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/317778.jpg" width="346"></div></h2><p>  The presentation of the first Apple smartphone took place in the summer of 2007.  The phone caused a real storm of emotions, because it was a revolutionary invention: <span>Steve Jobs</span> approached the matter in a very creative and original way.  He was the first to introduce touchscreen, which made the iPhone popular.  Almost everyone knows what a touchscreen is today, but still recall: this is a function of enlarging an image by moving the screen with two fingers.  This phone had everything: a great camera, good memory and <span>screen resolution.</span>  However, there was one drawback: the lack of support for 3G networks, which caused a flurry of criticism and ‚Äúflying stones‚Äù.  But, in spite of everything, the gadget managed to gain the trust of users, and six months after its release, no one asked a question, hearing the word "iPhone": "What is it?" </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Talk about iPhone 5 </h2><p>  Please do not be surprised why such a sharp transition was made from the first modification immediately to the fifth.  The thing is that for the next four generations, iPhone developers have remained very conservative: the same 3.5-inch screen, only the 3G network was added from the new generation networks, and, of course, the classic look.  But the next generation of the phone - iPhone 5 - appeared in Moscow shortly after it entered the world market, earning immediately the respect and trust of fans of new products in the world of technology.  IPhone 5 has broken all the old stereotypes: a new 4-inch high-resolution screen, an incredibly powerful processor, a revolutionary camera and three speakers have appeared, which made the sound clearer and more voluminous!  More specifically, this is a dual-core Apple A6 processor, an 8 megapixel camera with a five-element lens that allows you to take stunning pictures, replacing the camera on ordinary walks or even when traveling. </p>

    <h2>  Weight, video and price </h2><p>  As for the video, it began to possess the face recognition function exactly as in the photo.  The front Face-Time camera can record video in HD, as well as take better photos than on previous versions.  It is worth noting that the iPhone 5 dramatically dropped in weight, despite the fact that it began to have a larger screen diagonal: compared to 4S, its weight decreased by 28 grams.  Also, a useful innovation was the increase in phone runtime: from 6 to 8 hours on 3G networks.  All this creates a completely new iPhone 5. You probably breaks out of curiosity: <span>how much is iPhone 5?</span>  The price is considerable - $ 700, but using this phone, you will immediately notice how the money spent immediately begins to pay for itself. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone 5 in Moscow" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/317774.jpg" width="600"></div>  To summarize </h2><p>  IPhone is a revolutionary invention in the world of cellular communications.  It is still in full swing.  This is addressed to him by all the emotions of users and critics.  An invention that has tremendous success.  We hope that if you are now asked the meaning of the word ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù - what is it, you can answer without hesitation! </p>
