  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Second-hand iPhone purchase: rarely-written verification methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Buying a used iPhone is an option for people who want to save money.  There are many devices on the secondary market, among which may be lost or stolen smartphones, so you should check your iPhone before buying from your hands. </p><p>  When buying from an iPhone, the most common checks are the appearance, Apple ID, IMEI, Touch ID, sensor, screen, camera, battery charging cycle, whether the device is locked.  However, popular methods can be supplemented by others that are rarely written about, but they are effective. </p><h2>  Apple ID Verification </h2><p>  When checking a used iPhone, it is important to check the device‚Äôs binding to Apple ID.  The smartphone may not have external defects, be original and serviceable, however, when you block it, using the device is impossible.  When checking the iPhone, you should check if the Find iPhone feature is disabled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iPhone Feature" class="if uuid-2319435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319435.jpg?1519084754"></div><p>  If this option is enabled, then it is impossible to restore to factory settings or reset the settings.  Before buying a smartphone, the seller must log out of Apple ID. </p><p>  This method of checking the smartphone before purchase is not reliable.  The Apple ID may be empty, however, the phone may be locked in Iklaud, so before purchasing a smartphone, you should check for a lock in the Activation Lock section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Activation lock" class="if uuid-2319439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319439.jpg?1519084754"></div><h2>  Check IMEI </h2><p>  Each iPhone has an international identifier for mobile equipment - IMEI.  The main way to check IMEI at the moment is to dial the combination * # 06 # on the phone.  You can find out the iPhone number in the phone‚Äôs settings, and then check it on the official Apple website. </p><p>  <span>The serial number of the</span> smartphone is contained in the SIM card tray, on the device packaging, in its case (up to model 6S).  When purchasing a device, it is necessary to verify the IMEI with the number indicated on the SIM card tray.  In addition, this element of the device must match the color of the case.  If the color of the tray is different, then you should refuse to buy a phone, since its case has been replaced.  This is also indicated by the mismatch of the IMEI contained on the case and tray. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="IMEI on iPhone SIM Card Tray" class="if uuid-2319440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319440.jpg?1519084754"></div><h2>  Camera check </h2><p>  When buying a smartphone, it is important to check the photographic modules, for this you need to take a photo, a photo with a flash, record a video to check sound quality and braking, record slow motion video.  With the original device, the camera does not work late in the process. </p><p>  Checking the flash consists in turning on the flashlight or using this mode in photography.  The iPhone also has three microphones.  To check one of them, you need to record video with sound, when checking the second microphone, you need to start Siri.  To test the third microphone, you must connect the device to the Hands Free wireless headset. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone Flashlight Check" class="if uuid-2319442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319442.jpg?1519084754"></div><h2>  Checking calls, messages </h2><p>  Before buying a smartphone, you need to check the sound quality, for this you should call the purchased iPhone.  If you hear a quiet sound, you need to turn up the volume.  If the problem is not resolved with a full sound indicator, the speaker is malfunctioning. </p><p>  When you purchase a smartphone, you need to check whether messages are sent, for this you need to send any character to your number.  If SMS was not sent, then a possible cause of the problem is a modem malfunction. </p><p>  If you run FaceTime on the device, then it is possible to check the health of the camera, speaker and microphones.  It is also necessary to check the operation of the device using headphones. </p><p>  Your smartphone should not have an Apple ID in iMessage or FaceTime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Check iMessage iPhone" class="if uuid-2319441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319441.jpg?1519084754"></div><p>  One of the risks when buying a used iPhone is that the smartphone may be blacklisted by operators.  Blacklisted phones have unpaid contracts.  In this case, it is highly likely that the device can be subsequently blocked, even if it works properly after the purchase, since there is a regular exchange of lists between operators in which IMEIs are displayed. </p><h2>  Checking the originality of the screen </h2><p>  Before purchasing an iPhone, you should check the screen, including the detection of dead pixels, which are reflected in the form of white dots on the monophonic screen of the included gadget.  When checking the reaction speed of the display, it should be noted whether there are problems with the reaction to touch. </p><p>  The original iPhone screen is different from the Chinese counterpart.  So, when you press on the original protective glass of the smartphone, rainbow stains and other defects do not appear.  If the screen is easily pressed when pressed, then the acquisition of the device should be abandoned, since over time the non-original screen may come off.  A distinctive feature of the original screen is its polarization: white colors are transmitted without the pink shades that are characteristic of fake displays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone aftermarket" class="if uuid-2319443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77691/2319443.jpg?1519084754"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even a detailed check of the iPhone does not give a 100% guarantee that the device is not malfunctioning or there will be no problems when using it later.  For those who do not want to take risks, there are safer options for purchasing a smartphone - in companies that sell used equipment (for example, GOODBUY provides a guarantee from the store when buying used devices). </p><p>  If you are still willing to take the risk, then when buying an iPhone with your hands, follow the recommendations described above. </p></div></article>
