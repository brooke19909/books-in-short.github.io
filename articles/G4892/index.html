    <h2>  At risk </h2><p>  Especially often this is committed by young girls and women who by no means want to spoil their stylish hairstyles.  Although very in vain, since real hypermarkets offer a huge number of fashionable winter accessories for every taste and color. </p><p>  And those who bypass the shops can knit an interesting hat on their own.  This is not difficult to do, and by adding various embossed patterns, you can get something completely unique and exactly suitable for you.  Moreover, a knitted hat with a braid has always been and remains popular. </p><h2>  Home workshop </h2><p>  If you decide that a hat with a braid is exactly your option, then you can start to make it.  Do not worry in advance, since you can not imagine how simple this process is. </p><p>  First you need to find out the purpose of the headgear.  If you will wear it in the fall, you should not choose thick yarn with a 90% content of fluff or wool.  Threads with a sufficient acrylic content are best suited.  And if, on the contrary, you make a product for socks in winter, then <span>thick yarn</span> will be indispensable - the more wool, the better.  In the case when your choice has stopped on thin threads, it would be better to stock up with a couple of balls to tie a warm lining. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Endless list </h2><p>  Let's move on to the materials that our hat with a braid requires: </p><ul><li>  Yarn or thread that we have already talked about.  It is best to take yarn in advance and with a margin, since the unexpected absence of it in the store is unlikely to please you.  You can not worry about color, as the choice is huge.  Even if you live in a small town, then you have at your disposal a huge number of online stores that are always happy to help. </li><li>  Knitting needles or hook.  This choice also depends only on you, but we can say with confidence that it is better to knit the winter version of the cap with braids.  The fact is that then the product turns out to be more refined and stretching than the one created by the hook. </li><li>  Various knitting things, like row limiters or an automatic counter. </li><li>  Scheme hats with a scythe.  In most cases, it is universal, because thanks to a stretching elastic band at the base, it can be worn on anyone.  If you still could not find the desired circuit, then you can use only the patterned fragment from it.  In our case, this is a scythe. </li></ul><h2>  How to fit a hat with a slanting knitting needles </h2><p>  It is best to distribute all actions in stages to facilitate the process of understanding: </p><ul><li>  To grasp the head 55-56 centimeters, you need to dial 88 loops on the needles.  It is very important for further knitting hats so that there are only an even number of them. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cap pattern with braid" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/1976769.jpg" width="567"></div></li><li>  Now we knit 88 loops of 12 rows of elastic.  The cap scheme with a braid is divided into several parts, one of which is an elastic band.  It is presented in the photo above and resembles a sequence of front and back loops.  Thanks to this knitting method, the base of our cap will remain elastic and stretch even after washing. </li><li>  Further, when the elastic is ready, you can begin to manufacture the base of the cap.  For this, it will be necessary to knit a braid pattern, focusing on the diagram below. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's hat with a scythe" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/1976826.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  A rapport is a fragment of a pattern that repeats on the canvas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Then, when you knit 20 rows with a pattern, you can begin to reduce the stitches.  It is necessary that the hat with a scythe fit well in the shape of the head.  By the way, it should be clarified that decreases are performed only in the front rows. </li><li>  Now that we are knitting a rapport, the purl stitches are knit together.  Everything becomes clearer if you look at the diagram. </li></ul>

    <p>  So, row after row, the loops on the knitting needles are getting smaller and smaller, and in the end, the remaining knits are pulled together into a ring and tied tightly to a knot. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  Now that our hat with a braid is almost ready, we just have to add a couple of the necessary details.  First you need to carefully sew the product along the length so that the stitches are not noticeable.  This is not difficult to do, since a women's hat with a braid is very textured and embossed, so that foreign seams on it are almost invisible. </p><p>  If you are a beginner, then it is likely that the upper ring with decreases has not turned out very neat due to the different tension of the loops.  Do not worry, because everything comes with time, and this defect is very easy to fix. </p><p>  All needlewomen always have small skeins of yarn, which are very difficult to attach somewhere.  From them we will create a beautiful pompom that will decorate our hat and hide unnecessary details of the inexperience of the craftswoman: </p><ul><li>  Take cardboard and cut out two circles of the same diameter.  Then, with scissors we make a hole in the centers, forming a ‚Äúrim‚Äù with a thickness of about 2 centimeters. </li><li>  Having taken the yarn, we carefully wrap our billet, completely covering all the cardboard. </li><li>  We cut the threads along the entire circumference with scissors, after which we place the thread between the workpiece disks. </li><li>  Tighten the rope, making a couple of knots.  We remove the cardboard templates, form an even ball and sew it to the very top of our hat. </li></ul><p>  We wear with pleasure, forgetting about the cold and catching the enthusiastic looks of others. </p>
