Those who come here are offered whole tours and sightseeing tours of picturesque places.  The most popular waterfalls in Vietnam, which will be discussed in the article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="14.058324" data-lng="108.277199" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/1/7/17617.png"></div><h2>  Pongur </h2><p>  It is one of the most beautiful places in the country.  A distinctive feature of the Pongur waterfall (Vietnam) is that it is not too accessible for tourists because of its remoteness.  It is located in the vicinity of the city of Dalat, which is 1 491 km from the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi and at an altitude of 1,475 m above sea level. </p><p>  Two roads lead here - a long one, which passes through the Prenn waterfall, and a short one, with a length of about 30 km.  Nature lovers will like not only Pongur itself, but also the path to it, which runs through picturesque landscapes - coffee plantations, interspersed with wild tropical rainforest. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This Vietnam waterfall is located in a small gorge, which is surrounded by a beautiful natural park.  A steep stone staircase is laid to it, the approaches have handrails and bridges.  The depth of the pool bowl is about one and a half meters.  The height of the vaults from which water breaks down reaches sizes from 20 to 30 meters.  The width of the entire waterfall is approximately 100 m, which makes it the longest in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.exoticvoyages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pongur Waterfall" class="if uuid-3223300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3223300.jpg"></div><p>  The power of water flows is directly related to the seasons.  So, for example, in the rainy season, the waterfall becomes saturated and the sound of the streams of water that it dumps into its bowl is heard throughout the district.  The special beauty of Pongur is its cascades, their total number is seven pieces. </p><p>  Because of this, it is often called a seven-story or seven-jet.  The waterfall has wide ledges, along which you can walk among the jets of water.  Locals and a few tourists come here to rest and picnics.  Despite the fact that Pongur is located in remote places, this is one of those waterfalls that you must visit to see the delightful landscapes of this country. </p><h2>  Baho </h2><p>  It is located 25 km from the city of Nha Trang, which is the capital of Khanh Hoa province.  <span>Baho Falls</span> (Vietnam) has this name for the following reason.  From Vietnamese it is translated as ‚Äúthree lakes‚Äù, and this is no accident.  Water basins were formed due to streams of water that break down from a height of 60 meters.  The bowls of the reservoirs are located at different levels and are interconnected by Bahoe flows.  The water in the lakes is crystal clear and cool, but the temperature allows you to swim in them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hotbollywoodandhollywoodactress.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnamese landscapes" class="if uuid-3223302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3223302.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists quite often consider Baho not as a single waterfall, but three different, but this is an erroneous opinion.  Entire groups of tourists are brought to these places for sightseeing tours.  The beauty of the waterfall and its lake is simply mesmerizing.  However, it should be noted that not all will be able to see all three reservoirs. </p><p>  If the road to the first two, although long, is accessible to travelers, then the path to the third lake is very difficult.  It runs through the rocky slopes, and only trained tourists can reach them.  But it should be said that the beauties of these places deserve to spend time and energy on them in order to see them. </p><h2>  Multiple objects </h2><p>  Fairy Spring and Youngbay also belong to Nha Trang waterfalls (Vietnam).  The latter is located 40 km west of the city.  Translated from Vietnamese, Youngbey means "waterfall of the sky."  It is located in a nature park, which is named after him.  In addition to Yangbey, there are two more waterfalls here - Ho Che and Yang Kang.  After enjoying the beauty of all three water bodies, you can go to the hot mineral springs, which have different temperatures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpapers13.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of vietnam" class="if uuid-3223303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3223303.jpg"></div><p>  This nature park houses a crocodile farm and a small zoo.  The infrastructure is well thought out, everything is created for the comfort of guests.  There are several eateries and cafes in various places in the park.  All year round it is very popular with many tourists. </p><h2>  Fairy spring </h2><p>  This is a waterfall that is located 20 km southwest of Nha Trang.  It is little known to tourists and mainly here you can meet only local residents.  The object is a small stream that falls from a cliff, forming a small lake.  In the reservoir in the summer you can swim, but in the winter it is quite cold here.  Fairy Spring is not a high waterfall in Vietnam.  But, despite this, the beautiful nature of these places will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Datian Waterfall (Vietnam) </h2><p>  Among locals it is called Banzek.  The object is unique in that it is the fourth high-rise work of nature in the whole world and the largest in Southeast Asia.  It is located in Vietnam and China.  In the dry period, it consists of two waterfalls, and in the rainy season it becomes one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.exoticvoyages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Datian Waterfall" class="if uuid-3223299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3223299.jpg"></div><p>  Detyan is located 272 km from Hanoi, in the province of Kaobang, and is fed by the Quayshon River.  The width of its three levels is a total of 200 meters, and the depth is more than 120 m. A large lake with clear water spreads in the lower reaches of the cascades.  Due to the fact that the waterfall is located on the territory of two states, tourism infrastructure is quite well developed here. </p><p>  Several viewing platforms were created in these places, allowing you to see all the beauty of these places from the best points.  For the convenience of tourists, several hotels, restaurants and cafes have been built, as well as souvenir shops.  The period from November to April, when the water level is at its peak, is most visited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bookmundi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pu Mat National Park" class="if uuid-3223454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3223454.jpg"></div><p>  Vietnam's waterfalls, like the rest of its nature, attract thousands of guests and ecotourism lovers to the country all year round.  Here you can find everything - from quiet tourist excursions through the quiet gorges of Pongur to the extreme roads of Baho. </p>
