The most famous island visited by tourists is Phuket.  However, you can relax on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand.  In our article, we offer you information about one of its beaches. </p><h2>  Koh Samui </h2><p>  Samui is a small island in the Gulf of Thailand with a length of 25 kilometers and a width of 21 kilometers.  It is located 700 kilometers south of the capital.  If you are going to visit the island, you must take into account its climatic features.  From the beginning of October to December, monsoons dominate in the region, so there are regular downpours and minor storms.  According to experienced tourists, the best time to visit the island is from January to February, as well as the second half of July and all of August.  Despite some climatic nuances, the resort is suitable for visiting throughout the year.  The air temperature on the island ranges from +28 ¬∞ C to +32 ¬∞ C, and the water temperature in the sea does not drop below +27 ¬∞ C.  Thinking about where to go in the summer in Thailand, it is quite possible to consider Koh Samui as a possible option.  There are many wonderful beaches with clean sand and clear waters of the sea.  All of them are not very crowded, so no one and nothing will hinder your vacation. </p><h2>  Lamai Beach </h2><p>  Among the beaches of the island it is worth highlighting Lamai (Samui), which can be safely called the second most popular after Chaweng Noi beach.  Its length is about four kilometers.  Lamai (Samui) is located a little south of Chaweng.  He is not as partyy as his brother, but his infrastructure is excellently developed.  The sea off the coast is incredibly clean and beautiful, and the sandy surface of the beach makes it convenient for families with children.  In the vicinity you can choose housing for every taste, as there are many offers.  Not only tourists settle on the coast, but also those who live here permanently or winter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Central Lamai </h2><p>  The long beach of Lamai (Samui) is officially divided into two parts.  However, in fact, three parts are distinguished in its structure: southern, central, and northern. </p><p>  The central part is the most developed.  It is here that the best hotels are built on the beach of Lamai (Samui).  Each institution has its own sunbeds and awnings on the beach.  In the off-season there are not so many health resort visitors, but from December to February there is an influx of vacationers. </p><p>  From the north, the beach separates the stream from the rest of the coast.  The central part of the hotel "Aloha Resort" is ending.  Since the beach is very wide (30-40 meters), you can always find free space on it, especially if you move away from the bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beachtraveller.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the coast" class="if uuid-2536782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536782.jpg"></div><p>  The central part is characterized by a rather steep approach to the sea.  Depth begins literally five meters from the water's edge.  The ebbs and flows in this place are completely invisible.  This part of the coast is considered ideal for swimming.  Along the coast are hotels and beach bars.  From here, the closest thing is to get to the village of Lamai, which has mini markets, shops, banks, banks, cafes, restaurants and other infrastructure. </p><h2>  North Lamai </h2><p>  The northern part of Lamai Beach on Koh Samui is bordered by Chaweng Beach.  This area is very calm.  However, the sea here is shallower, and the ebbs and flows are felt more strongly.  In shallow water, you can see many stones of bizarre shapes.  The length of the northern part is about two kilometers, and the width varies from 5 to 30 meters.  The width of the coastal strip is significantly affected by ebbs and flows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The northern part of Lamai Beach has a shallow depth at the water's edge, which is very convenient for kids.  Therefore, couples with children prefer to relax here.  For the convenience of swimming, you must use special shoes so as not to injure your legs.  At low tide, the sea "leaves" about a kilometer, which causes certain inconvenience.  On the coast you can ride on bananas and jet skis. </p><p>  In the northern part of the beach you can find accommodation for every taste, from luxury hotels to modest apartments.  All hotels have sun loungers on the coast, which allows you to comfortably spend time by the sea. </p><h2>  South beach </h2><p>  The southern and central parts of Lamai Beach (Samui) are shared by the Bill Resort Hotel.  The length of the beach is approximately 0.5 kilometers.  It ends at a local attraction - the stones "Grandfather" and "Grandmother".  In the northern part, the width of the sand strip reaches forty meters, and to the south it narrows to ten meters. </p><p>  Sunset at sea is convenient, but there are stones at the bottom.  In windy weather, strong waves appear on Lamai (Samui).  The ebbs here are almost imperceptible, and therefore you can swim at any time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beachtraveller.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamai Coast" class="if uuid-2536783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536783.jpg"></div><p>  The southern coast is preferred by tourists who crave a relaxing holiday.  However, for kids the beach is completely unsuitable, since the shallow water is practically absent here.  In addition, stones are found in water.  There are no beach parties in this region.  Several small supermarkets, restaurants and shops are nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Many tourists ask which beach is better on Koh Samui, Chaweng or Lamai.  It is difficult to give a definite answer to this question.  The first beach is considered a real center of fun and entertainment, as well as the most developed region.  On Lamai beach, relaxing is also fun.  There are bars and restaurants here, but there are not so many entertainment establishments, so they do not interfere with tourists who want peace.  We can confidently say that Lamai is a quieter place.  Therefore, lovers of beach parties here may seem bored. </p><p>  On the coast, tourists are given a great opportunity to go diving.  The region has a number of companies that organize diving excursions.  All of them offer approximately the same trips to the island of Khao Tao. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque resort" class="if uuid-2536787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536787.jpg"></div><p>  Near the village of Lamai there are several fitness centers offering sports.  They are equipped with everything necessary for active classes.  Each center has professional instructors who help determine the training program. </p><p>  For a detailed acquaintance with the island of Koh Samui in Thailand, you can rent a bicycle.  A local travel company offers to explore the island on bicycles in the company of an experienced guide.  Such stunning walks will be interesting to all lovers of outdoor activities. </p><h2>  Lamai for children </h2><p>  If you come to the resort with children, then the best place to visit is the Coco Splash water park.  It is located on Lamai Beach and has seven water attractions of various difficulty levels.  There is also a shallow pool for kids in the water park.  In the amusement park, you can not only have fun with the whole family, but also relax in the shade of the arbors while the children play on the playgrounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samuivillaretreat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark of the resort" class="if uuid-2536806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536806.jpg"></div><p>  If the sea is not happy with calm, and you want to swim, you can go to the pink Elifant water park.  In it you will find a wave pool, a paddling pool for kids and water attractions.  The park is more designed for children. </p><p>  For children, the resort has karting, which is a fairly popular entertainment.  The pride of Samui is soccer golf - a new, but very popular fun. </p><h2>  Communication with animals </h2><p>  An equally popular destination among tourists of all ages is the safari park.  On its territory, twice a day, shows are organized with the participation of monkeys, elephants, birds, crocodiles.  The youngest guests can visit the mini zoo. </p><p>  Safari Park is located next to the waterfall.  The most courageous travelers can climb to its origins to a height of more than 80 meters to take stunning photos. </p><p>  On Samui, you can also visit traditional crocodile and snake farms.  Such places are visited not only because of the entertainment program.  Here you can buy leather goods and look near exotic animals. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  According to reviews, Lamai (Samui) is interesting for recreation in many ways, including entertainment and attractions.  The latter include the rocks of Hin Yai and Hin Ta, which are popularly known as the stones "Grandfather" and "Grandmother".  They are located in the south of the beach.  You can watch them absolutely free at any time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kosamui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Attractions" class="if uuid-2536759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536759.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists will certainly be interested in a Buddhist temple and local pagodas.  For completeness, vacationers recommend visiting a tiger show and a spa center.  In the south of Lamai you can climb to the observation deck to enjoy the surroundings. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Lamai village is a great place for shopping.  On its main street there are numerous shops and shops with souvenirs and other goods.  Popular Thai items and cosmetics are available here.  It is customary to bargain in the markets.  Sometimes the cost of goods can be significantly reduced. </p><p>  Tourists recommend to definitely go to the night market ‚ÄúLamai Night Plaza‚Äù.  It is located in the heart of the village.  In this market, you can purchase absolutely everything, from small souvenirs to modern electrical equipment.  Many tourists buy smartphones and products of famous brands here very cheaply. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kosamui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night market" class="if uuid-2536763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536763.jpg"></div><p>  The traffic during the market is blocked, the street turns into a large pedestrian zone.  Thai goods for massage and bathtubs, incense are also in demand in the village. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Thinking about where to go in the summer, you are sure to choose not only a resort, but also a hotel in which it will be comfortable to relax.  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLamai beach, the assortment of hotels of different levels is quite large.  Among them you can choose status institutions and the most modest bungalows.  The best institutions include: </p><ol><li>  Silavadi Pool Spa Resort, located just 9 minutes walk from the sea.  This five-star hotel offers accommodation in chic Thai-style rooms, the opportunity to visit a spa center, good food and a high level of service. </li><li>  "Banyan Tree Samui" - a chic complex with its own beach and comfortable villas. </li><li>  Royal Beach Resort Spa is a modern five-star complex equipped with a spa center, restaurants and several pools. </li><li>  Lazy Dais offers bungalow accommodation with all amenities. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="en.directrooms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel on Lamai Beach" class="if uuid-2536791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536791.jpg"></div><p>  From inexpensive establishments, tourists recommend paying attention to: </p><ol><li>  "Marina Beach Resort."  Located right on Lamai Beach, this hotel offers rooms with sea or garden views. </li><li>  Samui Beach Resort.  This is a hotel built near the rocks "Grandmother" and "Grandfather". </li><li>  The complex "Cottages Samui" is located on the coast.  It offers accommodation in small one-story buildings. </li></ol><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Lamai beach tourists evaluate differently.  Some people really like the local coast, others are not very happy with it.  Criticism is caused by stones falling under your feet, jellyfish, ebbs and flows.  In general, coastal holidays are suitable for older people and families with children.  For young people, you can recommend more rave regions, although experienced holidaymakers note that there is no fundamental difference between the beaches of Lamai and Chaweng.  The convenience of hotels in Koh Samui is that they are all located very close to the sea, so you are almost all the time on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coast Hotels" class="if uuid-2536800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2536800.jpg"></div><p>  If you compare Phuket and Samui, the first will offer you a higher level of service and a great coast.  The second island does not have any outstanding sights or interesting places.  All entertainment is concentrated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach.  In general, Lamai, like the rest of Samui, is ideal for a measured beach holiday.  Some tourists say that the water off the coast is not always clean.  Very often it is quite muddy, greasy spots of fuel left by local motor boats are noticeable in it.  They are used in recreational water rides. </p><p>  All holidaymakers say that Lamai is less crowded than Chaweng.  A significant drawback of the beach is that there are jellyfish in the water that leave very unpleasant burns.  On the coast there are even advertisements hanging warning tourists about the danger. </p><p>  In addition, tourists who are not the first time to come to the resort, note that the coast is becoming dirtier.  Garbage is not cleaned up so often.  But this is the problem of so many resorts in Thailand. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, Lamai and the island of Samui are recommended for a relaxing holiday.  If you are looking for active entertainment and nightly parties until the morning, then you should choose Phuket.  Samui's infrastructure is less developed and not as diverse as in Phuket.  However, the resort has its fans who visit it with pleasure. </p>
