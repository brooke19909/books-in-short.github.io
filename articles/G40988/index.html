It is inferior to the capital in terms of attendance by tourists, but this does not prevent it from being very beautiful and interesting.  The city was founded in 1536.  Kali is rightfully considered the most modern and most enjoyable to visit in the entire region.  Today we will tell you about this interesting place.  Where is it located?  How can I get here?  What do tourists say about him? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cali city in colombia" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1952224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get into the city </h2><p>  There are not so many ways that you can get here.  If you live somewhere close to this city, then it will be more convenient for you to travel by bus or car.  But if you are thousands of kilometers from this wonderful place, then to get here, you have to use the services of airlines.  For those who live in Russia, we remind you that there are no direct flights.  First you can fly to Bogota, and only then, using any form of transport, get to the city of Cali in Colombia. </p><h2>  About climate </h2><p>  The next question that you probably had is: "When is the best time to visit the city?"  Answering it is easy enough.  After all, in fact, there is no difference when coming to this excellent place.  The weather here is good all year round.  The temperature very rarely drops below 25 degrees during the day and 15 at night.  In Cali, the rainy season falls on all months of spring, as well as October, November and December.  So if you do not like rainy weather, then you better not come here during this period.  True, local residents assure that the amount of precipitation is very small and will not be able to interfere with your vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, if you do not want to leave a lot of money in this city, then you should not visit it at the end of December and in the middle of September.  At this time, large-scale and spectacular festivals are held here, due to which housing prices and food prices rise. </p>

    <h2>  Security.  What problems may arise and how to prevent them </h2><p>  One of the safest cities in Colombia is Cali.  Here you can walk in the evenings without fear and enjoy the performances of street performers at a later time.  However, do not forget that although Kali is quite safe, it is simply necessary to follow the precautionary rules: </p><ul><li>  Remember that you should not shorten the road in unknown areas of the city, because who knows how it can end for you, so it would be better if you call a taxi. </li><li>  Hitchhiking in the evening is also unsafe. </li><li>  And, most importantly, in any city in Colombia, you should not visit slums that are not protected. </li></ul><p>  Using these tips, you will be 90 percent safe and save only the most pleasant experience from the trip. </p>

    <h2>  Popular Attractions </h2><ul><li>  A small copy of the <span>statue of Christ the Savior, the</span> original of which is much larger and is located in Rio, is considered to be a visiting card of the city.  For local residents, this sculpture symbolizes a peaceful life and absolution.  You can visit this attraction at any time, but we recommend visiting here at night, because it is at this time of day that the lighting is very beautiful. </li><li>  The second no less significant place in the city is the salsa clubs La Matraca and Habanero.  Here you can see a show that will definitely not leave you indifferent.  Here you can not only dance, but also drink coffee or something stronger.  Also in these cafes very often professional dancers perform, watching which is very interesting. </li><li>  If you want to view the city from a bird's eye view, then the observation deck of Sebastian de Belalcasar will do just fine for you.  It received its name in honor of the founder of the city, then a monument was erected to him.  This place offers a beautiful view of the surroundings.  This is where you can take great photos of Cali in Colombia. </li><li>  Fans of active and informative recreation are advised to visit the sugar cane estate Pieda Chinche.  The museum consists of 21 ranches.  Here you will be shown the whole process of growing and processing sugar cane.  At the end of the tour, all participants will be offered to try drinks and sweets. </li><li>  Another very interesting and beautiful place is the church of San Antonio.  It is considered one of the oldest in the city.  The church was founded in the middle of the 18th century.  Although they should warn you: you can‚Äôt always get here, because, according to local residents, the church is often closed.  But even to see this place outside would be nice, because it is really unusually beautiful. </li></ul>

If you are new to them, then it is best for you to use the services of an instructor. </li></ol><h2>  Cartel of Cali in Colombia </h2><p>  Speaking about the city, it would be wrong not to say about the Colombian criminal organization that was engaged in the sale of drugs, including cocaine and opium.  This group lasted 21 years and controlled almost 90 percent of the drug trade in the world.  By the mid-90s, the cartel became the largest criminal syndicate ever existed.  But, fortunately, in 1998 the group was destroyed, the leaders were sent to the United States, where they were sentenced to 30 years in prison.  It was this event that began to be considered the collapse of the cocaine empire.  So, visiting the city these days, you can be completely calm and confident in your safety. </p>
