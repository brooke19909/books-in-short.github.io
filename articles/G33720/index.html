    <h2>  Detail </h2><p>  Speaking about how to fill out a report on changes in capital, it should be noted that enterprises independently determine the concretization of the indicators of the articles.  At the same time, in PBU 4/99 (Clause 11) provides that the values ‚Äã‚Äãof individual assets, income, liabilities, expenses and results of business operations should be presented separately if they are considered significant and if their interested users cannot assess without disclosure financial status of the company or the results of its activities.  They can also be presented in the balance sheet or statement of losses and profits in the total amount with comments, if each of the above indicators separately is not significant for the analysis of the profitability of the enterprise by interested parties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Format </h2><p>  Since it is necessary to fill out a report on changes in capital in accordance with applicable standards, then under Art.  13, paragraph 6 of the Federal Law No. 129, the compilation, as well as subsequent storage and provision of documentation is carried out on paper.  If appropriate technical means are available with the consent of interested parties, the processing, synthesis and transmission of information can be carried out in electronic form.  It should be noted that the electronic form is approved by the Order of the Federal Tax Service.  It is made in accordance with the forms certified by Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 66n.  Regulatory acts explaining how to fill out a report on changes in capital, form 3 is recognized as the only acceptable for entering the necessary information.  The form should be made clearly, without corrections and blots. </p><h2>  Features of entering information </h2><p>  There are some nuances that employees who fill out the statement of changes in equity need to know.  The sample provides for the introduction of information not only for the current period, but also for the previous 2.  So, the documentation for 2011 will also contain data for 2010 and the amount of assets as of December 31.  2009th.  When preparing a report, it should be remembered that negative or deductible indicators are reflected in parentheses.  Amounts of assets are entered in thousands (or millions) of rubles. </p><h2>  How to fill out a statement of changes in equity: an example </h2><p>  The documentation on the assets of the enterprise will be compiled on the basis of the aforementioned Federal Law No. 129, Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 66n, and PBU 4/99, 6/01, 14/07, and others. To clarify most clearly how to fill out a report on changes in capital, a sample filling is divided into three sections.  The document will reflect the movement of funds and adjustments in connection with a change in accounting policies and the elimination of errors.  It is mandatory to enter information on net assets for the past two and at the end of the current period when the report on changes in equity is completed.  A sample of filling, which will be presented later, was compiled for 2011 for LLC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filling out the statement of changes in equity" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/759799.jpg" width="545"></div>

The sample fill contains information for the current and previous period.  This section reflects data on the movement, increase, decrease in assets and their volume.  When entering information, you must be guided by the rules that explain how to fill out a report on changes in capital.  An example of filling out the documentation of last year is very useful for young professionals.  Particular attention should be paid to the process of transferring data from last year‚Äôs documentation.  Some difficulties may arise for employees filling out a report on changes in the capital of a newly created organization.  However, in practice, as a rule, everything is not so problematic. </p><h2>  OS revaluation </h2><p>  For those who want to know how to fill out a report on changes in capital, the sample considered in the article can serve as a visual aid.  When compiling the first section on the movement of funds, last year indicators are transferred to the current documentation, based on comparability.  This takes into account changes in the procedure for entering the results of the revaluation of intangible assets and fixed assets in the financial statements of a company. </p><p>  According to the current version of PBU 6/01 under item 15, a commercial company has the opportunity no more than once a year (at the end of the cycle) to re-evaluate groups of homogeneous fixed assets at replacement (current) cost.  The results of the procedures are subject to separate reflection in the documentation.  According to the previous edition of the specified PBU, the requirements of which contained the rules according to which in 2010 the report on changes in capital was filled out (instructions for filling), the commercial enterprise could reassess categories of homogeneous categories no more than once a year (at the beginning of the period) OS at replacement (current) value.  The results of these procedures are also reflected in the documentation separately.  The revaluation results are not included in the reporting for the previous reporting cycle and are accepted when compiling balance sheet information at the beginning of the period. </p><h2>  Revaluation of intangible assets </h2><p>  According to the current version of PBU 14/07 (Clause 17), a commercial enterprise has the opportunity not more than once a year (at the end of the cycle) to carry out revaluation of intangible assets in accordance with current market value.  It, in turn, is determined solely by the information on the active turnover of these intangible assets.  According to the previous version of the above PBU 14, in accordance with which the report on changes in capital was completed, the instruction gave the right to commercial enterprises no more than once a year (at the beginning of the period) to revalue intangible assets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fill out a statement of changes in equity" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/759800.jpg" width="397"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  When reflecting the results of the revaluation carried out in previous periods, the report for the year 2011 follows the amount of the markdown (revaluation) of intangible assets and fixed assets based on the results of 2009-10 indicated at the beginning of 2010-11.  accordingly, move from the beginning of the period (2010-11) to the end of the past (2009-10).  Through this transfer, comparability of indicators will be ensured. </p><h2>  Essential elements </h2><p>  The report should reflect indicators: </p><ul><li>  <span>Registered capital.</span>  Line 3310 = page 3314 + 3315 + 3316. </li><li>  Own shares repurchased from shareholders.  Line 3310 = page 3314 + 3315 + 3316. </li><li>  Additional capital.  Line 3310 = 3312 + 3313 + 3314 +.3315 + 3316. </li><li>  Uncovered loss (retained earnings).  Line 3310 = 3311 + 3312 + 3313 + 3315 + 3316. </li><li>  Reserve capital.  Line 3310 = line 3316. </li><li>  Total  Page  3310 = 3311 + 3312 + 3313 + 3314 + 3315 + 3316. </li></ul><p>  In particular, lines 3311, 3312, 3313, 3314, 3315, 3316 are indicated. Net profit on page 3311 is reflected in the amount for the reporting year, increasing the amount of retained earnings of the enterprise.  However, it should be noted that the value indicated in line 3311 must be equal to that given in page 2400 of the loss and profit documentation.  The net profit indicator should correspond to the amount contained in the accounting registers for credit accounts: </p><p>  <em>84 "Uncovered loss (retained earnings)" for the year.</em> </p><p>  <em>99 "Losses and profit" following the results of the 1st quarter, 6 and 9 months.</em> </p><h2>  Revaluation of property </h2><p>  Page  3312 contains the revaluation surplus of intangible assets and fixed assets.  It belongs to the additional capital of the enterprise: </p><ul><li>  in full, if in previous cycles the markdown of objects was not made; </li><li>  in the excess of the revaluation surplus over the markdown indicator, if the first is greater than the second. </li></ul><p>  One important point should be noted.  The revaluation surplus of intangible assets and fixed assets in the amount of the markdown made in previous reporting periods and included in the financial result as other expenses is included in the result as other profit.  In the accounting registers it is reflected in the credit of the account ‚ÄúAdditional paid-in capital‚Äù (83).  Upon disposal of revalued intangible assets and fixed assets, the amounts for their revaluation are transferred from the account.  83 to the account of the uncovered loss (retained earnings) of the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="completed statement of changes in equity" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/759801.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Asset Increase Income </h2><p>  Line 3313 reflects the amount of profit that is not included in the financial result of the current period.  Such income, for example, may be the difference that arises from the translation of the value of the assets of a company represented in foreign currency and the liabilities used in conducting activities outside of Russia into rubles.  This profit is reflected in accounting in the reporting period and is credited to additional paid-in capital. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  Line 3314 indicates the size of the increase in capital of the enterprise arising from: </p><ul><li>  issue of additional shares (shares); </li><li>  contributions to authorized assets. </li></ul><p>  Line 3315 contains the amount of increase in equity arising from the increase in the nominal value of shares (stocks).  In page 3316 (reorganization of a legal entity) the amount of capital increase that arose as a result of the allocation / accession is indicated. </p><h2>  Asset reduction </h2><p>  Line 3320 shows the totals for the following columns: </p><ul><li>  Share capital - p. 3320 = 3324 + 3325 + 3326. </li><li>  Shares repurchased from shareholders - line 3320 = 3324 + 3325 + 3326. </li><li>  Additional asset - line 3320 = 3322 + 3323 + 3324 + 3325. </li><li>  Reserve funds - p. 3320 = line 3326. </li><li>  Uncovered loss (retained earnings) - line 3320 = p. 321 + 3322 + 3323 + 3324 + 3325+ 3326 + 3327. </li><li>  The result - p. 3320 = 3321 + 3322 + 3323 + 3324 + 3325 + 3326 + 3327. </li><li>  Including - lines 3321-3327. </li></ul><p>  Net profit on line 3321 is reflected as the amount of loss for the reporting period, which reduces the amount of retained earnings of the enterprise.  The revaluation of property on page 3322 corresponds to the amount of the markdown of intangible assets and fixed assets.  It refers to the additional capital of the company in an amount not exceeding the revaluation surplus, if earlier it was made.  The amount of the markdown of intangible assets and fixed assets, which is greater than the specified revaluation surplus performed in previous periods and attributed to the increase in additional assets, is indicated in the financial result as other income.  In accounting registers, this value is reflected in the debit account.  83. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filling out a statement of changes in capital of a newly created organization" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/759802.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Asset Reduction Costs </h2><p>  Line 3323 reflects the amount of costs that are not included in the financial results of the reporting period.  Such an expense may be a positive difference that arises from the translation of the value of assets denominated in foreign money and the liabilities used in carrying out activities abroad into rubles if it relates to other income due to the termination of the enterprise outside Russia.  This value reduces the additional assets in the account.  83. </p><h2>  Other information </h2><p>  Line 3324 introduces the amount to reduce equity.  It arises as a result of a reduction in the <span>nominal value of</span> shares (stocks).  The decrease in the number of securities is reflected in line 3325. In page 3326, the amount that appeared during the reorganization of the enterprise in the form of spin-offs is added.  On line 3327 indicate the amount associated with the distribution of net income in favor of shareholders (founders, participants). </p><h2>  Asset Adjustments </h2><p>  Line 3330 reflects the amount that does not affect the change in the amount of capital as a whole.  It is indicated in the form of negative and positive values ‚Äã‚Äãfor different columns of this row.  When, when disposing of revalued intangible assets and fixed assets, the amounts for their revaluation are transferred from the additional assets of the enterprise to the account for fixing undistributed income (uncovered loss), then the report reflects: </p><ul><li>  in parentheses (in the form of a negative value) for the column "Additional capital"; </li><li>  a positive indicator in the "Uncovered loss (retained earnings)" column. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the indicator on line 3330 does not apply to the amounts on lines 3310 and 3320. </p><h2>  Section 2 </h2><p>  This part of the report reflects changes in the company's own assets for previous periods, which are caused by: </p><ul><li>  corrections correcting mistakes made in past cycles; </li><li>  changes in accounting policies of the enterprise (to ensure comparability of indicators). </li></ul><p>  In the explanatory notes, the responsible employee should give the reasons that entailed these adjustments to the amount of equity in previous periods. </p><h2>  Net assets (section 3) </h2><p>  This part of the report contains information on the amounts at the end of the period and for the two previous cycles.  So, the documentation for 2011 should reflect information on net assets as of December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.  According to the Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 10n, Federal Securities Commission No. 03-6 / pz, for settlements of the net asset of AO, except for companies that perform banking and insurance operations, the value of private equity should be understood as the value determined by subtracting from the size of the assets of the joint-stock company accepted for calculation , the sum of their liabilities.
