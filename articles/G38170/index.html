  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meissen, Germany: attractions, hotels, restaurants, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many famous and interesting cities in Europe.  They attract tourists, stories and guides write about them.  One such place is the city of Meissen in Germany.  Sights of the capital of Saxony, of course, are unique.  And most importantly, what it is known for is an old china production.  We‚Äôll tell you what you should see in Meissen (Germany), where to stay, where to eat and what to do there. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The ancient city of Meissen in Germany is located on the River Elbe, at the confluence of it with Tribisch.  The nearest major city is Dresden.  These settlements are separated by only 25 km.  Meissen is located on a hill and the adjacent plain.  From the capital of the country it is separated by about 150 km.  Therefore, Meissen is very convenient to visit, a trip to it can be combined with a visit to Dresden or Leipzig. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Meissen (Germany) dates back to 929.  At this time, the German king Henry I, nicknamed the Ptitselov, ordered the construction of a fortress Misnia on the hill to protect against aggressive Hungarians who were actively expanding their holdings.  In 968, led by Meissen, Margrave was formed with its own bishop.  The fortified fortress began to attract merchants and artisans who began to settle under its walls.  The convenient location on the way from Prague to Leipzig contributed to the rapid growth and prosperity of the city.  In the XI century, makgrafsto departed to the Vettin family.  This royal family is today represented among the monarchs of Europe by the Windsor branch.  In 1250, the city, which resisted the attacks of the Tatar-Mongol yoke, began to build a Catholic cathedral in the style of flaming Gothic.  Meissen gradually strengthened, became more influential.  In 1423, the local duke received the rank of elector, and this further strengthened the importance of the city.  In 1470, the first castle in Germany was erected here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the XVII century, Augustus the Strong decided to establish porcelain production in Meissen - a very profitable business at that time.  And the factory was located in the castle of Albrechtsburg, in which no one lived anyway.  The factory worked in the castle until 1864, until its own building was built for it.  At the end of the 19th century, Meissen became a large industrial and commercial center.  Two World Wars spared the city, and it preserved many historical buildings.  Today Meissen is known as the city of china.  This is the main local enterprise.  At the beginning of the XXI century, Meissen was badly affected by the flood, but now the city is put in order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen city Germany" class="if uuid-2982847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982847.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Today, tourists are attracted to Meissen by Albrechtsburg Castle.  In Germany, this is exactly the iconic place where the famous porcelain appeared.  However, there are other interesting sights in this city.  Although the object number 1, of course, is the castle.  Today it has been restored, and it houses the Porcelain Museum.  The second most important attraction is the Meissen Cathedral.  Together with the castle, it forms a unique architectural ensemble of the city.  The cathedral is considered an example of the purest German Gothic and is included in all world directories telling about this style.  Another attraction is the market square, or rather, the Town Hall building, built in the 15th century.  The deer house, a market pharmacy and residential buildings of the 16th-17th centuries attract the attention of the square.  Also distinguished by their special architecture: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the gate of the cloth-maker left from the fence of the cemetery at the beginning of the 17th century </li><li>  the well of Henry; </li><li>  Church of Our Lady of the 16th century; </li><li>  Siebenaiichen Castle of the 16th century, in which the poet Novalis, the philosopher Fichte, the playwright and poet von Kleist and other celebrities visited at different times; </li><li>  several medieval churches. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen Germany Attractions" class="if uuid-2982848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982848.jpg"></div><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  Arriving in ancient cities, tourists seek to see the main places, visit museums, take photos.  Meissen in Germany is also sometimes considered as a city of one day.  But in such visits, the city‚Äôs inspection program turns out to be too saturated, and travelers are not able to catch the spirit of the city, to imbue its atmosphere. </p><p>  Meissen deserves to spend 2-3 days in it, enjoying it to the fullest.  What is there to do all this time?  First off, take a walk.  You need to climb the Castle Hill (this can be done on the funicular) and look at the city from a height, but it is better to go downstairs on foot, enjoying the scenery.  You should also visit the porcelain museum, carefully look at all these beautiful products, learn the secrets of its production.  Then you still need to walk along the old streets of the city, which in the evenings are lit by the warm light of lanterns and become especially cozy and ancient.  You can follow the route that Dr. Pleischner walked in the film ‚ÄúSeventeen Moments of Spring‚Äù, because some movie scenes were shot right here.  And in the city you need to try local dishes, drink wine and sit in a restaurant.  In the warmer months, you need to plan your visit for the numerous fairs and festivals that are regularly held in Meissen.  And in September you can visit the famous wine festival. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen hotels Germany" class="if uuid-2982853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982853.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  Those who do not have enough historical and architectural attractions, Meissen in Germany can offer a visit to the zoo.  This is a small but very cozy animal house in which locals like to spend time.  Another place to visit is the numerous antique shops scattered around the old city.  It is not necessary to make purchases in them, but everyone can see all sorts of wonders, objects of art and placers of Meissen porcelain.  Collectors from all over the world come to these stores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rauantiques.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen Germany photo" class="if uuid-2982860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982860.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  Like any old city, Meissen (Germany) can have a meal in ancient restaurants where the spirit of the Middle Ages reigns, and dishes are created according to authentic recipes.  Only a few worthy places have been preserved in the city.  Such, for example, is the restaurant Vincenz Richter with a 200-year history.  From the window of the restaurant offers a completely medieval view: the old church, half-timbered houses.  The interior of the restaurant is a match for a good museum, it contains antique furniture, dishes, serving items.  But the main thing, of course, is the cuisine and the excellent local wine M√ºller Thurgau.  Here you can try boar dishes, German sausages, cheeses. </p><p>  A less pompous place, the Goldenes Fass restaurant, offers simpler, but very tasty food.  Not only guests love to go here, but also the residents of the city.  The restaurant is housed in an old building and is very well located on the main hiking route.  In addition to a solid meal, in Meissen you need to try fummel - a delicate and delicious cookie that can also be bought as a souvenir. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meissnertageblatt.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen in Germany" class="if uuid-2982874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982874.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  To feel the spirit of the city, it is best to settle in the historical center.  The best hotels of Meissen (Germany) are located there.  True, prices can ‚Äúbite‚Äù, but the atmosphere and high level service are guaranteed.  There are about 50 hotels in the city, there are also apartments and guesthouses.  The range of hotels is wide, from luxury to very simple hotels.  It is most convenient to stay in the heart of the old city so that you can take a walk in the evening, sit in a restaurant and not waste time getting to the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reisenaktuell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meissen hotels Germany" class="if uuid-2982881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2982881.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to travelers, the city of Meissen in Germany deserves to spend several days on it.  The historical center of the city is small, and it can easily be bypassed in half a day, but the climb to Castle Hill may require effort and time.  Travelers note that you do not need to do just visiting the main attractions.  Local churches are worthy of a thoughtful examination, especially since you can often listen to the organ or visit any exhibition in them. </p>
