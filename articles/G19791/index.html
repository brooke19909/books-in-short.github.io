  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transport tax tax amnesty, when applicable, transport tax relief for persons with disabilities, basic tax rate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, the base rate of transport tax is charged from 1000 rubles.  What determines the amount paid to the treasury?  Most often, the <span>car engine power</span> and the region in which the car is registered are taken into account.  There are many sites, the so-called calculators, which help car owners find out the approximate amount of the future transport tax. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the tax on transport is not very large, the <span>tax service</span> does not carefully monitor the facts of non-payment and does not punish non-payers.  Because of what, for many decades they drive cars without paying a transport tax.  The fact is that when buying and selling cars you do not need a receipt to pay this mandatory contribution to the state budget, so many car owners use this successfully.  As a result, Russian motorists owed several billion rubles to the tax authorities.  And therefore, in 2009, the first law was passed, which cancels some debts to the state treasury.  Otherwise, this means that a transport tax amnesty has been established.  However, this does not mean at all that this type of collection of funds from motorists has been canceled.  On the contrary, he continues to act.  And the tax amnesty for the <span>transport tax</span> means only that the owner of the car, who has not paid the tax, after a certain period of time will no longer be listed in the debtors of the inspection.  A deadline has been set.  Thus, a transport tax amnesty is valid from the moment it takes 3 years from the date of <span>payment.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How are those who have not paid the transport tax punished, and to whom the transport tax amnesty is not applicable?  These people pay a fine, in some cases they and the car are banned from leaving the country.  However, the last punishment is extremely rare.  By the way, not only a tax amnesty for the transport tax was adopted, but also several other very important points were decided that relate to vehicles and their owners. </p><p>  The most important of these is the issue of transport tax benefits.  So, the right to reduce the amount of contributions to the treasury was given to pensioners, disabled people and parents who have three or more children.  The tax deduction for disabled people has become especially significant.  If <span>a disabled person‚Äôs car</span> has an engine capacity of 100 to 150 horsepower, then he may not pay transport tax at all.  All those drivers whose cars have an engine power of less than 100 horsepower are exempt from paying this fee. </p><p>  As you can see, even if the tax amnesty for the transport tax does not come soon, you can easily solve the problem with taxes.  The first way is to renew the car for your parents - pensioners or disabled people.  Then you do not have to pay tax.  The second way is to sell this car and buy a new one - with an engine whose power is less than 100 horsepower.  Sometimes you can find honest ways to avoid paying tax.  If both options do not suit you, it‚Äôs better to honestly pay a fee to the treasury for transport.  Maybe if all motorists were just as decent on this issue, the problem of Russian roads would be exhausted. </p><p>  When choosing a car, you need to understand that the price you pay for the purchase will not be the last cash waste associated with it.  Remember insurance payments and taxes, try to calculate their approximate amount using a calculator website, determine the engine power - the more horsepower it has, the higher the tax rate.  So choose the engine for which you can afford the tax! </p>
