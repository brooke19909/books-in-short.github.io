These are long thin arms and legs with large feet, a straight or extended torso and a small head.  Bunnies usually have huge drooping ears, and girls have long hair made of yarn or wool.  To sew such a toy for the first time, you will need a master class. </p><p>  Tilda‚Äôs interior doll has a lot of tricks and nuances: delicate details, such as arms and legs, need to be sewn together with a seam with a small pitch so that open sections do not get worn out when twisting;  the joints are left unbroken, through which they fill the carcass with a synthetic winterizer, after which the parts are connected manually. </p><p>  To correctly cut all the details from the fabric, you need to make paper patterns, circle them on a linen or cotton cloth and cut them, leaving allowances for stitching.  When the foundation is ready, you can start painting your face.  Most often this is done with acrylic paints, but the eyes and mouth can simply be embroidered with colored threads.  <span>The hairstyle for the doll is</span> best done in the form of a wig, which is then attached to the head.  Very often a white cloth is taken for work and stained with hard-brewed coffee.  The result is not only a beautiful <span>skin color,</span> but also a pleasant aroma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interior dolls patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/376800.jpg?1397768227843" width="333"></div>

Of the tools you need to stock up with scissors, pliers and sewing accessories.  When everything is ready for work, it's time to turn on the imagination and get down to business. </p><h2>  Creation </h2><p>  The whole process of creating such a doll can be divided into several stages.  First, twist the wire frame for the doll.  And before that, you need to think about the growth of the future product and the pose in which the toy will be. </p><p>  The next stage is wrapping a kind of skeleton with a synthetic winterizer.  As a result of this process, the interior doll acquires a body.  To hold the material firmly on the wire, it is securely fixed with a fishing line or thread. </p><p>  Next is the turn to trim the doll body with a capron to give it a neat appearance.  Here for work you will need scissors and <span>sewing accessories.</span>  A piece of kapron pantyhose is tightened around the frame, in places of bends the fabric is tightened with a thread.  Also, with the help of a needle, the main facial features are formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself interior doll patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/376904.jpg" width="397"></div>

    <h2>  Kapron doll decoration </h2><p>  After that, they begin to apply makeup, as a result of which the faceless interior doll finds eyes, cilia, eyebrows and lips. </p><p>  The final stage in creating the body is the doll‚Äôs hairstyle.  Any material at hand can be used here.  Knitting yarn, clothesline, satin ribbon, floss thread, wool or fur are suitable.  In order to form a neat hair, first make a wig in the volume of the head, and then glue or sew on it. </p><p>  Lastly, interior <span>dolls</span> dress up <span>.</span>  <span>Patterns of</span> clothes in this case can be the most primitive.  Most often, the outfit is made non-removable, so it can be modeled directly on the figure, fixing shreds of fabric with glue or thread with a needle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY interior dolls" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/376905.jpg?1397768336597" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interior doll as a gift </h2><p>  Such a handmade product may well become a full and original present.  By the way, if you use your own imagination one hundred percent, then such a doll can become a functional piece of furniture.  Take, for example, a snail in the Tilda style, the shell of which can be of such a size that it will fit into a sofa cushion, or a nylon doll box, in which it will be possible to store various small items and jewelry. </p><p>  Such gifts, made with their own hands, will be appreciated even by someone who has never shown interest in handicrafts, because each new creation has not only a soul, but also carries the energy of its creator, a piece of his thoughts, emotions and experiences. </p><p>  To create interior dolls with your own hands is guaranteed positive emotions and continuous pleasure.  Therefore, you should cast aside all doubts, find time and immerse yourself in creativity, where there are no boundaries or prohibitions, but only your own imagination and a lot of improvised material. </p>
