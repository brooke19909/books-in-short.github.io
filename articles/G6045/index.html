  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of world civilizations - amazing discoveries of antiquity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The transition from the primitive communal system, when there was no point in talking about the existence of any significant social institutions, to primary civilizations, was a real breakthrough in the development of mankind.  Unfortunately, dating this moment is quite difficult, and above all due to the fact that the history of world civilizations does not have any common time classification for them. </p><p>  Such highly developed states as Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Greece, Japan, Babylon or the Aztec, Mayan and Inca civilizations existed not only often apart from each other, but also at different times.  According to scientists, this makes it very difficult to systematize in any way the features of ancient civilizations, as well as to trace their detailed history. </p><p>  Today, historians are inclined to the need for a separate study of various ancient peoples with the obligatory tracking of their mutual influences.  But, nevertheless, it is still possible to highlight some features common to all these civilizations.  So, the most important sign that characterizes the history of ancient civilizations was the emergence of writing.  This fact is undeniably confirmed by historical documents, architectural monuments and folk legends.  With the advent of writing, the system of transferring knowledge from one generation to another was simplified and, therefore, the history of world civilizations began to take shape. </p><p>  But it is worth noting that far from all the ancient peoples immediately acquired writing and, nevertheless, their history has survived to the present day.  The most striking example of this is the ancient city of Troy.  The Greeks learned about him from the blind man Homer, who was able to keep in memory the events of ancient epochs that he had heard earlier, and to tell his fellow tribesmen about them.  For many years, these events were considered nothing more than a myth, a beautiful fiction, and scientists were skeptical about the possibility of the existence of Troy in reality.  But in 1873, undeniable evidence was presented to the world of the existence of this city covered with legends - a German businessman and a Russian merchant named Heinrich Schliemann was able to unearth the walls described by Homer.  And with them he found a considerable number of gold jewelry belonging to the inhabitants of Troy. </p><p>  From that moment, the history of <span>ancient civilizations</span> became the subject of more than close study of historians and archaeologists around the world, the intensity of excavations in Turkey, Egypt and Greece increased.  The data collected during these studies brought science far more questions than answers.  Found evidence of the unusually high development of some civilizations has puzzled <span>classical science</span> .  It is very difficult to explain the exact astronomical observations of the Mayans and Aztecs from the knowledge of the ancient Egyptian priests and pharaohs, to figure out where in the pyramids the models of <span>aircraft that are</span> strikingly reminiscent of modern aircraft are explained.  That is why the history of world civilizations is still full of mysteries, which, perhaps, will be fought by more than one generation of scientists, trying to find the truth.  After all, not all <span>historical monuments</span> are found and not all written sources are deciphered, but interest in them does not fade. </p><p>  Answers to questions about the authors of the ancient pyramids, the Mayan calendar, the origin of the <span>Greek gods</span> have not yet been found.  The number of hypotheses is growing from year to year, many skeptical towards traditional science talk about the intervention of extraterrestrial intelligence in the activities of our ancestors, which means that the history of world civilizations will still bring us many surprises. </p>
