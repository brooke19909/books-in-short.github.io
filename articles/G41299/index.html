This is a famous Japanese warrior, whose defeat at the famous battle of Sekigahara in 1600 allowed the Tokugawa family to become the undisputed rulers of Japan. </p><h2>  Biography of Ishida Mitsunari </h2><p>  Around 1578, he was recruited for the service of Khashib (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi.  In fact, Ishida Mitsunari lived in the time of Troubles.  During military service in Shizugatak and elsewhere, his main function was administrative.  For its service, it received a possession giving 200,000 coca of rice, and the castle of Savayama in Omi.  Many did not trust him and many did not like him.  Partly due to the fact that he was "civilian" in origin, partly due to the power that he possessed in the Toyotomi government.  He issued numerous orders from Hideyoshi and often acted as his representative.  He was sent to Korea during the second campaign in 1597. </p><p>  The following year, after the Korean campaign, having received the support of three regents (Mori Terumoto, Uesugi Kagekatsu and Ukita Hiddy), Mitsunari rallied many daimyos (mainly from the western provinces) against Ieyasu.  One of his first actions was to take as hostages the wives of Tokugawa supporters who ended up in Osaka.  On August 22, the Sekigahara campaign began. </p><p>  <span>Well-</span> earned during the service of <span>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span> , a warrior who reunited Japan after more than a century of civil war, Ishida Mitsunari was appointed head of a small feudal family and soon became one of the most prominent officials in the new government.  After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, he maintained his state position, but real power was exercised by a council of five regents acting on behalf of Hideyoshi Hideyori's son.  The first among the regents was Tokugawa Ieyasu, and in 1599, when Ishida Mitsunari tried to improve his position by trying to sow discord among the Japanese aristocracy, some of Tokugawa's assistants favored his execution, but Tokugawa decided to spare him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait of Isis Mitsunari" class="if uuid-2768126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2768126.jpg"></div><h2>  Military defeat </h2><p>  The following year, however, Ishida Mitsunari convinced Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of the five regents, to oppose Tokugawa.  While the Tokugawa forces were diverted to fight Uesugi in the north, Ishida gathered many other lords to his side and attacked the Tokugawa position from the rear.  Tokugawa quickly returned from the north to defeat the forces of Ishida Mitsunari in Sekigahara.  The capture of Ishida marked the last major confrontation with the Tokugawa government, and in 1603 Tokugawa adopted the hereditary title of shogun, or military dictator, a title that was retained by the Tokugawa family until 1868. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.v.baidu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ishida Mitsunari character" class="if uuid-2768124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2768124.jpg"></div><h2>  Game and anime character </h2><p>  Sengoku BASARA 3 is the third installment of the video game franchise created by Capcom.  This was the first game in which Ishida Mitsunari was introduced as a character.  The reason for its introduction was that the game covered the Sekigahara campaign, which began after the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  In Sengoku BASARA 3, Tokugawa Ieyasu killed Hideyoshi before being able to subjugate the whole country.  Mitsunari was extremely loyal to Hideyoshi and survived his death very hard, mainly because of his betrayal of Ieyasu.  Hideyoshi's ministry was his life, and the man whom he once considered an ally instantly robbed him of everything.  Depending on which story mode the player chooses, the outcome of the battle of Sekigahara changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zerochan.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sengoku BASARA character" class="if uuid-2768127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2768127.jpg"></div><p>  The anime series that follows the game, Sengoku BASARA: Judge End, is more immersed in the characters' characters to show the relationship between them.  This shows that there was a friendship between Ieyasu and Mitsunari, which ended due to betrayal. </p><p>  This character is quite popular, and this popularity has made frequent slash themes about the Time of Troubles Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari. </p>
