    <p>  The line of products offered by Eurokommerts Bank, reviews of which in this connection have a purely positive connotation, are universal offers adapted for a wide range of consumers.  The institution‚Äôs policy is balanced and stable in terms of attracting deposits from individuals.  Clients of the institution have the opportunity to choose the most convenient format of cooperation among a large number of programs.  Many customers speak positively about specialized products for narrow categories of people.  These are universal programs for <span>public servants</span> and for employees of the budget segment, for pensioners and for employees of law enforcement organizations, developed taking into account their profitability and the specifics of their work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bank Partnership Contributors </h2><p>  Yerokommerts Bank, reviews of which are of a recommendatory nature, offers one of the highest <span>deposit</span> interest <span>rates in</span> the domestic financial market.  According to many clients, only within the framework of this financial institution the amount of charges can amount to 16.37% for ruble deposits and 4.5% for dollar deposits.  In accordance with the terms of the program, the duration of the partnership in this case will be 370 days.  The deposit program is known to the general public as ‚ÄúMonaco‚Äù, for it is characterized by automatic prolongation and the possibility of replenishment.  On average, the bank rate, depending on the partnership program and duration of cooperation, can vary from 10.2% to 16.37% for accounts in rubles, and from 1% to 4.5% for accounts in European currency and in dollars.  Investors willingly accept the proposals of a financial institution and leave very positive feedback about them. </p><h2>  What about payouts? </h2>

    <p>  Eurokommerts Bank, reviews of which confirm what was said below, throughout its entire history of existence has always been faithfully fulfilling its obligations.  The financial institution has suffered difficult times: the <span>crisis of 1998</span> and 2014.  Investors do not leave mass feedback that a financial institution does not pay and ignores appeals.  Despite the minor inconveniences that some clients write about, in particular, a delay of several days with the payment of the deposit and interest on it or an incorrectly accrued interest, seem insignificant against the background of the problems faced by customers of bankrupt banks that cannot return their money at all .  Eurokommerts Bank, reviews of which are pushing for partnership, inspires confidence in connection with a long history. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The work of the bank during the December hype of 2014 </h2>

    <p>  According to reviews, Eurocommerce Bank always tried to pay deposits and interest regularly.  He also adequately received clients during the December chaos with a sharp drop in the ruble exchange rate.  People note that the service scheme at this difficult time was adequate and focused on the interests of each person.  The service of all interested persons, and there were many of them, was carried out not only by the operators.  Customers were received by executives and credit managers.  People emphasized the fact that a bathroom for customers worked within the office, which left a positive impression of cooperation.  The responses say that for the convenience of depositors, since January 2015, a separate window of the operator has been working in the Moscow branch of the bank, which dealt exclusively with issues related to deposits. </p><h2>  What do bank ratings say and do they affect the activities of a financial institution </h2>

    <p>  In February 2012, the National Rating Agency established a rating for a financial institution.  Eurocommerce Bank received the ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù category and the second level of creditworthiness.  On February 5, 2015, the NRA confirmed its preliminary decision and the ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù category.  The only ‚Äúbut‚Äù is a negative outlook for the further development of the bank.  The relatively high rating on the national scale is due to the high share of assets with instant liquidity included in the bank's net assets.  We can talk about a good level of capital adequacy, which opens up broad prospects and opportunities for increasing the volume of active operations in the medium term.  The high rating is largely due to deposits of individuals, 96% of which are covered by the guarantee of the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Pressure on the rating level and, in particular, the basis for the negative outlook was an increase in losses in the second half of 2014.  A twofold increase in arrears and low indicators of the ratio of collateral and growth of the loan portfolio was noted.  Despite the dissemination of this information by special agencies, the activities of the bank have not changed.  Evrokommerts, a <span>bank whose reliability rating</span> has been called into question, continues to fulfill its obligations. </p><h2>  Minor complaints </h2>

    <p>  Like any other financial institution, this institution can meet not only positive, but also negative feedback.  Eurokommerts Bank (Vladikavkaz), for example, is often rated as a low-professional financial institution.  There are references to inappropriate behavior of the operation.  Some people talk about the rudeness of employees.  On the other hand, there are quite often refutations, in which the <span>bank's customers</span> believe that negative statements have no objective basis.  Eurokommerts is a bank whose reliability rating is high enough against the background of the actual situation in the financial world, characterized as a reliable institution, with which many citizens of the state are happy to build partnerships.  It is very difficult to talk about which of the descriptions of partnerships is true. </p><h2>  Inside look </h2>

    <p>  Eurokommerts is a bank whose branch addresses (by city) are available on the institution‚Äôs main site and is described by employees as a good financial institution.  Employees of the institution constantly focus on the wonderful team and at a decent level of wages.  The authorities treat subordinates with great respect.  Eurocommerce Bank (Vladikavkaz) has never practiced rudeness, insults and rudeness at any of the management levels.

    <p>  Another advantage that Eurokommerts Bank (Moscow) can offer, the addresses of which will be presented below, is favorable credit conditions.  Customers talk about the possibility of receiving cash in the amount of 10 thousand rubles and up to 550 thousand rubles.  Pleasantly pleases many the opportunity to pre-repay the loan without any additional fees in any amount and at any time, which opens up opportunities for savings by reducing overpayments.  Eurocommerce Bank offers deposits and deposits taking into account the interests of residents of the state, which gives it certain competitive advantages.  As practice and numerous reviews have shown, a financial institution does not deceive its customers by charging hidden fees and withdrawing unexpected payments.  Even a negative forecast of agencies and a low rating do not affect the serious attitude to their obligations.  Eurocommerts Bank, despite minor collapses in its work, continues to conduct its professional activities serving many customers at a fairly high level. </p><p>  For reference: in Moscow, bank branches can be found at the following addresses: Kotlyakovsky 1-ya per., 1, p. 99;  st.  Obraztsova, 4;  st.  Sharikopodshipnikovskaya, 13, p. 3. </p>
