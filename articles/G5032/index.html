  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most exciting activity for a young or expectant mother is knitting booties.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A newborn baby is a tiny and very moving creature that touches every person.  Small legs in beautiful sliders, tiny handles peek out from the sleeves of the shirt, a very pretty face framed by a lace cap - can you not smile?  But still, something in this lovely picture is missing.  What exactly?  Of course, beautiful booties. </p><p>  Knitting booties is probably the most fascinating activity that a woman who is expecting a baby can come up with for herself.  After all, these cute little things are so beautiful, they were invented just for the smallest children, they keep the warmth of our hands, a part of the soul invested in them, because we do it for our dearest little man.  <span>Knitting booties for</span> many seems to be a very complicated process, but this is not at all the case, you just need to sort out the details a little.  And if you spend a little time studying the patterns and describing the work process, then even completely inexperienced knitters do not have any particular difficulties. </p><p>  If you could not figure out knitting, you can <span>crochet the booties,</span> as this is much easier.  Than?  The fact that many loops knit immediately on the knitting needles, and if a woman had never before taken a needle in her hands, she might just get confused, upset, and lose the desire to create this little miracle for her baby.  <span>Crocheting booties is</span> easier, since there is only one working loop, and the variety of existing models is simply amazing. </p><p>  Here, for example, is one of the simplest and easiest options for booties.  Crochet a chain of five ordinary loops, lock it in a ring and knit 1 row with single crochet in a circle - 2 columns in each loop.  Next, knit 5-6 rows in a circle in single crochet rows; in each of them, 3 more columns should be evenly added to the number of existing ones.  Then knit rows of single crochets in the opposite direction in the same way in a circle, but without increases and without closing the row so that the hole for the leg is obtained at the top.  Knit in this way 8-10 rows (it depends on the desired size), then knit the heel of the booties, or just sew an open place, folded in half.  Next, tie the top of the product.  To do this, you need to fix the thread on the front of the booties in the place where the hole for the leg opens, and knit one row in a circle of this hole with columns with one crochet - two columns in each hole.  Then attach a thread of a different color, and tie the resulting frill with single crochet in one row.  After that, it remains only to tie two chains of strapping threads - these will be the laces, which then will be pulled into the existing holes under the frill, pulled slightly and tied.  It turns out a pair of very cute slippers with ruffles.  And to the laces, if desired, you can attach pompons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any version of booties knits very quickly, because little things are small, and therefore crocheting booties is possible even for those who are not very patient and want to quickly see the result of their work.  The booties themselves are much more convenient than socks, because they have various ties that fix them well on the legs of the child.  You can put them on any clothes, since they are perfectly stretched, which allows you to put them on top of thin sliders, <span>warm tights,</span> and even panties, if necessary.  And the choice of models simply knows no boundaries.  You can tie booties in the form of slippers, shoes, shoes, socks, with frills, ruffles, lace, buttons, ribbons, knit intricate flowers or animal faces, embroider with beads, large beads. </p><p>  Some confidently argue that booties, tied by the mother‚Äôs hands while waiting for the baby or after his birth, will warm his legs a hundred times better than any, even the most beautiful and high-quality, but bought in the store, booties. </p><p>  Knitting booties has one very important point - the yarn consumption on them is small, and if desired, they can be created from the leftovers.  But still, the yarn should be good, high-quality and soft.  If the product is knitted for winter, it is best to choose natural wool.  Currently, the choice of yarn is very wide, and you can find absolutely any colors and their shades.  In this case, you should not save and buy cheap synthetics or coarse artificial wool thread.  After all, this is for your baby, and in his wardrobe there should be no place for things made of non-natural materials.  In the event that summer is in the yard, it is best to choose thin cotton yarn, and knit booties themselves according to the patterns of openwork patterns so that the child's legs do not overheat. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the color scheme.  If you want to knit booties with multi-colored ones, then choose colors that are in harmony with each other and, of course, combined with the clothes of the child.  You should not make him look like a circus clown and dress up in bright, screaming outfits, because good taste is instilled from infancy.  So, everything should be beautiful and harmonious, because at this age, booties are not just an element of clothing, but, perhaps, the main and very first decoration that a baby has. </p>
