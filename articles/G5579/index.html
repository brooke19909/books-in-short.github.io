    <h2>  The path to the profession </h2><p>  A native of the Saratov region, Sergei Bogdan was born in 1962, <span>on March 27.</span>  But his childhood passed in Voskresensk near Moscow, where his parents moved from Volsk.  The city was not far from the landing course of <span>the Zhukovsky airfield,</span> so the most modern military aircraft flew over the inhabitants.  In addition, the father of the future celebrity served in aviation - all this predetermined the further choice of a profession. </p><p>  There is a known case when a young man, checking himself, climbed onto a crane, swinging it in all directions.  Although he himself claims that he fears heights and has never been extreme.  Any person, not feeling support underfoot, experiences some discomfort, but insecurity disappears after regular parachute jumps. </p><p>  Sergei Leonidovich Bogdan is a graduate of the Borisoglebsky Military Pilot School.  Since 1983, he flew on the Su-17M2, having risen to the squadron commander (Naval Aviation Regiment, Black Sea Fleet). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beginning of a test pilot career </h2><p>  After eight years of service in combat units, Sergei Bogdan entered CPPL (Akhtubinsk).  This was not an unexpected decision.  As a child, he read out books about Gallay and Chkalov, although he pushed him to try his hand at the <span>profession of a test pilot,</span> Colonel Neznanov, who is responsible for air fire and tactical training.  He carefully monitored the results of the ward, seeing the necessary inclinations. </p><p>  It was possible to realize the desire only after 4 years.  Before transferring to the fleet, pilot Bogdan Sergey Leonidovich served in Mongolia, from where it was not possible to come to Russia.  Going in 1991 from the Crimea to Akhtubinsk for an interview, he immediately got to the entrance exams.  I must say, it was such a difficult test that the officer dropped 30 kg of weight. </p><p>  In parallel, he entered the Moscow Aviation Institute, for the sake of obtaining the qualifications of a test engineer.  Then he studied and worked in the GLIC, owned by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.  Being a military man, he put on the wing more than 50 types of combat aircraft.  He has the assets of the first landing of Su-25UTG fighters, as well as Su-33 on an aircraft-carrying cruiser.  For this, in 2000, he received the Order of Courage.  And in the same year he retired to the reserve, having the rank of colonel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Work in the company "Sukhoi" </h2><p>  After retiring from the army, test pilot Bogdan Sergey Leonidovich remained in the profession.  He continued to work in the Sukhoi Design Bureau, taking part in the tests of the Su-27SKM, Su-30 MK2, Su-47. </p><p>  He had occasion to make demonstration flights in Russia and in France during aviation exhibitions.  In 2006, he was awarded the title of Honored Test Pilot.  In his track record, by the way, there is not a single bailout. </p><p>  Bogdan admits that 80% of <span>accidents</span> occur due to the human factor, therefore honesty and reliability are considered the main qualities of a professional.  Sometimes, due to the concealment of any information, a whole team of employees has to disassemble the plane almost a screw in search of a non-existent problem. </p><p>  Reliability is important, because in order to conduct tests in extreme modes, you have to prepare for each flight from 1.5 to 3 hours, and at the end of it make a competent analysis.  The focus on results is also important.  So, in the teams of test pilots only a small part reached the level that allows you to perform complex flights.  Since 2003, Bogdan has already begun to prepare for testing fifth-generation fighters.  It was he who happened to fly the famous T-50. </p>

    <h2>  Hero of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The title awarded to Bogdan in 2011 is an assessment of the merits in testing and introducing new aircraft.  The day before, in 2010, a test pilot took a prototype of the future T-50 from the airfield of Komsomolsk-on-Amur.  The flight lasted 45 minutes.  And at the MAKS-2015 air show, the <span>fifth generation fighter</span> was already officially presented, becoming its culmination. </p><p>  Sergei Leonidovich Bogdan once compared the Su-27 to a passenger car that replaced the trucks.  Now the fourth-generation fighter seems heavy and unnatural, and the 4 ++ (Su-35) generation has already demonstrated a new quality of handling, leaving the legendary 27th modification far behind.  The main advantage of the T-50 and its difference from the previous fighter is its low visibility on the radar.  If an aircraft of the same mass can be seen beyond 300 km, then the modern model can be seen beyond 100 km, and this seems to be a huge advantage in battle. </p><p>  The test pilot personally met with President Putin, who was interested in the comparative characteristics of the T-50 and F-22, emphasizing that the improvement of Russian aircraft is in response to the threat.  Sergei Leonidovich Bogdan believes that in terms of super-maneuverability and other characteristics, the domestic aircraft will in no way yield to the American one.  Only the F-22 is in service today, and the T-50 still needs to be improved. </p>

    <h2>  Today </h2><p>  Sergey Bogdan is still in service, heading the Sukhoi flight service and personally performing test flights.  He is an example to his subordinates.  His commitment to the profession is evidenced by his attitude to airplanes, the birth of which he compares with the birth of a child.  The same 9 months are required.  Moreover, over the past four, from 20 to 50 people have been working around the clock on a new instance.  The results of the work of many people, the responsibility to which he always feels, depend on the skill and skills of the tester. </p>
