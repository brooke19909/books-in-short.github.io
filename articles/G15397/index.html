This is unpleasant, and depending on how much was withdrawn, it is also a shame.  The reason for this, most likely, is an activated subscription (or maybe more than one) to some paid service. </p><p>  In this article we will look at how to unsubscribe from a paid subscription if you are tired of losing money from your account.  We‚Äôll show you how to unsubscribe from subscriptions.  "Megaphone" will be the operator, on the example of which the topic of the article will be revealed. </p><h2>  What is a subscription? </h2>

    <p>  Let's start with a general description of what this service is.  So, there is a category of content that is provided directly to the subscriber.  These are various melodies, pictures, jokes, horoscopes and other entertainments that the subscription operator sends to a specific user.  From the account of the latter, in turn, funds are used for using the service, which form the cost of the subscription. </p><p>  As for the initial form of interaction, in order for this service to be available, for example, on your phone, you need to activate it.  The connection mechanism is as follows: you need to go to the service offering this content and enter your phone number.  After that, a special field for the code will be generated on the side of the service, which, in turn, is sent to your phone.  Thus, in order to start using the service, you must first enter the number, and then the code sent to it.  This, in fact, will be a confirmation of your desire to use the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The principle of withdrawing funds from the account </h2>

    <p>  The money that the subscriber pays for the services provided to him is debited gradually, as the latter are used.  In practice, this write-off is expressed in the form of regular payments, most often daily.  For example, it could be 12 rubles a day or something like that.  True, there are also subscriptions for 200 rubles a day.  True, connecting such an operator is not profitable: firstly, not everyone on the account has a sufficient amount, and secondly, the user will notice and disconnect small payments later than in the case of 200-ruble payments. </p><p>  In all other respects, the service fee is charged according to the same model as the money for using any other option.  Therefore, in fact, there is nothing special about this.  If you want money not to go in an obscure direction, find out how to unsubscribe from all subscriptions, and calmly do it! </p><h2>  Subscription ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù </h2>

This means that the service provider company does not always send an informational message that the paid subscription has been activated on a particular number.  In fact, such a message can be displayed to the user who orders the service.  Due to this, a certain problem is obtained: a person who pays ultimately for access to content does not always know about it.  Therefore, often the money is withdrawn from the subscriber‚Äôs phone. </p><h2>  Who is abusing subscriptions? </h2><p>  As you might guess, the connection of this option is often used by unscrupulous service providers, trying to remove additional funds from the subscriber.  It is in their interests, of course, to do this as unobtrusively as possible so that the owner of the phone number continues to use the services for as long as possible. </p><p>  In addition, the operators themselves earn on subscriptions.  Market leaders such as MTS, Megafon and Beeline do not neglect to give suppliers the opportunity to attract subscribers and at the same time make money on people who do not understand why they are being charged. </p>

    <p>  To help those who have already fallen for the bait of subscriptions, this article is written.  In it you will find information on how to unsubscribe from subscriptions.  Megafon will be a prime example to illustrate the operator‚Äôs work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to protect yourself? </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted: it‚Äôs best not to issue any paid services to your phone number at all.  To do this, just do not leave it on third-party sites, and after that do not enter the code sent in the form of SMS on these resources.  Know: with the help of such a mechanism, some paid content can be imposed on you. </p>

    <p>  We go further: suppose it happened that you were imposed yet another unnecessary service, and now money is constantly being withdrawn from your account in an unknown direction.  What to do in this situation?  Everything is simple - we‚Äôll tell you how to unsubscribe from the extra paid services of Megafon.  There are five ways to do this. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  First of all, those who wish to terminate the provision of mobile services are given the opportunity to disable unnecessary options through a mobile site.  This is, of course, done in the Mobile Subscriptions section (Megaphone).  You can unsubscribe from each of the options listed there by a simple click.  When you do this, a message will appear on the screen.  Recall that to enter your personal account you need to log in using a special access code - it is called by the command * 105 * 00 #. </p>

    <h2>  WAP portal </h2><p>  If you have mobile Internet, and there is no way to use it to visit the regular version of the site, you can do it on a special WAP service.  It also provides a paragraph on how to unsubscribe from subscriptions to "Megaphone".  It is called ‚ÄúYour Subscriptions‚Äù, and in it you will see, again, a list of services that can be turned off with a single click. </p><p>  The advantage of such a portal is that the <span>oldest phones that</span> do not have WiFi or 3G can work with it. </p><h2>  application </h2><p>  There is another way to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions.  A modem and high-speed Internet connection are not required for him - just having the ability to install the Mobile Subscriptions application on your phone is enough.  With it, you can, having made the simplest combination of actions, disable or activate new services aimed at providing content for mobile. </p><p>  As it is written on the official website of the provider, the program in question is available on the JAVA platform, that is, it can also be used for older mobile phones. </p><h2>  USSD requests </h2>

    <p>  Of course, another answer to the question of how to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions is short digital USSD commands.  You can send them from any device - either an old mobile phone or a modern smartphone with a wide range of features. </p><p>  To find out what services your number is subscribed to, you need to dial * 505 #.  After that, the response message will show which options are available for you and, accordingly, what you are paying for at the moment.  Then, if you are looking for how to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions, you just need to know the code of each service.  There are a lot of them - they are all on the operator‚Äôs website.  In addition, these codes can be seen in the message that will be sent to your phone.  They look as follows: for example, to deactivate "Video Mail" you need to dial * 105 * 2310 #;  and to cancel the service ‚ÄúWho called?‚Äù  - * 105 * 2400 #. </p><h2>  SIM menu </h2><p>  Another way to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions is a special SIM card menu, which can be called up, again, from any device connected to the network.  To manage the options we are interested in, you need to go to the "Subscriptions" section and see which services are available to you.  Their cost should also be indicated there. </p><p>  Thus, if you want to stop receiving information on one (or several) of them, just go to the services page and click "Opt out".  In general, when compared with the others, this is the easiest and most affordable way to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions. </p><h2>  Popular Megaphone Subscriptions </h2><p>  Those who are looking for how to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions will find it useful to find out some of the most popular services that the operator and content providers are trying to slip to each subscriber.  In particular, we are talking about ‚ÄúChange the beep‚Äù (you can turn off the request * 105 * 9000 #), ‚ÄúAnswering Machine‚Äù (deactivated through the combination * 105 * 1300 #), ‚ÄúPromised payment‚Äù (* 105 * 2800 #).  What all these services mean, you can find out from the tariff plans and options that the operator offers.  As for how to unsubscribe from subscriptions, Megafon gives clear instructions on this subject, which we described above. </p><h2>  Should I refuse? </h2><p>  In general, the instructions described in this article are intended for a user who is clearly confident that he wants to refuse additional services (subscriptions).  Moreover, if you are really interested in the information that some of them provide, you can leave this subscription.  Moreover, you have the opportunity to see the cost at which the service will be provided.  If it is too high, nothing prevents you from reading our article on how to unsubscribe from Megafon subscriptions and following the steps indicated here. </p>
