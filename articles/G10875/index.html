    <h2>  What to see in Sochi and the surrounding area? </h2><p>  Holidays in Sochi is a special mood that appears only in this resort.  No European coast can create such a special atmosphere, which is characteristic exclusively for this city.  However, rest in Sochi is not only many kilometers of beaches and azure waves.  This is also a mass of cultural and historical sights, as well as a huge number of places intended for an exciting pastime. </p><p>  So, for example, the famous aquarium in Sochi - the largest in the whole of Russia - never suffers from a lack of grateful spectators. </p><p>  The entire complex itself consists of 30 aquariums, each of which has a huge number of marine and freshwater animals.  And even in this large complex - its area is about 6000 m <sup>2</sup> - there is its own so-called attraction.  A walk along the 44-meter tunnel can be equated with a deep-sea dive.  Just imagine: flocks of colorful fish, imposing slopes and predatory sharks swim across from left, right and even overhead!  And all this happens against the backdrop of a picturesque sea landscape. </p>
