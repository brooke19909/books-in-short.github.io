Today this hotel is one of the most famous in the capital.  He celebrated his 110th birthday and is proud of his story! </p><h2>  Hotel History </h2><p>  Surprisingly, in the very place where the <span>Metropol Hotel</span> (Moscow) is now located, the <span>hotel was</span> previously located.  The baths worked under him, and this place was very popular among the inhabitants of the city.  At the end of the 19th century, the hotel was sold.  In its place, according to the plan, they had to create a new hotel complex that would meet the cultural level of Moscow. </p><p>  The only owner of the Metropol Hotel in Moscow at that time was S.I.  Mammoths.  He chose the project of the architect V. Valcot, after which the construction began.  Alas, Mamontov was not destined to implement this brilliant idea, he was convicted in the embezzlement case and soon lost his fortune.  The new owners rebuilt the old complex, making a number of adjustments to the Valcot project.  The opening took place in 1905. </p>

    <p>  The hotel at that time was luxury.  Here, guests were offered such wonders as a telephone and refrigerators, and all rooms were spacious and each decorated in its own unique style.  Soon, a cinema was opened at the hotel, which only further surprised the guests of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the formation of the Soviet regime, the hotel did not work for its intended purpose.  Here was the Second House of Soviets.  That was until 1930, after which the complex again became a high-level hotel. </p><h2>  The architectural value of the complex </h2><p>  Moscow today is not just the capital, but also the historical center of Russia.  Each building is a value.  This also applies to such a building as the Metropol (hotel, Moscow).  The history of the complex began in the era when modern was in fashion.  Its spirit is felt especially in the exterior of the building. </p><p>  The paintings inside were made by such famous masters as Vasnetsov and Korovin.  The interior decoration is characterized by different styles, as was originally planned by Mamontov.  The whole complex appears to the visitor as a historically valuable architectural ensemble.  Majolica panels occupy a special place in it.  Among them - the work "Princess Dreams", made by Vrubel and now transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery.  Previously, any passer-by could admire this work of art on the facade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel metropol moscow address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39334/1136562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Also a great advantage of the hotel is its location.  Directly on the Theater Square, a few steps from the Kremlin, stands the Metropol Hotel (Moscow).  Her address: Teatralny proezd, house 2. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the hotel rooms were originally decorated in various styles and were distinguished by sophistication and luxury.  Today, Metropol is a hotel (Moscow), which offers its guests six accommodation options.  All numbers are described below.  Here, even a standard level number is able to impress guests of the capital.  As it was historically conceived, the differences between the numbers of the same level are preserved here.  That is, none of them is like the other. </p><ul><li>  Room "standard" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Superior room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 m2. </li><li>  Junior Suite with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 m2. </li><li>  Room "Executive Suite" - from 56 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Room "Grand Suite" - from 85 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Room "Presidential Suite" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã92.2 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul><p>  The apartments have antique furniture, chandeliers and other details.  All of them are made in a classic style. </p><h2>  Halls of the complex </h2><p>  The glory of the building was brought not only by the stylistic decoration and modern equipment of that time.  Hotel "Metropol" (Moscow) is a variety of halls.  What do they look like today and what are they for? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Metropol Hotel Moscow" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39334/1136635.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In total, there are nineteen different halls, large and small, for guests.  They are used for all kinds of events.  These are banquets, presentations, meetings and so on.  The employees of the complex assure that their approach in working with small groups of 15 people or a large number of guests of several hundred will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Famous guests </h2><p>  The hotel saw many high-level guests.  At one time, Alexander Kuprin and the great composer Sergei Prokofiev lived here.  Also, Mao Zedong, <span>Marlene Dietrich,</span> Pierre Cardin, Michael Jackson, Julio and Enrique Iglesias, Placido Domingo and others stayed in the rooms. </p><p>  In 1991 the hotel was again restored and opened in its original form.  He was also evaluated by a special commission, which assigned him a well-deserved rating of five stars. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The complex operates on a "breakfast" system.  They are served with a special delicacy.  A variety of dishes will surprise any client, and the sounds of the harp in the morning will tune to the desired mood, and the day will pass just fine.  It cannot be otherwise, because this is Moscow! </p><p>  Hotel "Metropol" also offers its guests to taste delicious dishes in the restaurant "Savva" from the chef A. Shmakov.  You can eat here not only when staying. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metropol hotel moscow history" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39334/1136763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The administration pays a lot of attention to seasonal discounts, as well as all kinds of promotions.  Some are held with the participation of the Bolshoi Theater, to get to the performance of which will help Metropol (hotel, <span>Moscow).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> of Russian ballet are always positive.  This is exactly the place that every guest of the capital should visit. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  The fact is that the Metropol Hotel (Moscow), whose address is already a historical value, cannot, in principle, have only positive reviews.  Yes, having read on various sites what clients write, you can come to the conclusion that in most cases this is praise.  It is for this reason that I would like to pay special attention to what the guests liked the most, and to what did not like it. </p><p>  Positive reviews: </p><ul><li>  Of course, absolutely all visitors note the excellent location of the hotel.  In principle, this is his <span>calling card.</span>  The balcony offers a gorgeous view of the Bolshoi Theater.  Who does not dream about it? </li><li>  Also, a positive mark deserves both the external and internal decoration of the hotel.  Those who come to Moscow to shop are always advised to settle in the area.  Here is an abundance of shops of various price categories. </li><li>  Customers also appreciated the setting of breakfast and dinner.  The sounds of the harp during morning coffee were remembered by many.  This is perhaps the most vivid impression of the hotel.  Breakfast includes gourmet dishes and caviar. </li><li>  Valued "Metropol" and Muscovites.  Halls are often rented here for various events.  The quality of service is always kept at a high level. </li></ul>

    <p>  There are also negative reviews.  Which sphere they relate to is described below. </p><p>  Negative feedback: </p><ul><li>  Some guests noted the complexity of the entrance to the complex.  This is not surprising and applies not only to rush hours.  Very often, when driving in personal vehicles, you can encounter such a problem. </li><li>  Also, guests who visited the hotel in the winter months wrote that the room was somewhat cold.  There was also a wish that the floors in the bathrooms be warm. </li><li>  The Metropol Hotel (Moscow), the photo of which is presented in our article, according to some users, is already in need of repair.  Recall that the restoration was last carried out in the 80s.  Of course, carrying out repairs in such a complex is a special event, including an expensive one.  Perhaps soon this issue will be resolved. </li><li>  Some guests noted that the price / quality ratio in the hotel was somewhat inconsistent with what was stated.  With the high cost of rooms there is no feeling of complete comfort.  It seemed to someone that the price included a percentage of the effective location.  This is probably true. </li></ul><p>  Otherwise, the guests have no complaints about anything. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The desire to visit Moscow and study its history leads many to this wonderful place.  The Metropol Hotel (Moscow) survived the change of the tsarist regime, the revolution, the Soviet period, and today it still adorns the capital of Russia. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter for what purpose the guest arrived at the hotel.  It will be convenient for absolutely everyone.  From here it is close at hand to Red Square, the Maly and Bolshoi theaters, to all kinds of shops and attractions.  The hotel itself is a museum of the history of the city, which is worth a visit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metropol hotel moscow reviews" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39334/1136870.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If there is no opportunity to settle here, you can come here for breakfast or dinner and plunge into the pleasant atmosphere, which is all enveloped here.  Metropol is a hotel that is not like the others.  You can scold him or give praise, but, in spite of everything, the historical value of the complex is his calling card. </p><p>  Those wishing to stay here should remember that the hotel is an object of cultural heritage of the Russian Federation.  Carrying out repairs here is not just an expensive pleasure.  That is why the restoration is carried out once a decade. </p>
