It contains numbers, notes, photos, and most importantly - a SIM card.  How to restore SIM card "TELE2", what to do first of all, where to call and what documents are needed for recovery, we will consider further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore SIM card2" class="if uuid-3024323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3024323.jpg"></div><h2>  SIM card lock </h2><p>  The first thing to do before restoring the lost SIM "TELE2", if your phone was stolen, is to block it.  As soon as possible, call the customer service center and inform the operator about the theft or loss of the SIM card.  The number will be blocked, and you can protect yourself and your family from the actions of scammers. </p><h2>  Cases in which SIM is restored </h2><p>  There are a number of cases where the subscriber can restore the SIM "TELE2": </p><ol><li>  Theft or loss. </li><li>  Blocking due to incorrectly entered pack code. </li><li>  Damage to the SIM card. </li><li>  With the wrong SIM card format. </li></ol><h2>  Recovery Documents </h2><p>  If the subscriber has lost the SIM "TELE2", how to restore it again?  In order to do this, you need to bring to the service center: </p><ul><li>  Passport for citizens of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Passport for foreign citizens. </li><li>  Military ID for people doing military service. </li></ul><h2>  SIM card is registered to another person </h2><p>  How to recover a lost SIM card "TELE2" if, when buying a card, the number was issued to another person?  For example, someone from your friends decided to purchase a SIM card with a beautiful number as a gift and designed it for themselves.  If the SIM card presented to you is lost, there is still a way out.  Contact the person in whose name the service contract has been drawn up, come to the office of the company and ask to renew the contract in your name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tarif.help" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can restore SIM card Tele2" class="if uuid-3024325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3024325.jpg"></div><h2>  When the number cannot be restored </h2><p>  It is impossible to restore the SIM "TELE2" only in one case: when more than six months have passed since the last use of the number.  If the subscriber has not used the number for 180 days, the service contract is considered terminated.  The number goes to resale for another subscriber. </p><h2>  Replacing an old SIM card </h2><p>  Suppose, when you purchased a new phone number, you had a regular push-button telephone.  Time passed, and you wanted to change it, for example, to a smartphone.  Then you have to change the SIM card.  New phone models do not support the old SIM card format and are focused on nano-SIM cards.  What if you encounter such a problem? </p><p>  Contact the office where you can restore the SIM "TELE2" in the new format, having received a duplicate of it.  The old SIM card will be blocked.  You can replace a SIM card even if a chip is damaged on it, physical contacts are erased, or it suddenly stops being detected by the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-on.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lost SIM card tele2 how to recover" class="if uuid-3024327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3024327.jpg"></div><h2>  For owners of corporate tariffs </h2><p>  Subscribers with the corporate tariff plan restore the SIM "TELE2" in a slightly different way.  To do this, you need to contact the personal manager of the department for working with corporate clients.  Documents required: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The manager needs to give an application to replace the SIM card with the signature of the director of the company. </li><li>  Contract for services. </li><li>  Passport, or other identification document. </li><li>  If the director of the company personally seeks help, a power of attorney is not required.  The director can carry with him only the seal of the company. </li></ol><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  How much does it cost to restore SIM "TELE2"?  A subscriber pays an employee of the company in the office for a new kit with a SIM card of 50 rubles, regardless of the tariff plan.  This money immediately goes to the subscriber's account, and he can again use the services of a mobile operator.  Thus, the replacement of SIM cards is completely free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-on.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover lost SIM card tele2" class="if uuid-3024330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3024330.jpg"></div><h2>  Rates and Subscriptions </h2><p>  When the subscriber managed to restore the SIM "TELE2", the following question arises: is the information that was on the old saved on the new SIM?  Some information can be restored without loss, this includes: </p><ul><li>  subscriber's tariff plan; </li><li>  phone number; </li><li>  subscriptions and services available on the room. </li></ul><p>  But the contacts, unfortunately, cannot be saved; they will have to be restored on their own.  To avoid the problem of losing numbers in the future, we recommend using the backup option, then your data will be safe and losing a SIM card will be painless. </p><p>  Restore SIM "TELE2" is not difficult.  The main thing is not to forget to bring your passport with you and contact your nearest customer service center.  Simka delivery by courier is not provided.  Also, it will not be possible to restore the number through a third party - the client must contact the company personally with his passport. </p>
