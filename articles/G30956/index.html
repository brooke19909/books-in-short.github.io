How to get to Sofievskaya square?  What interesting objects are located on it?  This will be discussed in this article. </p><p>  Many interesting places can boast of Kiev.  Sofievskaya Square is one of the main points on the list of every tourist.  Here is <span>St. Sophia Cathedral</span> with a majestic bell tower, a monument <span>to Bogdan Khmelnitsky</span> and other attractions. </p><h2>  Sofievskaya Square - the heart of Kiev </h2><p>  In 1036, it was at this place that the army of Yaroslav the Wise defeated the Pechenegs.  In honor of this momentous event, the Prince of Kiev ordered the construction of a magnificent cathedral.  Next to it came the area, which was initially called Starokievskaya. </p><p>  Since the XVI century, veche (public meetings) were held at this place, regular fairs were organized.  It was here that the people of Kiev met the army of Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the Liberation War of the Ukrainian people of 1648-1654.  In the middle of the XIX century, the square got its modern name and became known as <span>Sofievskaya (Sofiyskaya).</span> </p>

    <p>  Many important historical events took place here in the twentieth century.  The III Universal, proclaiming the Ukrainian People‚Äôs Republic, was solemnly adopted on the square.  This event took place in 1917.  And in 1990, Sophia Square became the starting point for the so-called living chain connecting Kiev and Lviv.  This event was attended by at least 1 million people! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sofievskaya Square: how to get there </h2><p>  Today, the square is a favorite vacation spot for Kiev residents and guests of the capital.

    <p>  The easiest way to get to the square is as follows: drive to the Zoloti Vorota metro station (green line) and walk about 700 meters north along Vladimirskaya Street.  You can also get here by trolley (number 16 or 18). </p><p>  There is another, more exotic, way to get to Sofievskaya.  To do this, get off at the Pochtovaya Ploshchad metro station, take the funicular to the Mikhailovsky Golden-Domed Cathedral and walk along Vladimirsky Passage to the square. </p><h2>  Saint Sophia Cathedral - a monument of ancient Russian architecture </h2><p>  Speaking of St. Sophia Square, one cannot but mention the cathedral standing nearby.  This magnificent building is one of the oldest and most prominent in Europe.  St. Sophia Cathedral, along with all the adjacent buildings of the architectural complex, is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p>

    <p>  "Architectural fairy tale" - this is how one of the modern Ukrainian local historians enthusiastically describes this cathedral.  It was built by the Byzantine masters in the 11th century.  Although the exact date of construction is unknown to scientists and researchers.  According to the annals <span>("The Tale of Bygone Years"),</span> this happened in 1037.  However, many are skeptical of this date, since at the same time, according to the same <span>Nestor the Chronicler,</span> a number of other large buildings and temples of <span>Ancient Kiev</span> were erected <span>.</span>  And this is impossible physically.  Most likely, by 1037 the author had in mind the moment the construction of all these buildings was completed.  Based on this, researchers offer several dates for the founding of St. Sophia Cathedral: 1011, 1017, or 1022. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bell tower of the complex, which is directly adjacent to the square, was erected much later - in the XVIII century, during the time of Ivan Mazepa's hetmanism.  Initially, it was three-tiered.  Later, in the 19th century, the fourth tier of the bell tower was completed.  Its height is 76 meters. </p><p>  On the bell tower of the cathedral is the bell "Mazepa", dating from the same XVIII century.  It is the largest among the ancient bells of Ukraine.  Its diameter is about one and a half meters. </p><h2>  Other monuments in the square </h2><p>  The second dominant of Sophia Square is a monument to the Ukrainian hetman Bogdan Khmelnytsky, installed in 1888.  One very <span>interesting legend</span> is associated with this monument <span>.</span>  They say that the monument was originally installed so that the Khmelnytsky mace pointed to Warsaw.  However, in this position, the back of the horse was turned towards the Kiev shrine - St. Michael's Cathedral.  The sculpture had to be deployed, and now Bogdan threatens with his hetman's mace in a northerly direction - either towards Moscow, or Sweden. </p>

    <p>  Sofievskaya Square is a sacred place for Kiev.  This was understood by all the conquerors of the city, who first of all tried to establish their banners or monuments-symbols on it.  So, in February 1919, the Bolsheviks, having captured the city, immediately installed busts on Lenin and Trotsky on Sofievskaya Square, and also made the obelisk ‚ÄúGlory to the October Revolution!‚Äù  (from plywood).  Later, all this was destroyed by the whites who occupied Kiev in six months. </p><h2>  Finally... </h2><p>  Sofievskaya Square is spacious, but not grandiose, majestic and at the same time restrained.  It was laid back in the XI century and has since seen a lot.  Today, tourists and locals like to walk around the square.  It becomes especially beautiful in the dark - in the lights of the evening illumination. </p>
