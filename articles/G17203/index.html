    <h2>  How long to travel from Antalya to Alanya? </h2><p>  With such a move will face all the tourists who plan to relax in Alanya, as the nearest airport is in Antalya.  If you are resting in Antalya, but want to see the sights of another resort, then this question will also be relevant for you. </p><p>  The distance between these two popular settlements is just over 133 km.  What is the time to go from Antalya to Alanya?  The answer to this question depends on how exactly you will get.  If you go by car, then, as experienced travelers say, even with stops for a short rest, you can meet two hours.  This is the fastest option.  Everyone else will take more time.  It: </p><ul><li>  transfer from travel agency; </li><li>  bus; </li><li>  Taxi; </li><li>  car. </li></ul><p>  There is no railway connection between the cities.  Consider all the available methods as detailed as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  If you purchased a tour </h2><p>  If you are a "package" tourist, then the travel agency will decide the question for you.  At the exit from the airport a transfer bus will be waiting.  How long it takes to get from Antalya to Alanya in this case will depend on the congestion of the road, as well as on how many hotels you need to transport arrivals.  It‚Äôs worth focusing on 3-4 hours, as experienced tourists write.  But the road will not be boring, as the guide tells a lot of interesting and useful things about Turkey. </p><p>  If you prefer to travel on your own, then you have to choose between a bus, taxi or car rental. </p>

    <h2>  Riding a bus </h2><p>  To catch the intercity bus, you must first get from the airport to the Otogar Antalya bus station.  You can do this on a local minibus.  The stop is located at the exit of the airport's internal terminal  The bus runs every half hour.  Starts work at 5-30, ends at 01-00.  For travel you need to pay about two euros.  It will take about an hour to travel. </p><p>  From the bus station in Alanya there are a lot of buses.  They do not have numbers, but each says what city it should be in.  Departure takes place every half hour.  A ticket is purchased either at the box office or from the driver (then money must be given at the exit, not at the entrance), costs 8-10 euros per person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An important point: buses do not go at night, the last flight leaves at 20-00, and the first - at 6-00.  If you arrived late, you can either take a taxi or wait in the morning for the airport. </p><p>  Travel time will be 3-3.5 hours, as there will be small stops.  Let‚Äôs now calculate how much to travel from Antalya Airport to Alanya.  It turns out that 4.5 hours of time only on the road without taking into account expectations, movements and other things. </p><p>  Turkish buses are as comfortable as airplanes.  They have comfortable seats, air conditioning, personal lighting, small televisions with headphones.  The driver's assistant will definitely warn you in advance about the stop.  You will enjoy the ride. </p>

    <h2>  We are taking a taxi </h2><p>  It will take no more than five minutes to search for a car; parking is located opposite the exit from the airport terminal building.  And if you book in advance, the driver will meet you with a sign at the exit from the arrivals area. </p><p>  The cost of the trip depends on the type of car.  If the economy option, then from 60 euros, if you need a minibus - from 70 euros.  In the case of traveling with a family or company, it will turn out even inexpensively. </p><p>  How long to get from Antalya to Alanya by taxi?  Travel time is 2.5 hours. </p><h2>  Driving a car </h2><p>  Two popular resorts are connected by the D-400 highway, which is considered one of the main roads in Turkey, so do not be surprised at the frantic traffic.  The route follows along the seashore, crosses small towns where it will not work fast. </p>

    <p>  The road is boring and hard can only seem to the driver.  Passengers will admire the magnificent scenery outside the window: the gentle sea, picturesque mountains and pines. </p><p>  Since the entire road is equipped with detailed signs, you won‚Äôt get lost.  The path will take, as mentioned above, 2-2.5 hours. </p><p>  There is only one minus in this situation: gasoline is expensive in Turkey (in 2017 - about 85 rubles per liter).  The budget of such a trip will be about 20 euros. </p><p>  Since there is very little cafe on the way, take a snack with you. </p><p>  Now you know all the answers to the question, how many hours to go from Antalya to Alanya. </p><h2>  Antalya and Alanya: which is better? </h2><p>  This is a question on which the debate will probably never subside.  Therefore, we will only briefly consider the most interesting, both there and there. </p><p>  Antalya is a large and noisy city, where there are many modern hotels, cafes and restaurants, shops and discos, water parks and amusement parks.  Here life is in full swing.  There are so many historical sights in Antalya that it can take a whole vacation to get to know them.  This is the gate of Hadrian, which is already 2000 years old, <span>the Hydyrlyk tower,</span> Ataturk's house-museum, beautiful mosques.  There are also wonderful natural sights - Duden waterfalls, <span>K√∂pr√ºl√º canyon,</span> Karaalioglu park. </p><p>  Alanya is a very atmospheric town, in the center it is noisy and fun, and remote areas will delight those who love solitude and silence.  The main attraction is the red brick tower of Kyzyl-Kul.  The Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale is very spectacular, it is especially beautiful at night when the backlight turns on.  There are interesting museums - ethnographic and archaeological.  Of the natural attractions, it is worth visiting the <span>Damlatas cave,</span> inside which there are many colorful stalactites and stalagmites.  Very interesting are the Cave of Lovers and the Phosphoric Cave, which was so named because of the glow effect due to the presence of phosphorus in the walls and arches.  And just walking on this amazing town is very nice. </p>
