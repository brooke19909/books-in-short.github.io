  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit a sweater. Tips for beginner needlewomen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitting is a very old kind of applied art and very interesting.  Perhaps the most surprising thing in it is that for many centuries things hand-crocheted or knitted do not go out of fashion, on the contrary, the wider the fashion industry develops, the more technological its production becomes, the more popular and interesting is knitwear .  You can quickly learn simple knitting techniques and simple types of knitting.  Any, even bizarre, pattern consists of combinations of the most basic loops - front, back and yarn. </p><p>  What can be advised to beginner knitters?  Any technique is better to master directly when creating even the simplest, but practical knitted thing.  Choose a simple model of a hat, scarf or bag, knitted with ordinary scarf, and begin to master this amazing type of needlework.  Having learned how to knit the main loops, make additions and decreases, you can proceed to more serious things, for example, a blouse or sweater. </p><p>  How <span>to knit a sweater?</span>  On the Internet or in needlework magazines you can find many interesting models with a detailed description.  We will focus on the most basic recommendations and some of the intricacies of knitting, which you need to know before starting work. </p><p>  So, it is very important to make a paper pattern of the model you like, with which you must consult with during the work.  Then you should make the correct calculation of the loops for the set, taking into account the thickness of the yarn and knitting needles.  To do this, before <span>knitting a</span> sweater, a small report of the pattern is performed, it is steamed, smoothed, then measured and, according to the size of the pattern, the required number of loops for each individual part is calculated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any sweater model consists of a back, front and sleeves.  But you can knit them in different ways.  For example, you can try knitting a sweater with knitting needles from the neck, a single piece that includes the back immediately, in front and the raglan sleeves.  The easiest way is to alternately knit the back, then the front, and then after two sleeves.  It is advisable to knit both sleeves from different balls on the same knitting needles at once, then it will not be necessary to remember the number of added and decreased loops when knitting the head.  If the sleeve is on a cuff connected with an elastic band, then in the next row after the elastic band the number of loops is uniformly gathered along the width of the sleeve <span>at the elbow.</span>  After the elastic on the back and the shelf, they also make uniform addition of loops along the width of the parts in the armhole. </p><p>  How to knit a high collar sweater?  If you plan to knit the collar separately, and then sew it on, you can not round the neck with the help of decreases, but before attaching the collar, simply tie it with a hook.  To knit a rounded neck, part of the loops (1/3) in the center of the part are closed in one row, and then knit two loops together through the row together to the width of the shoulder. </p><p>  How to knit a round neck knit sweater?  Before work, they necessarily make up a pattern-scheme for which, in addition to the usual sizes, you need to know the circumference of the gate.  This value is divided into six parts: one sixth put on the sleeve and two sixth on the front and back.  The diagram indicates the four diagonal raglan lines coming from the gate.  These lines will need to make increases.  Add loops of crochets or knit from one to three.  When the raglan line is knitted completely, knitting is divided, and each part (front, back and sleeves) is knitted separately. </p><p>  How to knit a multi-colored sweater?  To knit stripes or ornament using yarn of different colors.  A beautiful texture is obtained if before starting work, sew multi-colored pieces of yarn into a single thread, then wind them into one ball.  You will get a pattern of chaotic stripes of various widths and lengths. </p><p>  Getting to the implementation of the knitted model, you need to consider one truth.  A beautiful thing will turn out only if you do it very carefully, sequentially, observing the necessary technology. </p>
