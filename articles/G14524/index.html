And in order to understand why the family of the most powerful person in the USSR who had such a sad end, why the granddaughter of Brezhnev Victoria abandoned her daughter, as the latter ended up in Kashchenko, left there and became a homeless person, etc., it‚Äôs worth studying the biographies more deeply his wives, daughters, and, of course, his favorites. </p>

    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  Brezhnev's wife - Victoria Petrovna - was Denisova before her marriage.  However, there is an opinion that her real name is Goldberg.  Victoria Petrovna Brezhneva was born in December 1907 in Belgorod, Kursk province.  She and her husband had two <span>children: son</span> Yuri, who for some reason and then, and today speak very little, and, of course, Galina, who became famous as a lover of the circus and diamonds. </p><p>  Brezhnev was considered the first Soviet politician of the western type.  His white-toothed smile, funny dimples on his cheeks, handsome clothes made women go crazy over him.  They say that the Secretary General himself was not indifferent to the fair sex.  Nevertheless, all his life he was married to one and only.  Sorrows and joys, ups and illnesses were shared only with his wife, Victoria Brezhnev. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Wife Brezhnev </h2><p>  The biography of this woman in the Soviet years was a secret for many.  She always remained in the background.  Victoria Petrovna Brezhneva silently endured the evil rock and misfortunes that fell on her family.  She, who was never interested in either the political or state affairs of her husband, did not intervene in them.  She was quite enough of constantly arising worries with children.  And the Secretary General himself tried not to delve into household chores.  They say that at the slightest opportunity he went hunting, where in Zavidovo, judging by the words of people close to him, his second house was located.  As a rule, the USSR leader left there on Friday afternoon, and returned on Sunday evening. </p><p>  In recent years, as his entourage believed, homeworkers, including Victoria Petrovna Brezhneva herself, were happy with such trips.  The wife believed that constant family troubles became the cause of the disease developing in her husband.  They say that the only one the secretary general loved was Brezhnev‚Äôs granddaughter, Victoria.  In general, the family of the first person in the country had a difficult relationship.  But the biggest trouble he brought Galina Brezhnev.  The daughter of Viktoria Brezhneva, enjoying all the benefits, led a very wild life, so her mother had to hide a lot from her husband. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  "General Headache" </h2><p>  It would seem that from birth Galina was destined to become happy.  She had a loving mother, her father was a high-ranking official, wealth reigned in the house, all doors opened in front of her.  However, the difficult nature of Galina did not allow Brezhnev to live in peace.  At twenty-two, his daughter fled with a circus performer.  Strongman Milayev was much older than her.  Galina easily exchanged her carefree life for the unknown, leaving with him.  They say father went crazy.  He tried to find the prodigal Galina, but she returned only a year later.  When the father saw his daughter and son-in-law, as well as his granddaughter, he forgave them and even recognized Milaev.  After the circus she had many connections, including extramarital affairs.  Galina had several husbands and a lot of lovers.  But her reckless life after the death of her father came to an end. </p>

    <p>  The new government did not like her, they even tried to confiscate Galina‚Äôs car, cottage, jewelry, gifts from her father, but she managed to win the trial.  Brezhnev's daughter rented a summer house to live on this money.  Many commissions in the capital sold items that once belonged to her father.  Galina drank a lot, she died at the age of sixty-nine years in a hospital all alone.  Not even Brezhnev‚Äôs granddaughter, Victoria, whose biography also had many sad moments, was not present on her deathbed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Childhood favorite </h2><p>  The story of the granddaughter, in which Secretary General Leonid Ilyich <span>did not cherish a soul,</span> could be called worthy of a real novel.  Victoria Brezhneva, whose photo often appeared on the covers of magazines, was not only the heiress of a noble name, but also an enviable bride.  The most prestigious grooms of the capital secretly wanted to ask for her hands.  It would seem that a serene and happy life was provided to her until she was old.  But fate decreed in its own way. </p><p>  In childhood, Victoria did not need anything.  Indeed, she was a granddaughter, and beloved, of Leonid Ilyich himself.  But she was sorely lacking in ordinary maternal heat.  And even despite the fact that grandfather and grandmother Victoria Petrovna did not have a soul in their Vitus, she lacked her parents. </p>

    <p>  Galina with her husband constantly disappeared on tour.  Brezhnev's daughter got a job in a circus troupe of a make-up artist to travel around the world with her husband.  She brought expensive gifts to her girl, Victoria played with dolls, which other Soviet children could not even dream of, but apparently this is not happiness.  The girl wanted to walk with her parents, to be more often with mom and dad, but that was clearly not the case with her. </p><p>  Apparently, this is the reason that Victoria was not confident in herself, which affected her future life.  Beloved men often betrayed her, they did not even hide their desire to spend her grandfather‚Äôs money, and even deceived and robbed her.  She lacked human warmth!  Apparently, therefore, she, attached to her teacher from GITIS Raisa Logvinova, was friends with that after graduation.  "Soul-man", just such, according to this woman, was Victoria Brezhnev. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  After finishing school, Galina's daughter first entered the pedagogical institute, but soon transferred to GITIS.  She studied at the faculty of theater, already being a young mother.  Granddaughter of Brezhnev Victoria met her future husband <span>Mikhail Filippov</span> by accident.  He was also a student.  Of course, his grandfather did not dream of such a choice, but he had to come to terms.  The wedding took place.  Soon Victoria Brezhnev, whose biography was supposed to be ‚Äústellar,‚Äù gave birth to a daughter.  She was named after the daughter of Secretary General Galina.  I must say that the grandfather, although he did everything for his favorite, nevertheless, dissatisfied with her choice, did not even give the newlyweds an apartment, and therefore they all lived together in the Brezhnev house. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Victoria loved her husband Misha very much.  At first everything was fine with them.  But when Mikhail fell into the sons-in-law of the first person in a huge country, he began a dizzying career.  And soon there was a lot of money.  As a result, Misha began to walk.  Obviously, Victoria Brezhnev knew about this.  Out of despair, she began to take courtship of Gennady Varakuta - a student of GITIS who came to Moscow from Kiev. </p><p>  When in 1977 Leonid Ilyich found out that his married granddaughter had a stormy romance, he was terribly angry and ordered Andropov to quickly figure it out.  Varakutu was kicked out of the institute for a day, allegedly because drugs were found in his nightstand.  He was sent to Leningrad, but Victoria Brezhneva went after him.  And already in 1978, she, divorcing Mikhail Filippov, married again. </p>

    <h2>  After the death of Leonid Ilyich </h2><p>  When their famous husband, father and grandfather died, misfortunes began to haunt the family.  Immediately everyone was unemployed.  The widow of the Secretary General - Victoria Brezhneva - was evicted from the cottage.  Moreover, her personal pension was even taken away from her.  Galina also began to go into binges, which was greatly facilitated by the conviction of her husband Yu. Churbanov, which happened in 1988. </p>

    <p>  Granddaughter of Brezhnev Victoria did not escape the bitter fate.  Her husband, left without work, tried to do business.  Victoria tried to dissuade him in every possible way.  But he did not listen and, as a result, burned out, losing a lot of money.  Disagreements began in the family, and Gennady Varakuta left his wife and connected his life with Baibakov‚Äôs daughter. </p><h2>  Failures </h2><p>  Victoria Brezhnev was very worried not only for her husband, but also for her mother.  She struggled in every way with the drunkenness of the latter, tried to treat her, but Galina, fleeing the hospitals, insisted that she would still drink.  As a result, the relationship of mother and daughter finally went wrong.  And after the death of Galina Leonidovna, who died at the end of June 1998 in one of the capital‚Äôs special hospitals, Victoria had to exchange two apartments located in Granatov Lane and on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.  She was sorely lacking the means of subsistence.  Victoria Brezhnev herself did not work, and Galina's daughter began to have health problems. </p><h2>  Victim of cheating </h2><p>  Soon Victoria Brezhnev sold the famous grandfather's cottage.  But it ended sadly.  As her ex-husband Mikhail Filippov said, the secretary-general‚Äôs granddaughter fell for the bait that scammers threw at her.  Someone, like a well-known businessman who impersonated her close friend, deceived a woman and robbed him.  At one time he was the owner of the Beijing restaurant, known in certain circles as Kostya Peking, who was subsequently killed.  It was he who persuaded Victoria to conclude a complicated and at the same time incomprehensible purchase and sale transaction.  The granddaughter of Leonid Ilyich, who infinitely trusted the swindler, at his direction entered into the documents not the real, but the symbolic value of her insanely expensive apartment. </p><p>  But the deceiver, having paid her only part of the money, promised to give the rest of the amount later and even gave a receipt, which, however, had no legal effect.  So, Victoria was left without money and the apartment that her mother left her - Galina Brezhneva.  The daughter of Victoria Brezhneva, whose biography is also shocking with her tragedy, lost her home together with her parent. </p><h2>  The story of the "star great granddaughter" </h2><p>  Those who saw her would agree that she has a very strange appearance.  I must say that the daughter of Viktoria Brezhneva was loved by her famous great-grandfather even more than her mother.  From an early age she grew up in luxury and love.  Unlike her mother, she was not deprived of parental love.  People surrounding the family, looking at the little Checkmark, were touched and believed that the girl had a happy and secure future.  But how wrong they were .... </p>

    <p>  Instead of a carefree life, the daughter of Viktoria Brezhneva, Galina, learned from her own experience what poverty, illness, hunger, a psychiatric hospital are, and, finally, the betrayal of the closest and closest person - the mother. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  Victoria Brezhneva gave birth to her on March 14, 1973 in Moscow.  Her father was become a banker thanks to the grandfather of his wife, Mikhail Filippov.  When Galochka was only five years old, her parents separated.  Victoria got married again.  Her stepfather - Gennady Varakuta - was pretty good about the girl.  According to relatives, he raised her as if she were his own daughter. </p><p>  But Victoria Brezhnev with her new husband lived in harmony and love for only a few years.  After some time, problems began in the second family, followed by another divorce. </p><p>  But the great-granddaughter of Leonid Ilyich was always surrounded by care and affection.  Her nanny constantly looked after her.  Nina Ivanovna was always there.  Victoria gave her daughter to an elite Moscow school with an English bias.  And after graduating, Galya entered the Faculty of Philology at Moscow State University.  According to both classmates and classmates, she was a capricious and wayward young lady. </p>

    <h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  After graduating, Galina, with the patronage of her stepfather, got a job as a secretary in one of Moscow companies.  But the answers to phone calls, documentation and coffee preparation for the boss quickly tired of the girl.  She went to the service without much enthusiasm, and when the reductions began, she resigned of her own free will.  Then she was twenty-five years old. </p><p>  The girl‚Äôs biography changed dramatically when her mother - Victoria Brezhneva - found her a bridegroom with the help of a wedding agency.  Oleg Dubinsky - that was the name of the young man - worked as an engineer and, in the opinion of the granddaughter of Leonid Ilyich Victoria, perfectly suited her son-in-law.  Galina did not particularly resist the will of her mother, and therefore agreed to get married.  The wedding of Leonid Ilyich‚Äôs great-granddaughter, held in 1998, was celebrated without much luxury. </p>

    <h2>  Mother and daughter </h2><p>  But the life of the young did not improve in any way.  And once, having finally parted with Oleg, Galina Filippova returned back to her mother.  As a result of life's ups and downs, the woman began to slowly drink, which Victoria Evgenievna did not like. </p><p>  To cure her daughter of addiction, her mother sent her for treatment at the hospital.  Kashchenko.  So Galina, in her incomplete twenty-eight years, first appeared in an institution for the mentally ill.  And while she was there for compulsory treatment, Victoria Brezhneva, confused in real estate transactions, lost two of her very expensive apartments.  And finding herself without a roof over her head, the granddaughter of Leonid Ilyich went to live with her lover in the suburbs. </p><h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  For all the time that Galya was in the hospital, her mother never visited her.  Leaving the clinic, Leonid Ilyich‚Äôs great-granddaughter, finding herself useless and left without a roof over her head, began to wander.  For a whole year, the once-prosperous girl wandered around the Moscow gateways, trying to get herself something to eat from the garbage cans.  In the summer months, she spent the night behind garages next to the Tretyakov Gallery, and in winter, Galina slept in wooden courtyards in the courtyards intended for children's games.  And all this time, Victoria never once asked her. </p><p>  The appearance of <span>Brezhnev‚Äôs great-granddaughter</span> was changed beyond recognition.  Depleted, almost without teeth and with a baldly shaved head, she did not resemble the spoiled young lady she once was. </p>

    <h2>  Conjuncture </h2><p>  This lasted several years.  Once a homeless Galina wandered into the entrance to the building of her ex-husband.  The mother-in-law, who did not recognize her "star" daughter-in-law in a sleeping homeless woman, called an ambulance.  And again, the paramedics took Galya to Kashchenko.  There, at first, none of the medical staff believed that Brezhnev‚Äôs great-granddaughter was in front of them.  And only after she asked her nanny to call to confirm her identity, the attitude towards the young woman changed.  And although the medical staff treated her well enough, it was not possible to leave her in the hospital.  The head of the clinic helped her in <span>disability registration</span> and in determining in a boarding school for mental patients.  Here Brezhnev‚Äôs great-granddaughter spent seven years. </p><h2>  Help came unexpectedly </h2><p> For all the time that Galya was homeless or was in a madhouse, her mother, Victoria, did not remember her daughter.  The woman wrote to her, begging to pick her up, but all requests remained unanswered.  His father, Mikhail Filippov, who currently lives in Malta, did not want to help Galina either.  After a divorce from Victoria, he married again, and the fate of the child from his first marriage did not bother him.  The only person who remembered Gala was her very old nanny.  Only from her daughter Victoria Brezhneva from time to time received parcels with gifts and letters.  And it is not known how the fate of Brezhnev‚Äôs great-granddaughter would have developed if circus artists Natalya and Alexander Milaev had not known about her misadventures.  Victoria <span>'s half-sister</span> and brother have lived in the United States for many years, and therefore did not even know what a sad fate befell their niece.  Today, Galina lives in the Moscow Region, in a one-room apartment, which was bought by someone from her grandfather's entourage. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Victoria Evgenievna Brezhneva - the granddaughter of the Secretary General - believes that she did not betray her daughter.  She herself lives, struggling from bread to water, trying to earn money by transfers.  As for Galina, the mother despaired of re-educating her, and therefore prefers to stay away.  Nobody can judge who is right and who is guilty, however, rumors are constantly circulating in society about a certain curse on Brezhnev‚Äôs family ... </p>
