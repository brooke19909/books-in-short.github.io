It contains many different cities.  And when you go on any trip - to relax or on a business trip, it is advisable to plan your trip in advance.  For this, it is necessary, among other things, to know the distances between the starting and ending, as well as intermediate points (in order to calculate route options, financial expenses, overnight places, if necessary).  Let's look at an example of how many kilometers are from Moscow to Tver, how you can get there and what to see. </p><h2>  Distance between cities </h2><p>  If you travel by car from the Moscow Ring Road to the outskirts of Tver, you get about 140 kilometers.  If you go from the center of our capital to the center of a provincial town, then the distance will be within 170 km. </p>

The population in 2010 was 410 and a half thousand people, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã152 km <sup>2</sup> .

    <p>  Tver was founded in the 12th century.  In 1931, the village was renamed Kalinin, in 1990 - back.  The area is full of various sights and monuments.  This is one of the reasons why many people are interested in the question, how many kilometers are from Moscow to Tver.  People are interested in looking at all this, and they want to correctly calculate their time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Take the train </h2><p>  Trains in the direction of Tver leave from the capital from the Leningradsky railway station, and almost all stop there.  On the way, you will spend from one and a half to three hours, depending on different circumstances.  If you need faster, then you can <br>  use the services of a fast and comfortable ‚ÄúPeregrine Falcon‚Äù.  This pleasure will cost three times more, but the resulting comfort is worth the money.  In addition, you will spend only one hour and three minutes on the way. </p>

    <p>  For those who want to save, there is also an option.  You can ride the train.  In time it will be from two hours to three and a half.  This method is the cheapest, but you cannot count on the accuracy of arrival on the final journey.  The trains often stop, they can just stand for 20-30 minutes, skipping trains or Sapsans, sometimes they are too crowded. </p><h2>  To Tver by bus </h2><p>  Between the settlements under consideration there are also Moscow-Tver shuttle buses.  They cover a distance of 170 km in 2.5‚Äì3 hours.  The cost is still a little less than in the train.  The figures are not given in the article, because after a couple of months they may already be irrelevant and deceive you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When leaving by bus, you need to keep in mind that the stated travel time does not mean anything.  Punctuality is even worse than with the train.  In the event of a traffic jam on the territory of Moscow, the arrival time can easily increase to 2.5‚Äì3 hours, there have been times when up to 5 hours.  Reverse landing - from the square next to the railway station, located from the bus station just a 5-minute walk.  By the way, information for reference: the answer to the question, how much is from Tver to Moscow, is similar.  The distance even there, even the same back. </p>

    <h2>  Driving route </h2><p>  As already agreed, in order to quickly get to the neighboring regional center, you need to go from the Moscow Ring Road or the Leningradskoye Highway to <span>the E-105</span> (M10 "Russia") highway and, knowing how many kilometers are from Moscow to Tver, go on a journey.  Having passed Solnechnogorsk, Spas-Zaulok and Mokshino, we drive up to Tver.  It remains only to call directly into the city itself.  There are several options for how to do this: </p><ol><li>  After the village of Emmaus, from Moscow, the main highway at the post of the State traffic inspectorate goes to the left.  We need to take there to the right and go to the signpost to the regional center. </li><li>  There is an option to turn off the E-105 along the Turginovsky highway, do it at the traffic lights.  But this path is not recommended, since it has an unlit and poor road, and you can get lost on it. </li><li>  From <span>Volokolamsk highway</span> made a good entry into the city. </li><li>  You can drive around it on the highway and turn at the traffic lights onto the Staritskoye Shosse without reaching the bridge over the Volga and a new roundabout. </li></ol><p>  It seems to have figured out how many kilometers from Moscow to Tver, how to get there.  If your route runs further and you are not going to linger in the city, then simply follow further along the main road.  She will again take you to the E-105 towards St. Petersburg.  Having stayed in Tver for a couple of days for sightseeing, you will never regret it. </p>
