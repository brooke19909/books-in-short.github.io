    <p>  Not only sprinters dream of increasing running speed, but also those who are trying to maintain their athletic form at the proper level or just to be healthy.  Many not only run, but also strive to constantly increase their speed. </p><p>  In running, there is a phase of flight, during which the jerking leg comes off the ground.  In order for a person to run faster, it is necessary to reduce this particular phase so that contact with the support occurs as often as possible.  At the time of the flight phase, a person relaxes for an instant, which allows him to save his strength, and for this, the running stride length should be optimal.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdepends on the repulsion from the <span>treadmill,</span> the stride length does not affect it. </p><p>  In order to <span>increase the speed of</span> running, you need to push off the support with the same strength, but at the same time spending a minimum of time.  Along with this, the phase of the transfer of the fly leg is reduced.  It is necessary to actively promote that the leg as soon as possible touches the support, while reducing the phase of the flight.  Therefore, the person‚Äôs running speed does not depend on the length of the running steps, but on their frequency. </p><p>  It is very important to adhere to a certain <span>running technique</span> in order to maximize speed.  To push away from the support instantly and with maximum force, you need to gently, springy and very quickly set the foot on the track.  Hands at right angles need to be bent at the elbows, their movements should be rhythmic.  The running speed of a person directly depends on the amplitude of the movement of the hands. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the correct torso.  To develop high speed, the body must be tilted forward.  However, one should not forget that a large slope together with increased repulsion reduces speed, slowing down the extension of the fly leg.  The inclination of the body depends on the level of preparation of the athlete, as well as on his physique, and therefore it should be optimal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To increase the speed of running, many athletes use certain training schemes that contribute to the development of speed endurance.  Most often they use the interval method.  It consists in the alternation of running and outdoor activities, in which <span>jogging</span> is performed <span>.</span> </p><p>  There are many methods of <span>interval running,</span> but all of them are united by a common essence, which consists in the fact that an athlete runs one segment of the distance at maximum speed, then slows down for a while, and then again increases the speed of running.  The stretch using fast running depends on the individual preparation of the runner. </p><p>  Regular running runs contribute to the development of leg muscles, working out their correct setting, a gradual increase in the length and frequency of the running step, which inevitably leads to an increase in the person‚Äôs running speed. </p><p>  In order to properly prepare for the upcoming training, you need to follow a few simple rules, the most important of which is comfortable clothing.  Before the start of the run, it is mandatory to warm up for five to six minutes.  It includes a number of simple exercises that are necessary to warm the body.  After that, two or three minutes you need to go at an accelerated step to tune in to running.  Stress in the body should not be, movements should be light and free. <br>  You need to adhere to such a speed that the inhalation is carried out through the nose.  If this has become difficult, it is necessary to switch to breathing through the mouth and walk a certain distance to recover and then resume running again.  After it, you can not immediately stop, and even more so sit down.  You need to finish the run as gradually as you start, that is, walk a few minutes at an accelerated pace. </p><p>  The highest speed is achieved only as a result of hard training, subject to all the necessary rules and in accordance with the right methodology. </p>
