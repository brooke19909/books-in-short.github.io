Taylor, has become a real sensation in the world of photography.  Behind the apparent ease of the pictures understandable to the public, there is a long preparation and careful planning. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Arthur Elgort, stopping beautiful moments, was born in 1940.  His parents, immigrants from Jewish families, emigrated from Eastern Europe.  The boy studied drawing for a long time, but he soon realized that the lens of the camera conveys much more emotions and life than painting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arthur elgort" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1249869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Elgort saw the pictures of the speaker for naturalness in the editorial office of the famous fashion magazine Vogue and offered cooperation that continues to this day.  The creative director of the publication said that the photographer‚Äôs work opened a new era of expressive works on which modern American women live. </p><h2>  Real professional </h2><p>  Carried away by work, Arthur Elgort loves to shoot fashion, recognizing that this is a whole ritual.  The master, who has worked with all the popular fashion magazines, travels a lot, discovering new countries.  Realizing that photo shoots in exotic corners is a very expensive pleasure, the editors do not want to take risks and choose Arthur as a true professional in their field, who never had failed photos. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Revolutionary shot </h2><p>  The photo that revolutionized captures the beautiful Taylor.  With one hand she held disheveled hair, and with the other held the steering wheel.  No one could believe that this was a real staged photo, and not a hidden camera shot, the feelings of the actress depicted were so natural. </p><p>  But few knew that it was half a day before Arthur Elgort received a bewitching shot, and not a wind answered for a careless hairstyle, but a stylist hiding on the car floor with a hairdryer in his hand. </p><h2>  Changing the laws of the genre </h2><p>  Previously, models did not go outside, but were shot only in special studios, and meek heroines represented in the frame submitted to the will of the photographer.  Strictly and even stiffly fashion models looked a little like ordinary girls, and staged pictures clearly separated the housewives reading magazines from the alien and glamorous world of fashion. </p>

    <p>  Models looked directly at the fanciful photographs, and not a single detail violated the traditions that had developed over the years.  And Elgort‚Äôs picture proved that viewers can become part of it.  The actress shot by the master, lost in thought, does not pay any attention to the camera, and the frame is riddled with slight understatement, and therefore I want to appeal to him again.  American photographer Arthur Elgort brought forbidden freedom by changing the laws of the genre. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Work is a dream </h2><p>  Vogue fashion editor, who has traveled with the recognized genius of almost the whole world, enthusiastically talks about adventures away from his homeland.  He enthusiastically recalls a camel in Morocco, caves with Eskimos, <span>Masai tribes,</span> Indian elephants, Moscow artists with whom he had to work. </p><p>  Arthur Elgort everywhere shows his professionalism, demonstrating that even in the most outlandish places the model‚Äôs clothes remain in the spotlight.  Penetrating into the most remote corners of our planet for the best pictures, he enjoys his work, which he calls a dream. </p><h2>  Naturalness of staged photos </h2><p>  In the photographs of a master of genius, the viewer sees lively and sensual, sleepy and scattered, impudent and playful women in whom there is not a single gram of falsehood or pretense.  All staged photos look absolutely natural, and their models are cute for the author, so charismatic beauties live in each photo, shot as if spontaneously. </p>

    <p>  A lot of work is devoted to the symbol of heroin chic - the young top model Kate Moss, which in the frame looks like an ordinary girl.  There is nothing flippant and scandalous in the photographs, on the contrary, Arthur Elgort masterfully emphasizes her natural charm. </p><p>  A recognized professional throughout his life proves that his photographs are a real art that captures the viewer from the very first seconds, enjoying the established contact between the heroines and the author. </p>
