Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * is administratively owned by this city, but is actually located eight kilometers from it.  This hotel is located in a resort area such as Skanes.  In this article we will give a comprehensive description of the hotel and the place where it is located.  And the feedback from those who already had the opportunity to visit there will help us in this.  First of all, it must be said that this is a chain hotel.  It belongs to the Dessole Resort and Hotels line.  This network has proven itself in terms of service and <span>quality of service.</span> </p><p>  Until recently, the hotel had a different name - ‚ÄúDessole Saadia Resort‚Äù.  Reviews say that everything in this hotel is imbued with the spirit of antiquity.  Some people like it, others don't.  But in ‚ÄúNerolia‚Äù you will be met by the atmosphere of colonial Africa, relaxing and setting you on a relaxing holiday.  The reviews also warn that in the last year or two the hotel has completely reoriented itself towards the reception of tourist groups from Russia.  Some consider this a plus.  You don‚Äôt need to blush for your English, the staff understands you tolerably, the animators are so Russian guys in general.  But those tourists who would like to take a break from their compatriots in Tunisia cannot consider this a hotel advantage.  Now let's do a more detailed analysis of the living conditions at this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 reviews" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408654.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourists who came to Tunisia for the first time have a logical question: what is it?  The coast near Monastir abounds in shallow lagoons.  And the inhabitants of the city earned their living by the production of salt.  They just got it.  They blocked the lagoon and waited for the sea water to evaporate under the rays of the African sun, after which shining white crystals were collected in shovels.  One of such sand spits, which are a natural barrier to the sea, is Skanes.  Now it is completely at the mercy of hotels.  Because of this, the city of Monastir managed to maintain its ancient appearance, and it still looks as if the winds of globalization have bypassed it. </p><p>  Skanes is a five-kilometer spit, the width of which ranges from three hundred meters to half a kilometer.  Therefore, the concept of "far from the sea" there simply does not exist.  There are only two lines.  Front-line hotels are located on the sea coast.  And second-line hotels, such as Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (hotel photos are presented in the article), rise by the salt lake.  But far from Skanes, it‚Äôs to Monastir.  After all, you need to go around the lagoon to get into the city, and this is at least eight kilometers.  By the way, to Sousse - the youth resort in Tunisia - to go a little more - 13 km.  But trains and buses connecting the two cities go along the spit.  The railway station, by the way, is located five hundred meters from the hotel.  You can also ride a traditional Tunisian carriage drawn by a pair of horses.  <span>Monastir Airport</span> is also located on Skanes <span>.</span>  But the sound of boarding and taking off liners is not heard from the hotel we are describing.  But you will be the first to be delivered to the place of rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 Tunisia reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408655.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its total area is thirty thousand square meters.  And he has a lot of vacationers.  In the middle of a beautiful garden, similar to paradise Eden, three buildings rise.  They are located at an equal distance from the sea, but reviews say that it is preferable to choose the one that is located closer to the salt lake and, accordingly, Monastir.  These buildings are low, only three floors, built with elements of Tunisian architecture.  They include two hundred and ninety-three numbers.  But, reviews mention, it is rare when a hotel is one hundred percent full.  After all, it is located on the second line.  And although only two hundred meters are required to go to the sea, for Skanes this is considered a lot.  True, sometimes groups from Russia call in.  Then you may feel a crush, especially in the main restaurant and bars.  The buildings of the Nerolia Spa Hotel are surrounded by picturesque swimming pools on three sides.  Tranquility should be sought in the patio - the courtyard of the hotel, where silence and comfort reign.  Reviews say only good things about the hotel: the beautiful lobby, where the reception is located, the clean paths of the garden drowning in flowers, date palm trees and unknown plants everywhere. </p><h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  As in most four-star resort hotels in Tunisia, standard double rooms prevail in the Nerolia Spa.  There are one hundred eighty-three in the hotel.  There are also rooms designed for three and even four guests.  But in their content, they also belong to the category of standard, just their area is larger.  But there are suites in the hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 *.  Reviews do not say anything about how they differ from the standards.  Probably because there are only three such rooms in the hotel.  How do the tourists themselves describe the rooms?  Ignorant people complain that the floor is tiled with stone and the furniture is ‚Äúold wooden‚Äù.  Any antiquarian can make fun of such a review.  Furniture is not "tired", but antique, which should be appreciated.  As for flooring, most vacationers go to Tunisia in the hot season, when it is incredibly pleasant to walk on cold stone slabs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the choice of rooms in Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia), reviews mention a service that is not available in other hotels.  If there is such an opportunity (the hotel is not one hundred percent full), then you can change the room you don't like to another one of the same category.  Otherwise, the filling of standard rooms meets the expectations of a four-star hotel.  There is a TV with numerous Russian channels, air conditioning, electronic safe, minibar, which is daily replenished with bottled drinking water (one and a half liters).  In the bathroom, in addition to soap and bottles with shampoo, shower gel, there is a hairdryer.  All rooms, without exception, have balconies.  If the rooms are on the ground floor, terraces adjoin them.  They clean the rooms every day, and bed linen is changed once a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastir (Monastir).

    <h2>  Facilities at the Nerolia Spa Hotel </h2><p>  The patio and pool are not the only things guests will find on the territory of the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 *.  The reviews claim that there are also volleyball, mini-golf and football courts, and a tennis court, and a gym.  In general, much attention is paid to sports and a healthy lifestyle.  In the hotel you can play table tennis, boccia, water polo.  Every morning, the animators do physical exercises for everyone, and in the pool - water aerobics classes.  If minigolf is not enough for someone, there is a large field nearby for practicing this full-fledged elite sport.  Also, the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia) is located near the beautiful riding school, where you can ride on an <span>Arabian horse</span> on specially designed tracks. </p><p>  The hotel reception is open around the clock, and its staff understands the Russian language.  There is also a shop on site.  The word "Spa" in the name of the hotel is not accidental.  The hotel has a thalassotherapy center with a hammam, massage, beauty salon and hairdresser.  In addition to the two open, there is also a heated indoor pool.  At the reception you can arrange a rental car.  There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 Tunisia" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408648.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed guests at the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia) </h2><p>  Reviews mention only one concept of food in the hotel.  This is an all-inclusive program, beloved by Russian tourists.  But, reviews warn, this is still not a ‚Äúsuper all inclusive‚Äù.  Although all meals are served in buffet mode, they are held on schedule.  From seven to ten in the morning - breakfast, which smoothly turns into a brunch until 11:00.  It also takes place in the main restaurant, but with fewer dishes.  But from eleven in the morning the baton is hosted by a cafe on the beach, where you can taste hamburgers, snacks and salads.  This restaurant is open until four in the afternoon - for those who are too lazy to return to the main restaurant for lunch (from one to three).  From four to five, the cafe serves tea and pastries.  And for dinner, waiters wait for guests from seven to half past nine.  For those who arrived late or went on excursions, the opportunity to eat is not canceled.  From eleven until midnight, the main restaurant serves <span>late dinner.</span>  Reviews mention that the all-inclusive program also includes ice cream.  It, to the delight of the children, is distributed free of charge at the kiosk from eleven in the morning until four in the afternoon.  There are two a la carte restaurants in the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * hotel.  Reviews (2016) state that the guest can choose either Tunisian or Italian cuisine, and reserve a table with the administration.  Then a trip to the restaurant, where the √† la carte menu is served, will not cost you anything.  In another case, the reviews warn you, of course, they will serve you, but they will also show you the bill.  These restaurants operate from half past seven in the evening until twenty-two hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 Tunisia photo" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bars and cafes </h2><p>  In addition to these main points where they arrange a feast for the stomach, there are other food establishments in the hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 *.  Reviews are stray from the account and cannot indicate the exact number of bars.  But at least one of them has been working since eight in the morning to cure the headache of those who went through the day before.  This main bar closes only at midnight.  In addition to it, you can drink at two pools and on the beach.  They work from ten in the morning until six in the evening.  And at eighteen, the Piano Bar opens its doors, where live music plays until midnight.  At the same time, the Maure Cafe is open, where you can smoke a good hookah and taste freshly brewed Arabic coffee.  But visiting this catering point is paid.  A little further from the buildings on the territory of the Nerolia Hotel there is an amphitheater where discos are held.  A bar with alcohol and cocktails is open next to it from half past ten to two at night. </p><h2>  Guest reviews about meals </h2><p>  All tourists claim that the hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia) feeds its guests "excellent".  Barbecue lovers were satisfied: there was always meat and fish cooked on the grill.  Tables crammed with vegetables and fruits.  Peaches, watermelons, melons and dates have always been.  You could constantly find dishes from different types of meat: lamb, chicken, beef.  Especially a lot of reviews devoted to desserts.  In addition to the impeccably delicious Tunisian pastries, one could taste mousses, profiteroles and other sweets that went to the local cuisine after the period of French rule.  The children were happy with the ice cream - it was not powder in the hotel, very tasty.  As for the service, the tourists were satisfied with it.  The waiters at Nerolia Spa are agile, and even if many groups came from Russia, they managed to make new dishes so that there were no queues.  Guests who rested at the hotel in past years said that the service was paid in the Moorish cafe of the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 *.  Reviews in 2016 claim that now the bill is presented only for hookah.  Tourists strongly recommend visiting a la carte restaurants.  But they cannot give a clear answer about which one is better - with Tunisian cuisine or with Italian.  Here you should focus on your taste.  A la carte service, a festive and at the same time cozy atmosphere, set up for a special, romantic mood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 pics" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408626.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at Nerolia Spa </h2><p>  Hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia) photos are often presented from the angle where you can see the pools.  This is the main venue for daytime entertainment.  In the morning, physical exercises take place on the solarium terrace.  Then, already in the pool itself, the animators give classes in aqua aerobics or organize water polo competitions.  There is a school in the hotel where everyone is taught European and Arabic dances.  On the beach, animators also work tirelessly.  They organize volleyball and football competitions, conduct classes in step aerobics.  Since the beach is public, you can find a lot of water activities on it.  They ride (for money) on skis, jet skis, parachutes, bananas, and tablets.  There are water slides.  And at the hotel everyone can play table tennis, boccia, mini-golf.  The fun does not cease in the evening.  The piano bar features live music.  Especially a lot of reviews mention show programs in the amphitheater.  Often they are conducted by local animators.  But sometimes the hotel invites dance or song groups that bring national color to leisure travelers.  Discos are also sometimes held by professional DJs.  Animators, however, amuse people with contests, <span>win-win lotteries,</span> parodies, etc. You can sing karaoke at the bar. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia, Monastir) reviews are called a hotel for families.  For the youngest guests, the most favorable conditions are created here.  The hotel has a children's playground and a shallow pool.  In restaurants there are always high chairs for feeding babies.  And from the menu you can choose dishes that will be familiar, useful and desirable for young molesters.  If you do not want your child to remain in the sun for a long time, you can bring him to the game room, where cartoons are always broadcast and full of different funs.  All children who are already four years old but who have not yet reached twelve years old can be enrolled in a mini-club. </p><p>  Since the hotel specializes in hosting groups from Russia, there will be no language barrier between the child and the animators.  Girls are professional educators, and they can be entrusted with confidence to entertain children with games, competitions and master classes.  The mini-club is open from ten in the morning until noon and from half past two to five.  In the evening, for the little dancers, the animators organize a special disco.  For babies, there are also a number of services.  In general, children under two years old can stay for free at the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 *.  Fresh reviews even claim that upon request for a reception, a small cot with sides can be installed in your room.  You can use the paid services of a professional nanny who will deal with your child individually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 reviews fresh" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1408631.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Reviews about the hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * claim that you have to walk about five minutes to the sea.  After all, this hotel is located on a narrow spit, the width of which varies from three hundred to five hundred meters.  And even though Nerolia Spa is considered a second-line hotel (there is simply no third on Skanes), it is very close to the sea.  But since this municipal beach, sunbeds and umbrellas on it can be taken for a fee.  You can not say about the sunbathing area near the pools.  The solarium terrace is also lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Using them for hotel guests is free.  A soft mattress is also included.  But a <span>beach towel</span> is issued on bail.  As for the beach, then, according to reviews, it is sandy.  The orientation of Skanes to the north leads to the fact that the excitement of the sea is not uncommon.  Then brings a lot of algae ashore.  Vacationers complain of burning jellyfish and recommend purchasing a bathing suit - at least for children.  A bar is open on the beach from May to early November.  It opens at half past ten in the morning, and finishes serving customers at sunset.  If the sea is stormy, it will be replaced by two outdoor pools with fresh water and slides.  The third is indoors, and its temperature is constantly maintained at twenty-seven degrees. </p><h2>  Where to go and what to bring from Monastir </h2><p> For Russian travelers make out in the hotel Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * all-inclusive tours.  For a fee at the hotel, you can only smoke a hookah (five dinars, or one hundred and fifty rubles) and go to the spa center.  On the beach you have to fork out for all sorts of water activities.  But reviews are advised not to stay at the hotel, but to travel actively.  Tourists praised short excursions that did not take much time.  This is a trip to the zoo that children will especially enjoy.  And the men remembered a tour of the olive grove on ATVs.  All tourists are advised to visit Monastir with its ancient center and Sousse.  The road between these cities passes right at the gates of the Nerolia Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews in 2016 say that <span>the</span> B52 <span>bus</span> stop is nearby.  If you go outside the gates of the hotel, then left towards Sousse, and right towards Monastir.  The price of a bus ticket is six hundred and sixty millimes, which in translation into Russian money comes out about twenty rubles.  For a child, you need to pay even less - 0.40 dinars. </p><p>  Russian tourists are advised to try the local spirits, and for this make a trip to Sousse to the supermarket, which is located at the last stop of the B52 bus.  Buha (Tunisian vodka) costs thirteen dinars per liter (390 rubles), and cognac on dates - sixteen (480 rubles).  Of all-day excursions, reviews recommend going to the Sahara and to Carthage.  These trips are organized by Pegasus.  Get the rest from Ali - this is a local tour operator.  He organizes interesting excursions to El Jem Amphitheater (360 rubles), the Ribat fortress in Monastir (300 rubles).  Of the souvenirs, tourists recommend buying leather goods and ceramics, and also excellent olive oil. </p>
