However, the amazing beauty of a fabulous place and the pacification reigning on the islands of French Polynesia are worth seeing with your own eyes.  Here is everything that a person needs who decides to abandon problems.  Located at the very edge of the world, an untouched magical corner attracts travelers who can afford a luxurious vacation. </p><h2>  Some facts about the faraway islands </h2><p>  French Polynesia, bearing the status of the overseas community of France since 2004, is a <span>group of archipelagos</span> consisting of 118 islands.  25 of them are uninhabited, and the rest receive guests all year round.  The islands of French Polynesia, covering five million km <sup>2 of</sup> water, are located in the South Pacific, between Australia and South America. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island of french polynesia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174710.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The word "Polynesia", which came from the Greek language, is translated as "many islands", and such a name was assigned to the territory taken under the protection of the French Republic in the XIX century.  The overseas community of France has customs autonomy and its own government, which signs international treaties with other countries.  However, it is not part of the EU. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The list of islands in French Polynesia consists of 118 names, but they include only five archipelagos: Tuamo, Marquesas Islands, Society Islands, Gambier and Tubuai with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãfour thousand km <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Island population </h2><p>  For more than one and a half thousand years, the territory, admiring the exotic brightness of colors, was inhabited by Maori tribes, who left to the descendants the ruins of ancient sanctuaries and stone pyramids, on the walls of which are fanciful drawings.  And most of them are still not deciphered by scientists. </p><p>  About 80% of the population are Polynesians.  The most populated are the <span>islands of the Society.</span>  Aborigines do not live in the mountains, but prefer to live off the coast of the ocean. </p><h2>  Coral and Volcanic Islands </h2><p>  The islands of French Polynesia, having different origins (volcanic and coral), are located far from civilization, which for many tourists is a virtue.  The archipelago is inhabited by about 280 thousand people, and tourism is the main activity that brings income to indigenous people. </p><p>  The islands that arose after the eruption of volcanoes are special places.  The incomparable corners that survived several million years ago by the invasion of burning lava have changed forever.  Mysterious canyons and deep gorges have retained in their appearance the seal of formidable processes that took place before our era, and this is where their gloomy charm lies. </p><p>  As scientists have recently established, the volcanoes on the islands, along with tectonic plates, are shifted by several centimeters, and many even go under water.  It is possible that soon they will disappear from the surface of the earth and only atolls will remain, which increase in length and height every year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Other areas of land formed by clusters of corals are golden sandy plains of a rounded shape, which contrast with the turquoise ocean.  Rising several meters above the water surface, they differ in appearance from islands of volcanic origin.  Beautiful lagoons are surrounded by huge coral reefs, and majestic coconut palms grow on the ground. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The islands have a tropical climate with cool sea breezes.  November marks the beginning of a hot and humid season, which lasts until March inclusive.  Tropical rains, severe hurricanes and storms are possible at this time, and in January, destructive cyclones are observed. </p><p>  But most often tourists come here from April to October, when there is no sweltering heat and rainfall.  However, it is necessary to be prepared for gusts of wind with an unpredictable burden, because the elements very often show their character.  Daytime air temperature throughout the year does not fall below 20 ¬∞ C, and humidity is 92%. </p><h2>  Iles de la Societe </h2><p>  On the islands of the Society, whose name was given by the famous traveler D. Cook, the majority of Aborigines live.  The archipelago, bearing traces of volcanic origin, looks mysterious, and tourists enthusiastically look at the dark outlines of the peaks of extinct giants, once spitting fire.  Opened in the 18th century, it consists of several administrative divisions, which include two groups - Windward and Leeward Islands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of islands of french polynesia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174728.jpg"></div>

On a world map it can be found in the central Pacific Ocean.  Since it is located near the equator, there is no usual change of seasons.  A paradise, part of the Windward Islands, attracts all lovers of exotic.  The densely populated Tahiti, formed over three million years ago, is covered in high mountain peaks and emerald forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tahiti on map" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174748.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Lost at the end of the world, a corner located in the northwest of Tahiti and belonging to the Leeward Islands, is one gigantic beach, and tourists can go into the water from anywhere. </p><h2>  Favorite island among honeymooners </h2><p>  Not far from Tahiti you can find the wonderful island of Moorea, famous for its white beaches and pineapple plantations.  Created by mother nature in a shape resembling a heart, it attracts lovers from all over the world.  Such a curious look is given to it by the symmetrically located two bays - Cook and Opunokha, which appeared as a result of a natural disaster millions of years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moorea island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174754.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Those who can afford to marry in a fabulously beautiful corner, rush here to connect their lives.  True, it is worth knowing that local documents do not have legal force, so it is best to get married in your own country, and come to Moorea Island to get aesthetic pleasure from beautiful wedding ceremonies. </p><h2>  Sights of an amazing place </h2><p>  A fabulous place, to which the serrated spiers of a dilapidated volcano add color, attracts not only lovers.  Tourists climb to the observation deck Belvedere, which offers fantastic views of the bays and mountains.  Moorea is loved by historians studying the ruins of the ancient temple of Titiroa Marae, and all vacationers will be interested in visiting the cultural center of Tiki Theater Village. </p><p>  It will allow you to see what the Polynesian village looked like at the moment when the European's foot first set foot on the island.  In the French-built thatched huts, guests will be introduced to various crafts.  The center employees are engaged in tattooing and woodcarving, make fabrics and musical instruments, weave wreaths of exotic flowers.  And those who got into the house floating on the waves will see how black pearls are artificially grown.  The staff dressed in traditional costumes will demonstrate colorful wedding ceremonies, and the cheerful dance show, where guests are treated to a delicious punch, leaves no one indifferent. </p><h2>  Ideal place for divers </h2><p>  The picturesque island of Rangiroa (French Polynesia) is the largest atoll located on the Tuamotu archipelago.  Favorite corner of divers, whose name translates as "immense sky", is a picturesque place that falls in love with itself at first sight.  All his entertainment is associated with water, famous for its incredible transparency. </p><p>  Surrounded by corals, the atoll is a bird's eye view of a huge necklace resting on the water. </p><h2>  The most mystical place </h2><p>  Natives consider the island of Hua Hin (French Polynesia), nicknamed "wild", the keeper of the ancient local culture, and this statement is not accidental.  The mystical corner, recognized as the main archaeological center, surprises with a huge number of artifacts.  Sites of ancient civilization dating back to 900 BC, with a large number of objects buried in the ground, were found here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huahin island french polynesia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174762.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tourists are attracted by natural riddles, and every vacationer wants to see the unique phenomenon of "green ray".  When the sun goes below the horizon, emerald glare flares up due to the refraction of light in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. </p><h2>  Uninhabited islands </h2><p>  The vast Tuamoto archipelago, which locals call the "Tahiti pearl strand", consists of 78 coral atolls.  Most of them are unsuitable for life, and they gained fame through the extraction of black pearls.  Farms for growing a precious mineral of animal origin are considered the basis of the economy of the islands of French Polynesia.  It is here that the most beautiful and perfect pearls of a dark shade are collected.  Maori legends say that they are the first flashes of light presented to Tanya - the god of birds and forests.  People come here not only to admire coral gardens, picturesque lagoons, but also to engage in water sports. </p><p>  Gambier is a miniature island of volcanic origin, on which tourism is not developed.  This is a very remote part of the land, the main attraction of which is the pearl plantation. </p><p>  Ostral (Tubuai) is an island that is also not affected by tourism.  Consisting of five islands, it is not popular among holidaymakers. </p><h2>  Mysterious Marquesas Islands </h2><p>  The Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), located near the equator, are considered the most mysterious.  Untouched by man, paradise, covered with lush vegetation, fascinates at first sight.  It is simply impossible to describe the beauty of an amazing corner consisting of 12 islands.  On the archipelago, whose name translates as ‚ÄúLand of Men‚Äù, once sought inspiration, and found the last refuge the famous Paul Gauguin.  Next to the brilliant impressionist lies Jacques Brel, a Belgian poet and actor.  Tourists can bow to the graves or take exciting walks along the green slopes.  In addition, they are offered excursions on horseback, and no one refuses the temptation to see stunning panoramas and capture them on video. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marquise islands french polynesia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2174771.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Preserving the identity of French Polynesia, developing a tourist infrastructure, is always glad to guests.  If there is a real paradise on earth, then it is at the very edge of the world, where the virgin nature and civilization are ideally combined.  It seems that time on the islands has stopped, and I want to always enjoy the beauty of a magical corner. </p>
