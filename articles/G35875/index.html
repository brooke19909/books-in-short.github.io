    <p>  Concept development </p><p>  For the first time, the question of what socialization was was raised by the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, who discussed whether a person is a public organism.  With the emergence of social science itself in the 19th century, this question was again raised.  According to the popular opinion of that time, the original human nature was identified with the animal principle, and the <span>process of socialization was</span> considered as literal humanization and giving the newborn <span>social attitudes.</span>  Later this point of view lost </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="socialization of youth" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/139437.jpg" width="300"></div>  relevance.  With the development of evolutionary concepts and social science, it was proved that man was originally a social being.  Accordingly, the question of what socialization is has changed its emphasis.  Now this process was considered as a smooth adaptation of a person to the requirements of a particular society.  It is no secret that human history has been known by many societies with different cultures and <span>social norms.</span>  With a gradual study, knowledge of this phenomenon grew.  Cognitive psychology, studying the formation of adolescents, and psychoanalysis also contributed to this.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Process steps </p><p>  The modern theory of socialization distinguishes several stages of this phenomenon throughout human life: </p><ul><li>  Primary socialization is the first acquaintance of the child with the outside world.  This stage is perhaps the most important, since in the first years of life the basic principles are laid, which will continue to affect the perception of further education.  At this stage, the child‚Äôs parents play a crucial role, since it is they who give him the first ideas about the world and society. </li><li>  Secondary socialization.  It happens already outside the house, in the first teams <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="socialization theory" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/139435.jpg" width="600"></div>  peers into which a person falls: kindergarten, school.  Here, the child perceives new social roles and learns to interact already with the numerical group.  The most important foundation was already laid during primary socialization, but even at this stage very important traits are instilled, which subsequently affect <span>life values</span> and priorities, as well as <span>personal</span> <span>qualities of a person.</span> </li></ul><p>  In addition, there are several more types of this phenomenon.  However, it is assumed here that the socialization of youth and adults is already happening: </p><ul><li>  Resocialization  The process of eliminating incorrect or unfavorable behaviors and educating new ones is already at a conscious age.  Such resocialization occurs with each person throughout his life.  In essence, this is a process of adaptation to a dynamic surrounding world: the growth of technology, the changing state role, economic conditions, social representations and so on. </li><li>  Organizational socialization is the process of acquiring professional knowledge and skills to fulfill a certain social role in an organization. </li></ul>
