  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Sochi: an amazing thing nearby</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, holidays in Sochi, on the <span>Black Sea coast</span> , are becoming increasingly popular among residents of Russia and neighboring countries <span>.</span>  Very often tourists come here with children, since you can get to the resort of the Krasnodar Territory mainly by rail or by car, bus.  The mild climate, large clean <span>beaches, the gentle</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãand numerous architectural monuments attract an increasing number of vacationers.  Many people have the opinion that a vacation in the Russian south will be less comfortable than abroad.  In most cases, this is simply a fallacy.  In anticipation of the Olympics in Sochi is actively building sports facilities, as well as hotels, restaurants and entertainment centers.  The city is changing before our eyes and is truly becoming a tourist center of Russia, able to compete with foreign resorts. </p><p>  Mostly popular beach holidays in Sochi due to the huge number of large hotels and mini-hotels located right on the coast.  Here everyone will find a beach to their liking: sandy, pebble or gravel.  In the coastal area there are a large number of restaurants offering local cuisine.  It is somewhat specific because it combines Russian and <span>Caucasian cuisines.</span>  Shish kebabs are prepared right in front of visitors, on the beach, traders constantly sell cold water, alcohol and home-made snacks.  According to most people, rest in Sochi smells of red home-made wine and fried meat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the beaches, the snake waterfall cascade is very popular.  They got their name from the mountain of the same name.  In total there are 5 waterfalls in the cascade, the height of the largest reaches 25 meters.  At the last waterfall there is a spring spring, where you can drink pure water.  You can also swim here.  Waterfalls flow down a steep mountain wall, which makes the sight surprisingly beautiful.  Sochi has a lot of architectural monuments.  Among them, it should be noted the seaport, created in 1955 by the architect K.S.  Alabyana.  The height of his spire reaches 71 meters.  The station is decorated with statues symbolizing the seasons.  There is a fountain with a sculpture of the goddess of navigation.  The Marine Station is especially good in the evening, when its walls are highlighted. </p><p>  Talking about the rest in Sochi, you can not say about the famous mountain Big Akhun, which is located in the coastal part of the city.  Its height is 663 meters.  From this place you can see the whole city, as well as Adler and the <span>mountains of the Caucasian</span> ridge.  <span>Mount Akhun</span> is a favorite destination for honeymooners.  Every year, hundreds of young couples here swear to each other in love and fidelity. </p><p>  In addition to ordinary tours, many tour agencies offer to buy last-minute tours to Sochi at the lowest prices.  This makes it possible to greatly save on vacation and spend the remaining money on additional entertainment.  This way of relaxation will suit people mobile, a little prone to adventures.  The acquisition of such vouchers for resorts within the country is less dangerous than the same offers for foreign options.  This is explained by the absence of a language barrier, hidden commissions on bank cards, which in case of an unforeseen situation will help to quickly and efficiently find a solution to it.  In fact, last-minute tours to Sochi from bona fide tour operators differ from other tours only in price and a quick departure date.  To avoid unpleasant situations, you must carefully read the contract and always additionally purchase insurance.  It is worth paying special attention to what cases are considered insurance and to what extent they are paid.  Enjoy your holiday on the Black Sea. </p>
