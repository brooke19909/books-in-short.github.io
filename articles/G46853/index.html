    <p>  The complex has a team of animators, which offers vacationers day and evening activities.  For children, the hotel has a playground, a mini club, a nanny (for a fee), a swimming pool. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  El Mouradi Djerba Menzel (Djerba) has its own sandy beach near the hotel.  The coast is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, the use of which is included in the price of food and accommodation.  But beach towels are issued on bail, which is returned to tourists upon departure. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  We have already mentioned the location of El Mouradi Djerba Menzel (Djerba).  Djerba - Tunisia, more precisely, its southernmost point.  The island has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã538 km sq., And its coastline stretches for one hundred and twenty kilometers.  There are two ways to get to the resort: by ferry from the mainland (the journey takes no more than ten minutes) or by plane to Djerba International Airport. </p><p>  The island has a long history, now it is not known exactly who first discovered it, but it is believed that this merit belongs to the Phoenicians.  For many centuries, the Romans were owned by the Romans, the Carthaginians.  Currently, the island is considered the most important fishing center in the whole country.  The main port of the island is the capital of Houmt Souk.  In its restaurants, tourists can enjoy the freshest and most delicious seafood dishes.  Djerba is sometimes called Mediterranean Tahiti because of the endless sandy beaches washed by the warm waters.  The island was built up with modern hotels due to its excellent climate.  The sea near its shores is always warm and does not have significant temperature fluctuations, so you can swim and sunbathe on local beaches throughout the year.  On the one hand, island tourist life is not as active as on the mainland, and on the other, guests can enjoy clean beaches and sea water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunisia el mouradi djerba menzel" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1503498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On Djerba, cultures of different nations merged together, for example, Jews live quietly next to Muslims.  The island is very beautiful.  This is absolutely not a desert area, on the contrary, a huge number of olive groves grow here due to the fact that there are many underground sources on Djerba.  And in the southwestern part lies a shady wetland.  It is here that you can see huge flocks of flamingos, white herons, gulls. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  If you are resting in El Mouradi Djerba Menzel 4 * (Tunisia), then you should definitely see the most interesting places on the island.  Of course, it cannot be said that Djerba is the center of the sights of all Tunisia, but there are beautiful places here, you can see them in between beach vacations.  Each hotel has its own guides offering standard excursion programs (prices for them can not be called cheap).  However, most attractions can be reached by taxi, public transport or rented car.  The advantage of independent trips is the possibility of a calm and leisurely viewing of local beauties, which is not available in group trips. </p><p>  Many attractions are located in the city of Houmt Souk, located in the north of the island.  It is interesting to walk along the streets, look at local shops and the market.  In the endless labyrinths of the city you can see three ancient mosques. </p><p>  On the shore near the city is the fortress of Bordj el Kebir.  Once it was a defensive structure, but now it recalls its former greatness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi djerba menzel jerba" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1503499.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main attraction of the island is the synagogue of El Grib.  It is the oldest synagogue in all of Africa.  It is a place of worship for Jews from around the world.  It is located near the village of Riyadh. </p><h2>  El Mouradi Djerba Menzel: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would definitely like to discuss the reviews of tourists who had a rest in this hotel.  The complex occupies a rather large and beautiful area.  One of the advantages is its location on the coast.  The hotel itself is located away from the settlements, plus or minus, you decide.  If you are looking for a relaxing holiday on the coast, then you might like El Mouradi Djerba Menzel 4 *.  The tours offered to this hotel have a reasonable price and are a great option for a budget holiday. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are not new, but equipped with good furniture and working plumbing.  Of course, the apartments need updating, but their condition is quite acceptable.  All of them are quite spacious.  Every day, maids clean the rooms and change towels.  You can‚Äôt complain about cleaning.  But with towels, a hitch sometimes occurs.  So, for example, they can be taken for lunch, and new ones brought in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi djerba menzel 4 tunisia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1503501.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The service staff is very friendly and good, they settle quickly at the reception (2-3 minutes and the key is already in your hands).  Sometimes the leisureliness of workers is noticeable, but this, apparently, is their peculiarity. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel: reviews </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition in El Mouradi Djerba Menzel.  Reviews about him are the most positive.  Vacationers are fully satisfied with its quality and variety.  At the entrance to the main restaurant there is always a full water cooler.  Breakfast includes cheeses, sausages, vegetables, eggs, granola, pancakes, yogurts, croissants and other pastries, all kinds of side dishes (among them there are cereals), scrambled eggs. </p><p>  For lunch, a table with fruits, sweets, desserts, ice cream will certainly appear.  All this can be taken without restrictions.  In addition, soups, side dishes, turkey, beef, fish, chicken are always present.  On the street, pizza is always cooked throughout the day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi djerba menzel jerba jerba tunisia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1503511.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  For dinner, grill dishes, numerous salads and snacks also appear, and the assortment of desserts is updated.  Chocolate mousses performed by a local chef are incredibly delicious.  The restaurant has enough space for all vacationers, even though the hotel is large.  Queues and crowds are never observed.  In addition, there is an outdoor terrace where you can also sit down at a table.  The waiters are quick and agile, and for a tip they can even reserve a table you like and decorate it with flowers.  But the dishes are not washed very high quality.  However, such a misunderstanding is quickly corrected when the hotel is visited by the manager with the next check. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  According to tourists, in the vicinity of the hotel there is nothing special to watch.  However, there is a taxi rank nearby, so in five minutes you can be at a supermarket in the nearest town.  The hotel has its own guide offering a standard set of excursions.  You can use his services.  But, according to experienced tourists, it‚Äôs easier to rent a car at the hotel for a couple of days and travel the whole island on it.  Then you will certainly be able to see all the sights and interesting places.  The tracks on Djerba are very good, but at present there are a lot of roadblocks with military and police on them.  However, they are loyal to tourists, check documents and release.  There are no problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi djerba menzel 8 6" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1503513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the beach, it is quite large and is located in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  It has sun loungers, umbrellas and a bar.  The shore has a gentle slope into the water, which is convenient for kids.  Sometimes algae appear on the beach, which staff does not always promptly clean.  But overall the coast is clean and comfortable. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you are planning to travel with your whole family to Tunisia, El Mouradi Djerba Menzel may well be suitable for a relaxing holiday.  There is no noise and fuss inherent in Sousse, but all the time you will be in close proximity to the cleanest open sea.  Since the hotel, according to vacationers, is consistent with the price-quality ratio, it can definitely be recommended to tourists. </p>
