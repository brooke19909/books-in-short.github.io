    <p>  Great Britain, the photo of which is presented in this article, is one of the largest states in Europe.  She has a permanent membership in the UN Security Council, belongs to the <span>nuclear powers.</span> <br><br>  The modern state consists of four countries, although it has a unitary device.  The capital is the city of London, which is one of the largest centers of world trade and finance.  English is recognized as the official language, but residents speak many of its dialects. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The population of the modern type of territory of the island began 30 thousand years ago.  It passed by the waves.  Mostly lived Britons and Gels belonging to the Celtic culture. <br><br>  From the first century BC  the conquest of land began by Rome, which ruled in the southern part of the island for about 400 years.  At the same time, the invasion of German Anglo-Saxon immigrants began.  They gradually assimilated with the Celts and the creation of the Kingdom of England.  Some Britons settled in the territory of modern Wales.  The Gauls created the Scottish Kingdom with the Picts. <br><br>  In 1066, the Norman invasion of England began.  It brought French feudalism and culture.  Although over time, the Norman-French population assimilated with the locals.  England captured Wales and attempted to capture Scotland.  England also entered the struggle for the legacy of significant lands of France.  It unleashed the Hundred Years War. <br><br>  In the Middle Ages, Wales fully joined England, and Ireland was in alliance with it.  In the kingdom, the ideas of the Reformation were spread, as a result of which an Anglican church was formed with a monarch at the head. <br><br>  Under Jacob the First, a union was formed between England, Scotland, and Ireland.  Countries kept separate political entities.  As a result of further events, the <span>Glorious Revolution</span> took place (1688), and Great Britain became a constitutional monarchy. <br><br>  In the 18th century, an industrial revolution took place in the state, which positively affected the growth of the empire.  Mass development of colonies began, mostly in North America, and later in Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. <br><br>  In the 19th century, the Kingdom became the main economic and maritime power in the world.  This continued until the mid-20th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In World War I, the Kingdom was an ally of Russia and France.  On the Western Front, about 5 million inhabitants of the island fought against the German invaders.  After winning the war, the Kingdom received former German and Ottoman colonies.  This allowed the empire to grow to its largest size.  She covered with her power a fifth of the land.  But by 1921, the island of Ireland was actually divided into two parts - Free Ireland and Northern Ireland. <br><br>  The <span>Great Depression of</span> 1929-1932 led to great unrest.  This was followed by World War II.  The kingdom became an ally of France, Russia, and the USA.  The fight against Germany was concentrated in two battles - for Britain, for the Atlantic.  The victory brought Britain participation in the division of the post-war world, as well as a difficult financial situation.  Help was provided by loans from the United States and Canada.  Then began the restoration and further development of the state. </p><h2>  Flag history </h2><p>  Before becoming like it is today, the flag of Great Britain has come a long way in transformations.  This symbol of state power is known throughout the world; it is used in clothing design, architecture and art.  Officially, it is often called the "Union Jack", that is, "Union". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The scheme allows you to see the whole path of transformation since 1603, when Jacob the First came to power.  Initially, it was used in the Navy, which is why the name ‚ÄúJack‚Äù appeared, which meant the bow flag on the ship. <br><br>  The flag consists of the following parts: </p><ul><li>  St. Andrew's flag - blue background, white oblique cross; </li><li>  flag of St. George - white background, red cross; </li><li>  St. Patrick's cross - white background, red oblique cross. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, ‚ÄúUnion Jack‚Äù does not reflect the symbolism of Wales, which is why disputes within the Union Kingdom periodically arise. <br><br>  In order for the crosses not to occupy a dominant place on the canvas, they are shifted from the center in different directions.  This made the Union Jack asymmetrical.  Placing it upside down for no reason is considered an insult.  This option is allowed for the distress signal. </p><h2>  Battles in the country </h2><p>  In the entire history of the existence of the state, relatively few battles took place on its territory.  This is due to the remoteness of the island from the European continent. <br><br>  Greatest Battles of Britain: </p><ul><li>  the victory of William the Conqueror (Normandy) over Harold (the Anglo-Saxon army) at Hastings on 10/14/1066 opened the way to the Norman conquest; </li><li>  the battle of 1485 near Bosworth between the forces of Heinrich Tudor and Richard the Third (the Scarlet and White Roses war from 1455 to 1485 related to succession law); </li><li>  the battle against the Spanish ‚ÄúInvincible Armada‚Äù in the English Channel (July 1588) ended thanks to the skills of <span>Francis Drake</span> victory of England, which became the mistress of the seas; </li><li>  the battle of Marston Moore in the summer of 1644, when the troops of <span>Oliver Cromwell</span> defeated the forces of Charles the First; </li><li>  the battle for Britain (July-October 1940) is the largest air battle, as a result of which the Wehrmacht lost 3,000 pilots, and the Royal Air Force 1,800 pilots and more than 20,000 civilians of the island; </li><li>  the battle in the Atlantic (September 1939-June 1944) is considered the longest battle on which the supply of food to the islands and the supply of arms to the allied forces depended;  the victory over the German forces resulted in the death of 50 thousand sailors for the allied countries. </li></ul>

The largest of them occurred on water and in the air. </p><h2>  Battles for the Empire </h2><p>  Having become a powerful power in the world, Great Britain pursued a colonial policy.  In order to keep vast territories under her power, she used hired troops, the bulk of which were foreign legionnaires.  They were controlled by English officers. </p><p>  Battles in the colonies: </p><ul><li>  1781 - The surrender of the British troops at Yorktown in favor of the French-American adversary decided the outcome of the US War of Independence. </li><li>  The year 1842 was marked by a terrifying event for the Kingdom, when the Elphinstone detachment, which had left women and children (16 thousand people) from Kabul, was destroyed, with one man left alive. </li><li>  1858 - the siege and capture of Delhi by British troops along with the allies as a result of the suppression of the sepoy uprising. </li><li>  1860 - the decisive defeat of the Chinese troops from the Anglo-French army in the First Opium War, which led to the Beijing Treaties. </li></ul><p>  The troops of the Kingdom participated at one time in the Hundred Years War, as well as in the First and Second World Wars.  As a result of these confrontations, many famous battles took place both on land, and on water, and in the air. </p><h2>  Commonwealth countries </h2><p>  The United Kingdom, although it is a unitary state, still consists of several somewhat autonomous units. </p><p>  The countries of Great Britain: </p><ul><li>  England; </li><li>  Wales; </li><li>  Scotland; </li><li>  Northern Ireland. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there is the so-called Commonwealth of Nations, which includes more than 50 states.  In addition to Great Britain, their former dominions, protectorates and colonies belong to them.  The largest of them are Australia, Bangladesh, India, Canada, Nigeria, Pakistan and others. </p><h2>  Largest cities </h2><p>  Of course, London is the largest and most important economically, politically, financially, culturally.  Besides him, there are other great cities in Britain: </p><ul><li>  Birmingham; </li><li>  Liverpool; </li><li>  Manchester; </li><li>  Glasgow; </li><li>  Cardiff; </li><li>  Edinburgh; </li><li>  Belfast. </li></ul><h2>  Great people of art </h2>

    <p>  Great British people in the cultural sphere are known far beyond the borders of their island: </p><ul><li>  Agatha Christie - writer, author of detective stories; </li><li>  Joan Rowling - writer; </li><li>  Sir <span>Sean Connery</span> - actor; </li><li>  John Lennon - musician; </li><li>  William Shakespeare - playwright; </li><li>  Jane Austen is a writer; </li><li>  Vivienne Westwood - designer; </li><li>  Sir Paul McCartney - musician, activist; </li><li>  Herbert Wales - writer; </li><li>  <span>Joe Cocker</span> is a musician. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of representatives of the United Kingdom, who conquered the world with their creativity. </p><h2>  Great monarchs of the kingdom </h2><p>  During the existence of the state, the most famous monarchs of England were: </p><ul><li>  Wilgelm the conqueror; </li><li>  Richard the Lionheart; </li><li>  Henry the Eighth; </li><li>  Elizabeth the First; </li><li>  Victoria; </li><li>  Georg Six; </li><li>  Elizabeth the Second. </li></ul><p>  Great Britain spread its dominance throughout the world.  The modern Commonwealth of Nations still recognizes its Queen Elizabeth II. </p><h2>  Kingdom ruling family </h2><p>  The modern monarch is a representative of the Windsor Dynasty.  Elizabeth II came to power in 1952.  She has three sons, a daughter, eight grandchildren, five great-grandchildren. </p><p>  The history of Great Britain for many contemporaries is already unthinkable without the royal family.  The queen herself has become a real symbol of her state. </p><h2>  Great politicians of the Kingdom </h2><p>  The state has long existed as a parliamentary monarchy.  Royal power is limited to a bicameral parliament.  Most of the power does not belong to the royal family, but to the head of government (the prime minister). </p>
