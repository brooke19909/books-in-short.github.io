Rest in the Krasnodar Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you know <span>what a thermal / geothermal</span> spring is?  This is any source when water heated above 20 degrees Celsius comes to the surface from the bowels.  This happens when, in certain places on the earth's surface, especially where active volcanic activity is going on, underground water is heated to a hot state.  It also happens that certain rocks are a source of heat.  <span>Thermal springs</span> in Russia are the result of both reasons. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  There are three types of such sources.  Between themselves, they differ in water temperature: warm ones contain water from 20 ¬∞  to 37 ¬∞ , followed by hot ones - from 37 ¬∞  to 50 ¬∞ , and very hot ones - from 50 ¬∞  to 100 ¬∞  complete the top three.  Due to their useful properties, places with access to the surface of spring warm water have been valued by people since ancient times.  Their healing properties were known and used already during the period of the Roman Empire.  The water of these sources very well helped people to relax, maintain youth and be cured of various diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal springs in Russia" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/563935.jpg" width="600"></div>  For these and other reasons, such therapeutic sources do not lose their importance and relevance now.  Tourists every year becomes more and more.  And with the development of infrastructure, for example, the Krasnodar Territory, people come to be treated.  After all, thermal springs in Russia, including in its south, can successfully treat many diseases.

    <h2>  Mount Mashuk and its healthy drinking water from sources </h2><p>  This mountain is known in all corners of our country.  Few have heard of Pyatigorsk and its famous drinking springs.  It was from here that the development of Russian balneology began once.  Back in 1863, on the initiative of S. A. Smirnov, a balneological community was created here, which included famous rehabilitation therapists and doctors.  Speaking about the current thermal springs in Russia, it should be noted that only in Pyatigorsk itself and nearby places there are 23 spa establishments and all of them are located at the springs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot springs in Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/563941.jpg" width="600"></div>  In principle, the whole city is a large resort system, in which there are also the most modern, very comfortable, health resorts.  The Tsvetnik park, which is known throughout the country, has the Pushkin, Ermolov and Lermontov baths with radon, carbon dioxide and sulfide waters accessible to all.

    <h2>  Treatment and rest in the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  The most gorgeous Russian sources are in Kamchatka, there are most of them.  In addition to the usual ones, there are also many geysers when superheated water is thrown to the surface in the form of steam.  Sometimes it goes from a depth of thousands of meters.  The closest similar resorts are located in the Caucasus and in the Krasnodar Territory.  They have long been known and inhabited by all those in need.  The water in them has an average temperature of 50 to 90 degrees.  In the Krasnodar Territory, 32 thermal springs are known in total, 13 of them are actively used.  Especially known are the objects of the Absheron region, where there are more than 50 only explored. A quarter of them carry up water rich in medicinal impurities and mineral salts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="healing springs" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/563961.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now we will name the most famous of them.  These are the sources that are constantly exploited, that is, benefit people:

    <ol><li>  The city of Apsheronsk, the sanatorium ‚ÄúSolnechnaya Polyana‚Äù - is known for its iodine-bromine wells. </li><li>  Khadyzhensk city, Mineralny sanatorium - the same wells. </li><li>  The Neftyanaya station, the children's health resort ‚ÄúGorny-Zdorovie‚Äù is a carbon dioxide-sodium-carbonate well. </li></ol><h2>  Characteristics of local sources </h2><p>  If you are counting on a good rest <span>in the Krasnodar Territory,</span> then the information provided below will not be superfluous.  Water sources in this area vary significantly in composition and productivity.  Here are some examples.  On the right bank of the Czechok, a local river, a couple of kilometers from Neftegorsk is located well No. 5/42 with water lying at a depth of 90 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medical sources of Russia" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/563965.jpg" width="500"></div>  It is similar to the ‚ÄúBorjomi‚Äù, and a glass of it can be dialed in three seconds.  It is quite possible to organize a spill in containers for medicinal drinking.  The water from some other wells in the ratio of trace elements and gases is ideal for balneotherapy, similar to the resort of Staraya Russa.  That is, the development prospects are enormous, and the opportunities available are used very little.
