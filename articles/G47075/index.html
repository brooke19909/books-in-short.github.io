Today it is possible to buy a VHI policy in almost all insurance companies, however, most often people become AlfaStrakhovaniya's clients. </p><p>  A feature of this system is that in the formation of the package of medical services provided, you can directly participate, choosing how much and where they will be provided.  Alfa Insurance insurance reviews will be presented at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kommersant.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DMS in alfa insurance customer review" class="if uuid-3165152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165152.jpg"></div><h2>  About the program </h2><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie company has been operating in the services market for more than 20 years.  She received a high reliability rating (according to Expert RA) and serves more than 12 million policies.  This company has its own network of medical clinics, as well as a round-the-clock telephone support service for its customers. </p><p>  Not everyone knows what a VHI policy is.  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  In addition to the classic program, which includes the services of medical specialists for children, future parents, diagnostics and therapy of cardiovascular pathologies, digestive system diseases and comprehensive examinations, there are also options that are suitable for different life situations, for example: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  AntiOnco - all types of cancer therapy without age restrictions. </li><li>  AlfaKlesch - insurance against cases of infection with borreliosis or tick-borne encephalitis. </li><li>  Alfa Globality CoGenio - VHI abroad for a long stay. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMoney for health‚Äù - implies insurance for accidents and other accidents. </li><li>  ‚ÄúTravel Medicine‚Äù - travel insurance. </li></ul><h2>  Where are company clinics? </h2><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie is one of the few companies that thought of providing their clients with medical services earlier than others and launched projects to open their own medical clinics.  To date, such institutions operate in 12 Russian cities.  Below are some company addresses: </p><ul><li>  Perm, st.  Peter and Paul, 53. </li><li>  Samara, st.  Gubanova, 20 A. </li><li>  Kirov, st.  Preobrazhenskaya, 37. </li><li>  Saratov, st.  them.  Rakhova V.G., 131. </li><li>  Moscow, st.  Stavropol, d. 23, building 1. </li></ul><p>  The company plans to open an additional 50 clinics in large cities. </p><p>  According to reviews, Alfa Insurance's addresses and phone numbers are quite easy to find on the network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.finance-monthly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha insurance reviews addresses phone numbers" class="if uuid-3165149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165149.jpg"></div><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie hotline is working around the clock.  Clients of any Russian region can contact a specialist by a number that can be easily found on the official website.  In Russia, the call is absolutely free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A special hotline number has been allocated for the Moscow region and Moscow.  For such a call, additional charges may apply, according to the terms of the tariff plan. </p><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie customers who have received VIP status also have a separate number for contacting a specialist.  By contacting him, they can get the highest quality service.  This phone number is issued to the client after the conclusion of the contract, or it can be found on the official website. </p><p>  It should be noted that the hotline is available for urban or mobile communications so that each client can receive timely assistance and the most relevant information.  Qualified employees will answer questions about the conditions and rules for obtaining insurance services, provide advice on actions in case of an insured event. </p><p>  It is important to understand that all these phones are relevant only at the time of writing.  All changes can be found on the official website of the company. </p><h2>  Program benefits </h2><p>  Alfa Insurance's ‚ÄúJust Pay‚Äù VHI program has the following benefits: </p><ul><li>  an individual approach for each category of clients; </li><li>  the opportunity to undergo treatment at the best specialists and in first-class medical clinics; </li><li>  taking into account the wishes of the insured client; </li><li>  providing a wide range of medical services; </li><li>  the ability to amend the insurance contract; </li><li>  round-the-clock phone support; </li><li>  the opportunity to receive the necessary medical care in remote regions of the country; </li><li>  medical protection anywhere in the world thanks to VHI programs that are designed for travelers and foreigners; </li><li>  speed of registration of policies; </li><li>  great opportunities for corporate insurance; </li><li>  a wide range of programs and a large network of regional representative offices of the organization; </li><li>  availability of own network of clinics; </li><li>  a large number of insured customers; </li><li>  favorable conditions for issuing a policy to state employees; </li><li>  centralized medical examination. </li></ul><h2>  rules </h2><p>  People want to know everything about AlfaStrakhovanie insurance company before signing the contract.  And it is right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vhf insurance insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3165143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165143.jpg"></div><p>  Comprehensive VHI programs of this organization are created to receive a full range of medical services by all clients.  They are designed to service several insurance claims.  Typically, comprehensive policies cover: </p><ul><li>  inpatient and outpatient services; </li><li>  dental activities; </li><li>  emergency care; </li><li>  fare; </li><li>  consulting support. </li></ul><p>  Insurance payments are made no more than 1 time per month.  As a rule, in complex programs there are three tariff plans: ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù, ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and ‚Äúplus‚Äù.  They may differ in the volume of services provided to customers and the size of insurance payments. </p><p>  Reviews about VHI from Alfa Insurance are mostly positive. </p><h2>  Types of programs </h2><p>  Based on the risks that medical insurance of a given company can cover, two main programs for individuals can be distinguished.  For example, the Standard program in Alfa Insurance for VHI includes, in addition to basic medical care, dental care.  A special program specializes and is calculated on a specific case (for example, cancer or a tick bite). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iamexpat.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="all about insurance company" class="if uuid-3165148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165148.jpg"></div><p>  If the client is more interested in family insurance, for example, when traveling abroad, it is better to choose comprehensive protection, which covers all expenses for elimination of the disease and restoration of health when insured events occur.  If an accident occurs, and it is also included in the list of funds covered by the company‚Äôs funds, then the telephone number of the support center specialist can be found on the policy form and at any time ask for help.  Customer reviews of VHI at Alfa Insurance confirm this. </p><h2>  Policy price </h2><p>  The cost of voluntary medical insurance policies depends on the services included in a particular tariff and the age of the client who purchases it.  For services that are provided without an insurance policy, you will have to pay a considerable amount, especially in situations where you have to get help with good equipment in private clinics. </p><p>  Of course, the value of the VHI insurance document for individuals in size cannot be compared with the amounts that a comprehensive treatment can cost.  Nevertheless, before purchasing a policy, you need to carefully weigh how much assistance may be required in each individual case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.credy.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full insurance dms just pay" class="if uuid-3165146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165146.jpg"></div><p>  Sample prices that depend on the type of medical service look like this: </p><ul><li>  outpatient treatment - from 4 to 20 thousand rubles; </li><li>  emergency care - up to 10,000 rubles; </li><li>  hospital - from 5 000 rubles; </li><li>  Dentistry - up to 25,000 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Insurance case </h2><p>  Not many people know that, protecting their client from illnesses and accidents, insurance companies do not always have the opportunity to cover all treatment costs.  That is, Alfa Insurance puts forward some requirements for each insured event.  There is also a list of situations that do not apply to them (HIV, congenital malformations, trauma when intoxicated, etc.). </p><p>  In certain situations, there are restrictions on payments, for example, injuries and fractures.  In this matter, the client is assisted, modern diagnostic methods are used, however, a special table of traumatic injuries is used to calculate the compensation, due to which the amount of compensation may not correspond to the funds that were actually spent on treatment. </p><p>  Insured events are called: </p><ul><li>  exacerbation of chronic pathology; </li><li>  therapy of acute diseases (burns, trauma); </li><li>  death due to an accident. </li></ul><p>  In all insurance cases, AlfaStrakhovanie provides a specialist call for home, treatment and transportation, in accordance with the signed contract and for an amount not exceeding the established maximum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verywellhealth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="policy dms what is it" class="if uuid-3165147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165147.jpg"></div><p>  What other conditions of VHI in Alfa Insurance need to know? </p><h2>  Features of comprehensive insurance programs </h2><p>  Many people have doubts that paid health insurance is better than usual.  However, this doubt is due to misunderstanding and the inability to compare the amount of possible costs of treatment with the price of the policy. </p><p>  The price of such insurance is inextricably linked with what services are included in its tariff.  For example, comprehensive protection, which covers a fairly wide range of risks, is more expensive than insurance for certain services only.  But you can get comprehensive insurance, which will include all insurance cases, without exception, and the client will be able to receive the same comprehensive and high-quality treatment in case of an ailment. </p><p>  It is better to familiarize yourself with customer reviews about Alfa Insurance in advance. </p><h2>  Alpha TRAVEL </h2><p>  Compulsory health insurance is subject to all people living in the territory of the Russian Federation.  However, many people often travel outside the country, and sometimes make quite long trips, with a risk to health and life.  For people who travel to European countries, compulsory insurance will be absolutely useless.  At the same time, the conditions of another country are such that foreign tourists must be insured according to an insurance policy.  AlfaStrakhovanie offers travelers the TRAVEL tariff, which is designed for short-term or long-term visits to foreign countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verywellhealth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full insurance customer reviews" class="if uuid-3165145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165145.jpg"></div><p>  If the client intends to visit Europe, then such insurance coverage provides: </p><ul><li>  expenses associated with transporting a person to his homeland; </li><li>  diagnosis of the disease and first aid; </li><li>  repatriation costs. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews about VHI from Alfa Insurance </h2><p>  Clients of this company say that insurance payments for the policy upon occurrence of insurance cases are always made on time.  And people are very happy with this.  As for medical services in specialized clinics, policyholders most often leave positive feedback about Alfa Insurance, saying that VHI provides them with a wider range of services and high-quality medical care.  And they consider this the main difference from the compulsory medical insurance. </p>
