    <h2>  brief information </h2><p>  Taiga (Kemerovo region) is a small city.  As of 2015, just over 24 thousand people lived here.

Tomsk is located closest to it - only 80 km.  The capital of the Russian Federation is at a distance of 3.5 thousand km, and the nearest airport is sixty kilometers away.  Map Taiga Kemerovo region, which can be viewed below, displays the location of the streets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taiga city Kemerovo region" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1299404.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was thanks to her that this region began to be populated.  The railway station began to function in 1896.  Near it was built the urban village of Tomsk-Taiga.  Its construction was due to the fact that another large branch of the railway to Tomsk was to be built from the Taiga station.  However, its construction was never completed, and the village strengthened. </p><p>  Initially, Taiga (Kemerovo region) was listed as a railway station between the Berezovaya and Kitat rivers (tributaries of the Yaya River).  However, gradually the population of the town increased to 10 thousand people, and it was decided to give the town the status of a city.  It happened in 1911. </p><p>  The name of the city is associated with the geographical term "taiga", which means a natural zone with a predominance of coniferous forests.  The meaning of this word was fully justified.  This city was surrounded by a continuous <span>impassable forest,</span> which corresponds to this natural zone. </p><h2>  Location and climate </h2><p>  The city of Taiga (Kemerovo region) lies within the Kuznetsk Basin (intermountain in Western Siberia).  The average altitude is within 200 m, the highest elevation reaches 450 m. </p><p>  The climate of the city is sharply continental.  Taiga has a fairly long winter, which lasts from late October to early April.  Summer is short, warm enough, but very humid.  The average temperature in the winter in the city is -14–17 ° , in summer - + 16– + 19 ° .  The average annual rainfall is 500 mm, and more than half of them fall in the summer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Taiga (Kemerovo region) is a single-industry town.  The basis of industry, the economy and the work of the population is the railway junction.  The station is built so that the paths bypass it from two sides.  The main branches go to Tomsk and Kemerovo.  A locomotive repair depot, a repair and technical school, a distance of a track and power supply, and a branch of the Institute of Railway Transport operate on the basis of the railway node.  Only 12 structural divisions. </p><p>  More than 60% of the working population of the city are involved in railway enterprises.  Also in the city there are industrial institutions.  Light industry is developing (a textile factory is engaged in the production of school uniforms and work clothes for railway workers) and the food industry. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are not many local attractions in the city itself.  Perhaps the main and only interesting object can be called the railway station - the place from which the whole city began.  This is one of the few buildings, the construction of which was still in the pre-revolutionary period.  The building has been standing since 1905, however, it needs reconstruction.  Next to it, you can see two more buildings of the beginning of the XX century - a locomotive depot and a <span>water tower.</span>  Since 1954, a steam locomotive has been standing on a pedestal, considered a monument to the labor feat of railway workers. </p><p>  Two historical monuments of the city - a monument to the victims of political repression and a memorial to soldiers of the Taigans.  The Museum of Local Lore also operates. </p><p>  On the southern outskirts you can find several historical buildings: the pseudo-Russian church of Andrei Kritsky, built in 1907, the shop of the merchant Magazov and several residential buildings of the early XX century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taiga church" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1299426.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Within 100 km from this settlement there are two large cities - Kemerovo and Tomsk.  Here, in addition to the railway, bus transport also operates - shuttle buses. </p><p>  The city of Taiga (Kemerovo region), unfortunately, often experiences problems with water supply.  Unlike other Siberian settlements, it is not located off the coast of a large river.  Accordingly, this suggests that there is no natural source of water supply in the city.  Local residents use the resources of the largest nearby river Yaya. </p>
