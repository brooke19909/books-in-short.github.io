    <p>  It so happened that most tourists discover the real India just after visiting Goa, which is considered the most ‚Äúnon-Indian‚Äù state in the whole country.  This is a former Portuguese colony in which traditions, language and architecture are significantly different from the rest of India. </p><p>  Why do hotels on Goa on the first line so attract tourists?  Judging by the reviews, the popularity is due to the presence of stunningly beautiful beaches that stretch for tens of kilometers.  The coast was first mastered by European hippies, and now has become one of the most popular resorts in the world.  There you can find rest for your taste and for any fee. </p><p>  All hotels on Goa on the first coastline can be divided by location and class of service provided.  Be sure to pay attention to what kind of services the hotel can provide and which category of tourists it is designed for. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First <span>Goa South Goa</span> Hotels </h2><p>  This part of Goa can offer you a quiet and relaxing family vacation with young children.
