Meanwhile, to learn this art is quite simple.  If you already have certain skills, then it will be useful to learn knitting a crossed face loop, because this is the basis of many beautiful patterns.  In addition, the product will turn out to be more dense and practical to wear, and it also retains its shape better.  In addition, when reading schemes, such a concept as a crossed face is very common.  We will also get to know him.

    <h2></h2><h2>  <strong>Getting ready for work</strong> </h2><p>  So, let's understand <span>how the</span> facial crossed loop <span>fits</span> .  By the way, sometimes such loops are called "grandmothers", do not be surprised if you meet such a term in the literature.  Even a beginner can master this technique.  One has only to stock up with comfortable knitting needles and woolen threads.  Yes, you will also need an extra knitting needle, since many patterns are knitted with her help. </p><p>  You can cross the front loops on threads of any density, but in order to learn this, it is better to take thick yarn.  Then the picture is embossed and clearly visible.  As a rule, winter things are tied with patterns of this kind.  In this case, any coat is suitable.  It is better if it is with a small pile or without it at all, so that the product does not turn into an awkward creation, when it is impossible to make out the pattern.  Well, if it is a smooth, almost shiny thread with the addition of synthetics.  Then the thing will be better to keep in shape, and the picture will be clear.  If you want to use embossed patterns for knitting lighter or even summer clothes, then traditional ‚Äúbraids‚Äù and ‚Äúharnesses‚Äù will not suit you.  Pay attention to other options, especially since there are a lot of them: a pearl pattern, a "barrel", flakes, stars and others.  They will look great on thinner threads.  In addition, if you use a magazine where there is a picture of the finished model and a description of the work, then you need to select the yarn in accordance with the recommendations, otherwise no one will guarantee you an excellent result. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  <strong>Work algorithm: basics</strong> </h2><p>  Let's say you already knit the right number of rows, and are ready to master knitting facial crossed loops.  What is easier!  Follow the detailed algorithm and learn how to knit a facial crossed loop: </p><p>  1. With the right knitting needle we pry the next loop, which is still located on the left knitting needle. </p><p>  2. Grab the thread and knit a loop on the back wall. </p><p>  3. Pull the obtained loop on the front side. </p><p>  For the <span>wrong loop, the</span> order is slightly different: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="two loops together front crossed" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/344793.jpg?1393535633771" width="300"></div>

    <p>  1. The needle enters the loop on the contrary - from left to right. </p><p>  2. The loop is tied to the back wall. </p><p>  3. The thread is pulled to the wrong side. </p><p>  The meaning of the crossing is that the loop turns over on the other side.  After studying the basic rules, let's move on to the analysis of patterns. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Simple embossed elastic </h2><p>  This pattern allows the product to stretch without losing shape.  This gum is more dense than usual.  The loops fit either on the right or on the left side, the knitting order can vary.  Here is one example of how to cross facial loops: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  1. The front first row: 1 front crossed, 1 crossed back loop behind it. </p><p>  2. All subsequent rows fit "according to the drawing."  This term means that over the front loops knit over the front, over the wrong - wrong. </p><p>  This gum is great for knitting scarves, hats and individual elements that need extra stiffness or fixing.  These include, for example, straps on vests and jackets. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Pigtail: the basics </h2><p>  Everyone must know the patterns with braids, also known as Aran harnesses.  They were especially popular in the 80s of the last century, but today the fashion for them is returning again.  And this drawing will not cause you any difficulties if the previous material was able to.  The principle of knitting in this case is that one group of loops crosses with another.  Moreover, the thickness of the braid depends on the number of loops in the group.  So, for a medium-sized tow, 8 or 10 loops are required (4 or 5 on each side), which also depends on the thickness of the thread.  In this case, an additional spoke is always used, on which the loops are left.  With this technique, a cross that looks like a scythe is obtained.  And you can knit a real pigtail - of three stripes.  In general, there are hundreds of patterns based on braids and plaits.  They fit in with rhombs, and squares, and corners, and a spikelet.  There are countless options. </p><h2>  Knitting technique </h2><p>  The simplest option is as follows: </p><p>  1. Type 20 stitches into the needles.  The first - edge - just removed.  The latter always fits the front, the rest - according to the scheme. </p><p>  2. Knit 4 wrong loops, then 10 front loops, and again 4 wrong loops. </p><p>  3. The second row and subsequent knit according to the drawing until the moment when you need to cross the loop.  For example, you can knit 10 rows. </p>

Now we need an extra knitting needle, we will cross the loops.  In this row, as usual, you remove the hem, then knit 4 loops on the wrong side, remove 5 loops on the auxiliary knitting needle, leaving it behind the canvas.

    <p>  5. Knit 5 stitches with faces.  Now we also knit all the stitches with an additional knitting needle. </p><p>  6. Finish the series with purl loops. </p><p>  7. We knit again according to the drawing, do not forget to repeat the procedure of crossing in 10 rows. </p><p>  You have all seen the resulting pattern - this is a neat pigtail, or rather, a plait.  As you have already seen, mastering this popular pattern is not so difficult.  Moreover, knowing this technique, you can achieve completely different results. </p><h2>  Keg Pattern </h2><p>  Another very simple drawing, made exactly as described above.  The number of loops in our case should be a multiple of five plus three loops.  The pattern is knitted according to the following algorithm: </p><p>  1. In the odd rows (except the third) you knit one wrong side loop, four facial;  then this pattern is repeated. </p><p>  2. Even rows are knitted according to the drawing. </p><p>  3. Special attention is paid to the third row.  Here we make the cross.  Knit 1 wrong side, then remove the loop on the auxiliary knitting needle, knit 3 stitches with the front knitting, and then another one from the extra knitting needle.  Knit another purl loop and repeat the pattern. </p><p>  4. The pattern begins to repeat after the tenth row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how does the facial crossed loop fit" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/344511.jpg?1393510194721" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  It is not enough just to master the knitting technique, you need to be able to correctly apply it.  Add a few tips in the end. </p><p>  1. In some cases, for example, if you need an extra spoke just to remove only 1 loop, it may not be convenient to use it.  You can replace this tool with a pin or a toothpick.  Crossing the front loops in this case will be much easier.  You do not need to be afraid that the extra spoke will slip out. </p><p>  2. At first, you should not show imagination, act strictly according to the drawing.  Otherwise, you will get confused in the loops, and your even pigtail will turn into its ugly likeness. </p><p>  3. Do not forget that things with such a pattern receive additional volume and relief.  Keep this in mind when choosing yarn and knitting patterns. </p><p>  4. The gum bound in this technique will be tough.  Therefore, if you choose a barbed thread, you can hardly wear such a hat or sweater. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

For example, you can knit two loops together face crossed, just remember to add loops in this or the next row.  The pattern will turn out no less beautiful and original.  In general, just looking at the illustrations for this article, you can imagine the variety of patterns associated in this technique.  But in reality there are even more!  Do not stop learning, improve, and your work will not only please and warm your loved ones, but also surprise others.
