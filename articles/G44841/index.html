    <h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Nazareth in Israel is located 25 km from the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGalilee, in a huge hollow.  The city is surrounded by the hills of the Lower Galilee, whose height does not exceed 500 meters.  From these peaks there are magnificent views that are admired by everyone who comes to Nazareth (Israel).  The sights of the city are amazing.  There are many temples, monasteries and churches, several Muslim shrines, historical monuments, on the territory of which archaeological excavations are carried out today. </p><p>  Nazareth is a city in Israel where tourists will need modest clothing and this is especially important when visiting places of religious worship.  Experienced tourists believe that the most favorable time to visit this city is autumn and spring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nazareth in <span>Israel: attractions</span> (photo with description) </h2><p>  In this city there are a lot of interesting and memorable places where tourists should definitely visit.  We will present you the most popular and interesting sights of Nazareth. </p><h2>  Ancient Sepphoris </h2><p>  This is a famous national park located six kilometers from Nazareth.  Large-scale archaeological excavations are carried out here.  It is believed that the name of this ancient city came from the word "bird".  For the first time it is mentioned in documents dated 100 BC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nazareth Israel Attractions" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1858095.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Under King Herod, Sepphoris was the capital of one of the four parts of the kingdom (tetrarchy).  Later, the residence of Herod Antipas was located here, during the reign of which a fortress wall was erected.  In 363, a strong earthquake occurred in Sepphoris.  His further fate is quite typical for the history of the region: it included the Byzantine period, the era of the Crusaders, the rule of the sheikhs and the revolt of the Arabs.  Until the 10th century, the Jewish community remained in the city. </p><p>  The park welcomes guests throughout the year.  In addition to archaeological finds, tourists will certainly be interested in visiting the crusader fortress and the church of <span>St. Anne</span> and Joachim, the parents of the Virgin Mary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temple of the Annunciation </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the temple of the Annunciation in Nazareth is not only the main attraction of the city, but also of all Israel.  This is the largest religious building in the Middle East.  The magnificent Catholic Church in the city center was built on the site of temples of Byzantine times.  This place has long attracted numerous pilgrims. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nazareth city in Israel" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1853680.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Inside the huge complex is the cave of the same name, in which, according to Catholics, the Virgin Mary learned from the archangel Gabriel that she would soon become a mother.  The church, 55 meters high with powerful walls and an unusual concrete dome, looks like a fortress, but at the same time admires with its exquisite beauty. </p><p>  It harmoniously combines modern church design with the remains of ancient churches that can be seen from the cave.  The upper church is decorated with mosaics that were donated by Catholic communities from different countries. </p><h2>  Greek Catholic Church </h2><p>  According to researchers, Nazareth is a city in Israel, which even today requires detailed study.  Presumably in the place where the church is today, in ancient times there was a small synagogue in which Christ studied and prayed.  Here he preached to the inhabitants of the city.  Thousands of pilgrims came here, which required the construction of a small church, which today belongs to the Greek Catholic community. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nazareth photo israel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1853682.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here at every step there are amazing monuments that are holy to Christians around the world. </p><p>  The Orthodox Church claims that the <span>archangel Gabriel</span> appeared to the Virgin Mary at the source, above which is now a church, consecrated in honor of this saint.  According to the gospel, Mary was gathering water at the source when the archangel Gabriel appeared to her and announced the good news.  The current well, located at the end of Paul VI Street, was built recently, but the source at this place has been known since ancient times. </p><p>  This is confirmed by archaeological excavations under the souvenir shop located next door.  There were discovered Roman baths that existed in the era of Jesus.  A narrow passage extends through the <span>church of the archangel Gabriel</span> and leads to the altar, from which the source can be viewed from below. </p><h2>  Mount Tabor </h2><p>  An iconic place for pilgrims visiting Nazareth in Israel.  It is located in the north of the country in the Lower Galilee, at a distance of nine kilometers from Nazareth.  It is a mountain 588 meters high.  According to one of the many versions, its name can be translated as "navel", which is associated with its uniform and rounded shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Israel Hotels Nazareth" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1853690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is an opinion that it was here that the Transfiguration of the Lord took place, one of the most important events of the gospel history.  Now there are two monasteries on the top of the mountain.  One of them is a 19th century Greek Orthodox convent.  It was built on the site of a Byzantine temple.  On its territory is the temple of the Transfiguration.  In 1911, the bell tower was completed. </p><p>  The second monastery is Franciscan, Catholic, located on the site of a 13th-century Muslim fortress.  Here is the basilica of the Transfiguration of the Lord - the creation of the architect Antonio Barluzzi.  You can go to the Catholic monastery through the "Wind Gate".  <span>Mount Tabor</span> is also mentioned in the Old Testament <span>.</span>  At its foot was Via Maris, an ancient trade route linking Egypt and Syria.  Numerous historical events took place here: the battles of the crusaders and Saracens, the <span>wars of the</span> kingdom of <span>Judea</span> , the battle of Napoleon‚Äôs troops. </p><p>  The medieval road that leads up the hill has also been preserved.  It is not available for the movement of buses, so you can go up it only by car or on foot. </p><h2>  Nazareth Market </h2><p>  If you happen to visit Nazareth in Israel, then do not miss the opportunity to see the city market, which snakes through the narrow streets of the Old City.  This is one of the largest <span>eastern bazaars in</span> Israel.  Despite the many foreign guests walking and looking at goods, this is a true Arab market, where not only residents of Nazareth, but also its surroundings come for shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nazareth israel attractions photo with description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1853688.jpg" width="600"></div>
