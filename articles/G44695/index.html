They are levied on property, income or land.  Fees are also paid by different companies or individual entrepreneurs, depending on the tax regime applied.  Every month and annually it is necessary to transfer a really significant amount of funds to the state budget.  Therefore, many people have a question about how to evade taxes by legal methods.  If you use illegal methods, this will lead to criminal prosecution of a citizen.  To reduce each type of tax, you can use various unique methods. </p><h2>  How to reduce personal income tax? </h2><p>  From each person‚Äôs salary, 13% is transferred to the budget every month.  In this case, the tax agent is the employer, who not only pays the fee, but also submits the necessary documentation to the Federal Tax Service for his employees.  Employees of different companies may not be involved in calculating this fee, but at the same time they are thinking about how to avoid paying taxes in order to slightly increase their salaries. </p><p>  For example, if a citizen receives 35 thousand rubles, then in his hands he receives only 30450 rubles, and 4550 rubles.  transferred to the state budget.  There are several ways that make it possible to save on the payment of personal income tax.  These include: </p><ul><li>  switching to a gray salary, but this method is not legal for the immediate employer, so if such a violation is detected, the head of the company will be held accountable; </li><li>  tax refund to the Federal Tax Service or through the employer, for which different types of deductions are used, for example, if a citizen purchased residential property on his own, he can return 13% from 2 million rubles, which will significantly increase a person‚Äôs monthly income; </li><li>  The amount of personal income tax decreases for some beneficiaries, which include people with disabilities, veterans or underage workers. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the property deduction, you can issue other types of returns.  For example, standard benefits are offered to employees who have minor children.  Social deductions are made out if last year a citizen spent a certain amount of money on treatment or tuition, and they are provided even if the money is spent on training or treatment of close relatives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.apwealth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to avoid car tax" class="if uuid-3222489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222489.jpg"></div><h2>  How to reduce the transport fee? </h2><p>  If a citizen has his own car, then he will have to pay a transport tax to the regional budget annually.  Its size depends on various factors, which include: </p><ul><li>  power of an existing machine; </li><li>  region of residence of the citizen, since tariffs are set by the local authorities of each city; </li><li>  discount offered only to beneficiaries. </li></ul><p>  To reduce this fee, you can use the following methods: </p><ul><li>  relocation to another region; </li><li>  machine power reduction; </li><li>  car registration for a person who can take advantage of the benefits when paying this fee. </li></ul><p>  Each method has its own characteristics, but if a person is interested in avoiding a car tax, he can use some legal methods to transfer a small amount of funds to the regional budget. </p><h2>  Auto power reduction </h2><p>  The amount of transport tax depends entirely on how much power a car registered for a citizen has.  That engine power is taken into account in the process of calculating the size of the collection.  This characteristic can be found in TCP. </p><p>  If the citizen is sure that in fact the power of his car is less than indicated in the TCP, then you can correct this error by contacting the traffic police department.  The most common discrepancies are due to the following reasons: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  mistakes made by officials in the process of filling TCP; </li><li>  significant wear on the car leads to a decrease in its power. </li></ul><p>  To prove that the power of the car is less, you will have to order a technical examination.  This issue will have to be addressed only to specialized organizations that have the necessary license.  As soon as the necessary changes are made to the traffic police database, you need to request a certificate, which is then transmitted to the employees of the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  You can further reduce power by buying a less powerful car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get away from transport tax" class="if uuid-3222485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222485.jpg"></div><h2>  Re-registration of a car on a beneficiary </h2><p>  How to get away from the transport tax without using the power of the machine?  To do this, you can re-register your property to another person who has the right to use the benefits when paying this fee.  Beneficiaries are determined not only by federal, but also by local legislation. </p><p>  As a standard, the car tax is not paid by the following citizens: </p><ul><li>  people with disabilities, but they are offered exemption exclusively on the condition that they drive special cars converted for their limited capabilities, and you also need to buy such a car using social services; </li><li>  retirees in many cities can expect a significant discount in the process of paying this fee. </li></ul><p>  How to get away from transport tax with the help of beneficiaries?  To do this, any citizen can re-register his car to a person who can get exemption from paying a fee.  But at the same time, you must trust this citizen so that he does not appropriate a vehicle.  Most often, a car is reissued for parents who are already in retirement age, so they can count on a significant discount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Residence in another city </h2><p>  In the process of calculating the transportation tax, the tariff, which is set by the local authorities of each city, is taken into account.  How to avoid tax?  To do this, you can obtain a permanent or temporary registration in another region where a low tariff is used. </p><p>  Most often, Muscovites use this trick, since a significant tariff is applied in the capital.  They often register in another region where their close relatives live.  This allows them to pay a not too significant amount of funds to the state budget for their cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cypruscompanyformation.com.cy" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to avoid taxes when renting an apartment" class="if uuid-3222490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222490.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to reduce property tax </h2><p>  If a person has any property officially registered with him, then he has to pay a certain amount of funds to the budget every year until December 1 of each year.  Its size depends on the cadastral value of the existing property.  A fee is paid for apartments, rooms, shares in housing, houses or other similar objects. </p><p>  How to get away from property tax?  Different methods may be used to reduce this fee, but not all of them are legal.  If a person does not want to pay a large amount of funds for his property, then it is advisable to use only legal methods, otherwise you will have to face negative consequences. </p><p>  How to get away from apartment tax?  In order not to annually transfer a substantial amount of funds to the state, you can take advantage of the following legal and simple tricks: </p><ul><li>  re-registration of real estate per person who is a beneficiary under federal or regional legislation, and usually there are discounts for pensioners, people with disabilities, veterans of labor and other citizens, but it is advisable to contact the social protection department of a particular region to obtain relevant information; </li><li>  the use of a deduction, and if a person has only a small share in an apartment or house, then he can get an exemption from paying a fee at all; </li><li>  registration of a residential object as a place for doing business, which will lead to the need to pay a fee only to a company that uses this room for its work; </li><li>  change of use of the object. </li></ul><p>  The easiest way is considered to be housing for a beneficiary, who should be a close relative of a citizen.  Other methods are considered quite risky and specific.  But at the same time, it is taken into account that the state offers the benefit to only one property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www1.nyc.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to avoid taxes un" class="if uuid-3222487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222487.jpg"></div><h2>  How to avoid tax when selling an apartment? </h2><p>  If a person sells his property, then he has to pay a large amount of funds to the budget, since 13% is transferred from the income received.  For example, if a citizen sells his apartment for 2.4 million rubles, then of the amount received, 312 thousand rubles are paid to the budget.  This amount is considered significant, therefore, citizens have a question about how to avoid tax when selling a house or apartment.  To do this, you can use the following methods: </p><ul><li>  registration of a deduction, which amounts to 1 million rubles, therefore, if an object is sold at a lower cost, then there is no need to pay a fee; </li><li>  it is not necessary to pay sales tax if the property has been owned by a person for more than three years, but this only applies to the situation when the apartment or house was obtained on the basis of a gratuitous transaction represented by donation or inheritance; </li><li>  if the apartment was bought, then you will not have to pay a fee from its sale if it belonged to the seller for more than five years; </li><li>  if the seller has documents that confirm his spending on the purchase of real estate, then he will have to pay the fee only with the difference in price, so if the apartment is sold cheaper, you will not have to transfer any amount of funds to the budget. </li></ul><p>  Many people, wanting to avoid paying the fee, intentionally in the contract of sale reduce the cost of the apartment.  Now this method does not work, because if the selling price is too low, then the Federal Tax Service employees use the cadastral price in the calculation process, so the seller of real estate still has to pay a fee.  If you understand how to avoid tax when selling an apartment, you can significantly reduce the tax burden. </p><h2>  How not to pay money for rental housing? </h2><p>  If a person has several real estate objects, then often he decides to rent one apartment to increase his income.  But it is important to carry out the procedure officially, for which a formal contract is concluded between the lessor and the lessee.  A citizen must pay a fee from the income received, but often lessors have a question about how to avoid taxes when renting an apartment. </p><p>  In order not to pay the fee, you can use only two ways: </p><ul><li>  illegal rental of real estate; </li><li>  the correct conclusion of an agreement with the tenant. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, the transaction is not registered with Rosreestr.  However, it is still possible to draw up a contract with the tenant.  Under such conditions, certain risks arise for the owner of the real estate, since if the tenant does not pay the funds or even damages the property of the citizen, then it will be impossible to recover money from him even through the court.  Additionally, if employees of the Federal Tax Service become aware of such an activity, the homeowner will be held accountable. </p><p>  Is it possible to evade tax legally?  The landlord can legally reduce the fee if the contract is correctly drawn up.  The tax is paid only for the year, so if the agreement is drawn up with the lessee for a shorter period, the lessor may not transfer the fee to the Federal Tax Service.  Such a contract can be drawn up by a notary public or independently.  This agreement is registered in the Federal Registration Service, and this method has many advantages.  The relationship between the two parties will be formalized, so if you have different problems, you can easily go to court to claim your rights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aarp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how can you avoid taxes" class="if uuid-3222491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222491.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get away from IP taxes? </h2><p>  If a person is engaged in entrepreneurial activity, then he has to pay taxes to the Federal Tax Service, and their size depends on the chosen taxation regime and the profit received.  How to evade taxes for individual entrepreneurs?  The way to reduce the fee depends on which system is used to calculate the tax.  Therefore, the following nuances are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  if a simplified tax system is used, then a fee is paid either on all income, or only on net profit, therefore, to reduce the tax, it is advisable to choose the system of tax system "Income minus expenses", after which the costs of doing business increase; </li><li>  with the simplified tax system, the tax base can be reduced only for expenses that are reasonable and confirmed by official documents; </li><li>  if you choose UTII for work, then you can reduce the fee only by reducing the physical indicator, for example, if the entrepreneur is engaged in retail trade, then you need to choose only a small room for this activity; </li><li>  it is impossible to reduce the cost of a patent in any way, so if an SPE is used, then the entrepreneur will not be able to influence the price of this document; </li><li>  with the application of OSNO, income tax can be reduced by raising other expenses. </li></ul><p>  If the entrepreneur begins to use any illegal methods, then he will have to face negative consequences.  For attempts to evade tax not only administrative, but also criminal liability is applied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycrashers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to avoid taxes" class="if uuid-3222482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222482.jpg"></div><h2>  Features for companies </h2><p>  Even owners of different companies are thinking about how to avoid taxes.  They usually want to reduce the amount of VAT and income tax.  To do this, you can use the following legal tricks: </p><ul><li>  purchase of working capital, as a result of which all received income will be taken into account in expenses, and also this will lead to expansion of production and increase in the company's capacity; </li><li>  an increase in expenses of the company, which inevitably leads to a decrease in income and tax base, as a result of which the company transfers a small amount of funds to the state budget, although usually this situation is the basis for extraordinary tax audits; </li><li>  cash withdrawal, although this method is illegal, as well as such fraud often lead to checks by the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  withdrawal of money to offshore zones, but this is only possible with the implementation of foreign economic transactions; </li><li>  VAT reduction due to deductions. </li></ul><p>  Practice shows that the purchase of working capital does not bring any tangible benefits to the direct owner of the company.  Therefore, usually entrepreneurs use other, but legal methods to save on taxes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rawstory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to avoid tax when selling an apartment" class="if uuid-3222483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3222483.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Everyone wants to know how to evade taxes by legal means.  Different tricks can be used by people paying property tax or personal income tax, and there are also some ways to reduce the fees of entrepreneurs and business owners. </p><p>  It is advisable to use exclusively legal and proven methods, since if illegal fraud and schemes are used, this can even lead to criminal prosecution.  Enterprises that deceive employees of the Federal Tax Service are forced to pay large fines, and often this leads to a suspension of their activities.  In fact, there are many ways in which it is legally possible to reduce the amount of paid contributions, and you can not worry about the negative consequences. </p>
