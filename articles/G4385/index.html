Touring is not a cheap pleasure, and I want to save at least on something, for example, on housing.  What are the options for cheap accommodation in St. Petersburg? </p><h2>  Options </h2><p>  There are three accommodation options both in St. Petersburg and in any city in general (well, not counting the overnight at the station or on the benches, but this is absolutely for extreme people).  Guests are offered a hotel, apartment or room for rent and a hostel.  About each - in order.  But first‚Ä¶ </p><h2>  Inexpensive - how much? </h2><p>  For all people, the concepts of high cost and low cost are directly dependent on the financial condition.  But since most of the tourists belong to the middle class, and you should focus on this category, which means that fashionable hotels with four and five stars disappear for sure. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap accommodation in St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2072079.jpg">  Inexpensive - this is an amount in the range of up to three thousand per day.  Typically, for a price you can find a hotel room, but amenities will be on the floor.  If they are desirable in the room, then the cost is likely to be more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Inexpensive accommodation in <span>St. Petersburg in hotels is</span> possible.  Only, again, you need to consider that three stars is the maximum that is available in this case.  Hotels have a couple of undeniable advantages over other accommodation options - it's security.  All of them are protected, in all, regardless of the type of room service is provided.  But, as a rule, the cost of living is still slightly higher. </p><p>  Recently, mini-hotels began to appear.  In fact, they are no different from ordinary ones, they just have fewer rooms, and the prices can be slightly lower (as a rule, from two and a half thousand).  Mini-hotels are often located in old houses of the nineteenth century, where ancient ceremonial rooms have been preserved.  This is mainly the center of the city. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Accommodation in St. Petersburg inexpensive apartments" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2071582.jpg"></p><p>  By the way, choosing a hotel for an inexpensive stay in St. Petersburg, it makes sense to consider economy options - now there are enough of these in St. Petersburg.  The only convenience in such a hotel is likely to be on the floor.  An important aspect is the season.  In summer, prices are much more expensive everywhere than in winter.  However, on New Year's holidays the cost of living again jumps.  This point must be taken into account when planning a trip, especially if the budget is limited. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cheap accommodation in St. Petersburg: hotels </h2><p>  First, we give some examples of relatively inexpensive St. Petersburg hotels.  These include, for example, the Novel Europe Hotel near the Chernyshevskaya metro station (this is the city center on the Neva).  The cost of living for a double room here is 2500 rubles with a bathroom in the room and a thousand less if the bathroom is shared.  Reviews of tourists about this hotel are only positive. </p><p>  Another reasonably priced hotel is Rinaldi Premier.  It is located near the metro station "Ploshchad Vosstaniya".  Guests are provided with a shuttle service, free Wi-Fi, and the price starts from one thousand four hundred rubles per day.  The same cost and in the apartment house "Little House", located near the metro station "Mayakovskaya".  According to tourists, the location of the hotel is very convenient, almost no noise from the street. </p><h2>  Economy Hotels </h2><p>  An economy class hotel is perhaps one of the best options for those who are short of money.  These are young couples, students, schoolchildren, the elderly.  For a night in such a place you can give only five hundred rubles (well, and above, of course).  True, food is not included in the price, just like there is no separate shower and toilet in the room.  There are twelve hotels of economy class in St. Petersburg.  And the prices there are really impressive.  For example, in the hotel ‚ÄúOn Sadovaya‚Äù a double room costs only one and a half thousand a day, while there is a hotel in the very center of the city - two steps to Nevsky, Kazan Cathedral, Isaac and other attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Accommodation in St. Petersburg inexpensively" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2072081.jpg">  At the Kievskaya hotel, prices are slightly more expensive - from a thousand eight hundred per day.  It is located at three stops from Nevsky Prospekt, on Kurskaya Street, which is also very close.  Near the Moscow railway station is the hotel "Znamenskaya".  You can stay in it at all for ridiculous money - from a thousand rubles per night.  These are just a few examples of the fact that inexpensive <span>hotel</span> accommodation in <span>St. Petersburg is</span> possible. </p><h2>  Inns </h2><p>  In total, in St. Petersburg there are more than two hundred mini-hotels with more than four thousand rooms.  They are in demand among those who arrived in the city on the Neva on business or on a business trip.  In St. Petersburg, there is a whole <span>network of mini-hotels</span> called RA.  These small hotels are located in the city center, on the ground floors of houses.  One of the hotels is located on Nevsky, directly opposite the Gostiny Dvor.  Prices in this hotel chain are quite reasonable - from 2400 rubles per day.  <span>On Ligovsky Prospekt,</span> not far from Moskovsky Train Station, there is another mini-hotel - Esplanade.  An economy room for two here costs from two thousand rubles, a standard - for a thousand with a little more expensive. </p><h2>  Daily rate apartments </h2><p>  In addition to hotels, there are other accommodation options in St. Petersburg inexpensively.  Apartments, for example.  Their plus is independence from strangers (and in general the absence of strangers nearby), the ability to live in a large company, the presence of a kitchen and bathroom with a toilet in constant access.  True, you will have to cook it yourself too, but we cook for ourselves at home.  As a last resort, in St. Petersburg there are a lot of budget cafes and dining rooms where you can quench your appetite tasty and cheap. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Accommodation in St. Petersburg inexpensive apartments for rent" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2072082.jpg">  Now one of the most popular options is to rent an apartment for living.  In St. Petersburg, you can inexpensively find a lot of options, especially if you don‚Äôt rest on the city center, but pay attention to slightly more remote areas - the prices are lower and the quality of the apartments is no worse.  You can find a good one-room apartment, clean and comfortable, for one and a half to two thousand rubles a day.  If you look in the center, then, of course, the price will rise.  There are a lot of sites where you can find an apartment for rent.  However, one of the most popular options is the Airbnb website: it offers really many different apartments for every taste, so you can easily find a place in your pocket. </p><p>  One of the very unusual and interesting options for inexpensive accommodation in St. Petersburg is the three hundred year old house on Mokhovaya Street.  The front door in it looks exactly the same as at the end of the nineteenth century - the spirit of antiquity is in the air.  You can rent "odnushka" in this historical place from two thousand rubles a day, and for a weekly stay they make a ten percent discount. </p><h2>  Rooms for rent </h2><p>  Inexpensive accommodation in St. Petersburg can be provided for yourself in another way, by renting a room, not an apartment.  There are also many such proposals.  At a minimum, you can find them on the above site.  In addition, old women often stand at train stations, wishing to earn some money by renting out part of their apartment. </p><h2>  Hostels </h2><p>  The hostel is a hostel.  Not in the literal sense, of course, but in translation from English, but the essence is close.  These are four-six-eight rooms ... and to infinity people, often with bunk beds.  But there are hostels and private rooms - for one and two people.  This is the cheapest option to stay in St. Petersburg inexpensively.  The hostel can be rented for four hundred or five hundred rubles in a shared room, and in a separate room for just a thousand.  Almost all hostels have a common room with games and movies, provide free breakfast, and tea, coffee, cookies and completely unlimited. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Accommodation in St. Petersburg inexpensive hostel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2072084.jpg">  One of the most popular hostels in St. Petersburg is called "Grandma House".  It is located on Vladimirsky Prospekt, in the immediate vicinity of the Dostoevskaya metro station.  This hostel has a mini library and free Wi-Fi.  On Ligovsky Prospect is the hostel "Graffiti L".  The price in a dormitory room per night is from three hundred rubles.  The Party Train Hostel next door is a little more expensive - from five hundred and eighty rubles a night, but there is a bar and a games room in this place. </p><p>  In general, the closer to the center, the cost will be more expensive, but such a scheme works not only with hostels, but with any type of housing.  In the historic district of St. Petersburg, a hostel‚Äôs dormitory room will have to pay a thousand rubles per night, and even more expensive for a separate room.  But the sights are close.  In total, there are about one hundred and twenty different hostels in the area, and even more if you move away from the center.  You can find them in the same way as apartments - through special sites and search engines. </p><h2>  Areas of residence </h2><p>  With exactly where to live, you also need to decide in advance.  If it is preferable within walking distance from attractions, you need to consider the central areas.  If the budget is still more important, you can slightly expand the geography of your searches - at least a couple of kilometers away from the center.  Remote areas of St. Petersburg, metro end stations are generally the most inexpensive option.  There, by the way, as a rule, it is quieter, and many are very happy with it.  Of course, you will have to spend some time daily on the road to places you want to see, but even if you lived in the center, you would have to go somewhere anyway - not all the sights are concentrated in one area.  Again, if a person travels alone, from the point of view of peace and security, it is better to live in the center - you will not have to go back to hell in the evenings alone. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap st petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2071574.jpg">  If you focus on the subway, then many hotels are located on the red branch.  Its minus is that it is densely populated - during peak hours in the mornings and evenings there is a rush of crowds.  The thing is that it is at the red line station that minibuses come from the suburbs.  Therefore, it is recommended to live on the red metro line in its upper part.  They also advise the blue branch, but, on the contrary, the lower part - the upper one is loaded approximately the same as the red one.  From the final lower metro station of the blue line - "Kupchino" - to Nevsky Prospekt thirty minutes. </p><h2>  Where is more profitable? </h2><p>  In general, if you go with a big company, then where to live is not important.  The amount distributed to all, separately for each individual person, will be very small.  However, if traveling together, then, perhaps, hotels and mini-hotels are not the best option.  It is much easier and cheaper to rent an inexpensive apartment near the metro - this will cost less than two times, if not more.  Of course, living in an apartment requires independent care for food and cleanliness, but if this situation does not bother, then this is still the best choice. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><ol><li>  When choosing a hotel, you need to pay special attention to whether food is included in the price. </li><li>  When traveling with a small child and checking into a hotel / hostel, you need to be interested in the availability of a baby cot (or warn in advance about its necessity). </li><li>  It is more profitable to travel in a large company (from five people). </li><li>  Using reservation systems, you need to look at several different options at once: the price of the same apartment on different sites can vary. </li><li>  When choosing an apartment / hotel, it is important to understand for yourself what is called the city center.  This is Vasilievsky Island, the <span>Petrograd side, the</span> Central and Admiralty districts of St. Petersburg. </li><li>  If the booking site offers any promotions and great offers, you need to use them without hesitation, as this is a good opportunity to save. </li><li>  Booking is always better in advance. </li><li>  Accommodation prices may vary depending on the days of the week, so if you can adjust, it is better to choose the cheapest dates and days. </li><li>  Book online cheaper. </li><li>  Inexpensive hostels (which are the most, the most inexpensive), as a rule, close at a certain time, so you need to have time to return home at a specific hour.  This point must be discussed in advance upon check-in. </li></ol><p>  Even with a fairly limited budget, you can find inexpensive accommodation in St. Petersburg, as in any city in the world, and be sure that the trip will be unforgettable. </p>
