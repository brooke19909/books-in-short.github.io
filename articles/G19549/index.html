A brief biography, terrible and tragic details of its existence are still not disclosed.  The throne in Russia was passed from parents to children, but this procedure could not do without intrigue, scandals and bloodshed. </p><h2>  The background of the struggle </h2><p>  In 1730, Anna Ioannovna was declared the new empress.  This woman is the daughter of Ivan V, who was the elder brother of Peter the Great.  It so happened that both boys were crowned in childhood, but the lesser king became the actual ruler.  Ivan was in poor health, and he did not interfere in government affairs.  All the time he devoted to the family.  In 1693, his fourth daughter was born.  Shortly afterwards, at the age of 29, the senior sovereign died.  Many years later, his great-grandson, John Antonovich Romanov, came to power for a short time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="john antonovich romanov" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1068156.jpg" width="295"></div>

    <p>  Even at a fairly young age, in 1710, Anna Ioannovna, at the request of Peter the Great, was given to marry a foreign duke.  However, less than three months later, the newly-made husband died.  Now scientists believe that the cause of the tragic ending is excessive alcohol consumption.  Consequently, the 17-year-old widow for a long time lived in St. Petersburg with her mother.  The woman did not marry again, and she never had children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The path to power </h2><p>  After the death of Peter the Great, the question arose who should rule the state further.  The day before, the emperor repealed the law, according to which the throne was transmitted only through the male line.  Among the applicants for the throne were two daughters: Anna, who refused all rights, and Elizabeth, she was 15 years old at the time of her father‚Äôs death.  The eldest son of Peter from his first marriage, Alexei, was denied the throne.  Other scenarios were not considered then.  They did not take into account the descendants of <span>Ivan V,</span> among whom John Antonovich Romanov subsequently appeared. </p><p>  Accordingly, under the new laws, the wife of <span>Catherine I was</span> declared ruler <span>.</span> However, the woman did not reign for long.  Constant balls undermined her health.  In 1727, she died.  They decided to bring to power the infant son of Tsarevich Alexei - <span>Peter II.</span>  However, the boy was unwell and died in 1730.  The Council decided to enthrone the aforementioned Anna Ioannovna. </p>

    <h2>  Successor birth </h2><p>  The woman had no children, so the successor question became an edge.  In order for the descendants of her father, Ivan V, to remain in power, the ruler decided to call her sister to Russia with her daughter Anna Leopoldovna.  When the girl‚Äôs mother died, the empress raised a child as a native.  Subsequently, she issued a decree according to which the children of the niece are considered direct heirs to the throne.  In 1739, she married the girl to the Duke of Anton Ulrich.  The young people did not like each other, but both understood the essence of a marriage deal.  A year later, namely on August 12, a son was born to the young spouses - John Antonovich Romanov.  Accordingly, the autocrat called the crumb his successor.  Anna Ioannovna made subjects swear allegiance to the little heir. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Continuation of the dynasty </h2><p>  However, she was not destined to take part in the education of the future ruler.  In October, the queen became ill.  A few days later the woman died, having previously appointed the Duke of Biron as regent for young Ivan. </p><p>  The day after the death of the empress, namely October 18, 1740, the little heir was transferred to the Winter Palace with honors.  After 10 days, the boy officially ascended the throne.  Accordingly, the Braunschweig branch began to rule, in which there were many representatives of European nobility.  But thanks to the blood of the empress‚Äôs niece, it was the Romanov dynasty.  John Antonovich was considered the rightful heir. </p><p>  During her lifetime, Anna Ioannovna said that it would be extremely difficult to cope with the post of regent.  The man was interested in power, which in this way was concentrated in his hands.  However, very soon a high position ruined it. </p>

    <h2>  Important posts </h2><p>  Biron behaved confidently, neglected his subjects, including the parents of the little king.  Consequently, very soon his arrogant behavior was tired of the nobility.  Therefore, the guardsmen, led by Field Marshal Minich, were unhappy about the coup d'etat and sent Biron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  John Antonovich Romanov needed a new regent.  They became the mother of the autocrat - <span>Anna Leopoldovna.</span>  The cunning Minih understood: the young woman will not be able to cope with all state affairs, therefore she will entrust the management of the country to him.  However, his hopes were not realized. </p><p>  At first, the man hoped for the rank of generalissimo.  This post was given to the father of the heir.  Minich became a minister.  That power would be enough for him.  But during court intrigues he was pushed away from business.  The coveted role in the court was taken by Osterman. </p>

    <h2>  Intrigues of the rulers </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the boy was very small, he served as king.  Many foreign guests refused to read documents without the presence of the emperor.  While adults were engaged in important matters, the little autocrat played on the throne.  A very respected person was John Antonovich Romanov.  Parents were having fun at the time.  Anna Leopoldovna tried for some time to participate in resolving state issues, but very quickly realized that she could not do it.  Documents indicate that she was a soft and dreamy woman.  She spent her free time reading novels and did not really like festivities.  Anna did not pay much attention to fashion and walked around the palace in simple clothes. </p><p>  At that time, they paid tribute to the little monarch: they dedicated poems and poems, issued coins with his profile. </p>

    <h2>  Fateful night </h2><p>  Despite the status, young parents tried not to pamper their son.  However, he did not have to enjoy fame.  In the short time of Anna Leopoldovna‚Äôs reign, her rating fell significantly.  Taking advantage of the situation, on December 6, 1741, <span>Elizabeth I</span> (daughter of Peter I) made a coup.  Then John Antonovich Romanov lost all rights.  The years of the reign of the monarch ended without ever beginning. </p><p>  The self-proclaimed empress took the baby from the cradle, saying that it was not his fault that his parents had sinned.  On the way from the palace, the boy played cheerfully in his arms, completely not understanding what was happening. </p><p>  The royal family and their like-minded people were punished.  Some were sent to Siberia, the rest were executed.  Elizabeth intended to take the young spouses abroad.  However, she was afraid that over time, the enemies of the crown would return them to their homeland. </p>

    <h2>  Life behind bars </h2><p>  The family was transported to Riga near prison, and in 1744 to Kholmogory.  Toddler isolated from parents.  There are documents testifying that the mother was sitting in one part of the fortress, and John Antonovich Romanov was behind the wall.  Whose son, what is the title of a prisoner and what kind of blood flows in his veins - the guards knew.  However, they did not have the right to tell the child about his origin. </p><p>  Having given birth to four more children in exile, Anna died at the age of 27.  The husband survived his wife for 30 years. </p><p>  From infancy, Ivan VI lived in solitary confinement.  They did not play with the child, did not learn to read and write.  The guards did not even have the right to talk to him.  However, the boy knew that he was the heir to the throne.  The guy spoke little and stuttered. </p><p>  The raw cell had a bed, a table and a toilet.  When the room was cleaned, the boy walked behind the screen.  It was rumored that he wore an iron mask. </p><p>  Several times he was visited by Russian monarchs.  However, each of them saw a threat in the youth.  Even under Elizabeth, portraits and documents with the name and image of the little king were destroyed and hidden.  Smelted coins with the profile of Ivan.  Even foreigners were severely punished for storing such money. </p><h2>  Tragic ending </h2><p>  It was said for some time that Catherine II planned to marry a prisoner and thus stop the dispute in the state.  However, this theory has not been confirmed.  But one thing is certain: the queen ordered the guards to kill the prisoner if someone rescues him. </p><p>  They wanted to cut the young man into monks.  Then he could not claim the throne.  But the heir refused.  Perhaps it was then that he was taught to read and write, and the only book he read was the Bible. </p><p>  It was rumored that the guy had grown crazy.  However, other sources say that he was smart, albeit reserved. </p>

    <p>  They did not stop twisting the intrigues of the Romanovs.  The dynasty in the novels (John Antonovich - one of the main figures) has never been cordial.  Several times the name of the young man was used in invented riots. </p><p>  In 1764, the prisoner was in the Shlisselburg fortress.  Second Lieutenant Mirovich persuaded part of the guard to release the legal emperor.  The guards acted according to the instructions: they killed an innocent young man.  He was 23 years old by then.  There is a version that the rebellion was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe empress, who thus decided to remove the competitor. </p><p>  For a long time after that, <span>Ivan VI</span> was not even remembered.  And only after the fall of the empire began to appear information about the tragic fate of this representative of the Romanovs. </p>
