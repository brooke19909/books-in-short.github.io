But today Bali is a rather popular and modern resort that has cordially opened its doors to tourists from all over the world.  It is here that you can enjoy a relaxing holiday, picturesque nature, the beauty of the sea and just a romantic atmosphere.  The village of Bali is located literally in the middle between Heraklion and Rethymnon, a little away from National Road, on the banks of several beautiful and cozy bays.  The village got its name back in the days of Turkish rule and translated from Turkish Bali means "honey".  Indeed, a quiet and in its own way "home" resort town receives a lot of tourists. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atali village 3 o crete retimno bali" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44425/1449436.jpg" width="600"></div>
