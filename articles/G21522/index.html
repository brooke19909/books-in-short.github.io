Turkey Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The gentle sea, the bright sun, interesting excursions - this is a wonderful vacation that Turkey provides.  Places of rest are the most diverse: million-strong megalopolises and small towns, historical monuments and protected areas, elite beaches and crowded resorts such as the Lara region. </p><h2>  Lara </h2><p>  In a special tourist area, near Antalya, which is called Lara, many hotels have been built, including the Lara Hadrianus Hotel. </p><p>  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLara is known for its excellent beaches, which extend a solid golden strip for many kilometers between Kundu and Antalya.  Here are concentrated hotels of various classes - from the most luxurious complexes to budget buildings.  The price level of rest in Lara depends on the distance from the sea coast. </p><p>  Any map of Turkey with hotels shows a high concentration of resort infrastructure in the area - more and more shops, spa centers, amusement parks and restaurants are being built here. </p><p>  Arriving at the <span>airport of Antalya,</span> you can get to Lara by city bus (600A).  Usually it leaves from the International terminal, a ticket costs about three and a half lira. </p><p>  In Lara Hadrianus Hotel 4 * can also be reached by taxi or hotel bus, pre-ordering a transfer service. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  In the Lara zone and in Antalya, the climate is the same for the Mediterranean regions.  In summer, the weather is hot (more than thirty degrees) and there is almost no rainfall, and in winter it is not cold at all (on average, fifteen degrees of heat) and there is a lot of rain, because nearby mountains - they get in the way of cyclones and heavy rains pour on the sea coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can see snow in Lara, but only as an extraordinary event - over the past seventy years this has been only once. </p><h2>  Lara Hadrianus Hotel </h2><p>  This is a cheap hotel in an ordinary urban neighborhood.  Lara Hadrianus 4 * is located in the Lara zone.  The distance to the sea - 650 meters, to Belek - 35 km, to the center of Antalya - 16 km. </p>

    <p>  The opinion of the hotel depends on individual requirements for comfort and level of service, as well as on the purpose of arrival. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities almost only spend the night in the hotel - and in this case there are more positive reviews.  And people spending more time at the hotel note its shortcomings. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  One of the advantages is a separate beach, which is distinguished by its spaciousness, cleanliness, clear sea water and the lack of hustle and bustle.  The beach has a lot of greenery, there is a bar, locker rooms, decent toilets and showers are installed. </p><p>  The hotel bar serves beer and wine.  Coffee, tea and water are available all the time. </p><p>  The food in the restaurant is good.  The meat is not served in whole chunks, but the chefs try to diversify the menu and prepare many types of dishes from minced meat or chicken. </p><p>  Often mentioned about the composition of vacationers in Lara Hadrianus Hotel 4 *, reviews include reports of a large number of Iranians who come families. </p><p>  Russian tourists talk about unusual traditions for them: for example, Iranian women bathe in a hotel pool in clothes.  For many Russians, this is the first experience of communicating with other cultures, which often turns out to be very useful for them in terms of learning different traditions. </p><p>  In addition, the Iranians drink very little (or do not drink at all) and are always well-dressed, which is also an example for many, perhaps. </p><p>  There are many Turks in local parks who always walk with their wives and children.  And on the streets there are practically no drunks (with the exception of tourists) - even in the evenings. </p><p>  The cozy rooms are quiet and calm, since there are almost no young people, discos are not very noisy and end early. </p><p>  Despite the proximity to the airport, the noise of aircraft in the room is not audible - just close the door to the balcony. </p><p>  The hotel is small, everything is compact and the atmosphere is very calm. </p><h2>  Critical reviews </h2><p>  A fairly large number of tourists mention the location of the Lara Hadrianus Hotel.  The reviews are not always positive - many did not like the fact that the hotel is adjacent to the usual city microdistrict with cheap high-rises, cluttered wastelands, crowds of working people on the streets and many homeless cats and dogs. </p><p>  The city beach, which can be reached on foot in a quarter of an hour, is polluted and has no infrastructure.  The road to the city beach runs right along the crowded streets, where it is not very convenient to appear in beachwear.  In addition, stray dogs can be found on the city beach. </p><p>  On the private hotel beach, only wicker umbrellas are provided free of charge, but they do not save from the hot Turkish sun, so you can quickly get sunbathed. </p><p>  It is forbidden to bring your own drinks to the hotel beach - you have to buy at the bar. </p><p>  A free bus leaves the hotel from the beach without an exact schedule, so you can easily be late for a single flight - in this case you will have to pay for a taxi. </p><p>  Room cleaning is very rare, the stairs on the floors do not wash and do not sweep, when changing bed linen, only sheets are updated. </p><p>  Tourists, vacationing at the Lara Hadrianus Hotel 4 *, report that for lunch and dinner, mainly chicken is served - for ten days there may be no hot dishes from other products. </p><p>  In the hotel bar and restaurant, drinks are served only in glasses (100 grams), for an unopened bottle of water, juice, beer or wine you have to pay extra.  Naturally, all drinks in cups are highly diluted. </p><p>  The rooms have tight bathrooms, so it is impossible to completely open the door (since it rests on the plumbing) and you have to somehow squeeze into the toilet. </p><p>  Many tourists note the absolute absence of the animation declared in the advertisement.  Vacationers have fun at discos or watch movies on the Internet (but you need to pay extra for high-speed access). </p><p>  Some tourists are annoyed by the morning and evening calls of the muezzin (herald of a mosque) and the proximity to the airport. </p><h2>  Other Turkey Hotels </h2><p>  In the Lara zone there are several more hotels similar to the Lara Hadrianus Hotel in terms of cost, room size and catering and leisure for tourists. </p><p>  For example, Club Hotel Falcon 4 * is also a city hotel and consists of several five-story buildings.  Standard room - 18-20 meters.  On TV you can watch 2 Russian channels.  The same set of services is provided as in Lara Hadrianus Hotel - and also in the reviews of tourists there is a lack of declared animation and meat for lunch (except chicken). </p>

    <p>  The quality of services at Club Hotel Falcon is appropriate for its value, and the hotel is well suited for active tourists who want to spend their holidays economically. </p><p>  Among the four-star hotels in Turkey in other resort areas, hotels with a similar cost of living can be noted. </p><p>  So, in Kemer (near Antalya) is the Blauhimmel Hotel, where the minimum cost of living is 64 dollars, while the cheapest room in Lara Hadrianus Hotel is from 40 dollars.  Blauhimmel Hotel provides the same facilities and services. </p>

    <p>  A short list includes the following attractions: </p><ul><li>  the ancient city of Perge; </li><li>  exhibition of sand sculptures; </li><li>  <span>Duden waterfalls</span> ; </li><li>  Lara Kent Park; </li><li>  Kaaraalioglu Park; </li><li>  "Cotton fortress" Pamukalle; </li><li>  <span>water park in Antalya</span> (Dedeman). </li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  In order for a vacation in Lara Hadrianus Hotel to be successful, it is worth taking note of some tips from experienced tourists: </p><ul><li>  You need to bring along an English phrasebook, as well as an Arabic dictionary, as the staff does not speak Russian at all, but not all in English. </li><li>  Employees working in the room service need to be tipped. </li><li>  Take bags of instant coffee or your favorite tea. </li><li>  Near the hotel there is a large Migros store - there you can buy bottled water and drinks, as well as all kinds of sweets. </li><li>  Towels for going to the beach should be taken at the reception, and they work only from 9 a.m.  Therefore, lovers of early bathing is better to take a towel from the room. </li><li>  For good things you should go to the local market, especially on Wednesdays.  The quality is excellent there, and the prices are eight times cheaper than in Antalya. </li><li>  Own hotel beach is located far away, the bus travels only once (and not always on schedule).  You can negotiate with a local taxi driver and calmly go back and forth (about 15 liras). </li><li>  If a tourist leaves early in the morning when the hotel management is absent, the reception staff may demand money for the mythical ‚Äúadditional services‚Äù.  In this case, you should not pay, but you should calmly "sit down and wait for the boss."  Then all problems will disappear instantly. </li><li>  High-speed Internet is paid, so you just need to take on a flash drive more films, books, games and so on. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing the many reviews, we can conclude that the quality of service at the Lara Hadrianus Hotel is quite consistent with the cost of living. </p><p>  The hotel provides a good opportunity for an economical vacation for middle-aged people who appreciate the peace, comfort and tranquility in the room, active rest on the sea and trips on interesting excursions. </p>
