Therefore, many domestic tourists began to consider alternative options for a beach holiday.  Someone goes to India, someone - to Thailand, others prefer the UAE.  Tunisia has recently become very popular with Russians.  For a comfortable stay, this country fits perfectly.  The tourist infrastructure in this resort is developed simply superbly.  Of course, a huge number of comfortable inexpensive hotels is what, among other things, Tunisia can offer its guests.  <span>Hotels Hotel President</span> Resort 3 *, for example, many choose for good service at reasonable prices.  Reviews about this complex on the Web are mostly just good. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  Hotel President is located in Hammamet, in the immediate vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea.  It is located on the second coastline - 400 meters from the beach.  This, of course, is not too close.  However, this hotel does not cause almost any complaints from tourists in terms of location in relation to the sea.  A feature of the Hammamet resort is that living in hotels built on the first coastline is not very convenient here due to the noise of the trains. </p>

    <p>  Russian tourists who have booked rooms at the Hotel President Resort 3 * hotel usually fly to Tunisia, to <span>Enfida Airport.</span>  To get from its territory to the hotel can be a maximum of an hour.  Also, many vacationers come to Hamammet from the airport of Tunisia.  In both cases, it is best to go to the place by bus.  <span>Public transport</span> is located directly opposite the hotel.  You can also hire a taxi or book a transfer at the hotel itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  The Hotel President Resort 3 * is a hotel, reviews about which are really very good, a complex that includes the main five-story building and 15 two-story bungalows.  Its entire territory is planted with beautiful tropical plants and looks like one large garden.  The main hotel courtyard with pools is tiled with light tiles.  Around it are mowed lawns with cafes and bars.  In general, the hotel grounds look very impressive and prestigious.  Many tourists also find the interiors of the main building and bungalows quite worthy. </p><p>  Hotel President Resort by the standards of hotels in Tunisia is quite old.  It was built in 1995.  The last reconstruction in the hotel was also carried out quite a long time ago - in 2010.  In 2013, this hotel became part of the Dessole Resorts &amp; Hotels chain.  The total area occupied by it is 3 hectares. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  If you wish, guests of Hamammet can rent one of 366 comfortable rooms at this hotel.  All rooms rented at this hotel are equipped with televisions, safes and air conditioning.  Unfortunately, there are no refrigerators in the Hotel Club President 3 * hotel (Tunisia, Hammamet).  Of course, for a three-star hotel this is uncharacteristic and causes dissatisfaction with a certain part of the guests.  But all the hotel rooms have balconies equipped with outdoor furniture.  Here you can dry beach items, smoke or just admire the surroundings from here.  The views from the balconies of this hotel really offer very good views - of the sea or the courtyard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bathrooms at the Hotel President Resort 3 * hotel (Tunisia) in each room are individual.  In addition to the traditional set of household chemicals for bathing, a hairdryer is provided here for the convenience of guests.  In addition to the usual rooms, this hotel also has rooms designed specifically for the disabled.  They are equipped so that people with disabilities live in them as conveniently as possible. </p><h2>  Hotel room reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of tourists about the rooms rented in this hotel was very good.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel rooms are large enough for a comfortable stay.  The beds, judging by the reviews of the guests, are very comfortable here, and the maids change their bedding often.  Hotel employees also clean the rooms on time.  Moreover, in most cases, they perform their work well.  There is no living creature in the rooms of the Hotel President Resort 3 * hotel <span>(Tunisia, Hammamet)</span> , and the equipment here works more or less properly. </p>

    <p>  Some complaints from tourists are caused by the furniture installed in the hotel rooms.  This hotel is, after all, really very old, and the beds with tables and nightstands here are a little shabby and shabby.  Also, many guests really do not like the decoration of the corridors of the bungalow.  Some Russian vacationers even compare it with the design of the halls of Soviet hospitals at the end of the last century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another minus of the rooms of this hotel is that they practically do not catch free Wi-Fi.  Hotel guests can use the Internet only in the lobby or by the pool.  Yes, and here the Network, unfortunately, works every other time. </p><h2>  Hotel President Resort 3 * <span>(Tunisia):</span> service <span>reviews</span> </h2><p>  The staff at this hotel, according to most vacationers, is very competent and polite.  This applies to both maids and administrators or kitchen workers.  All problems arising from guests, hotel staff are trying to solve as quickly as possible.  At the reception at the Hotel President Resort, there is also a Russian-speaking administrator.  Her name is Faith.  For those tourists who do not know English, it is worth contacting her for all arising questions. </p><p>  Many consider the hotel‚Äôs slightly biased attitude to Russian tourists as some of the drawbacks of this hotel.  The best numbers here are often given to Germans or visitors from other European countries.  This, of course, in many cases causes quite legitimate indignation of our compatriots.  In addition, some tourists note the fact that German youth resting at the hotel often behaves too noisy, interfering with other guests. </p>
