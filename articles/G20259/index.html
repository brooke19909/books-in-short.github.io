  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car radio JVC KW-AV51: description, specifications, instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, large car radios with touch displays have entered into fashion, allowing not only to listen to music, but also to watch movies.  They can act as headsets for smartphones.  One of them is the JVC KW-AV51, which has a number of advantages and allows you to turn part of the car panel into a real multimedia center.  A large number of connectors for connecting additional devices expands its capabilities and leaves prospects for improving sound and selecting the appropriate source for playing music files.  In order to understand its advantages and disadvantages, you should first familiarize yourself with the basic functionality, and then analyze user reviews. </p><h2>  Sound sources </h2><p>  In order to receive your favorite songs non-stop, the driver can use the built-in radio.  It has a pretty good reception and allows you to listen to the radio even in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãuncertain reception.  Due to the additional processing of the radio signal, it is possible to improve the sound quality and increase the comfort of listening to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brandbeast.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio jvc kw" class="if uuid-2994539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994539.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to listen to your own collections, you can use the built-in drive in the JVC KW-AV51 to play discs.  Through the use of a modern system, he can read not only classic CDs, but also more capacious DVDs, which can fit much more your favorite tracks.  If using compact disks is inconvenient, then a suitable solution would be to use a USB drive.  Its role can be played by either a simple flash drive or an external hard drive formatted according to the FAT32 standard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another feature is the ability to use the radio as an amplifier, using the AUX input located on its front panel.  The presence of an input for a linear signal allows you to connect any external devices, such as game consoles, players and portable TVs.  This requires a special cable.  You can find out its pinout for the radio in the instructions attached to it. </p><h2>  Wireless Signal Capabilities </h2><p>  There is no built-in adapter for connecting smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth, but at the same time it can be purchased separately and connected to the appropriate port.  The firmware of the JVC KW-AV51 radio supports the configuration of various devices not only as conventional sources of stereo music, but also as headsets for talking on the speakerphone without using hands and violating traffic rules. </p><p>  Another feature is support for synchronization with some devices to work with the phone book and display on the radio display of incoming messages.  This is especially convenient when the phone is in your pocket, and it is inconvenient to get it while driving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bukalapak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jvc kw av51 specifications" class="if uuid-2994540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994540.jpg"></div><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  Although the radio is quite large, the manufacturer did not refuse to make the front panel removable.  This moment will please drivers who are worried about the safety of their car.  In addition, in the event of damage to the display, it will be possible to repair the JVC KW-AV51 by simply replacing the entire panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When installing and removing difficulties, it does not arise, all the mounts and connectors are thought out, the panel can be put literally blindly.  The connectors are sturdy and do not become loose over time, which guarantees reliable display operation. </p><h2>  Radio installation </h2><p>  In order to carry out the installation of the car radio, you will need to make sure that the car has a seat for 2-DIN format devices.  If there is none, then it is recommended either to look at the compact model, or buy and install a separate special pocket. </p><p>  The connection of the main connectors is standard, therefore, difficulties with installing and pinning the radio will not arise even for those who have not encountered such work before.  If the car already had a similar radio, then it would be enough just to switch the corresponding connector into the socket of the new ‚Äúhead‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio pinout" class="if uuid-2994541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994541.jpg"></div><p>  To deal with the remaining connectors, designed to connect to peripheral devices, complete instructions for the JVC KW-AV51 will help.  It describes in detail which one is suitable for connecting a certain type of equipment, as well as how to correctly perform post-installation configuration. </p><h2>  Playing video files </h2><p>  The radio supports the playback of most modern and outdated formats, so that drivers have the opportunity to watch their favorite movies during parking.  In addition, there is a connector on the rear panel that allows you to install and connect an additional monitor for passengers.  It can be mounted in the headrest of one of the front seats or mounted on the ceiling of the cabin.  This feature is useful primarily for families with children, who can turn on cartoons for the duration of the trip, and thus occupy them. </p><p>  You can play videos from regular DVDs, as well as using USB drives.  Not even a very large external hard drive is enough for an impressive collection of music and films. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiocentre.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jvc kw av51 connection" class="if uuid-2994542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994542.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  The main task of any radio, regardless of its functionality, is to play music.  It is the quality of the sound played that can be called the criterion by which the final selection is made.  The radio in question, according to reviews about it, received a sound path that allows you to produce surround, deep sound.  The presence of an equalizer and a low-frequency amplification system made it possible to connect even a budget or stock speaker system to it and tune it in such a way that familiar melodies could please your hearing. </p><p>  The basic characteristics of the JVC KW-AV51 are about the same as other devices of this type.  The built-in amplifier supports up to 4 speakers with a power of 50 watts each.  If you need deep bass, you can connect a subwoofer with its own amplifier and capacitor.  For this, a linear output is provided on the rear panel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bukalapak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jvc kw av51 instruction" class="if uuid-2994544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994544.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive and negative sides of the model </h2><p>  If we analyze in detail the reviews left by the drivers about this model, we can highlight its main pros and cons.  Among the positive aspects, the following are most often noted: </p><ul><li>  The ability to expand functionality due to numerous additional inputs and outputs. </li><li>  A removable panel that allows you to protect the car from illegal entry in order to seize the radio. </li><li>  A nice and clear menu through which the initial setup.  Even without instructions, it can be configured intuitively, since all parameters are written in simple language. </li><li>  Simple connection.  JVC KW-AV51 can be mounted by anyone who reads the instructions, and all wires of the proprietary connector are signed in accordance with their purpose. </li><li>  The ability to fine-tune sound quality to the existing speaker system. </li><li>  A wide selection of audio sources, ranging from classic radio to various portable devices with wired and wireless connections. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jvc kw av51 without panel" class="if uuid-2994543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2994543.jpg"></div><p>  Among the minuses of the JVC KW-AV51 model, one can single out a slightly slow switching between menu items and folders on external media, as well as a rather loud fan designed to cool components.  The rest of the drivers did not find critical problems and are happy with their purchase. </p>
