Coin 1 ruble 1970 "100 years to Lenin"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To consider the banknotes depicting the image of a political leader, we will try to find out who he is and who he was in a particular country.  Take for the specifics of the USSR-a necessity.  Our choice fell on banknotes, coins and paper rubles with the image of Lenin Vladimir Ilyich.  What is his life like?  What has he done so that his profile or full face is immortalized on the country's money? </p><blockquote><p>  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (Ulyanov) (1870 - 1924) - the leader of two revolutions, the head of the first state in world history based on socialist doctrine, and an influential politician of his time. </p></blockquote><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  The country of the Soviets had sufficient experience in creating banknotes, both ordinary and copies for the anniversary, birthday of the leader of the state, or the date of the heroic feat.  Vladimir Ilyich was the leader of the world revolution.  The image of Lenin was taken as the basis of symbolism on the country's military heraldry, on the money supply in the USSR.  The publication of the image of the leader of the proletariat took place on paper and iron money with ingenious diversity and art. </p><h2>  USSR country, year 1970 - 100 years to Ilyich </h2><p>  Today, coins in terms of quality and variety of images have a meager character, impoverished structure, earlier artists of the mint worked true miracles.  What can I say, only one ruble with the image of Lenin there is a wide variety of types. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.123rf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The image of Lenin's symbols on the commemorative coins of the USSR in full growth version" class="if uuid-3098732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098732.jpg"></div><p>  For example, the popular and mythical jubilee ruble, chasing on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the head of the first world socialist state - Lenin V.I. in 1970.  By such a great date, it was necessary to create something epic, meaningful and vivid, as the hero of the day was.  And the mint in the distant seventieth year, it was a success. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Jubilee coin as a work of art </h2><p>  The work of art was the anniversary 1 ruble issued in the USSR on the centenary of the birth of the permanent leader and "father."  The jubilee product of the mint of the Union of the impressive type looked like this: </p><ul><li>  Obverse - front side.  The copy contains the profile of Lenin V.I. in the form of a wide-format head size around the neck.  Thus, a large part of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe obverse of the coin is occupied, with the exception of the canvas from a number of points passing along the edge of the element.  Canvas takes profile in the ring.  The bottom has the outline of a period of two dates: the birth of Lenin and the current release date of the ruble.  The numbers in the stamped font at the bottom of the obverse are: ‚Äú1870 - 1970‚Äù.  The butt ringed with a star belt of a five-pointed structure / </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="1 ruble 1870 1970. Obverse" class="if uuid-3098727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098727.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Reverse is the flip side.  The emblem of the Soviet Union is depicted here: wheat ears on each side tied with a ribbon, in the center of which the globe is visible.  Above the planet, the symbol of the workers and peasants is the image of the sickle and hammer.  Through symbolism, the embossed inscription of the name of the socialist state - in the form of a concave embossment there was an abbreviation: "USSR".  Below it, another inscription shows the face value of the coin: "One ruble." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anniversary 1 ruble. Reverse" class="if uuid-3098721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098721.jpg"></div><p>  A format inscription curled around the back side, indicating what the procedure for issuing a jubilee coin with a face value of 1 ruble is confined to: ‚ÄúOne Hundred Years Since the Birth of V. I. Lenrin‚Äù.  The bottom of the reverse in the center contains the obligatory five-pointed star of a depressed format. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Passion of numismatists to rubles from the USSR </h2><p>  The state is no longer more than twenty-five years old, but the facts, objects, images that are associated with it, for collectors in price.  Banknotes of different denominations are no exception.  The attention of collectors is concentrated on coins of the Soviet era. </p><p>  The farther the year of the release of iron banknotes from the time of the Soviets from our days, the more the appetite of collectors grows.  Of particular interest to numismatists are jubilee metal money.  Those of them that were issued on the great anniversary or round dates of events officially marked by world historians. </p><h2>  The mysteries of the jubilee coin today: the Lenin ruble and two prices </h2><p>  The ruble with Lenin, issued by the centenary of its birth, is becoming the most popular instance of the USSR banknote.  The price segment of the jubilee ruble is dramatically different on the Internet.  At some auctions, the cost of this coin of the USSR is tens of thousands of rubles.  At the same time, they claim on the resource that such a sample with the image of Lenin is a ‚Äúfive to five minutes‚Äù relict, and they publish both photo and video evidence of information. </p><p>  Another portal sells rubles with Lenin for nothing.  What is the reason?  How much is the Soviet ruble with Lenin, and where is the truth about the value of the coin.  She, as always, is somewhere in between.  Indeed, one type of ruble with Lenin at a cost today reaches several tens of thousands of Russian rubles - an indisputable fact for professionals.  Another type of Lenin ruble coin is also real, its price is low - it is also an axiom in the circles of serious collectors. </p><h2>  The whole truth about the price of the ruble from the position of professionals </h2><p>  Visually, money contains symbols according to the regulations, weight, diameter correspond to the standard.  Why then is there such a difference in price for the same coin today?  After all, there are no distinctive features: the jubilee coin of that time with Lenin is sold at one auction for a song and the second resource publishes the same face value, but with a price of tens of thousands of difference. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With the naked eye and with poorly published pictures of coins, there is no way to solve this riddle.  But turning to the professionals, we get two coins of the same name, dedicated to the anniversary issue, face value of one, but with a completely different appearance. </p><p>  This is the key to the dual value of the coin.  The first category is known as ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù, the coin is dull, and over time it undergoes darkening and staining, both on the front and back. </p><p>  The second category has obverse and reverse of a shiny glossy shade.  Gloss does not fade over time.  This category in professional circles is called Proof.  But the main differences are in the circulation of the issue. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Md_-I6vnt5Q" data-url="https://youtu.be/Md_-I6vnt5Q" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/8/1/9/14819.jpg"></div><p>  The riddle is solved.  We summarize the above in a short list of categories of coinage: </p><ul><li>  Matte coinage is a daily series.  1 ruble coin, anniversary, year of minting 1970. On the obverse is the head of the leader of the world proletariat.  Reverse - commemorative congratulatory inscription and coat of arms.  By the centenary of the birth of Lenin, a sample of this coin of the USSR was produced in the whole country in multimillion circulations.  The indicated amount led to a decrease in the value of the banknote.  The ruble output quality is reduced to the budget option to avoid high production costs.  A distinctive feature of the category is a matte appearance, an alloy of the worst grades, due to which the sides become dull during operation.  The main thing in the circulation of the issue is its volume, which influenced the current cheap price of a sample of the first category at numismatics auctions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.featurepics.com" data-author=": featurePics, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Obverse and reverse of the ruble with the image of Lenin" class="if uuid-3098724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098724.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Glossy coinage of the Proof series.  The issue of a coin for a memorable date is distinguished by an increased quality of the banknote.  Its main feature is that this version of the ruble is only one hundred and eleven thousand copies.  The category was not given to the general public.  Availability at that time was exclusively through gift or collection editions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruble coin with Lenin - Proof series" class="if uuid-3098722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098722.jpg"></div><p>  The highest grade alloy for the production of 1 ruble 1870-1970, providing luster and gloss throughout its "life", a limited circulation - the main criteria for the high cost of the banknote today. </p><h2>  Paper rubles of the USSR: fantasies of artists </h2><p>  The equivalents of metallic money were banknotes on paper.  In this matter, the country of the Soviets was also not inferior in art and artistic beauty.  Both minimal denominations of paper money and notes of the highest value had captivating plots, bright colors, but with the obligatory standard: an image of Lenin in various angles.  The full face of the leader of the world revolution was used on the first copies of Soviet paper rubles, on a U-turn and was detailed in detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three Hearts" class="if uuid-3098730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098730.jpg"></div><p>  Such a design of paper money was used in the formation of the Soviet state, when the imperial stamping or model of execution of disciplines was still not everywhere abandoned.  Denznaks were distinguished by a wide and long form, with a detailed portrait of Lenin full face. </p><p>  But the exploitation of the chervonets showed the inappropriateness of this format, so the mint artists were given the task of replacing it.  Such paper rubles with Lenin from the era of the formation of the USSR are of true value to world collectors due to their fine design and rarity. </p><h2>  <span>Soviet paper banknotes:</span> circulation practice </h2><p>  Paper money for everyday use dictated conditions for the convenience of using it.  It turned out that large design banknotes are very impractical, wasteful at issue and inconvenient in everyday life.  Therefore, special regulations were adopted, standards for paper banknotes for different denominations were established. </p><p>  For each size of the banknote, a color spectrum was selected, the size, not so intricate, but, nevertheless, the artistic design.  Money stamping measures were introduced for practical, cost-effective and easy-to-use banknotes for circulation by a multimillion-dollar population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icollector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper banknotes of the USSR with Lenin of various denominations and denominations later than the printing period" class="if uuid-3098725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098725.jpg"></div><p>  The only thing that remained unchanged was the image of Lenin on banknotes.  And although the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù full-face of the communist leader has now been replaced by an adult profile, nevertheless, he did not leave a single banknote in the country of the Soviets until its last days. </p><p>  For collectors at auctions, Soviet paper money represents a different value depending on several criteria: the appearance of the banknote, face value, year of issue, and others.  But just like the metal counterpart, they are in demand among numismatists around the world.  Collectors love especially large bills of the USSR in good and excellent condition: from fifty rubles.  The price is not bad at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Large banknote of the USSR (50 rubles) 1961" class="if uuid-3098729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3098729.jpg"></div><h2>  Ruble and Lenin: conclusion </h2><p>  In the annals of the history of our state, even the Russian Empire, even the Soviet Union, in popular circulation, for the name of money, a short name was used - "ruble". </p><p>  In the USSR, all banknotes were associated with Lenin V.I. The ruble and Lenin, both a coin and a paper copy, went a long, thorny path.  Nevertheless, he completed the journey along with the collapse of the Soviet state itself, turning out to be a symbol of the monetary unit of an entire era. </p>
