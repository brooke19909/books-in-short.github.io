    <h2>  The secrets of creating lace paintings </h2><p>  Traditionally, cotton or <span>linen yarn is</span> chosen for summer products <span>.</span>  This is due to the fact that natural materials perfectly pass air, absorb moisture and do not cause allergic reactions.

    <p>  Artificial fibers, such as acrylic and polyamide, can lead to deformation of the product, and microfiber and lurex often give the fabric rigidity.  This is especially important when it comes to children's products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why knit a pattern </h2><p>  Sometimes cotton material may be poorly dyed.  To determine in advance whether the yarn is shedding, you need to wet the thread and wipe it with a light cloth.  If it still turns out that the color is unstable, no need to get upset.  In this case, you will have to knit a product only from this yarn, refusing to combine it with other shades.  You can also try using chemical methods to fix the color (special washing powders). </p><p>  Openwork can be very moody, which often leads to errors in the calculations that relate to the size of the products.  Loose patterns can be much wider when steaming with an iron or, conversely, sit down under the influence of high temperature. </p><p>  It is necessary to tie the sample, wash and stroke it, so that an openwork blouse with knitting needles is conceived.  Schemes and descriptions that are attached to the pattern should be followed carefully.  Care must also be taken in knitting density.  One of the most common mistakes is that the sample is knitted tighter or weaker than the rest of the product, which leads to deviations in size (openwork summer blouse, knitting with needles, it turns out either more or less than planned). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork blouses for women with knitting needles" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1390152.jpg" width="424"></div>

    <p>  The use of this system is useful if you need an openwork blouse knitted with needles for a teenage girl or adult woman. </p><p>  The model consists of two main elements: </p><ol><li>  Thick bodice. </li><li>  Openwork bottom. </li></ol><p>  To make the bodice you will need circular knitting needles, as the raglan technique is used here.  In general, the rest of the fabric can also be knitted round-robin or two parts can be made and then stitched together. </p><h2>  How to tie a bodice </h2><p>  To create a classic raglan, you should dial on the circular knitting needles the number of loops corresponding to the circumference of the neck.  You should carefully consider the calculations so as not to get too deep a neckline. </p><p>  The stiffer the yarn, the weaker the <span>knitted blouse</span> should be <span>knitted with knitting needles.</span>  <span>Schemes and descriptions of the</span> pattern are not needed, since the bodice is knitted with a garter stitch.  After a set of loops perform the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  Divide their number into four parts and mark 4 loops serving as boundaries. </li><li>  The front row is knitted only with facial loops.  Before and after the marked loop, double crochets are performed. </li><li>  In the back row, which also includes only facial loops, all the crochets are crocheted. </li><li>  Repeat the second and third paragraphs until the canvas reaches 8-10 cm. </li></ol><p>  When knitting the last row, you should dial loops for knitting the fabric under the armpits.  This is done in the same way as the very first row is typed.  When the bodice is the right size, begin to perform basic parts. </p><h2>  How to knit openwork <span>blouses for women with</span> knitting needles: making the front and back </h2><p>  After the bodice is finished, you need to calculate the loops for working with the pattern.  It is important to consider rapports.  If the total number of loops is a multiple of 12, then all rapports are placed. </p><p>  In the case when the loops are not enough, you need to knit another row of garter stitch and evenly add the missing amount. </p><p>  Then they work according to scheme A.1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork blouse with knitting needles for a girl" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1390149.jpg" width="330"></div>

    <h2>  Web expansion </h2><p>  Next, an openwork rim is performed, which serves as a transition from one scheme to another.  The pattern shown in the figure under the marking A.2 should be used. </p><p>  Then proceed to scheme A.3.  In the process of further knitting, the fabric will be expanded.  This effect can be achieved by adding two loops in each rapport.  In the figure, this is indicated by introducing an additional icon - a black oval. </p><p>  A close examination reveals that the rapport initially consisted of eight loops, and after additions - ten.  In order not to spoil the ornament with unnecessary holes, new elements were added not with the help of yarn, but by another method.  They are tied from broaches between two adjacent loops. </p><p>  When the openwork is completed, you can do the bar.  In the presence of a neat harness, any openwork blouse with knitting needles looks good.  Schemes and descriptions are not needed here, since the bar is knitted in the same way as the bodice: with a shawl pattern (one front). </p><p>  When closing the hinges, you need to ensure that the row is not tightened, otherwise the product will be difficult to put on and wear. </p><p>  In the photo there is no strapping around the neck or armholes, but experience suggests that such a canvas stretches quite quickly.  To avoid this, we can recommend the implementation of several rows of single crochet columns.  If the craftswoman wants to decorate these sections of the blouse, then after the first row of columns with a single crochet, she can perform any dressing she likes. </p><p>  If the blouse is too wide, a lace can be passed through the holes formed by the intermediate pattern (A.2). </p>
