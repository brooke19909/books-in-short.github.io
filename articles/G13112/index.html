  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign policy of the USSR in the 30-40s</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The international situation in which the development of the USSR took place in the pre-war period was quite complicated.  There were hotbeds of tension in the Far East and in Europe.  The capitalist powers of the world secretly prepared for war.  In Germany, power passed to the fascist party.  All these phenomena indicated that the situation in the world was very intensively approaching armed conflict. </p><p>  <span>The foreign policy of the</span> USSR in the prewar years was determined by a number of circumstances. </p><p>  First of all, it should be noted that the alignment of forces in the international arena qualitatively changed in the 30s and 40s.  Mainly, these changes are associated with the emergence of the first state with a social system of government, the aggravation of contradictions between colonies and metropolises.  Equally important was the fairly intensive development of the German economy, a state dissatisfied with its international position. </p><p>  Changes have affected the nature of the impending armed conflict.  The dispute between the imperialist states over the redivision of the world was to turn into a confrontation of powers among themselves, as well as the opposition of the entire bloc with a country with another socio-economic system - the Soviet Union. </p><p>  The foreign policy of the USSR, in spite of everything, continued in a peaceful manner.  The state openly opposed the occupation of Czechoslovakia.  The Soviet Union even offered military assistance to this country.  But Czechoslovakia refused. </p><p>  The foreign policy of the USSR until the 39th year is considered an example of the desire to prevent war, stop the aggressor.  <span>The Soviet Union</span> at that time was the most implacable opponent of fascism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But by the summer of 1939 the position had changed.  In September of the same year, agreements and secret protocols were signed, according to which the Soviet Union and Germany became practically partners. </p><p>  This turn is associated with several circumstances.  It should be noted that the situation in the world by the 39th year did not allow the Soviet Union to fight alone.  The country needed to ensure its security.  In this situation, the foreign policy of the USSR could go in three ways.  The state could continue to be alone, conclude a military agreement with France and England, or sign an agreement with Germany. </p><p>  Thus, by the summer of 1939, negotiations began between England, France and the Soviet Union on the signing of a pact on mutual assistance and the formation of an anti-German coalition. </p><p>  The foreign policy of the USSR before the start of the military confrontation was controversial.  This was connected not only with the peculiarities of the international situation of that time, but also with the peculiarity of the bureaucratic system in the party-state leadership of the Soviet Union itself. </p><p>  The post-war period, the state experienced quite hard.  In the 50s and 60s, new political and economic foundations began to be laid in the country.  The foreign policy of the USSR in the postwar years began to change course.  Along with this, fundamental changes were taking place in society itself. </p><p>  After the war with Germany, the USSR was recognized as a great country.  Different powers of the world sought to establish diplomatic relations with the state. </p><p>  The most important area in the international politics of the Soviet Union was ensuring border security, as well as the struggle against the new development of fascism. </p><p>  Relations between the USSR and the USA became narrow.  Thanks to the efforts of American and Soviet diplomats, it was possible to form the World Bank, the UN and other structures that are fundamental in creating an economic and political order.  In addition, the USSR from that moment took a seat (along with China, France, England and America) in the UN Security Council. </p>
