  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xiaomi TVs: reviews, review, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  TVs from the Chinese company Xiaomi, unlike mobile phones, have appeared on the domestic market quite recently and are represented by only a few series.  Despite the modest number of devices presented, the models are rapidly gaining popularity. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on Xiaomi TVs, users choose the brand‚Äôs technique largely due to the excellent price-quality ratio.  One of the most noteworthy features of Xiaomi models is a natural picture along with a clear and rich range.  Moreover, this rule applies to the public sector, not to mention the premium. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of Xiaomi TVs, which includes the most sensible models, distinguished by their quality component and a large number of forest reviews from consumers.  All the models described below can be found both in offline and online realities, so there should be no problems with a thorough inspection. </p><h2>  Mi TV 4A 32 </h2><p>  <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> TV 4A is a relatively inexpensive device from the budget sector.  The model was distinguished by good color rendering, a decent margin of brightness, as well as an attractive appearance, where the exterior is neatly emphasized by thin frames. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onlygizmos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv xiaomi 32" class="if uuid-2506318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506318.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews on Xiaomi TVs of this series, the 32-inch device looks great both in the kitchen and in a small living room.  It should also be noted that the device has a very modest weight of 4 kg, so users do not experience any problems with mounting on a wall or ceiling.  In addition, breaking into expensive brackets with such a mass is not necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Xiaomi TV control, as well as the interface, can be called intuitive, and a user of any level will figure it out.  The device‚Äôs functionality allows you to play audio and video content of almost any format.  In addition to all this, we have a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Xiaomi TV, fully supporting smart TVs on the Android platform and having child protection, as well as a sleep timer. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 15,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Mi TV 4A 43 </h2><p>  Xiaomi Mi TV, unlike the previous model, has a diagonal of 43 inches and a matrix with full Full HD-scan.  Judging by independent sales statistics, the device enjoys enviable popularity among Russian consumers.  In addition, reviews of Xiaomi TVs in this series are mostly positive, and ratings are kept within 4.5 points out of five. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.besttechguru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv xiaomi 43" class="if uuid-2506319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506319.jpg"></div><p>  This model greatly spoiled sales to venerable brands such as Sony and Samsung.  For the money that Xiaomi is asking for its TV, you can buy the simplest 32-inch option from the above companies. </p><p>  Judging by the description, Xiaomi TVs fully support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless protocols, as well as smart TV functionality on the Android platform.  The advantages include excellent model sound, an abundance of interfaces for connecting peripherals and a convenient, and most importantly, sensitive control panel that works even from the next room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The estimated price of the TV is about 27,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Mi TV 4A 50 </h2><p>  One of the most noteworthy new products this year.  The model was distinguished not only by exceptional image quality with support for 4K resolution, but also by excellent sound accompaniment with surround sound power of 16 watts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegadgetwire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi tv 50" class="if uuid-2506317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506317.jpg"></div><p>  The device also boasts sensible backlighting, organized by Direct LED technology.  Users in their reviews of Xiaomi TVs in this series positively speak about the quality of the picture.  In addition, watching your favorite shows and movies does not tire your eyes even at a brightness set above average. </p><p>  The pros can also record an abundance of wireless protocols.  Here, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and DLNA, and even Miracast, which allows you to display the image on the big screen from any mobile gadget, be it a smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 36,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Mi TV 4C 55 </h2><p>  Here we have a high-quality screen with a matrix that fully supports 4K resolution.  The availability of technologies for working with HDR and advanced HDR10 will please fans of dynamic films and those who do not disdain to use TVs as a monitor for a personal computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi tv 55" class="if uuid-2506314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506314.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of chic surround sound with a power of 16 watts, which adds realism to the picture and contributes to a complete immersion in the atmosphere of what is happening on the screen.  Among other obvious advantages, users in their reviews note the attractive appearance of the model, where the finest frames around the display add a modern style. </p><p>  As a nice bonus, you can indicate the presence of a full-fledged smart TV on the Android platform, which gives almost unlimited possibilities in terms of games and applications, as well as the price that is quite adequate for the available characteristics.  Of the minuses, users note only the control panel.  It doesn‚Äôt respond as well as we would like, and the toolkit on it is located somehow randomly. </p><p>  The estimated price of the TV is about 40,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Mi TV 4 55 </h2><p>  In its appearance, the model cannot be distinguished from the previous respondent, but its ‚Äúfilling‚Äù is more advanced.  The device boasts an enviable functionality and an abundance of versatile tools that fully reveals almost all the advantages of digital technology.  Perhaps this is the best that the brand can offer today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestatesman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv xiaomi tv 4 55" class="if uuid-2506316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506316.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù has put all its best practices into the model and implemented them fully, and not for show.  Of course, some of the "tricks" are brazenly co-branded by venerable brands and neatly disguised, but a good half of buyers don‚Äôt give a damn about it - if only everything worked as it should and pleased the eye. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The model received not only an explanatory matrix that fully supports 4K scanning, but also a very good supply of brightness and contrast for 6000 units.  As for the functionality, here we have the usual classic set, and several useful additions. </p><p>  DivX support allows you to play content in an ultra-economical format, which will come in handy if you store movies in 4K resolution on a flash drive.  In addition, the TV has its own built-in memory of 8 GB, which in some cases completely eliminates external media. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.unp.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best xiaomi tv" class="if uuid-2506320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506320.jpg"></div><p>  This also includes the presence of 24p True Cinema technology for working with film films, voice control, as well as an abundance of various interfaces for connecting almost any peripheral.  Even the outdated VGA output here is implemented as it should and does not spill snow, as it happens in other models. </p><h2>  Consumer opinion </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, this model will be an excellent acquisition for the most fastidious users who do not accept compromises.  The device from Xiaomi has analogs.  The same Sony and Samsung companies boast about the same achievements. </p><p>  Only here the cost of models from these brands is almost twice as high.  At the same time, ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù pleases with a more than affordable pricing policy, which is by no means the last argument for the domestic consumer at the time of purchase. </p>
