  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted female cardigan: schemes, working principle, tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitted clothes not only warms in the cold, but also allows you to create interesting and stylish bows.  It's a shame only that not everyone can afford a really beautiful, original and high-quality model.  Although you should not be upset!  Almost any option presented in the store can be done independently. </p><p>  For example, in the article we will talk about the principle of making a knitted female cardigan.  Patterns, knitting needles, yarn and many other important points will be highlighted in detail.  Thanks to this, even novice craftswomen will be able to please themselves with a thing. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  To associate a conceived wardrobe item, you must first determine the style.  Cardigans are traditionally an elongated jacket with a v-neck.  However, now there are various variations and it is important for you to choose your own. </p><p>  After this, you should decide in what way you want to highlight a knitted female cardigan.  Pattern patterns are currently not only diverse, but also available to every needlewoman who has a computer.  But it is important to rely on your knowledge and skills.  Perhaps it is better to purchase unusual yarn, and to knit by the most ordinary facial stitch? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardigan Pattern" class="if uuid-3061729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3061729.jpg"></div><p>  Going to purchase knitting threads, be guided by the season of socks ideas.  It is clear that wool is more suitable for a warm winter cardigan.  But in the spring you can safely flaunt in an openwork thing made of acrylic, cotton or mohair yarn.  But it‚Äôs important to clarify: if you focus on the pattern, that is, you choose a complex pattern for a knitted women's cardigan, it is not recommended to consider colorful yarn.  Plain, both pastel and acid, is more suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting needles should use annular metal.  But another convenient option is also acceptable.  The main thing is that the diameter of the spokes should be equal to the thickness of the thread or slightly exceed it. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted Cardigan Pattern" class="if uuid-3061699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3061699.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced craftswomen do not recommend accurately repeating the patterns of a knitted female cardigan presented in various master classes.  Photos of satisfied needlewomen usually show a product that is precisely tailored to the figure.  To make a similar model, you have to arm yourself with a centimeter tape.  And if you knit according to standard parameters, you can get a product of a larger or smaller size than required. </p><p>  This advice is best not to neglect.  In addition, even novice masters can cope with the task.  After all, you only need to set the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  length of the product; </li><li>  armhole level; </li><li>  lowest point of the gate; </li><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  neck width; </li><li>  sleeve length. </li></ul><h2>  Implementation of ideas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pinosy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to knit a cardigan" class="if uuid-3061777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3061777.jpg"></div><p>  Many professionals recommend knitting a female cardigan with the needles according to the scheme (full-size) drawn on graph paper.  But you can also connect a sample of the pattern and calculate the number of loops and rows of 1 cm. Next, simply translate the measurements taken into the desired units.  And start knitting: </p><ol><li>  Loop (chest girth). </li><li>  Tie up to the bottom of the goal. </li><li>  Continue by evenly reducing the loops.  But remembering that the total number of decreases is equal to the width of the neck. </li><li>  Having reached the armhole, divide the canvas into three parts - shelves and back. </li><li>  Finish each separately. </li><li>  Stitch the shoulders. </li><li>  On the armhole, dial the loops and tie the sleeves with a wedge or evenly. </li></ol><p>  This is the principle of making a knitted female cardigan with knitting needles.  With the scheme presented in the article, it will be much more convenient for you to implement the idea.  In this case, the pattern, yarn, design can be changed at your own discretion.  And each time to create a unique product. </p>
