Therefore, it is important for them to know how to get from one city to another most quickly and on a budget. </p><p>  In this article, we will look at different ways to get from Venice to Verona.  After all, the "pearl of the Adriatic" is a rather damp city, and in the high season there will not be crowded from crowds of tourists. </p><p>  Verona, the place praised by Shakespeare, where the prototypes of Romeo and Juliet lived, is also very interesting.  And the prices here are much lower. </p><p>  We will tell you how to get from Venice to Verona on your own.  You will also find out where you can get excursions for organized travelers. </p><h2>  Taxi and car </h2><p>  If you want to get from Venice to Verona ‚Äúwith the breeze‚Äù, book a private shuttle.  You can also use official taxis.  Usually this type of transfer is ordered online - it is safer, and the price is fixed. </p><p>  The cost of such a trip will cost an average of 250 euros (18 105 rubles) in both directions.  Traveling from Venice to Verona by car is approximately two and a half hours.  The distance of 120 kilometers is not too big, but during this time you will get to the highway from one city, and then move off from it in another village and get into its central part. </p><p>  Approximately the same amount will be required for those who travel in their own or rented car.  But if you do not regret 8 euros (580 rubles) and go on toll roads, you will be in Verona in an hour and a half.  The main road the cars follow is A 4. To get closer to the center, you need to find the Verona Sud exit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": Franz Marc Frei, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Venice to Verona by car" class="if uuid-2664944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2664944.jpg"></div><h2>  A train </h2><p>  This is the most convenient way to overcome the distance Venice - Verona. "  How to get by train from one city to another?  First of all, you need to purchase a ticket.  Often its price "bites", but the Italian trains are clean, convenient and comfortable.  They have a speed of more than 200 kilometers per hour. </p><p>  Express trains in Venice leave from Santa Lucia station, and arrive in Verona at Porta Nuova station.  The first train leaves at eight in the morning, and the last at 20:00. </p><p>  The cost of the express is approximately 19 euros (1377 rubles) for the second class.  But tickets for them need to be bought in advance.  However, many tourists prefer the train "Treno Regional."  They go slower, but tickets can be bought on the spot, and the price is much cheaper - 7 euros (507 rubles). </p><p>  Italian electric trains are not inferior to the "expresses" either in terms of comfort or convenience.  By high-speed trains you will get from Venice to Verona in an hour with a small, and regional - in two. </p><div class="photo" data-original="selectitaly.com" data-author=": Peter Broster, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Venice Verona: how to get there by train" class="if uuid-2664952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2664952.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get from Venice to Verona by bus </h2><p>  This type of transport is preferred by budget tourists.  Although, frankly, trains in Italy are cheaper.  Therefore, economical Italians prefer to travel by regional trains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Buses are mainly used by tourists and residents of distant villages.  How to get from Venice to Verona with this type of intercity public transport?  Buses belong to different carrier companies, and their route depends on it. </p><p>  Some of them travel through various small villages and narrow paths, and instead of 120 kilometers they wind up as many as 250. Tickets can be purchased from companies whose offices are located at bus stations.  Their cost is about 20 euros (1448 rubles), and they reach Verona in three hours (on average). </p><p>  But lately there has appeared such an option as the Flixbass buses.  They go from Mestre station.  They make 5 flights a day, and the trip costs from 8 euros (580 rubles).  On the road, such buses spend a little more than 2 hours.  Tickets can usually be bought online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flixbus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Venice to Verona by bus" class="if uuid-2664961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2664961.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursion </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt really want to think about how to get from Venice to Verona and back, then this is the best way out.  In Piazzale Roma, travel companies gather groups and offer them such a trip. </p><p>  The tour lasts 7 hours.  Guides, as a rule, are Russian-speaking.  But the price, of course, bites.  From a group of 5-6 people they take 500 euros (36,233 rubles).  This price includes a trip to Verona and back, as well as a city tour. </p><p>  Entrance to the museums you will have to pay separately.  The trip can be quite tiring, but a vivid experience is guaranteed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.veronality.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Verona - how to get from Venice with a guided tour" class="if uuid-2664964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2664964.jpg"></div><h2>  From Venice Airport </h2><p>  If you come to the hub named after Marco Polo, and your final goal is Verona, then you should first get to the suburbs of Mestre.  Why?  If you ask experienced tourists how to get from Venice Airport to Verona, you will hear that there are a lot of trains from Mestre station to Porta Nuova station. </p><p>  It is better not to go there by taxi; it will be too expensive.  FlyBas express buses run from Marco Polo Airport to Mestre.  From their parking lot to the train station is just a few meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rightraillines.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Venice to Verona by train" class="if uuid-2664958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2664958.jpg"></div><p>  All trains going to Verona stop in Mestre.  There you can choose whether to board an electric train or a speed train. </p><h2>  How to get from Venice to Verona: reviews and tips </h2><p>  The best way to get from one city to another, according to tourists, is the railway.  Travelers who used the train assure that it is convenient to travel by electric trains, but it is better to take tickets at vending machines, rather than at the ticket office - there can be huge lines. </p><p>  You should also remember to compost travel documents in special yellow validators, otherwise they can be fined.  The trains ride silently.  But it often happens that the trains are late, and the whole schedule may be violated.  In addition, ads on platforms - exclusively in Italian.  There is no translation into English. </p><p>  People traveling in their own cars, claimed that gasoline in Italy is expensive, there are strict speed limits (even on toll roads you can drive a maximum of 130 kilometers per hour).  However, you still won‚Äôt get to the historic center of Verona by car, and there are very few free parking lots nearby.  Have to leave the car in the underground parking lot. </p><p>  But, having a car, you can stop on the road anywhere, for example, in Padua or on Lake Garda. </p>
