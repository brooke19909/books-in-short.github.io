    <h2>  Kazbek </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous sights of North Ossetia.  The height of Mount Kazbek is 5033 meters.  It is located on the border with the Russian Federation and Georgia.  The beauty of Kazbek attracts many tourists and novice climbers. </p><p>  One Georgian legend tells that once Prometheus (Pharmat), who was a giant (sledge), was chained to the mountain.  Once he stole fire for people.  For this, the gods were very angry with him and chained to the mountain with iron chains.  But the punishment did not end there.  Every day a bird called Hoopoe flew to him and pecked his heart.  Here is such a beautiful and tragic legend. </p><p>  Kazbek is an extinct volcano, which, according to scientists, last erupted about 4000 BC.  e. </p>

    <p>  The English climber Freshfeld first conquered the mountain in 1868. And after 21 years, the Russians erected a flag on that very spot, which is perfectly visible from the side of Vladikavkaz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What do experienced climbers say? </h2><p>  When climbing Kazbek, special difficulties will not arise.  There are two routes, and both of them are beautiful and attractive in their own way.  The first is laid across the north, the second through the south (Georgia).  According to experienced climbers, Kazbek is an excellent option for beginner climbers of mountain peaks.  <span>Positive qualities</span> for beginners are more stable weather conditions and faster acclimatization. </p><p>  But do not think that this mountain is so harmless.  It is known that many years of sleep did not prevent the tragedy from happening in the <span>Karmadon Gorge</span> (this terrible incident claimed the lives of 130 people, including the film crew, which included the famous Russian actor Sergei Bodrov).  As scientists found out, the tragedy was due to the fault of the Kolka glacier that had left its place. </p><p>  However, many people come here not only to conquer the peak of Kazbek, but also to enjoy the natural beauties that are hiding on the territory of this mysterious mountain. </p><h2>  What can you see on Kazbek? </h2><p>  At an altitude of 4 km is an ancient monastery called Betlemi.  This cave was opened in 1947 by climber Levan Sudzhashvili. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that archaeologists who later studied Bethlemi discovered a priceless church banner of the 10-11th centuries, a high cross, coins of the 15-17th <span>centuries, a bronze</span> candlestick, as well as monastic cells, a stone pillar and graves without names and inscriptions.  Later, archaeologists and researchers concluded that the monks who previously lived here hid jewelry and valuables. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should also be remembered that it is better for people suffering from high blood pressure not to climb to the very top, otherwise unpleasant sensations and dizziness may occur. </p><p>  The sights of North Ossetia do not end there, then there will be many more interesting things. </p><h2>  North Ossetian State Reserve </h2><p>  The reserve is located on the northern slope of the eastern part of the Central Caucasus.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese beauties is 30 ha.  The North Ossetian Reserve was created in 1967 on the territory of the Tseisky Republican Reserve in order to preserve certain species of animals and plants. </p>

    <h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  North Ossetia - Alania is famous for its diversity of flora and fauna.  So, about 1,500 tours live on the territory of the North Ossetian Reserve.  In the forests (and they occupy about a third of the entire territory) roe deer and wild boars live, the number of which is only 60 individuals.  Bison also live in the reserve, mainly in deciduous forests.  They were resettled in the 60s.  Now there are more than 200 individuals. </p><p>  The main representatives of the fauna of the reserve are bears.  There are about 35 of them. The jackal is also found in this area (in the Unal basin), but rather rarely.  On the territory of the reserve you can see a forest cat, a marten, a raccoon dog, an American mink, a hare and a squirrel. </p><p>  Among the birds, it is worth noting the black stork, songbird, blackbird, wren, ruddler, buzzard, vyakhir, eagle owl, crow, jay, gray owl, large lentils (lives in the mountains), as well as several species of tits and woodpeckers. </p><p>  What else is rich in North Ossetia?  The territory of this region, in particular, the North Ossetian Reserve, contains about 200 species of insects.  Among them, one can single out a steppe hawk, <span>Caucasian ground beetle,</span> odorous beauty, Ascalaf mottled, which are listed in the Red Book.  Here you can also observe tarantula, praying mantis, phalanx and other species of invertebrates. </p><h2>  What to see in the reserve? </h2><p>  The sights of North Ossetia, in particular, the North Ossetian reserve, are numerous.  Among them, one can distinguish the second largest karst cave in the region called Shubi-Nykhasskaya.  The walls of the cave are covered with stalagmites and stalactites (they grow very slowly - for thousands of years).  And the <span>bats</span> listed in the Red Book live there <span>.</span> </p><p>  It will be quite interesting to look at the cave towns, the Mesolithic site of the Shau-Lagat, various historical and archaeological sites, catacomb cemeteries, etc. </p><p>  Traveling along the routes of the reserve, you can see the 12th-century church, Tseysky and Skazsky glaciers, observe the life of animals and birds, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of North Ossetia: City of the Dead </h2><p>  This place consists of 99 crypts located on 4 floors.  The buildings here are partially dug into the ground, and there are also ground buildings with a gable or pyramidal roof. </p><p>  According to some historical sources, this village was created during the outbreak of the plague.  In those days, the family, which was struck by a terrible disease, closed in one of the crypts and quietly waited for their fate. </p><p>  Few people know that in those days, the Ossetians considered the crypt to be quite an expensive pleasure, so only a few could afford to die in this type of room. </p><p>  In this city, to this day, there is a terrible legend that disturbed the peace of deceased ancestors can pay with their lives.  However, despite this, many tourists still come to a terrible place to see the crypts, still smelling of the death and pain of dead Ossetians. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that, of course, not all are solved, and only in the daytime.  Indeed, earlier this was a completely justifiable rumor, because it is not known how many more harmful bacteria could survive in the walls of the crypts.  But today all the premises are thoroughly studied and investigated.  Therefore, at the moment, we can say with confidence that the crypts are absolutely harmless to visit. </p><p>  This attraction of North Ossetia to this day excites the consciousness of tourists who have been there, because it is quite difficult to convey the emotions that you feel when you look at the crypts, where once innocent people died painfully. </p><p>  It should also be noted that on the territory of the City of the Dead there is the largest tower in Ossetia, named after the Mansurovs. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So many miracles and riddles, such a variety of flora and fauna can boast only North Ossetia-Alania.  Numerous attractions, architectural monuments, a huge number of caves, historically significant buildings and stunningly beautiful nature mesmerize every person who arrived in this region.  Having visited at least once in North Ossetia, you will want to come back here again and again, because such miracles are rarely seen anywhere. </p>
