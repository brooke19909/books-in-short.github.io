The king loved the theater, patronized artists and with pleasure participated in the performances himself.  Several hundred years have passed, and the capital of France is still the center of culture. </p><h2>  What is opera </h2><p>  The word "opera" came to us from the Italian language and literally translates as "labor, products, works."  The conditional definition appeared much later, at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  Nowadays, by the word "opera" we mean a type of musical work in which words, music and theatrical action are uniquely combined.  Music plays a paramount role here, unlike the theater, and the whole action is based on the libretto.  The libretto is built on the basis of a work of art. </p><h2>  Grand Opera History </h2><p>  One of the most popular and significant opera and ballet theaters in the world of art was and remains the Grand Opera.  However, this name is a bit dated.  Today, this temple of art is called the Opera Garnier, named after the architect Charles Garnier.  The building is located in the ninth district of Paris, in the city center, on the street of the same name Opera.  The Opera metro station is also located here. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.8719697" data-lng="2.331601399999954" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/0/6/18006.png"></div><p>  It‚Äôs impossible to simply pass by the magnificent opera in Paris.  It was built in the neo-baroque style in the distant 1875.  The story of the appearance is connected with the personality of Napoleon the Third, who was so superstitious that after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on him next to the Le Peletier Theater, he decided to erect a new, amazing in its beauty temple of Melpomene.  A nationwide competition for the best architectural sketch was announced.  Several hundred works were viewed.  Napoleon, being a fine connoisseur of theatrical art, chose the project of an unknown architect Charles Garnier.  Napoleon was struck by the luxury and scope that the architect proposed to give to his masterpiece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pariscityvision.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Opera Paris" class="if uuid-3242623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242623.jpg"></div><p>  In 1860, construction began.  The situation was hindered by the unpleasant fact that the land in the selected place was very swampy.  It took about eight months to drain and cleanse the earth.  Construction continued. </p><blockquote><p>  A river flows under the foundation.  Garnier turned this fact into a blessing.  The water of the river carries sand, closing small cracks, and in case of fire it is an excellent reservoir with water. </p></blockquote><p>  Construction continued for fifteen years, even despite the unstable political situation of that time.  The fall of the Paris Commune turned the temple of art under construction for some time into a prison.  The conspirators were executed there.  But by 1875 the construction was completed, and the townspeople saw the magnificent opera building - in Paris he had no equal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oddviser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opera Garnier" class="if uuid-3242557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242557.jpg"></div><h2>  Interior architecture </h2><p>  Since the end of the eighteenth century, the name of the theater has changed many times.  It was the ‚ÄúTheater of Arts‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Theater of the Republic and Arts‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Theater of Opera‚Äù and even the ‚ÄúImperial Academy of Music‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRoyal Academy of Music and Dance.‚Äù Photos of the Grand Opera in Paris do not convey even half of the splendor that the building has saturated An architect is not only outside, but also inside.  Finishing stones were brought from all over Europe and its colonies, including African ones.  From stones masons created magnificent statues that have survived to this day.  Famous sculptors of that time worked day and night to create the most magnificent statues of Greek gods, patrons of love, poetry, dance and music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The building occupies about ten thousand square meters.  They quietly fit the stage, capable of simultaneously accepting more than 400 artists.  For viewers, two and a half thousand seats are provided.  Almost all decorative elements are decorated with gold leaf.  According to surviving historical documents, it was known that it took about six tons of gold to pour it with generous hands on plafonds, statues of cupids, Greek goddesses in order to decorate mirrors and ceilings.  In the center of the hall hangs a magnificent crystal chandelier, which can be seen even from the outside of the opera house in Paris.  Now between the statues of the gods there are busts of great composers of all eras: Beethoven, Strauss, Bach, Mozart, Rossini, and the ceilings are decorated with restored frescoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodfon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall paintings in Opera" class="if uuid-3242552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242552.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Excursions to the <span>Garnier opera in Paris</span> are held daily for those who have not yet got a ticket for any performance, because getting them is not very easy.  Everything is reserved several months in advance.  And if you are in the capital of France passing through, then excursions will be enough to enjoy the splendor of opera in Paris.  Tours are held daily from ten in the morning until five in the evening.  The ticket price is from five to ten euros, excluding the cost of the guide.  His services are paid separately in the amount of 35 euros.  After a walk through the halls at the exit, you can buy several trinkets in memory of this magnificent palace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ballet school </h2><p>  The Opera and Ballet Theater in Paris is famous not only for its amazing architectural wonders, but also for its repertoire, one of the best in the whole world.  Since its foundation, not only opera compositions have been staged here, but also ballet ones.  The ballet troupe has been here from the very beginning, as well as the ballet school, which was the most significant throughout France.  Famous ballet dancers and choreographers not only from the French, but also foreigners performed on stage.  For several centuries, a unique repertoire has been formed at the Granier opera in Paris, which from year to year has been a stunning success.  For example, Giselle or La Sylphide.  A classical ballet school was formed at the theater, which spread throughout Europe.  She penetrated into Russia. </p><p>  Having survived the rapid formation and development, by the beginning of the nineteenth century, the ballet school began to fade away, there were less and less people wishing to watch performances.  The revival, bright and rapid, occurred with the advent of the Russian seasons in the twenties of the twentieth century.  Now the ballet school continues to release the best ballet dancers in the world, and the troupe not only performs on its own stage, but also tours around the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="danceviewtimes.typepad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ballet school" class="if uuid-3242618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242618.jpg"></div><h2>  Repertoire </h2><p>  The repertoire of the ballet troupe at the opera in Paris has a large number of productions.  It is difficult to name the best of them, because for each performance that a ballet troupe gives, tickets must be reserved in advance.  Here are just a few of the performances: </p><ul><li>  La Sylphide; </li><li>  "Coppelia"; </li><li>  Offenbach's ‚ÄúButterfly‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚ÄúGiselle‚Äù and ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù in the new edition of Alicia Alonso; </li><li>  "Swan Lake" under the direction of V.P. Burmeister; </li><li>  M. M. Fokin's ballets Parsley and Vision of a Rose. </li></ul><p>  This is only a small part of the performances, which from year to year pluck the stormy applause of the audience.  Opera lovers should definitely listen to such pearls of the Grand Opera in Paris as ‚ÄúSalome‚Äù, ‚ÄúNightingale‚Äù, ‚ÄúMoor‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegend of St.  Kristofe, ‚ÄúSeven Canzon‚Äù, ballets ‚ÄúBolero‚Äù and ‚ÄúWaltz‚Äù. </p><h2>  Opera Bastille </h2><p>  Another notable building in spoiled Paris is the Bastille Opera.  Among other reasons why this urban masterpiece appeared, one could name a lack of cultural space.  The Grand Opera eventually ceased to accommodate everyone who wanted to join art.  In addition, the theater was designed both then and now for an elite audience.  The Bastille Opera in Paris is a more democratic scene. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.parisinsidersguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="performance in the opera Bastille" class="if uuid-3242592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242592.jpg"></div><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a new theater was born in 1968 with three French composers: Pierre Boulet, Maurice Beige and Jean Vilar.  French President Francois Mitterrand, then in power, approved the idea, and a competition for the best architectural project was announced around the world.  An important condition for creating the sketch was to clothe the majesty of classical arts in a more modern and understandable form to the masses.  About a thousand applications were reviewed, and in the end, the architect of Uruguay, Carlo Ott, became the winner.  Construction began in 1964.  They started it with the demolition of the old Bastille railway station, which had not been used for a long time.  Finished construction in five years.  Timed it to the 200th anniversary of the Bastille.  The opening was attended by stars of the world opera scene. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pro.visitparisregion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Facade of the Bastille" class="if uuid-3242597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242597.jpg"></div><h2>  Internal and external device </h2><p>  The opera building was erected in five years.  It is able to accommodate 2723 spectators.  The building was built in the Art Nouveau style, it is crowned with a cubic structure for the stage.  The walls are finished with glass.  The highlight of this architectural concept was that the interior and the stage are not visible from the street, and theater visitors can see the panorama of the city from the inside. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the theater is built according to all the canons and is considered a world-class theater, experts note that the acoustics in this Melpomene temple are much lower than its older counterparts. </p><h2>  Problems and Solutions </h2><p>  The new opera in Paris was originally equipped with modern theater technology.  However, from the first years of work in the theater, frequent breakdowns occurred, either with mechanisms on the stage, then in the lobby or in the utility rooms.  The facade of the building wore out several times faster than the due date, so the state put forward a lawsuit against builders and contractors who were accused of using low-quality building materials.  France won lawsuits only by 2007.  But the reconstruction was delayed for a long time.  Now the theater is being updated in standard mode.  The opera does not close and gives performances according to the schedule. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opera Bastille" class="if uuid-3242595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242595.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  If you came to Paris specifically for the sake of aesthetic pleasure, for the sake of acquaintance with culture and art, it is better to choose accommodation located within walking distance from the city center.  The most popular hotels among tourists are Astra Opera Paris and Plaza Opera Paris.  The hotel staff is always happy to help their guests on any issue, including those related to visiting theaters and operas.  When checking into the hotel at the reception directly, in fact, and preferably in advance, you should express your wishes.  You can specify specifically what performances you would like to attend, which exhibitions and museums to visit.  The hotel staff will provide you with a complete list of shows that can be held during your stay in the city.  Do not forget to indicate the number of tickets. </p><h2>  What to bring with you </h2><p>  Culture is culture, and tourist cute little things for friends and relatives must be acquired without fail.  Moreover, at theaters and galleries there is always a corner where they sell all kinds of trinkets and souvenirs.  After the tour, in the Grand Opera, be sure to purchase postcards with the image of halls and pavilions, magnets and travel brochures with brief information about the life and functionality of the building from its first days.  Friends can bring flags and emblems with the emblem of France, mugs for memory or T-shirts with the image of the main attractions of Paris. </p>
