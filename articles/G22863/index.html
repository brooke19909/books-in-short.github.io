There are many ways to create such a craft for designing a traffic stand in a kindergarten, and for applications or children's games.  In the article, we will consider easy options for kindergarten kids and schemes for assembling different cars by folding origami paper.  Older readers will also learn how to draw the desired car on their own, so that in the future they can cut it out of paper along the contours and make a three-dimensional model for an exhibition or a game. </p><h2>  Work in a manual work lesson </h2><p>  Thick paper machines are capable of being made independently by children in the older group of kindergarten.  They already know how to draw well and use scissors.  Before you make a typewriter from paper, it is advisable to create a template from cardboard, on which one half of the car will be displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a typewriter" class="if uuid-2712460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2712460.jpg"></div><p>  Then the template is laid out on a sheet of paper folded in half, and is drawn in a simple pencil.  It remains only to carefully cut along the line with scissors and attach additionally prepared parts - wheels, headlights, windows. </p><h2>  Origami machine diagram </h2><p>  In older preschool or primary school age, children can be asked to fold a typewriter from a sheet of paper according to the scheme.  Initially, the teacher or parents should step by step explain to the child the implementation of each fold, making the machine simultaneously with the child.  Firstly, the baby visually sees both the scheme and the actions that an adult does.  Secondly, it learns to fold the sheet correctly, carefully smoothing all the folds, because the quality of the work done depends on this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="luntiks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper folding scheme" class="if uuid-2712388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2712388.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a paper machine with your own hands, let's carefully consider the figure above.  You need to prepare a square sheet of paper and make folds diagonally and in half along a horizontal line.  Then, turning the work on the back side, press with your fingers on both sides to get the shape under No. 1 in the figure.  Now, how to make a typewriter out of paper, see the diagram, acting in the order of increasing numbers.  The finished craft can be painted with markers or supplemented with applique elements. </p><h2>  Another origami option </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make an <span>origami paper typewriter</span> using the step-by-step instructions in the figure below.  To work, you need a square sheet of paper, which can be cut using a ruler and a simple pencil, or you can create a uniform square shape by bending the sheet in A-4 format.  To do this, just wrap one of the corners of the rectangle to the opposite side.  Just cut off the extra strip with scissors and after opening the paper you will see an even square. </p><p>  Then do everything according to the scheme below.  First, the sheet is bent in half along a horizontal line, then each half is folded in half again.  Figure 3 shows that on the rectangles the corners need to be bent up.  So that the machine does not have sharp corners, they are folded inward. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami pattern" class="if uuid-2712411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2712411.jpg"></div><p>  Then the work is folded in half.  Then they make the back of the machine, first bending the triangle, and then pushing it inward with a finger.  The front of the car is designed differently.  The hood of the car is almost flat, and the windshield has a slight slope.  It is made with scissors, cutting a couple of centimeters.  The figure shows how the cut should look.  The hood of the car lowers inward by pressing with a finger.  It remains only to supplement the finished machine with details, drawing them with a marker. </p><h2>  How to make a typewriter out of paper according to the scheme </h2><p>  There are schemes for assembling volumetric machines on sale, but you can make such drawings yourself.  As a sample, let's consider the principle of their manufacture in the figure below.  It is possible to make not a solid body, but consisting of separate elements, for example, first draw the upper and side parts with wheels, then make a rectangular bottom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.template.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing machine for cutting" class="if uuid-2712810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2712810.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs easier to learn how to make patterns for making models, starting with trucks.  All parts are even rectangles.  If you have purchased schemes, then you can diversify them, supplementing the picture with new details and changing colors.  In order to connect all the elements of the car, you need to leave small rectangular pieces of paper or trapezoidal pieces of paper on each part of the picture.  They are smeared with glue and attached to the adjacent side of the craft. </p><p>  The article shows several ways to make a paper machine.  Try to create a car figure with your own hands according to these schemes.  Good luck </p>
