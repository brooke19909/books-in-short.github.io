    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the many positive points, you should not turn a blind eye to the shortcomings that are inherent in the Side Royal Paradise 4 * hotel (Turkey, Side).  Reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  hotel workers practically do not speak Russian, as the institution is focused mainly on Germans; </li><li>  photos of numbers presented on the official website do not correspond to reality (in fact, they are much more modest); </li><li>  such an elementary request, such as replacing the batteries in the remote control, takes a very long time and is reluctant; </li><li>  maids constantly forget to replenish supplies of drinking water in the minibar; </li><li>  in restaurants "A La Carte" there is no musical accompaniment; </li><li>  if you go on an excursion, then you will not be packed with lunch box, but they will offer you to refresh yourself with the remnants of yesterday's dinner; </li><li>  the staff is extremely reluctant to work in the absence of a tip; </li><li>  despite the fact that Turkey is famous for its unique ice cream, in this hotel its taste and quality are not at the highest level; </li><li>  there are no irons not only in the rooms, but also on the floor or at the reception (that is, they cannot be used even for a fee); </li><li>  no animation in Russian; </li><li>  unprofessional work of a hotel photographer (it is good that his services are not very expensive). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The first thing you need to pay attention to when going to this hotel is that it is aimed at German tourists.  Therefore, it will not be easy for you to communicate with the staff if you do not even know a little English or German.  As for animation, there is absolutely nothing in Russian.  However, this is unlikely to spoil the rest. </p><p>  Once inside the hotel, in the building itself, and then in the room, you can admire the beautiful decor and elegant interior.  Nevertheless, there is some sense of deception.  The fact is that the photos presented on the site are nothing more than advertising computer graphics.  Naturally, after high expectations, there is some disappointment. </p><p>  What is impossible to complain about is nutrition.  A huge assortment of meat, seafood, desserts and many other products pleases the eye and stomach.  In addition, food can be taken out of the restaurant, which is not allowed in all hotels. </p>
