Here everyone can choose the settings to their taste, however, almost all profiles are invited to set a photo.  In the social media news feed, users are used to sharing parts of their lives and uploading a lot of photos.  One of the most popular ways to create a photo is selfies.  For those who are not familiar with this concept, we explain: selfies are photographing oneself. </p><h2>  Selfies </h2><p>  There are several types of such photos: in the mirror or using the front camera.  But very often it happens that, holding the phone, tablet, camera or other device in hand, it is not possible to capture the whole background on which you want to take a beautiful photo.  Or, say, a very large group of friends wants to take a picture, but not all fit into the frame. </p><p>  Then a selfie stick comes to the rescue.  Another name for the device is a monopod.  So, which selfie stick is suitable for which phones and what kind of miracle invention is it?  We will talk about this in the article. </p>

    <h2>  Varieties of fixtures </h2><p>  Before answering the question for which phones the selfie stick is suitable, you need to determine the type of device that you are going to purchase or that already exists.  And there are several varieties of monopod.  Briefly tell about the most popular of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple tripod </h2><p>  The first type of monopod to be discussed is a tripod.  In fact, this is an ordinary stick, made of more or less durable material with a device for attaching the phone to the end.  In general, these are all its advantages, if you do not take into account the fact that the cost of such a selfie stick will be quite cheap compared to electronic devices.  But for a budget option is very suitable. </p><p>  However, be prepared for the fact that whenever you want to take a picture, you will have to set a timer on the camera.  What is good - you can use such a tripod even if you do not have a modern gadget and you use a simple phone with a camera or a camera. </p>

    <p>  The gadget is fixed at the top and bottom, but it is worthwhile to warn that the device may fall out, so it is better to keep it horizontal and try not to rotate.  These are the limitations that this selfie stick implies.  What phones is this object suitable for?  For almost anyone, if only it could be fixed at the end of the tripod, and it is desirable that there is a timer on the camera. </p>

    <h2>  Stick with button </h2><p>  It is the same tripod, but the kit comes with a small remote with two buttons.  For which phones is a selfie stick with a button suitable?  In this case, there are nuances, because far from all devices this product fits.  To understand whether your device is compatible with this model, you need to clarify this circumstance directly at the place of purchase from competent people.  For example, from sales consultants, if a monopod is purchased at an electronics store or a mobile phone store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We strongly recommend not ordering a selfie stick on unfamiliar sites or without the possibility of a return, because the client risks that the monopod and gadget will be incompatible, respectively, the selfie stick will not work. </p><p>  But back to the remote.  Two buttons are standardly located on it - one for devices running Android, the other for iOS.  It is important not to confuse when photographing something at a crucial moment. </p><p>  The photographer‚Äôs hands will be constantly busy, because in addition to the tripod itself, you need to hold the remote control and press the button.  We offer you to make sure in advance that the gadget is equipped with a data transfer function via Bluetooth.  The connection between the monopod and the device is carried out precisely through it.  The price of the device is also low.  And once again we recall: it is important to find out which phones are suitable for a selfie stick of this type. </p><h2>  Stick with wire </h2><p>  The price of such a device is slightly higher than the previous two types.  At the same time, a monopod is much more practical and convenient to use.  A wire comes out of it, which must be inserted into the headphone jack.  For which phones is a selfie stick with a wire suitable?  For almost everyone who has a headphone jack, but it‚Äôs better to check with the seller.  What is the model of your device and you will be given the answer to this question.  You can also read on the packaging with which devices the monopod is compatible. </p><p>  There is no separate remote here, and the button is located directly on the tripod.  The device does not need charging and any additions.  Selfies can be taken with one hand.  Users have found another advantage of this monopod.  When it‚Äôs cold outside and your hands are wearing gloves, you don‚Äôt want to take them at all in order to take a photo.  Such a selfie stick will come to the rescue.  For which phones it is suitable, you can find out in the instructions or from consultants, but for the most part - for everyone. </p>

    <h2>  Monopod with button on a tripod without wires </h2><p>  The name speaks for itself.  The device does not have wires, it works via Bluetooth.  Basically, on such devices not three, but three mounts, so the gadget should not fall out.  Of the minuses, it can be noted that the monopod needs to be charged, but working with a single charge is quite lengthy.  Its price is also an order of magnitude higher than that of previous models.  We can say that this is the most popular selfie stick among users.  Which phones is it suitable for?  For almost all models of gadgets with Bluetooth support. </p>
