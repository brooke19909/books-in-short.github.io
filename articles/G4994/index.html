History, Description and Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sosnovaya Polyana is a municipal district of St. Petersburg that arose on the site of an old summer cottage village, as well as on the entire territory adjacent to it with picturesque forests.  After the end of World War II, various enterprises began to appear here, so it took a larger amount of housing, which needed to be provided for workers.  Thus, intensive construction unfolded in this area, thanks to which this area is now built up with high-rise buildings, entertainment centers and parks. </p><h2>  Description and further development </h2><p>  <span>Krasnoselsky district of</span> St. Petersburg is an ancient district of the city, where this district is located.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe massif is 40 hectares, and the planned refurbishment is 219,000 square meters.  About 52 thousand people live in this quarter. </p>

    <p>  Recently, a new development concept has been developed, which was done by Renovation.  Sosnovaya Polyana (municipal district) will receive a new comfortable urban environment, which will be fully provided with everything necessary.  Thanks to this, the quarter will gain new engineering networks, as well as <span>new schools,</span> kindergartens and houses of creativity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Place history </h2><p>  Until the beginning of the XVIII century, in this territory there was mainly coniferous forest, which had a length from the Volkhonsky highway to the <span>village of Volodarsky.</span>  A little later, Sosnovaya Polyana (St. Petersburg) began to be built up from the south - from the side of the Peterhof road.  At that time only suburban estates were built there. </p><p>  Shortly before the revolution, Sosnovaya Polyana was a holiday village with wooden buildings, which was almost destroyed during the hostilities. </p><p>  Until the nineties of the XX century, in this territory one could see private dachas with vegetable gardens, which were later demolished.  Today, the Krasnoselsky district of St. Petersburg is built up with comfortable houses, and its feature is that there is not a single industrial enterprise and not a single metro station.  Sosnovaya Polyana is part of the Krasnoselsky district. </p>

    <h2>  Coat of arms </h2><p>  A golden carriage is depicted in the very center of the symbol representing Sosnovaya Polyana district, and just below it we see a branch serving as a reminder that a suburban village was located in this place until the sixties. </p><p>  The background part of the picture is presented in green and red shades, which are arranged in a checkerboard pattern.  The first of them symbolizes a well-maintained and rich green district, and the second represents courage and dedication. </p><h2>  Where do the county borders? </h2><p>  The boundaries of the microdistrict, in accordance with its charter, are: </p><ul><li>  from the west - from Veteranov Avenue to the railway road adjacent to the industrial zone; </li><li>  in the northern part of the region - from the right of way of the Baltic direction to housing development; </li><li>  then the border follows Budyonny Avenue to the very St. Petersburg highway; </li><li>  in the north, the region ends near the monastery of the Trinity-Sergius desert; </li><li>  from the east, the quarter ends near the zone of the Peterhof carriageway and the Ivanovka River. </li></ul>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Sosnovaya Polyana Park is the main pride of this municipal district.  It was founded at the beginning of the XIX century on the territory of beautiful virgin forests.  At that time there was only one manor. </p><p>  The park area is planted with a variety of trees, and also has original winding paths and elegant canals.  This place remotely resembles a beautiful forest, which is divided into 2 parts by Veteran Avenue.  Currently, various <span>sporting events</span> are taking place there <span>,</span> and all the locals like to have picnics in the park in the park or just take a walk with their families. </p><p>  In addition, in the district of Sosnovaya Polyana there are still parts of the old buildings dating from around 1968 and located on Pilyutova Street, as well as the old Manikhin estate. </p><p>  In this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg is another unique building with atypical architecture for Russia - the Gothic House.  It was built at the beginning of the XIX century and was intended to store books, as well as all kinds of works of art.  5 years ago, the building suffered a devastating fire and today has a deplorable appearance, but the city authorities promise to restore it and turn it into a recreation center for young people. </p><p>  Across the road from this house is another pride of the quarter - the famous Vorontsov's summer house.  It was erected even earlier - approximately in the middle of the XVIII century.  The chancellor himself went bankrupt, so he was forced to sell the cottage at the end of his life. </p>
