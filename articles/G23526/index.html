Therefore, every year an increasing number of beginning masters are interested in the technology of performing the most spectacular and popular patterns.  In the material presented below, we will study the features of making a braid of 12 loops with knitting needles.  This pattern looks very beautiful and original.  Most often used for knitting warm products.  Especially hats, mittens and various types of scarves. </p><h2>  What are knitted braids </h2><p>  Many beginners really like patterns similar to the one being studied.  However, it seems to them that such beauty can only be done by professional masters.  Nevertheless, experienced needlewomen constantly repeat the opposite.  Let's try to figure out what knitted braids are and whether this technology is available for beginner knitters.  To begin with, various braids and braids, including a braid of 12 loops (knitting needles), in most cases consist of front loops.  In this case, the length (number of rows) and width (number of loops) can be adjusted independently.  Beautiful weaves are obtained when loops in the same row change places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="braid from 12 loops how to knit" class="if uuid-2995283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995283.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern design </h2><p>  Needleworkers who have a basic knowledge base can easily navigate according to the scheme.  Therefore, we further propose to study the graphic instruction, which will help to knit a 12-loop volume braid with knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, with this pattern you can decorate whatever your heart desires.  For example, a bandage-bezel, using only one pattern repeat, and two edge loops.  Or combine the studied motive with others, as the main photo demonstrates.  The rapport of this pattern consists of two facial loops, eight purl, twelve facial (braid) and eight purl.  You can also knit from one braid.  In this way, hats, scarves and mittens are most often decorated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="12-loop braid" class="if uuid-2995279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995279.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern Execution Technology </h2><p>  A braid of 12 stitches with knitting needles is easy to knit.  But it is important to consider that this is not a simple tourniquet.  We will not cross six loops, but four.  The part located in the center participates in both bindings.  Lateral - through one crossing.  For beginning masters who better perceive text instructions, we offer a detailed description: </p><ol><li>  We collect twenty loops on the knitting needles (2 hem, 12 on the braid and 6 purl to highlight the studied pattern). </li><li>  In the first row we set the pattern. </li><li>  We remove the hem, knit 3 purl, 12 front, 3 purl and the last hem we sew as purl. </li><li>  We knit the second row and all subsequent even ones according to the figure.  That is, over the front - the front, it is necessary on the wrong side - the wrong side.  Edge remove. </li><li>  We knit the third row, as the first. </li><li>  But in the fifth, the fun begins.  In it, we will begin to form with the needles a braid of 12 loops.  We remove the edge, we knit three wrong and four facial according to the picture.  The next four loops are removed on an additional knitting needle, we take away from ourselves (for work) and we knit the next four front ones.  After we knit the four middle facial loops, which we previously removed on the auxiliary knitting needle. </li><li>  We knit the seventh and ninth row as the first. </li><li>  In the eleventh, we again cross the loops.  But this time the central part and the rightmost one. </li><li>  Remove the edge, knit three wrong ones.  We transfer the four central loops to an additional knitting needle, take them to ourselves (before work) and knit the following four front ones.  Then we return the four removed loops in a row, we knit, and then the remaining four face, three purl and edge. </li></ol><p>  Thus, <span>knitting braids</span> from 12 loops consists of fairly simple actions and is quite accessible for beginners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="description of a braid of 12 stitches with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2995289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995289.jpg"></div><h2>  How to calculate the dimensions of a conceived product </h2><p>  In order for the connected thing to turn out beautiful and neat, you must correctly enter the selected pattern.  After all, if the picture is cut off, the work will look careless and lose its attractiveness.  Therefore, experienced craftswomen recommend that beginning knitters take into account the pattern repeat when calculating loops and rows. </p><p>  The studied braid consists of 12 loops and 11 rows.  This is a horizontal and, accordingly, vertical pattern repeat.  If you want to knit the whole product with solid braids, for example, make a hat with braids of 12 loops with knitting needles, you should tie the sample, taking one report of the pattern.  Moreover, it is important to use knitting needles and yarn that are prepared for the main work.  After that, measure its length and width with a centimeter.  Divide the width of the idea by the width of the sample and multiply by 12, thereby finding out how many loops you need to dial to knit the desired product.  Similarly, the rows are calculated.  Divide the length of the idea by the length of the sample and multiply by 11 rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="braid of 12 loops hat" class="if uuid-2995284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995284.jpg"></div><h2>  How to knit a hat with a pattern "Volumetric braid of 12 loops" </h2><p>  A huge number of people perceive information much better when they observe the process from the outside.  Therefore, we further invite readers to familiarize themselves with the video instruction in which an experienced needlewoman shares her skill, explaining the whole process - from looping to the final decrease. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="vcfmcD7y4sA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1685&amp;v=vcfmcD7y4sA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/5/9/7/12597.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that the description of a braid of 12 stitches with knitting needles will be possible to fulfill even for beginners, which will help them realize even the most daring idea.  The main thing is not to be afraid to try your hand and not stop halfway. </p>
