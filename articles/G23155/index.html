  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mount Khu Yam: myth or reality?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mount Khu-Yam is a famous myth for people who have at least once heard this name.  First of all, it is the name that is of interest, because in Russian it develops into an obscene statement.  The question of whether such a mountain exists and where it could be will be discussed later in the article. </p><h2>  The appearance of the myth </h2><p>  It is not known for certain where the name of Mount Khu-Yam came from and who came up with it.  If you look at phrases in the Chinese language, then named by phonetic features could exist in it.  If you ask any passerby on the street whether there is such a peak on the map, you can get a wide variety of answers. </p><p>  People will speculate that she is in Japan, China or even Thailand.  For many citizens, Asian languages ‚Äã‚Äãare foreign, and therefore such assumptions are natural.  You can add Korea, Taiwan and several other states to this list.  And although this does not explain the theory of the appearance of the name of Mount Khu-Yam, it makes it possible to understand why people believe in its existence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lazerhorse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is there khu-yam mountain in the world" class="if uuid-2419854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2419854.jpg"></div><h2>  The main mountain peaks in China </h2><p>  If we talk about the existence of a peak with this name, then China is the most suitable territory for this.  The reason for this is as simple as possible - 70% of the entire country is sheltered by mountain ranges.  Mostly this applies to the northern region, where there are world-famous peaks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Their height ranges from two to eight thousand meters, and they are located in the Himalayas.  This mountain system is known as the highest on Earth.  Its highest peak, called the Chomolungma (Mother of the Gods) in Tibetan, is called Everest by the Europeans.  Among the local population, this peak has two more names.  Every year it attracts a huge number of tourists.  Perhaps it was among them that the legend of Mount Khu-Yam appeared. </p><p>  Another popular ridge is the Sacred Mountains.  Here are located several cult peaks for the local population.  Among them, it is worth noting Songshan, on which the legendary Shaolin Monastery, Shaanxi with its beautiful views, and the ancient Emeishan Mountain are located.  It is worth noting that this is not the whole list, and this ridge is worth a look for everyone who wants to get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãadrenaline and enthusiastic emotions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wanna-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is there a photo of Khu Yam Mountain" class="if uuid-2420430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2420430.jpg"></div><h2>  Related Names in China </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in photos of Khu Yam Mountain, but it is impossible to find them on the Web.  The reason for this is that the existence of such a natural object is only a myth.  If you take a detailed physical map of the world and spend several hours exploring Asia, you still will not be able to find such a peak. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Instead, the researcher in this matter will be able to find similar names of mountain peaks, which he will definitely pay attention to.  So, in the center of the Himalayas you can find a mountain called Kangphu-Kang.  In the north is the peak of Kankar-Punsum, famous among climbers.  Its height reaches 7570 meters, and it has earned popularity because so far no one has managed to climb it.  Another similar name can be considered Kuiten-Uul, which gives rise to the Potanin glacier.  Khartapu, Kongurtube and several other peaks can be added to this list, but all of them are not the Chinese mountain of Khu Yam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese colored mountains" class="if uuid-2419857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2419857.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the legend of the existence of a mountain with a strange name attracted the attention of different people.  Some even specifically checked the information for truthfulness, but each of them came to the same conclusion - there is no Mount Khu-Yam and the photo where it is depicted. </p><p>  In China, there are many peaks that deserve the attention of lovers of extreme tourism.  For example, in addition to those mentioned in the article, it is worth noting the Colored Mountains, which convey a huge range of colors and give unforgettable pleasure.  So, you can come to this country not only for the sake of a mythical mountain. </p>
