When does the countdown of these periods begin?  What discoveries have been made during this time? </p><h2>  The beginning of a new time </h2><p>  New time is called the period when humanity has stepped to a new stage in the development of its potential.  But when exactly did this happen? </p><p>  Usually a new time is called the period between the Middle Ages and Modern History.  Some propose a countdown from the 17th century, when the English Revolution began in 1640.  But a breakthrough in achievements and changes in society begin as early as the 15th century, which is why many researchers consider this the beginning of a new era or early New Time. </p><p>  At the end of the Middle Ages, important discoveries and inventions were made.  In 1440, Johannes Guttenberg invented the printing press, and books not only religious, but also scientific and entertaining, gradually developed.  In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered America, European colonization began. </p>

    <p>  Society changes attitudes and addresses the essence of the human person.  In England, departing from the primacy of the Catholic Church, the Reformation movement and Protestantism are emerging.  Science begins to develop, the first scientific communities are created: the Royal Society, the French Royal Army of Sciences.  Inventions of the new time from the XVI: mechanical calculator, vacuum pump, barometer, pendulum clock.  Galileo Galilei invents the telescope, Descartes creates a coordinate system.  A microscope, a spyglass, and glass glasses appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Inventions of the New Time from the 18th Century </h2><p>  From the end of the 17th century, the bourgeoisie was born.  <span>The industrial revolution</span> gives impetus to the development of capitalism and industrial society. </p><p>  Technical discoveries and inventions of the new time are sometimes made quite by accident.  So, John Watt was visited by the thought of a steam engine when he looked at the jumping lid of a boiling kettle.  Thomas Newkman built the first reciprocating steam engine in 1712. </p>

    <p>  G. Amonton invents a <span>gas thermometer</span> in 1703, followed by <span>an alcohol thermometer</span> from Rene Reaumur (1710).  John Handley and Thomas Godfrey invent the sextant (1730). </p><p>  Demand for the production of fabrics encourages the invention of spinning and sewing machines.  The first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint.  The author of the spinning machine was James Hargreaves (1764).  In 1893, Whitecomb Judson came up with a zipper. </p><p>  Many inventions of the New Age were made in the 19th century.  In 1818, the law of photochemistry was discovered, and in 1839, N. Nieps, L. Dagger invented photography.  In 1769, the Frenchman Kunho builds a steam engine cart, and in 1886 G. Daimler and K. Benz invent the first crew with a gas engine. </p><p>  A.S.  Popov invents a radio in 1895, Nikola Tesla in 1893-1895 creates a radio transmitter, and then a radio receiver. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The great <span>inventions of the New</span> Age are <span>Thomas Edison's</span> light bulb and the discovery of electricity, <span>this is an invention of</span> x-rays by Ivan Puliu and Roentgen at the same time.  Thomas Watson in 1876 became the author of the telephone, before him there was a speaker ‚Äútalking telegraph‚Äù, invented by <span>Alexander Bell.</span> </p><p>  Other inventions of the New Age: parachute, steamboat, piano, tuning fork, balloon.  In the 18th-19th centuries, a kaleidoscope, a stereoscope, arc welding, a steam locomotive, a lighter and matches were also invented (moreover, a lighter much earlier). </p><h2>  Modern Inventions </h2><p>  The newest time begins its countdown from the 20th century, namely from 1918.  At that time, technological progress took a significant step forward.  The first means of transportation with engines were invented, making it easy to overcome significant distances.  Many mechanisms were improved, and mankind was burning electricity with might and main. </p><p>  The time has come for the development of the natural sciences.  Of particular importance are chemistry and physics.  In the XX century, K. Lanshteiner first discovered a blood group, Freud worked on the theory of psychoanalysis, P. Erlich opened up the possibilities of chemotherapy.  A. Fleming discovered in 1929 penicillin - the first antibiotic in the world. </p>

    <p>  Wars and conflicts between states contribute to the active study of physics and nuclear energy.  In 1905, A. Einstein discovered the theory of relativity; N. Bohr worked on the quantum theory of atoms.  The atomic nucleus is discovered <span>(E. Rutherford,</span> 1911), Artificial radioactivity (F. and I. Joliot-Curie, 1934), the nuclear nucleus of uranium is first split (O. Gan, F. Stassman, 1938). </p><p>  Outer space is being studied and new discoveries are being made in astronomy.  Discover cosmic rays (W. Hess, 1911-1913), the Hubble law on the expansion of the universe (E. Hubble, 1929).  It becomes known about space radio emission (K. Jansky, 1931). </p><h2>  Bright inventions and discoveries of the XX century </h2><p>  Discoveries and inventions of modern times significantly surpass previous eras.  During the Cold War, America and the USSR compete both in creating nuclear weapons and in space exploration.  The first rocket designs, space stations, and spacecraft appear.  The Soviet Union is releasing the first artificial Earth satellite, taking the first steps to travel to the moon - space stations, moon rovers are launched onto the surface of the satellite. </p><p>  In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person to be in space.  In 1969, American Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. </p>

    <p>  It would not have been possible to see Armstrong walking on the moon if television had not been invented in the same century.  The contribution to the development of this miracle of technology was made by Vladimir Zvorykin, Filo Farnsworth, and others. </p><p>  In 1946, the first ENIAC computer was created in the USA, the predecessor inventions looked more like a calculator.  The inventor of the first prototype of a computer is considered Charles Babbage. </p><p>  Important inventions of modern times are also the scuba gear of J. I. Cousteau (1943), the helicopter of A.M. Cheremukhin (1930), the jet engine of V.P. Glushko (1930), the laser of Theodor Meiman (1960) and the atomic bomb (1945) whose name is kept in the strictest confidence. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the period of the New and Modern times in history, many great and necessary discoveries and inventions were made to humanity.  We use many of them now. </p>
