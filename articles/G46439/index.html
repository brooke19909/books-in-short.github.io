This region attracts divers and honeymooners, who are the majority here.  The archipelago includes 6 islands.  The inhabited Phi Phi Don, located in the north, and Phi Phi Lei, on which almost no one lives, located in the southern part, are the largest of them. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The period from November to April is the most suitable time for a visit to the archipelago.  The air temperature is steadily held at around 30 degrees Celsius and is truly heavenly.  Rain in the tropics is most often stormy, but short in duration, so the rainy season is absolutely not an obstacle to relaxation.  In a word, Phi Phi (Thailand) is an island created for lovers of magnificent natural landscapes, wild impenetrable jungle, sun and clear sea water, exotic species of birds and animals, trees and plants, and just an amazing vacation. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2>
