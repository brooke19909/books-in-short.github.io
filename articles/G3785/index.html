  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the matrix in the phone: description, characteristics, purpose</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphone screens, in addition to displaying information, also carry the function of a governing body.  Like any glass product, they are quite fragile.  In case of damage, the phone becomes almost impossible to use.  Someone can take it to the service, for which they will have to put a lot of money, and someone will ask if it is possible to change the matrix on the phone yourself.  We will talk about all the nuances of the device and display replacement in the material below. </p><h2>  Classic displays </h2><p>  Most touch screens on smartphones consist of two components.  The matrix (in fact, the screen itself) and the touchscreen are the touch panel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globalsources.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is the matrix in the phone" class="if uuid-3207032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3207032.jpg"></div><p>  For those who are interested in what the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin the phone, we inform you that this is an LED or LCD panel.  What it specifically depends on the manufacturing technology.  On the front side it is covered with a thin layer of protective glass, and behind is a protective layer of stainless steel. </p><p>  A touchscreen usually represents the entire front panel of a device.  This is a glass, and in rare cases, a plastic plate having a conductive layer inside and, in most cases, an oleophobic coating on the outside. </p><h2>  OGS modules </h2><p>  We continue to study what a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin a phone.  Recently, in order to reduce the thickness of the case, manufacturers equip their devices with such screens.  OGS or One glass solution (a solution with one glass) is a matrix and a touchscreen connected to one monolithic panel.  When one of the components fails, the entire module changes, which partially simplifies the task.  The reduction in thickness is achieved by reducing the air gap between the matrix and the touchscreen, as well as the fact that the touch panel is used as a protective glass for the matrix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifics of repair of OGS screens </h2><p>  However, replacing a sensor or a matrix individually is by qualified specialists, and even then not in all cases.  This is due to the fact that with this approach, the repair itself will cost more than the part, since this requires special accessories.  This is a heating stand, a stencil, a photopolymer and an ultraviolet lamp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what" class="if uuid-3207030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3207030.jpg"></div><p>  This type of screen is installed on the vast majority of modern smartphones.  You can try to replace a separate part of the display module with your own hands, but only if you have a lot of time, a desire to learn new things in the case when the device is not a pity. </p><h2>  Self-replacement matrix on the phone with OGS-module </h2><p>  It is worth noting that it is strongly not recommended to repair such a panel with your own hands due to its complexity and the likelihood of damage to other components of the device.  It is much easier and safer to purchase the display module assembly for self-replacement. </p><p>  As for the flagships of HTC and Samsung, which were released after 2015, their independent repair is impossible without damage to parts of the case.  When buying a display module or its parts separately, usually in the kit immediately comes a basic set of tools (screwdrivers, suction cups, etc.).  To replace one of the components of the screen, the procedure is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Dismantling the device.  Remove the back cover, and if it is non-removable, heat it with a hairdryer and gently pull off the suction cup.  Then unscrew all the screws and very carefully disconnect all the cables. </li><li>  Remove display module.  In the same way as the back cover was removed using a hairdryer and suction cup. </li><li>  Lock the display for delamination. </li><li>  Detach the matrix from the touchscreen, warming it with a hairdryer and sticking a thin thread or string from the edge, cut the adhesive layer into it, without stopping the heating. </li><li>  To clean the glue residue from the sensor and matrix of the phone screen using a special cleaner. </li><li>  Apply glue to the replaced part and glue the components of the screen as evenly as possible. </li><li>  Cure adhesive with UV lamp.  The exact hardening time will be indicated on the packaging. </li><li>  Replace the screen, connect all the cables. </li><li>  After the glue has completely dried, assemble the smartphone. <div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the matrix in the phone" class="if uuid-3207036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3207036.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Self repair screen with air gap </h2><p>  These types of displays are much more suitable for repair at home.  The tools that come with the spare parts will be enough to restore the device.  The difference between what the matrix in the phone and the sensor is described above, so that this should not cause problems when ordering the necessary parts. </p><p>  The process itself is slightly different from what was described in the previous paragraph.  Disassembling the device, removing the display module and so on.  The simplicity of this design is that when separating the matrix and the touchscreen, you do not need to use special tools.  They are interconnected with a special double-sided tape, and the parts are attached to it after replacement.  It is especially worth noting that when working with loops and the insides of a smartphone, care should be taken not to damage the internal components. </p><h2>  Does self-repairing the screen make sense? </h2><p>  This article provides instructions for replacing damaged screen components, but does it make sense to do this yourself, or is it worth contacting a phone repair company?  The matrix and sensor are parts that are sensitive to external influences.  With insufficient accuracy, the entire display module can be disabled.  Separately, it is worth examining the advantages and disadvantages of hand-made repairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a matrix" class="if uuid-3207035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3207035.jpg"></div><p>  Parts for the organization of telephone repair are purchased in bulk at a significantly reduced cost.  Find the same price tag in retail is almost impossible.  As an option, order a part from China, but this is fraught with weeks of waiting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobirobo.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is in the phone" class="if uuid-3207034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3207034.jpg"></div><p>  Self-replacement is advisable if an inexpensive device is damaged.  After all, the cost of repairs in the service can cost half the price of the device.  You can spend a lot of time without achieving a positive result.  Such actions can be justified by great enthusiasm and a considerable amount of free hours. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This article describes what a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin a phone and what a sensor is, what distinguishes them from a display module.  Also given recommendations and instructions for self-repair.  But if you feel a lack of experience in this area and fear of spoiling the device, it is better to contact a qualified service technician.  There, the replacement of the damaged part will be carried out quickly, efficiently and with a guarantee. </p>
