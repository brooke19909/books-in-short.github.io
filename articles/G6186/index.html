  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reforms of the Elected Council of Ivan the Terrible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By the end of the 1540s, under the young ruler Ivan IV, a circle of leaders was formed whom he trusted in conducting business in the state.  Later, the new government, Andrei Kurbsky called the "Chosen Council".  Its most famous members were Adashev Alexei Fedorovich, confessor Sylvester, <span>Viskovaty Ivan</span> Mikhailovich - head of the <span>Ambassadorial order,</span> and several other noble princes. </p><p>  Reforms of the Chosen One </p><p>  The first steps towards reform were the meetings of the nobles and the governor.  In February 1549, the February meeting was held, which became the first Zemsky Sobor.  The main political strategy of the Chosen Council was the centralization of the Russian state according to the civilizational model of the West.  The change of strategy required a set of reforms.  Reforms of the Chosen Council had an anti-boyar orientation.  She relied on landowners, nobles, posad people, and therefore, expressed exclusively their interests. </p><p>  The elected parliament, the reforms of which occurred in 1549-1560, implemented transformations in all spheres of society.  The changes affected the administrative, church, legal, financial and tax and other systems. </p><p>  Reforms of the Chosen one in the legal and administrative systems </p><p>  By the decision of the ‚ÄúCouncil of Reconciliation‚Äù in 1549, a new code of laws was being prepared.  The amended Sudebnik was established in 1550.  The relations between the feudal lords and the peasants have not changed; the old norms and laws have been preserved.  At the same time, the power of local feeders was somewhat limited, and the process of forming orders accelerated.  Orders are the first functional governing bodies in charge of certain areas of state affairs (otherwise they were called chambers, courtyards, etc.).  The most famous were Chelobitny, Streletsky, Ambassadorial and other orders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, centralization of local self-government was carried out.  The local governments were replaced by the elected administration.  These and other innovations strengthened the position of the nobility in society, united the provincial nobility into service cities. </p><p>  Army reform </p><p>  In the mid 50-ies of the XVI century adopted the "Code of Service".  A strict order of service was established.  All landowners, regardless of the size of their holdings, became service people.  The government of <span>Alexei Adashev</span> organized a <span>streltsy army</span> and formed a squad of archers to protect the king.  According to the results of military reforms, tens of thousands of soldiers appeared weapons, equipment and food. </p><p>  Church Reforms of the Chosen One </p><p>  In 1551, Stoglav was adopted, in which one hundred chapters were published on the answers of Ivan the Terrible about the structure of the church.  Stoglav strengthened general discipline in the church, regulated life.  The king intended to confiscate land from the church, but these intentions were not approved by the Chosen Council.  The Church did its best to strengthen its authority, which is steadily falling in the eyes of the people. </p><p>  Reforms of the Chosen One are pleased in the financial system </p><p>  No administrative reforms could be implemented without restructuring the tax system.  In 1550, a census of the entire population was conducted.  Yard taxation has been replaced by land taxation.  In the central territory, a tax unit called ‚Äúbig plow‚Äù was introduced; its value varied depending on the situation of landowners.  The payment of taxes by the population has become increasingly centralized.  "Feeding income" has been replaced by a nationwide "feeding fee." </p><p>  In general, the reforms of the Chosen One under Ivan the Terrible were mixed.  They were of a compromise character.  Reforms helped to strengthen power and improve the position of the nobility.  Their implementation was interrupted due to the resignation of the Chosen One in 1560. </p>
