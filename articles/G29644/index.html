  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Georgia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of Georgia dates back to the tenth century.  At that time, several principalities merged.  This state lasted about three centuries.  After several centuries, already in the eighteenth century, again the Georgian principalities united.  A little later, some of them joined the Russian Empire. </p><p>  In the eighth century <span>BC</span> , the Greeks lived on the western territory of modern Georgia.  After several centuries, the Anatolian tribes entered the eastern territory of the state.  They assimilated (merged) with the locals.  Thus the Iberian state was formed, which did not last long. </p><p>  Between the fifth and third centuries BC, various states invaded the territory of modern Georgia.  However, in 189 BC, the army of the Romans defeated the army of the Seleucids.  As a result, the Armenian state was formed, to which the Georgian principalities also joined.  Its rulers seized quite a few territories. </p><p>  However, between the fourth and fifth centuries the western territory of the Armenian state was captured by the <span>Byzantine Empire, which was</span> quite powerful at that time.  At the same time, the Persians invaded the eastern part. </p><p>  In the seventh century, a Muslim state was created throughout the territory of the Armenian state by visiting Muslim Arabs.  Ancient Georgia was able to get rid of this yoke only by 1122.  At the same time, the Seljuk Turks invaded Armenia.  This forced many Armenian Christians to flee to Georgia.  There they merged with the local population. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> and Persia for a rather long period of time tried to invade the territory of Georgia.  All attempts were unsuccessful until the eighteenth century.  In this century, the Turks have almost succeeded.  However, Catherine the Great came to the aid of the Christian population of the Caucasus.  Russian troops were able to expel numerous Turkish invaders.  From that moment, the history of Georgia continued as part of the Russian Empire.  The complete expulsion of Muslims occurred only in the mid-nineteenth century. </p><p>  After the accession of Eastern Georgia to the Russian Empire in 1801, Tbilisi became the administrative center in the Georgian province.  The city also housed the residence of the commander in chief of the Russian army. </p><p>  <span>The history of Georgia of the</span> nineteenth century is significant for the nationalist parties and groups created and then very popular.  Along with this, the status of the country's capital city of Tbilisi as a major cultural and economic center has strengthened. </p><p>  The beginning of the twentieth century was marked by the declaration of independence of a number of states (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan).  However, after the capture by the Bolsheviks, they all became <span>part of the Soviet Union.</span>  Moreover, the RSDLP committee was created in the capital, Tbilisi.  Since the beginning of the twenties of this century, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia have been united in the <span>ZSFSR (Transcaucasian</span> Soviet Federative Socialist Republic). </p><p>  This federation was dissolved in 1936.  From that moment another history of Georgia began. </p><p>  In 1990, the first elections were held in the country.  They were attended by several political parties. </p><p>  According to many political experts, the former Soviet Republic had good prospects for progressive economic growth.  However, in 1992-93, the history of Georgia was marked by a war between Abkhazia and South Ossetia for independence.  It should be noted that the country's president <span>Eduard Shevardnadze</span> made a great contribution to stabilizing the political and economic situation in the country at that time <span>.</span> </p>
