The main one is a wired element, which provides information transfer.  Both the radio frequency and the cable can act as a channel.  The second option is the most practical, so it is used more often.  However, in this group there are a lot of subspecies and various modifications of guide media.  The <span>fiber-optic</span> communication <span>cable is</span> becoming more and more popular, but traditional wiring does not lose its position in the market.  Habitual <span>twisted pair,</span> in particular, is appreciated for its affordability and relative stability in data transfer. </p><h2>  Cable application </h2>

    <p>  Wires of this type are used to transmit various information.  In particular, the lines are arranged for broadcasting a television signal, providing telephone communications and exchanging digital data.  Accordingly, there may be different purposes in terms of scale and location.  There are intercity, interregional and zonal lines.  With the development of communication systems, a separate classification of networks for urban and rural has appeared.  Lines are laid not only outdoors, forming air and ground channels, but also inside buildings for direct communication with equipment.  A <span>telephone cable</span> familiar to many <span>,</span> for example, can be underwater and wall.  Belonging to a particular class determines the installation method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Communication cable device </h2>

    <p>  Several components can be used in the cable design.  The basis, as a rule, is a conductive "core", along which the signal is transmitted.  The simplest device has symmetrical cables, in which two identical wires are used, forming the same twisted pair.  It should also be noted <span>insulation materials.</span>  They are represented by different coatings, but the most common is the braid and external insulation, which protects the cables.  Communication lines may provide different degrees of protection for wiring depending on the operating conditions and the laying method itself.  <span>A structured cabling system</span> cannot be considered without mentioning accessories and accessories to enable efficient installation.  This group of elements includes various connectors, connectors, cross panels and wiring closets. </p><h2>  Types of Shells </h2><p>  As already noted, the shell performs a protective function, therefore, in conditions of use on the street, the importance of this material increases.  This coating protects not only the conductor, but also the insulation layers, since the contact of moisture with the coating can disrupt and even spoil this section of the line.  So, the shell consists of reinforcing and sealing layers.  As a material for them, metal, plastic, rubber and even paper can be used.  A special role in the device is played by metal, since it can perform the screening function.  Traditional types of communication cables, including symmetrical and coaxial, can be provided with a screen based on a metal sheet, mesh or foil.  There is also a whole group of shells made of polyvinyl chloride.  This is a fairly practical and functional material, which in this case can act as an element of physical protection, and a semiconductor, and a layer for insulation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Coaxial cable </h2><p>  The base of the cable is formed by two cylinders with different diameters, in which the axis is combined.  At the same time, one of these elements is placed in the other, which forms the configuration of a solid inner conductor.  Such devices are used for broadcasting in a wide range of frequencies.  The highest stability in terms of electrical quality, this communication cable differs at frequencies up to 4 GHz.  For this reason, coaxial wires are used in radio and microwave systems, in computer local area networks, as well as in cable television infrastructure.  Moreover, telephone service providers use this cable in the laying of trunk networks, which in itself indicates a high reliability of the product.  As for equipping a protective sheath, for this conductor use the whole range of practical solutions from paper wrapping to armored steel tape.  In some cases, the cable is laid without any protection at all - in the bare form. </p>

    <h2>  Balanced cable </h2><p>  In this case, the cores are twisted into isolated groups, that is, twisted pairs.  This arrangement creates equal conditions for both cores of the circuit, which minimizes the effect of the wires on each other.  Also, the mutual movement of the cores in areas with bends is prevented and a round shape is maintained.  In addition to the classic pair twisting, there is a four-way configuration, as well as dual and hybrid layouts.  In order to facilitate the correct installation of a balanced cable, manufacturers mark each group with one color.  The basic shades that are commonly used in pairs are red and blue.  Regardless of the quality of the sheath, the communication cable is provided by the internal winding of the wires.  To do this, use colored synthetic or cotton yarn. </p><h2>  Fiber optic cables </h2>

    <p>  <span>Optical cables</span> form a two-layer fiberglass made of multicomponent or quartz glass.  By the way, the diameter of such a fiber is 100-150 microns.  Reinforcing and plastic threads are used as insulation.  The protective coating is selected depending on the operating conditions, but the spectrum is the same as in the case with traditional communication wires.  It is important to note the separation of such cables into multimode and single mode.  The main difference between them determines the size of the core, which can be represented by one or more thin fibers.  For example, a single-mode cable has a thickness of about 8-10 microns, which helps to eliminate inter-mode dispersion.  In turn, the core of multimode fibers is up to 60 microns.  Despite the high speed of information transfer and reliability, such channels lose single-mode due to dispersion distortion. </p><h2>  Special Purpose Cables </h2><p>  Cables with an armored cover that protect the base from external influences fall into this category.  The outer coating may be solid steel wire elements.  Typically, such a high level of external protection is required for networks that must be installed under water.  From this point of view, wires should be divided into sea and river.  In the first case, the design is calculated on the ability to protect against wave shocks, moving along the rocky bottom, resistance to ice, etc. This protection is realized by two-layer wire armor, the wire diameter of which is 4-6 mm. </p><p>  The river communication cable is not structurally different from the underground directional communications of this type.  However, in this case, an increased thickness of the steel or lead sheath is provided.  Not so high requirements for coastal wiring.  Such networks are provided with a single layer of armor made of round steel wire with a diameter of 6 mm. </p><h2>  Communication cable routing </h2>

    <p>  Typically, communication lines are laid underground in special sewers.  Engineers strive to carry out installation in such a way that the minimum number of bends is formed.  In extreme cases, wells are created - the points at which a bunch of individual cable segments occurs in order to ensure turns.  There are some features in laying fiber optic lines.  The main difficulty in working with such wiring is the need to achieve optimal tension.  After completion of the land work, the line is drawn to the building, where the fasteners and connections are made.  For example, a telephone cable, due to its size, can be laid with fixing with special brackets or studs.  But, from the point of view of external perception, the best solution would be to draw a line through the channel under the baseboard or in the subceiling niche. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Today, any owner of a private house can organize a modern connection of a communication cable to his house without any technical problems.  As practice shows, the correct initial calculation of this event significantly increases the chances of forming a durable network.  At the same time, the price of a communication cable for household needs varies in the average range from 100 to 200 rubles.  for 1 meter, which allows not to save on the quality of materials.  The most expensive solutions today are represented by fiber as the most effective and efficient signal translator.  Its cost is higher than traditional solutions, but for a one-time installation, this choice justifies itself.  If you plan to implement a large-scale project, then perhaps you should limit yourself to using coaxial or symmetrical wires. </p>
