Many write that the cost of living is really low compared to other similar institutions here in Sochi.  Lazarevskoye is a place where there are many holiday homes operating on an all-inclusive basis.  But, as users note, often they offer many services for a fee.  Here, at the hotel, you don‚Äôt have to buy anything.  Even ice cream, drinks are all free.  The second plus is a lot of entertainment for children on site.  Younger guests will always find something to their liking.  Also, people write that the territory is well-groomed, the staff is polite, the rooms are comfortable and clean.  By cons include a too small beach.  They say that during the peak season there is a bit crowded.  And not only on the beach, but also in the restaurant "Tavern".  Sometimes it is difficult to find a free place to have breakfast or lunch. </p><p>  At any time of the year, I am glad to see my guests at the Prometey Hotel.
