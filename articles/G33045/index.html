    <h2>  Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 *: overview </h2><p>  If this is your first trip to Phuket, keep in mind that most hotels here do not have their own beach area.  All the beaches of the island are municipal, so you will have to pay for rest on sunbeds under umbrellas.  This fact should help you not to evaluate hotel complexes depending on proximity to the sea and the presence of your own coastal territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * was commissioned just eight years ago.  However, four years later, large-scale repair work was carried out in it, so most vacationers note good design, cleanliness and comfort in the rooms, as well as an abundance of modern technology. </p><p>  Information about the hotel Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * is quite difficult to find on the Internet, but it is often offered to our compatriots by travel agents.  It is especially interesting for young people and those who are not too pretentious of their surroundings.  The hotel complex Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * can be attributed to small hotels that have no more than sixty rooms.  They are located in one two-story building with an elongated shape.  All apartments are located on both sides of a long corridor.  Some of the tourists claim that the farthest rooms are separated from the reception by two hundred meters. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * is equivalent to three thousand two hundred square meters.  This fact does not allow the hotel complex to have a vast territory, but this is a typical situation for Thai island "treshki".  Despite this, the hotel is surrounded by beautiful exotic plants that create the appropriate mood.  But some guests claim that they still did not have enough green spaces in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  If you are planning an independent trip to Phuket and are worried about how to get from the airport to the Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * hotel complex, the address given to the taxi driver will help you quickly find yourself in the right place.  Experienced travelers are advised to write it on a piece of paper at home in <span>Thai,</span> so it will be easier for the driver to understand you and he will definitely not be mistaken in choosing the direction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel belongs to hotel complexes located on the second coastline.  Vacationers will need to cross the road to get to the beach.  The distance separating Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * from the sea does not exceed six hundred meters.  Guests in their reviews note that the road to the beach area does not take more than five to seven minutes.  Moreover, the hotel complex is located literally in the center of <span>Kata Beach.</span>  It is believed that this is one of the most quiet and family coastal areas of Phuket.  There are always a lot of children and respectable couples, relaxing on deckchairs to the sound of the sea. </p><p>  If you are closer to youth parties and noisy parties, then go to Patong, a tuk-tuk will deliver you to him literally in twenty minutes.  Here the most fun people gather and a variety of entertainment shows are held every evening. </p><p>  Keep in mind that from <span>Phuket Airport</span> to Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * it takes an average of about forty-five minutes.  But this distance does not take much time, because the path runs through a beautiful area with high-quality asphalt surface.  Most tourists do not even notice how they find themselves at the reception of their hotel. </p><p>  If you have purchased a tour that includes breakfast only, which is quite common in Thailand, then the convenient location of the hotel will allow you to visit the local market often and visit numerous cafes, where you will certainly be offered a large selection of dishes of national and Russian cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the hotel described by us belongs to the category of budget "three rubles", the Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * provides its guests with only the most necessary amenities.

In general terms, we can say that the reviews about Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 * are more positive.  Vacationers who understand that they are going to the average three-ruble stay quite satisfied with the service and the hotel itself.  The advantages of the hotel complex include: </p><ul><li>  convenient location relative to cafes, markets, shops and beaches; </li><li>  high professionalism of employees, among which there is a Russian-speaking staff; </li><li>  tasty and fresh food in the restaurant; </li><li>  good housekeeping; </li><li>  a clean, albeit small pool, where you can have fun; </li><li>  low cost of tours. </li></ul><p>  Our compatriots found few disadvantages, but for some tourists they turned out to be significant: </p><ul><li>  poor sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  an abundance of ants; </li><li>  intermittent interruptions with light and hot water; </li><li>  long and uncomfortable corridor in the main building; </li><li>  a drain that runs along the entire wall of the residential building; </li><li>  frogs arranging night concerts right under the windows of the rooms, because of which it is impossible to fall asleep; </li><li>  noise from the street; </li><li>  poor breakfasts. </li></ul><p>  Of course, it is for everyone to decide whether this hotel is suitable for him.  However, the photos of Kata Silver Sand Hotel 3 *, posted by its guests on the Internet, create a rather pleasant first impression.  As a small conclusion, we can say that people who are not spoiled by the five-star service and who are ready to put up with some inconvenience for little money can come here.  Typically, this category includes young people, young families and pensioners, who have been diligently saving up for a trip abroad for several years.  But those who are accustomed to luxury and want for their money to get all the benefits available, should look for another hotel complex on the "Kat".  It will not be very convenient for them in this budget hotel, and the reviews left will be filled with negativity. </p>
