    <p>  The Mercury Foundation, which only positive reviews continue to appear, has a unique policy.  He takes funds from his depositors and accrues <span>compound interest</span> on them <span>.</span>  In this case, the down payment is not returned to the participants of the system.  This approach has eliminated the problem associated with the massive withdrawal of money, with the <span>outflow of capital</span> in times of crisis.  When the clients of the investment company begin to actively withdraw money, this becomes the reason for their shortage.  As a result, payments cease, and the company goes bankrupt. </p><p>  The participants in the system are people who are aimed not at making a one-time profit, but at creating a constant passive income.  People who join the project do not expect the return of their primary capital along with interest.  They expect a steady income over the next year.  Interest is accrued every day.  Money is withdrawn every week.  There is a prerequisite for participation in the program - this is a monthly withdrawal of funds.  This approach eliminates the likelihood of peak loads on the system, which guarantees its intelligibility and stability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Does the system work in reality, feedback from investors </h2>

    <p>  The feedback on the Mercury project (Mutual Assistance Fund) indicates that payments are made in accordance with the regulations every Tuesday.  Many people express gratitude towards the creators of the company.  Finally, each person received a unique opportunity to create a worthy and passive <span>source of income.</span>  Pleasant words are heard from the lips of a wide variety of people, ranging from retirees to businessmen.  The Mercury Foundation, reviews of which are attracted to cooperation, maintains an open policy of activity, does not hide anything from its participants and currently makes regular and serviceable payments, in accordance with the terms of the partnership.  It inspires respect and builds trust of different types of people. </p><h2>  Voluntary Partnership </h2><p>  The Mercury Foundation also has positive reviews for the reason that it does not oblige anyone to anything.  Participants in the system have repeatedly written that the company does not force and does not force to attract new investors.  You can put money into your account and legally receive your interest.  No public activity is needed.  Active project participants who are involved in attracting new investors receive a decent reward as bonuses.  According to already existing depositors, you can get an increase in the interest rate if you visit your account daily and just click on the ‚ÄúBonus‚Äù button.  It is worth saying that this action is not just an advertisement for promoting the system, it is a really working tool to increase revenue.  People who are actively involved in the promotion of the fund talk about the correct accrual of the bonus.  Its removal takes place without problems either monthly or weekly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Additional features attract attention </h2>

    <p>  "Mercury" (mutual assistance fund, reviews of which are with a positive connotation) is designed for the interests of a wide audience.  Each potential investor can contribute to the structure of funds in a minimum amount.  Active participation in the promotion of the project will be accompanied by pleasant rewards and bonuses.  The more actively the actual participants of the association will attract new investors, the more income they will be able to receive.  The reviews for Mercury (Mutual Fund) say that the system works flawlessly.  All settlements with active participants are carried out in an appropriate volume and in a clearly defined time frame.  This leads the foundation to prosperity and even greater popularity.  To receive your reward, just send a request on Monday to noon.  If the participant does not submit an application for withdrawal of funds, all his payments will be stopped until the reasons are clarified.  Numerous positive reviews about Mercury (Mutual Fund) are explained by the fact that after receiving payment, each participant in the system should leave a brief note about this fact.  It only stimulates the development of a mutual fund. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Everything is always under control. </h2>

    <p>  A universal feature of the project is the fact that project participants cannot contribute a disproportionate amount of funds to the fund.  There are clear limitations and limits within the partnership rules.  It is worth saying that the participants in the system cannot deposit funds systematically.  The balance of contributions and their frequency allows the system to develop gradually and harmoniously.  The contribution can be made for a period of one year, which gives grounds for the formation of a clear and transparent payment plan.  To recruit a sufficiently large number of investors, the system works to reduce the percentage of monthly payments.  The first year of partnership provides 360% per annum, the second - 300%, the third - 240%, the fourth - 180%, the fifth - 120%.  Such a policy precludes bankruptcy.  The project itself, according to the creators, was originally designed for 5 years, and already in 2017 there should be cardinal reductions in payments.  While the system is working, the Mercury project (Mutual Fund), which is encouraging reviews, continues to make payments and fulfill its obligations. </p><h2>  Everything is based on trust </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù, Mutual Fund (Russia), reviews of which are presented in a positive way, has no resemblance to the standard structure of the pyramid.  Investor funds are not concentrated in one hand, so the likelihood of a collapse of the structure is completely excluded.  Funds are distributed between custodians, who are involved in the calculation of payments.  No more than 350 thousand rubles are concentrated in their hands, which makes it possible to avoid the attention of tax services.  The fund was not created with the aim of appropriating other people's funds.  It is, in fact, a community of independent people whose relationships are built on trust. </p><p>  ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù, the Mutual Fund (Russia), reviews of which are mostly good, throughout the history of its existence regularly paid interest to investors.  If there were delays, then they were no more than a day.  Such a frivolous attitude of the guardians in some places led to their demotion.  This fact can be confirmed by all participants in the fund. </p><h2>  Negative reviews: anti-advertising or the truth? </h2>

    <p>  Studying the Mercury Foundation, finding negative reviews about it can be problematic.  However, they do occur.  This anti-advertising or truth, it is very difficult to say, we can only <span>state the fact.</span>  For example, some participants argue that after making money to the fund, they received only one payment in the amount of about 7% of the total amount.  After termination of payments, the administration began to ignore requests.  Ultimately, such accounts were simply deleted.  Such comments are accompanied by many counterarguments and even charges of writing such a text for money.  "Mercury" (investment fund) reviews are mostly exemplary, and their vast majority.  Negative feedback from investors is a lonely phenomenon that is not a regularity.  Here everyone can figure it out independently, where is the truth and where is the slander. </p><h2>  Sincerity of the creators of the project </h2>

    <p>  Dmitry Vasadin and Arthur Zalyubovsky openly talk about their creation under the name "Mercury".  <span>A mutual fund,</span> negative reviews of which are considered a real rarity, according to them, is replenished exclusively from two sources.  These are new contributions of program participants and reinvestment of old contributors.  When asked about what will happen to Mercury when investors are exhausted, the founders of the project say that this is simply impossible, since people always strive to earn as much money as possible.  Having experienced the benefits of the system on themselves, investors continue to reinvest.  It turns out a kind of vicious circle, which is almost impossible to break. </p><h2>  Project Bankruptcy Information </h2><p>  In 2014, very interesting information appeared that Mercury, a mutual assistance fund, reviews of which throughout its entire existence were often good, turned out to be a <span>financial pyramid</span> that collapsed.  The report said that depositors gave their money to the fund, while not receiving any guarantees for accruing interest on them.  In fact, a certain donation procedure was carried out.  The project founders promised to pay at least 1% of the deposit amount every day for a year.  360% against 20‚Äì25% of bank deposits turned out to be very attractive.  There were no problems with attracting clients to the partnership.  The main participants in the system were residents of Russia and Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.  The founders of the pyramid had many accounts of international type in different currencies around the world.  So, on August 25, 2014, the organization was declared bankrupt.  However, this state of affairs did not persist for long.  Today the fund is afloat again and continues to actively advertise its activities. </p><h2>  There is no lack of investors </h2>

    <p>  After the company was declared bankrupt, it again resumed its activities.  Currently, strictly limited deposits are accepted, while the return of the main body of the deposit is not provided.  The duration of the partnership is 1 year.  The annual rate is slightly lowered - from 320% to 240%.  Profit is paid every week to a bank card.  After its revival, the Mercury project (Mutual Fund), reviews of which are often written in a positive manner, suggests making weekly re-contributions.  The funds are in the hands of other project participants.  The referral fee is from 6 to 12% of the amount of funds raised.  A flexible partnership scheme is working flawlessly so far, but how long this state of affairs will last is very difficult to answer. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The Mercury Foundation, whose negative reviews are a real rarity, is currently at the peak of its development.  A plentiful amount of advertising, including on social networks, ensures the popularity of the fund.  Despite the fact that partnership with the organization is not supported by any legally strong papers, a fairly large number of people agree to it.  According to one of the correspondents of the newspaper ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù, in this situation, people are led by simple greed.  Despite the timeliness of payments, such an ideal scheme cannot work forever, and here the question of time already arises.  On the other hand, there are thousands and even tens of thousands of people who have been successfully receiving their weekly payments for a long time and enjoy the opportunity provided by the fund. </p>
