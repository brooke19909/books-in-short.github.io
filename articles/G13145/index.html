And although its history spans only 300 years, today it is not only a historical and cultural center, but also a tourist one.  Thousands of people come annually to get acquainted with museums, art galleries, architecture and history of the city. </p><p>  The most popular place for guests of the city are hotels on Nevsky Prospekt - its main street. </p><h2>  Nevsky Prospect </h2><p>  We can safely say that Petersburg began with this avenue.  Only 2 years after the start of construction, it became clear that a direct road from the Admiralty to the Novgorod Highway was needed.  They decided to cut down the forest from two sides at once, but the calculations turned out to be somewhat incorrect, and the straight line, like the arrow, Nevsky Prospect, received a turn on the site of the modern Uprising Square. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, it became the main street of the capital, where the whole cultural and commercial life of the city took place.  Gradually, its development began.  So in the 40s of the 18th century, on the corner of Fontanka and Nevsky Prospect, Anichkin Palace was built for Count Razumovsky.  Many houses here were built according to the designs of Rastrelli, some of them have survived to this day with virtually no changes, for example, the Stroganov Palace. </p>
