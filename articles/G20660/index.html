    <h2>  A bit about Simeiz </h2><p>  The silhouette of the village is easily recognizable: it is formed by the rock of Diva, the dilapidated rock of Monk and <span>Mount Cat.</span>  The healing <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãclimate</span> and stunning natural landscapes attract thousands of tourists every year. </p><p>  In ancient times, not far from Simeiz (in the basin of Besh Tekne) there was a parking lot of ancient people.  Its first inhabitants were Taurus.  They left behind dolmens in the vicinity, as well as a fortified settlement located on Mount Koshke.  At its foot is the largest Taurus burial ground on the peninsula.  It consists of 95 graves.  In the II-III centuries BC.  e.  traces of brands in this area are lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simeiz hotels reviews" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1302711.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Middle Ages, the fortified Taurus settlement turned into a feudal castle.  At this time, the Byzantines, who then owned the southern coast of Crimea, founded a fortified monastery nearby.  Historians believe that it was then that the settlement was called Simeiz. </p><p>  After the weakening of the power of Byzantium, the village, as, indeed, the entire southern coast of the peninsula, became part of the Genoese Captain Gothia.  The new owners turned the castle into a fortress.  Today, its ruins are preserved. </p><p>  In 1475, the Ottomans won the possessions of the Genoese, and the settlement became a small village.  Only Christians lived in it.  At the end of the 18th century, the village, as well as the entire peninsula, became part of the Russian Empire.  One of the first owners of these territories was General F. Revelioti, who at that time was the commander of the border outpost from Balaklava.  Nevertheless, he did not play the main role in the fate of the now famous resort, but the Maltsov family. </p><p>  In 1828, they founded the Simeiz family estate on this land, the boundaries of which they gradually expanded, buying up small nearby plots of land.  And already at the beginning of the XX century the resort village New Simeiz appeared here.  For a very short time, it has become one of the most comfortable aristocratic resorts in Crimea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Simeiz hotels by the sea" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1300623.jpg" width="600"></div>
