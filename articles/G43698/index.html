Some are trying to pick up wireless models of the vacuum type.  Such headphones are compact, have a pleasant appearance, excellent sound and autonomy. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider some models of the AWEI manufacturer.  They meet all the above criteria.  In more detail - further. </p><h2>  About AWEI ES 900M and headphones </h2><p>  AWEI was founded in 1993 in the Republic of Korea.  On its territory, it became popular almost immediately.  In 1999, the company was bought by a Chinese representative, which gave her a chance to enter the international market.  After a certain period, the company fell into the mid-price segment, and its main office was transferred to China.  What models allowed her to become so successful?  This is an AWEI ES 900M headphone.  Their average cost is $ 8.  And what advantages / disadvantages they have, we will consider further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awei headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818174.jpg" width="544"></div>

    <h2>  Packing and kit </h2><p>  The box is quite standard for all Chinese companies that make the feeling of a quality product through beautiful packaging.  A bright illustration is printed on it.  The lid is closed and held with Velcro.  Good quality cardboard, font and lettering look great.  But, objectively speaking, the packaging design leaves much to be desired. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The package includes AWEI headphones themselves, two gray nozzles, although the headset is sold with black ones.  There is a clip and a bag for transporting the device. </p><h2>  Appearance and materials </h2><p>  The manufacturer did everything as accurately as possible, there are no fuzzy or too sharp edges, there are no inflows either.  It should be noted that not all companies that produce more expensive equipment are able to offer such a high-quality assembly.  The wire is soft, it is practically not confused.  Flat cable.  There is no smell of plastic and so on.  The body is made of metal. </p><p>  There are many similar headphones on the market now.  Their bodies are quite similar.  The only directly noticeable minus: there is a long cable divider, which is larger than the microphone unit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awei es headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818175.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The bass is tight, powerful and flexible.  It goes well with other ranges.  What sets this model apart from its competitors is its slightly quiet low frequencies.  Some consumers have noted a lack of speed.  Small tails can be tapped.  In general, this does not particularly affect the sound, so this nuance cannot be called a minus.  Mids and highs are less popular with consumers.  They are a little deaf.  Because of this, the tunes are unnatural, voluminous and flat.  Ears do not get tired of the sound.  He is moderately positive, with no apparent upsurge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You need to understand that these AWEI headphones can show themselves well only if they are connected to a powerful source.  If it is weak, then the bass will be slightly smeared.  If desired, the model can be warmed up (no more than 5 hours). </p><h2>  AWEI ES-600M </h2><p>  The budget headphones of the ES-600M model also gained popularity.  Their approximate cost is $ 7.  The quality of the headphones is fully consistent with the declared price.  In more detail about their advantages and disadvantages - below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awei a920bl headphones" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Options and box </h2><p>  In this matter, there are no claims against the manufacturer.  The kit includes ear pads, a clothespin and a cover for transporting the device.  The latter is made of leather substitute.  There is also an instruction manual for AWEI headphones. </p><p>  The packaging is made in the form of a transparent box.  On the surface are characteristics.  There are also no complaints about how everything is in the box. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the sound of this device leaves much to be desired.  From the first listening it becomes clear that the lower frequencies are noticeably prevailing.  The bass is heard well.  But unfortunately, it is unnatural and a bit like a normal noise or hum.  This is confirmed by reviews.  AWEI earphones feature blurs with the sound of any melody.  Often there is a lack of high range.  The bass begins to mix with the mid frequencies, which makes the melody unsuitable for listening through these headphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awei headphones reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The cable is made using special technology.  It is heavy and has the shape of a noodle.  At the point where the headphones diverge, the wire narrows.  The plug is ordinary, it can easily fail at any time.  The design of the headphones in some parts is coated with metal.  They sit perfectly in the ears, although they stick out a little. </p><h2>  Comparison with competitors </h2><p>  This model does not stand out much, except for its cost.  Its rival, the XKDUN CK-700, which costs $ 7, is also made in China.  It has a much better sound.  The balance in the frequencies is visible, the bass is more sensitive and natural, the higher range is more noticeable.  In general, when playing music in the CK-700, the tracks seem more natural. </p><p>  Another competitor, the Philips SHE 3590, costs just $ 12.  Unfortunately, these headphones are much better than those presented.  They also show sound many times better. </p><h2>  Headphones AWEI A920BL </h2><p>  These headphones are perfect if you need a simple device for listening to music.  Appearance and characteristics are fully consistent with the cost.  The average price is $ 10, so you should not expect something high-quality and serious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect awei headphones" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818178.jpg" width="600"></div>

They sit perfectly in the ears; when used for two hours, no discomfort occurs. </p><p>  The control panel at first glance seems too long, but over time you get used to it.  It gives you the opportunity to work with volume, tracks (scroll through, pause), and also activates the voice assistant, calls the number from the contacts and, of course, allows you to turn on / off the headset.  A more detailed description can be found in the instructions for the AWEI A920BL headphone. </p><p>  There is voice acting.  It applies only to 2 options: connecting to a smartphone and reading the contact that is ringing.  The voice sounds great, does not cause irritation. </p><p>  The headset has a good function: it can display the charge of its battery.  According to the instructions, this option only works with iPhones, but consumer reviews make it clear that it also works on Android. </p><h2>  AWEI A980BL </h2><p>  These headphones are perfect for listening to music tracks from any phone.  The design is interesting, discreet.  The dimensions are small, the sound and autonomy are at an excellent level.  What impressions do consumers get after buying? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awei a920bl wireless headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1818180.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Packaging and packaging </h2><p>  Headphones come in a yellow box.  There are ear pads, clothespin and special devices for fixing wires.  Unfortunately, the USB cable is not included. </p><h2>  Design, assembly and materials </h2><p>  The build quality and the design itself at first look quite impressive.  Many consumers are surprised, because when using the device for a long time this feeling does not disappear. </p><p>  The speaker received a thick body, it is made of metal.  It does not have a collapsible design.  Apparently, the seams are inside.  The speaker before stamping is placed in a special form, which allows to achieve such a result. </p><p>  There is another version of these headphones on sale.  This is a black headset with a red wire.  There is a golden copy.  Recently, the manufacturer released a green and completely black model. </p><p>  Since the structure has no seams, it can be used during rain and sports.  The thing is that moisture will not harm her. </p><p>  On the speaker housing you can see a specific look that resembles a rough turning workpiece.  Most likely, this is an imitation. </p><p>  AWEI <span>Wireless Headphones</span> are connected via cable.  Its length is 60 cm. The housing has silicone insulation.  Near the left earphone is a remote control.  It is made of plastic.  Thanks to him, you can perform some functions.  The connection of the cable and the remote is credible, it seems that the design is rubberized.  The latter has three buttons.  One is responsible for turning on and off, and can also stop playback.  The rest adjust the volume and allow you to switch tracks. </p><p>  The central button of the remote control received a two-color indicator: it lights up blue / red.  The first speaks of a full charge of the battery, and the second - of its end.  If the indicator blinks quickly, it means that the device can connect to another wirelessly.  Also in the normal active position, a blue color is lit.  Thanks to him, the headset is easy to find in a dark room. </p><p>  The microphone is located on the side of the remote control.  At the back is the company logo.  Immediately located and the port, which is necessary for charging the device. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  If you compare these AWEI headphones with the above, then these noticeably differ in sound quality.  The low frequencies are deep and natural.  They are as clear and detailed as possible.  High are distinguished by sonority.  It should be noted that the frequency range is quite wide, so the headphones cope with all genres.  Of course, a lot depends on the quality and power of the source, as well as on the player and equalizer.  Consumers, using headphones on different phones, say that they sound best with LG models.  With Chinese smartphones, the sound is a little weaker, but it does not lose anything in quality. </p><p>  In general, with any phone, these headphones show their best side.  Reproduction is really worthy.  If you compare them with the above models, as well as those that are sold at a higher price, you need to note: the sound is at or often much better. </p><p>  The headset works with a wireless module, the version of which is 4.0.  Thanks to him, communication is not interrupted, not distorted and allows you to receive high-quality music even at large distances. </p>
