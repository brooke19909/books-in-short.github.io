Unlike Ares Hotel, there are several suites.  The service includes round-the-clock service, free wake-up service.  There is a playground, tennis court, massage room, sauna and jacuzzi.  The beach offers water sports and diving.  By the way, it is located near Kemer, just 1 km from the center. </p><p>  Hotel Ares Siti is slightly smaller than the previous ones, it has a territory of 1680 square meters.  m., 73 rooms, two buildings in 3 and 4 floors.  Compared to Hotel, the hotel has several advantages: ceramic flooring in rooms, a snack bar on site.  The hotel also does not have its own beach, but there are several interesting places to visit nearby - the Yeryuk Museum and the port with yachts. </p><p>  The cost of rest at Ares hotels is approximately at the same level, since they all fit into the category of three stars.  For example, 7 nights at Ares Hotel cost about 12,000-14,000 rubles.

    <h2>  Ares Hotel Kemer 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  For the most part, the impressions about staying at Ares Hotel are not very positive.  Every second vacationer gives the hotel a rating of 3 on a five-point scale.  Many complain that the shower and toilet are combined and there is no separate shower, that is, when you take a shower, the entire toilet is in the water.  Someone got a broken toilet or washbasin.  But these are isolated cases.  This problem can always be solved by asking the hotel administration for a different number.  Someone is embarrassed by old furniture, but it is naive to expect luxury apartments from a three-star hotel. </p><p>  According to some vacationers, they got a room with a very small area - 6 square meters.  m. Unfortunately, this fact takes place.  Most often this is due to the fact that tourists simply do not specify information regarding the room, and then write negative reviews. </p><p>  Despite the recent renovation, the walls of the hotel have remained the same.  And according to vacationers, there is no sound insulation between the rooms.  Some tourists, especially those who rested there with children, complained about the constant loud music playing in the hotel, which prevented the children from sleeping, the noise and the slamming of doors.  In addition, due to the low cost of recreation, it was not always possible to meet there cultural and intelligent tourists who were tempted by the all-inclusive program (we are talking about the excessive use of alcoholic beverages).  Unfortunately, such guests are often found in inexpensive three-star hotels and spoil the impression of a vacation to others. </p><p>  Many are dissatisfied with the food at the hotel.  According to most, the portions in the restaurant are small and meager.  According to vacationers, the staff simply saves on food, and hotel guests have to have lunch and dinner in the city. </p><p>  Among the positive aspects of the hotel Ares Hotel Kemer 3 * (Kemer center) are noted for the courtesy and friendliness of the staff, clean rooms and quality cleaning.  Also, many highlighted the rapid settlement, proper operation of the air conditioner, which is very important in the heat.  The proximity of the sea and urban establishments was to many's liking. </p><p>  Analyzing the reviews left by guests, the hotel can be described as a place for unpretentious tourists.  Everyone knows that you need to pay for quality service and a variety of services, and trips to Ares Hotel are cheap.  Therefore, when choosing a hotel you should always understand that a three-star hotel will not provide you with animation programs, wine at a meeting and a free set of services.  If you are ready to sleep on old beds, be content with a pool near the hotel and a city beach, then Ares Hotel is what you need. </p>
