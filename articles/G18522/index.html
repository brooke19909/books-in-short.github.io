But what do the reviews of comfortable travelers about hotels on Liberty Island say?  Most of them praise nature, the sea, the beaches of Cuba and scold its hotels.  "Communist Paradise" left its mark on the life and thinking of citizens, namely they work in hotels in resort towns.  In this article we will consider the hotel Naviti Beach Club Varadero <span>4 * (Cuba).</span>  Judging by the name, it is located in the resort of Varadero.  And what do the reviews say about him?  There are quite a few of them.  Which is not surprising.  After all, the hotel has recently changed its sign.  Until January 2015, she was called "Resident Allegro Varadero."  Those who like to relax in the Occidental Hotels &amp; Resorts hotel chain can not worry: the hotel management remains the same.  The same high level of service awaits you, wherever you are. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1520379.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Where is the hotel located and how to get there </h2><p>  Varadero is a large resort village.  It occupies the entire Ikakos Peninsula, which is given a thin scythe in the sea.  Therefore, vacationers have at their disposal two water areas: the Atlantic and the Gulf.  Hotel Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 * is located ten kilometers from the village of Varadero.  This location reviews are found to be successful.  After all, the farther from the village, the less the charms of the ‚Äúsocialist paradise‚Äù are seen.  Although the guards are still on the beaches anyway.  There are no direct flights to Varadero from Russia.  Direct trains from Moscow can only be reached to Havana.  How to overcome one hundred thirty-five kilometers separating the capital of the country and the resort?  From Havana to Varadero, buses of the Viazul company travel.  Her cars are equipped with air conditioning and a toilet, go to the resort four times a day.  But the bus station from the airport can only be reached by taxi.  From the village of Varadero, double-decker beads ply throughout the peninsula.  A ticket worth five ‚Äúcookies‚Äù is valid for a whole day.  It is easy to get to the hotel Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 *.  Reviews warn that taxi drivers do not know the new name.  They should indicate "The Executive Allegro Varadero" or the even more ancient name of the hotel - "Oasis of Varadero 1920". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1520376.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was built not at the beginning of the twentieth century, but at the end, more precisely, in 1997.  And the last renovation took place altogether in 2006. The figure 1920 refers to the building.  It really was built in the twentieth year of the last century.  Then the idea came up to reconstruct the Cuban town, that is, Varadero - to make it what it was at the end of the nineteenth century.  There are small houses under the tiles, a church, and most importantly - the atmosphere of 1887.  But the territory of the Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 * hotel is truly huge.  On it stand a long four-storey building curved along the sea and two complexes of two-three-level bungalows.  They are named after the beaches - Cayo Largo ("Long", the last major overhaul took place in 2003) and Cayo Coco ("Coconut", renovation 2006).  Buildings are surrounded by greenery.  Beautiful paths curl around the garden.  There are pools, courts, other infrastructure.  The hotel buildings are painted in a rich yellow-orange color, which in combination with the blue sea creates a joyful atmosphere of relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 (Cuba, Varadero)" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1520375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  As you can see, the Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 * hotel is suitable for both lovers of living in large buildings and lovers of peace and small villas.  There are five hundred and three rooms in the hotel, half of which are located in the main building.  They are decorated very stylishly in warm yellow or cool blue tones.  The rooms are divided into two categories: ‚Äústandard‚Äù and ‚Äújunior suite‚Äù.  For a view of the sea at the reception are asked to pay extra.  But reviews claim that the lagoon is clearly visible from the windows of the upper floors of the rooms with Garden View.  Tourists say that even the "standard" in the hotel is very spacious - thirty-two square meters.  Even more ‚Äúsuites‚Äù - 46 square meters.  m. The hotel has several rooms, fully adapted to the needs of persons with disabilities.  The guest rooms in the building are equipped with furnished balconies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  As stylish, spacious, well-equipped, comfortable bedrooms characterize the reviews.  Each room has a bathroom with a brand new and well-functioning plumbing.  Some have a bathtub, others have a shower, but everywhere there is a hairdryer and a set of hygiene items.  A TV with satellite channels and a CD player will diversify your leisure time, high-speed and free Wi-Fi will allow you to stay in touch with friends.  The tropical heat will be left outside by air conditioning, and the filling of the minibar will refresh.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be put in a safe.  Each room has an iron with an ironing board, a work desk with a telephone, a coffee maker or a kettle (there are also bags for self-made drinks).  Cleaned in bedrooms and bathrooms every day.  And snow-white linen and fluffy towels are changed every other day.  Tourists cannot give recommendations regarding room reservation.  Everywhere the filling is more or less the same.  But the building is quite noisy, while the bungalows that are buried in verdure are quiet and comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Naviti Beach Club Varadero 4 Varadero" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1520377.jpg" width="600"></div>
