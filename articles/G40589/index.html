Of course, not everyone has such an opportunity, but you can show your vocal data at home.  There is karaoke for this.  And at the same time it is not necessary to go to a karaoke club, which costs decent money.  You can create a concert hall at home. </p><h2>  Karaoke devices </h2><p>  Today, the home appliance market is full of all kinds of devices, the main function of which is to play phonograms.  Customers who purchase this equipment may have a reasonable question: is it possible to connect karaoke to a TV?  Naturally, it is possible, however, depending on the model and year of manufacture of the TV, the connection method will vary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": LightYearMusic Karaoke &amp; DJ, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect karaoke to a TV" class="if uuid-2257580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257580.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, karaoke can be configured on a personal computer, on a laptop and other devices.  The only difference is that many PCs have the appropriate codecs for playing the necessary audio formats and for full-fledged singing you only need a disc with phonograms. </p><h2>  Setting up karaoke at home </h2><p>  In fact, figuring out how to connect karaoke to a TV is very easy even on your own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Setup consists of the following steps: </p><ul><li>  connecting speakers and a subwoofer to the player to enhance sound; </li><li>  connecting the cable from the DVD to the TV; </li><li>  insert a disc with songs; </li><li>  microphone connection. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.karaokeisle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect karaoke to LG TV" class="if uuid-2257588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257588.jpg"></div><p>  The best option for doing what you love is to use special players (usually DVD-receivers, as well as so-called home theaters).  They are equipped with stereo sound systems and the necessary connectors for connecting to many models of televisions and microphones.  In addition, the new models, you can choose the playback methods - through a DVD-ROM or flash drives. </p><h2>  Using karaoke via a smart TV </h2><p>  And the latest technology achievement is TVs with built-in players.  The leadership race has so far been won by LG and Samsung.  And for example, even a child will be able to figure out how to connect karaoke to the Samsung Smart TV, since the set-up includes detailed instructions for setting it up. </p><p>  Smart TVs made a real sensation among fans of singing their favorite songs in a relaxed home atmosphere.  In addition, the new models are equipped with two microphone jacks, as well as quite powerful speakers.  Loud, comfortable - and you can perform a duet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is one more caveat.  When searching for solutions on how to connect karaoke to an LG Smart TV, remember that now the new technology has direct access to the Internet.  And this means that songs can be played directly from the Web, without connecting additional devices. </p><h2>  Help the Internet in setting up karaoke on Smart TVs </h2><p>  The World Wide Web is filled with many useful applications, so it‚Äôs easy to figure out how to connect karaoke to a TV and set up high-quality vocal playback, even without calling specialists.  A variety of applications, codecs and drivers, millions of phonograms - all this is available, with a small caveat that you will have to pay for it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.mymusiccloud.com" data-author=": Jpotts, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect karaoke to a Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2257600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257600.jpg"></div><p>  Typically, such programs have a limited effect, so you have to subscribe, but it is relatively inexpensive.  But the result will be fantastic - powerful and clear sound, without the risk of spoiling the TV. </p><p>  Important!  In order not to crookedly install any application, you need to carefully read the instructions on how to connect karaoke to the Samsung TV (for all manufacturers, the principle of connection and settings is identical). </p><h2>  Microphone setup </h2><p>  In fact, choosing a good microphone for your karaoke system is also not an easy task.  Here you need to look at the manufacturer, the quality of the audio stream at the output, power and the presence of a suitable connector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": eHowTech, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a karaoke microphone to a Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2257606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257606.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, before connecting a karaoke microphone to an LG or Samsung TV, you need to check the back or side of the TV (or the output connectors of the DVD player). </p><p>  There are several varieties of microphones, ranging from professional to amateur: </p><ul><li>  wireless </li><li>  USB microphone </li><li>  standard plug-in microphone. </li></ul><h2>  Wireless microphone is the best choice for karaoke </h2><p>  Of course, if you make a choice in favor of quality and comfort, then the solution is unambiguous.  A radio microphone eliminates a whole bunch of wires in the room.  There is also no need to purchase additional adapters for connection.  Yes, and figure out how to connect a karaoke microphone to a Samsung TV, you do not need special skills. </p><p>  In addition, such a microphone allows you to sing anywhere in the room, within the radio control. </p><h2>  Alternative microphones </h2><p>  Well, if acquiring a wireless microphone seems too wasteful, then you can use an alternative method.  There are quite inexpensive devices with a standard connector and cord.  Of course, you will have to look for the connector you need for your DVD player or Smart TV, but the result will still be a little cheaper.  There are two types - with 6.3 mm and 3.5 mm connectors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crutchfield.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect karaoke to a Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2257614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257614.jpg"></div><p>  There are still USB microphones, which are universal, since almost all karaoke devices and TVs are equipped with these connectors.  Unfortunately, to use such a microphone, you will need additional tuning, with which the average layman may not be able to cope.  Then it is better to contact either specialists, or knowledgeable people who have similar techniques, or visit the necessary sites with instructions on the Internet. </p><h2>  How to set up karaoke software </h2><p>  In addition to connecting karaoke to a TV, you need to know how the software is configured for the full functionality of music programs. </p><p>  There are several installation options: </p><ul><li>  when connecting the TV to a PC or other device (laptop, tablet); </li><li>  directly to the tv. </li></ul><p>  When downloading software from the Internet, it is best to make sure that there are no viruses or other potentially dangerous programs on the disk or flash drive.  Otherwise, serious damage can be caused to both the PC used and the TV itself.  We are talking about technical failures, up to the need for flashing or reinstalling the OS. </p><p>  Therefore, the best way to connect karaoke to an LG TV (this particular company is very demanding on its products) is to copy the drive from acquaintances or friends, that is, from the original disk.  This completely eliminates the possibility of viruses infecting devices. </p><h2>  What to choose - paid or free karaoke software? </h2><p>  As for the fees for using specialized karaoke software, the situation here is ambiguous.  On the one hand, once having bought a licensed program, the user receives all its advantages on an ongoing basis, namely: </p><ul><li>  regular updates; </li><li>  replenishment of the music library; </li><li>  improvement and comfort when working with the program. </li></ul><p>  But free applications are downloaded at your own discretion, and you will have to answer for the consequences yourself.  Of course, among the free software there are very good programs, but they may not have support and compatibility with certain TV firmwares. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a karaoke microphone to an LG TV" class="if uuid-2257616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257616.jpg"></div><p>  There is, however, one more option.  If you don‚Äôt have the desire and skills to install karaoke software, you can use the simplest solution.  Now on the Internet there are a lot of special sites that make it possible to check your vocal data directly through the browser.  The only negative of such singing is that most resources do not support performance evaluation, and many karaoke portals have a limited number of tracks.  Of course, there are several dozen special sites that have ratings and a colossal music library.  But usually they are available only after subscribing. </p><h2>  Modern trends in the development of karaoke at home </h2><p>  In principle, taking into account the latest technologies and the large-scale development of the Internet, it‚Äôs easy to figure out how to connect karaoke to a TV.  The main thing is that there is a desire to show your vocal skills. </p><p>  Modern TVs are so similar to computers that they perform virtually all the settings in automatic mode, without additional human intervention.  An important point here is to adjust the synchronization of sound and video. </p><p>  This means that the audio stream coming out of the microphone must be matched with the text video sequence.  In addition, the combination of the user's voice with the sounding phonogram should be harmoniously adapted.  They should be in a single spectrum. </p><p>  But the capabilities of modern technology are such that it‚Äôs not worth worrying about how to connect karaoke to a Samsung or LG TV.  First, the app stores of these companies (Samsung Apps and LG Apps) provide special software for karaoke enthusiasts, which easily optimizes all settings on their own and prepares the TV for soundtrack playback. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youtubemusicsucks.com" data-author=": Admin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to connect karaoke to a TV" class="if uuid-2257619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/2257619.jpg"></div><p>  Well, if the TV does not support the Smart function, do not be upset.  Nobody canceled the opportunity to sing in the pleasure of their neighbors, using a DVD-player or PC (laptop).  The only difference is that additional software is required, as well as several adapters, depending on how you can connect this device to the TV. </p><h2>  Last few tips </h2><p>  You can also add that, choosing a method of connecting a TV to a playback device, you need to pay attention to the following aspects: </p><ul><li>  sound quality; </li><li>  footage clarity; </li><li>  synchronization of audio and video. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, if you are using a laptop or PC, it is best to use an HDMI cable as an adapter.  It will provide decent quality (without squares on the screen) and the best sound reception / output. </p><p>  If you have selected a DVD receiver, you can get by with the usual ‚Äútulip‚Äù adapter, although it is optimal to use a digital SCART connector (if there is one on the TV). </p>
