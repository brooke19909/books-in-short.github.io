It is located in the Russian Federation.  The population of the city is about 5.2 thousand people.  For the first time, the Red Hill town of the Tver region was mentioned in the 16th century (1518).  Then he was known as Spas-na-Kholm.  In the XVII century, this region belonged to the possessions of the Krasnokholmsky monastery.  And already in 1776 he was assigned the status of a city. </p><p>  Legend has it that in the middle of the year before last, M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin visited this region and talked with local officials, after which several new topical works about arranging office work in Russia arose. </p><p>  Currently, Red Hill (Tver region) is the administrative center of the district.  It is located at a distance of about 175 kilometers north of Tver.  Within the city, the Neledina River flows, belonging to the Volga basin, which originates in the Tver region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="red hill tver region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1299508.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  By rail from Red Hill you can get to St. Petersburg through Savelovo to Moscow, also to Kalyazin and cities of the Yaroslavl region, such as Uglich, Rybinsk.  Road transport connects the city of Red Hill (Tver region) with Bezhetsk, Sonkovo ‚Äã‚Äãand other settlements of the region.  In the city, minibuses mainly travel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  Initially, the village of Spas-na-Kholmu was formed on the site of the modern city.  According to legend, Empress Catherine the Great visited these places and was pleasantly surprised by the magnificent picture that opened up to her - this area impressed with the splendor of summer colors and flowers.  It is worth noting that at that time this territory was literally a single green space.  She commanded that the city be called ‚Äúred,‚Äù which means beautiful.  Since then, in all documents and books of that time the name "Red Hill" has gone.  At the same time, the emblem of the city was approved - on a blue background a red hill, on top of which the crown adorns. </p><p>  Gradually, the village of Red Hill (Tver region) grew.  When it received the status of a city, it was made the center of the county of the same name in the Tver province.  A little later, Red Hill turned into a city, at first Vesyegonsky, and later Bezhetsky district.  After the formation of the Moscow region, it became its regional center.  And from 1935 to this day it is the administrative-territorial unit of the Tver region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Red Hill, Tver Region" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1299510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  The activity of peasants who lived at different times in the city was characteristic of the region as a whole - the production of linen, leather shoes, and also farming. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since the beginning of the XXI century, the number of inhabitants of the city of Red Hill (Tver region) has decreased by more than two thousand people.  This is due to the departure of the population to larger centers, especially young people dispersed rapidly.  There are no higher educational institutions in the city, the entertainment infrastructure is poorly developed, and the distance from the main transport routes makes it impossible for people to move freely and quickly to large settlements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãred hill tver region" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1299509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Red Hill, several architectural and historical monuments have been preserved. <br>  The Krasnokholmsky St. Nicholas Antoniev Monastery was founded in the 13th century - a typical example of white-stone architecture was seriously damaged during the October Revolution.  Only a part of the buildings has survived, which, like many other places of worship in the era of socialism, were used for social needs.  Despite the fact that the monastery is currently a monument protected by the state, it is still in a deplorable state. </p><p>  The architecture of the city of Red Hill (Tver region), in particular civil buildings, are typical of small towns in central Russia.
