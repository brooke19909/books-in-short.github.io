Agree that this is a good way to generate passive income.  Almost every one of us has ever thought or is thinking about investing our money in a bank. </p><p>  Why is this investment method chosen by many people?  The answer is extremely simple.  Firstly, quick income.  Secondly, ease of action.  No special knowledge is needed here.  It is enough to study the rating of banks on interest on deposits and choose the best option for yourself. </p><h2>  What is called a bank deposit? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehindu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bag of dollar bills" class="if uuid-2254102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2254102.jpg"></div><p>  A deposit is money transferred to a bank for storage at a certain percentage.  After a certain time, funds are returned in a larger volume.  It depends on the interest rate and the money you invested. </p><p>  Bank deposits are regarded by the state as entrepreneurship, respectively, you need to pay tax. </p><p>  All banks need investors, therefore, interest-bearing deposits are constantly changing, more sophisticated ways of attracting customers are being invented, and the rating of banks on interest on deposits is changing.  It is important to remember that banks will definitely not make offers that may be to their detriment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What you need to know when choosing a contribution program? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="investobox.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank inscription" class="if uuid-2256752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2256752.jpg"></div><p>  There are many different ratings of banks on interest on deposits, and we will talk about them in the next part of the article.  All money in the framework of the programs is protected by law, but still asking questions to banks about the amounts received is pointless. </p><p>  Before you invest your money, you must definitely study all the conditions.  First, he may have a floating rate.  Secondly, the program may have various additional conditions. </p><p>  Often banks arrange seasonal promotions.  For example, New Year.  Credit organizations offer to invest with higher interest rates and just at that time it is most worth looking at the rating of banks on interest on deposits. </p><h2>  Five rules when placing a bank deposit </h2><p>  Many people do not understand investment investments at all, therefore, before you give your money, you need to carefully study everything, and five golden rules will help you with this.  Be sure to read them. </p><h2>  Rule 1. Money should not be in one institution </h2><p>  Many decide to invest a large amount in one organization.  Do not do this if you are not completely sure of the institution.  As you know, an insurance agency in case of something does not pay you more than 1.4 million.  No matter how many deposits you have at the bank.  The total amount for them will not exceed this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rule 2. Duration </h2><p>  In this case, you should think carefully.  Each credit institution has a calculator on its website.  All financial organizations focus on the term of deposit placement.  If you are confident in the bank, then you can invest for a long period, but if it exists not so long ago, then you can place funds for a short time. </p><h2>  Rule 3. Withdrawal of Amount Received </h2><p>  Many investors are attracted by significant interest rates with minimal investment amounts.  Usually, such deposits are not replenished, but sometimes interest can be withdrawn. </p><p>  In fact, the money is almost dead, because in case of closing the deposit ahead of schedule, you will have a fine and interest will have to be returned. </p><h2>  Rule 4. Capitalization </h2><p>  Not many investors pay attention to this, but it is worth it.  After all, the more capitalization occurs, the more money you will receive.  Simply put, capitalization is the calculation of interest on interest. </p><h2>  Rule 5. Deposit replenishment </h2><p>  This is a nice plus.  You can supplement your contribution with funds at any time and get more.  Of course, interest rates with such conditions are usually lower, but for many it is very convenient. </p><p>  Below we will tell you about which banks have the highest interest rate. </p><h2>  What are the contributions? </h2><p>  There are a lot of deposits in banks and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Nevertheless, there is a single classification of deposits. </p><ol><li>  Demand - depends on the term of the deposit. </li><li>  Replenishable or non-replenishable contribution.  Everything is very clear here. </li><li>  Currency.  Deposits can be put not only in rubles, but also in dollars and euros. </li></ol><p>  Difference of demand deposits from term deposits in its term.  A term deposit is usually from one month to several years, and there is no term on demand.  That is, a person can pick up funds when he needs them. </p><p>  As for the currency, in domestic banks there is a choice.  But interest on foreign currency is much lower, although it is much more stable and this has its advantages.  The first thing to consider is the rating of banks on deposits at interest. </p><h2>  Rating of banks on deposits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vistanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best banks of Russia" class="if uuid-2254110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2254110.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Absolute Champion Plus <span>deposit at Baltinvestbank</span> commercial <span>bank.</span>  Maximum rate - 8.5 percent.
