In addition, it is known as the oldest balneological resort in Russia, as well as the place where M.Yu. served and died.  Lermontov. </p><p>  Due to its numerous mud deposits and mineral springs located on a relatively small area, Pyatigorsk in the Stavropol Territory of Russia can well compete with the leading resorts in Germany and the Czech Republic.  But these places are good not only for healing.  Arriving in Pyatigorsk, outdoor enthusiasts can find many interesting new routes for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="church in Pyatigorsk" class="if uuid-2928329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2928329.jpg"></div><p>  The picturesque city located in the North Caucasus, spread out on the slopes of Mount Mashuk and drowning in picturesque groves, is happy to receive its guests, regardless of their social status and nationality.  After all, all of its natural resources in the form of clean mountain air, mineral water and therapeutic Tambukan silt Pyatigorsk allows people to get free of charge. </p><h2>  History from ancient times </h2><p>  Pyatigorsk people settled for a very long time.  This is evidenced by household items and tools found in these places by archaeologists.  The first written mention of Bish-dag (five mountains) with its hot spring was left by Ibn Battut.  This famous Arab traveler mentioned these places, describing his travels in 1334. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mid 16th century  information about the Pyatigors created by Russian chroniclers is dated.  In these papers, it is reported that this is the area in which the Circassians live. </p><p>  In 1773, the Russian scientist Guldenstedt briefly described the Hot Mountain, which is the southern spur of Mashuk.  The researcher pointed out the existence of a hot sulfur spring that flows down to the <span>Podkumok river.</span>  In those years, this area was ruled by the Turks.  But after the adoption in 1774 of the Kyuchuk-Kaynardzhsky treatise, Pyatigorye became part of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  The history of Pyatigorsk began in the 18th century.  It was then that a point appeared in this area, part of the Azov-Mozdok fortified line, created according to the order of Catherine II to protect the southern borders of Russia. </p><p>  In 1780, a fortress was built near the Beshtovy Mountains to strengthen this point.  She was named Konstantinogorsk in honor of the grandson of the sovereign.  Not far from this fortress, the village of Hot Waters arose, to the healing springs of which visitors began to gather.  It is 1780 that is considered the date when the city of Pyatigorsk was founded. </p><h2>  Birth of the resort </h2><p>  In 1803, Alexander I published a rescript that attached particular importance to this area.  This document changed the fate of the city, making it a resort. </p><p>  Throughout the entire history of this region, scientists have repeatedly been convinced that in terms of their diversity, wealth, value and quantity of mineral waters Pyatigorsk has no equal in the whole world. </p><p>  Some innovations were introduced by the General Manager of Georgia and the Caucasus, General A.P.  Ermolov in 1819. By his order in the Hot Waters the baths were rebuilt, and a platform appeared on one of the ledges of Mashuk.  A new building for the adoption of water procedures, which was called "Ermolovsky", also grew.  In addition, the general, with the participation of the Petersburg Construction Committee, planned the whole area, creating residential quarters in it.  In a new settlement, residents of various cities located in the Caucasian province were invited to move in.  For this, people were offered some benefits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, one of the parts of the future Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Territory) and the streets that still exist in the city were formed.  Their current names are Bukhachidze, Anisimova, Krasnoarmeysk, K. Marx Avenue and them.  Kirov.  Soon the first residential buildings appeared in these quarters, and since 1823, construction in the city began to be carried out most actively.  So, a hotel with a restaurant, Soldier‚Äôs, wooden Sabaneev‚Äôs baths, etc. were erected in it.  In addition, the boulevard was planned, mineral water sources were arranged, the Elizavetinsky, Emanuelevsky and Kazenny gardens, as well as the Nikolaev flower garden were laid out.  In the city there was a gazebo called "Aeolian Harp", Lermontov's Grotto and Elizabeth Gallery. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The project of the future city was drawn up in 1828 by Giuseppe Bernardazzi.  In 1830, it was approved by the Committee of Ministers of Russia.  At the same time, it was proposed that General Emanuel call the city of Pyatigorsk, as well as the mountain at the foot of which it was located.  February 18, 1830 this settlement appeared on the map of Russia. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Where is the <span>mountains.</span>  <span>Pyatigorsk?</span>  In the Stavropol Territory on the territory of the same name hill, not far from the southwestern slope of Mashuk.  In the vicinity of the resort two shallow, but at the same time turbulent streams flow - Podkumok and Kuma.  They have a rather picturesque appearance, but are not able to satisfy the needs of Pyatigorsk in drinking water.  Here, and at all, despite numerous sources, there is a shortage of life-giving moisture.  And this is one of the main problems of the administration of the city of Pyatigorsk in the Stavropol Territory.  Today, Kuban helps to compensate for this deficit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the vicinity of the resort are natural ponds.  These are the Lysogorsk and <span>Tambukan lakes,</span> which have impressive deposits of healing mud.  But it is worth noting that their water has a bitter-salty taste and a specific smell.  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, this fact scares away those who decided to swim here.  The only place where residents and guests of Pyatigorsk are given the opportunity to take a nap with a fishing rod or calmly swim is the Novopyatigorsk artificial lake.  It is located in the southwestern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. </p><p>  The highest point of the resort is Mount Beshtau.  Climbing to its observation deck, you can admire the excellent panorama.  It offers a view of all the resort towns of KavMinvod, as well as the Main Range of the Caucasus.  Amazing views can also be observed by those who climb Mount Mashuk, which is practically located within the city limits, sheltering mineral water pump-rooms, parks and local sanatoriums on their slopes. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, Pyatigorsk will surely appeal to those who love shady places.  After all, the slopes of Mashuk are covered with linden and oak forests, cozy birch groves, as well as thickets of hawthorn.  All these massifs are located in the northwest direction from the resort, and then connect to the Beshtaugorsky forest, consisting of hornbeam, beech and ash. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Pyatigorsk is a region of the Stavropol Territory located geographically south of Yalta.  But, despite this, the climate of these places is closer to temperate continental.  Affects this remoteness of the city from the sea. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, in Pyatigorsk there are no sudden changes in temperature.  The summer here is quite warm.  In the hottest month - July, the thermometer rises to an average of +21 degrees.  Winters in Pyatigorsk are mild.  Even in January, the air temperature does not fall below -4 degrees. </p><p>  Warm and dry autumn pleases guests of the city.  The fine days, which last until the end of November, never upset the cloudy sky and off-season dampness. </p><h2>  Wellness factor </h2><p>  At the very beginning of its history, the resort was founded as a place intended for treatment with hot sulfur springs.  It was they who were the first to be discovered in these parts.  Today, the guests of Pyatigorsk are invited to improve immediately with three types of natural springs.  Among them, not only hot, but also warm, as well as cold.  Healing mineral water is produced in Pyatigorsk simultaneously from 23 wells.  Additionally, there are 15 more sources.  However, these wells are in reserve and will be used only if necessary. </p><p>  According to their chemical composition, the waters produced in Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Territory, Russia) are divided into three types.  Among them: </p><ol><li>  Sulfide.  They are mined in the main group of local sources known since ancient times.  Such waters are characterized by high temperature, which reaches +47 degrees.  This health elixir is used, as a rule, for balneological procedures in Lermontov, Pirogov and Yermolov baths. </li><li>  Carbonic.  These mineral springs in Pyatigorsk are used for balneotherapy and for drinking.  The water in them has medium and low carbon dioxide content.  One of the subspecies of this natural healing factor is the Essentuki type.  These are cold carbonate waters.  Before use, they are specially heated right in the pump room. </li><li>  Radon.  Their sources have poor mineralization.  Moreover, in the composition of such waters is a certain amount of radon.  Depending on the source, it ranges from weak to high.  Apply such water only externally, using when taking a shower, baths and during inhalation. </li></ol><p>  Judging by the reviews, in Pyatigorsk, vacationers can drink natural medicine for free in nine pump rooms located on the slopes of Mashuk.  And also in specialized galleries (on Akademicheskaya St. and on Kirov Avenue). </p><p>  In numerous sanatoriums of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Territory), in addition to balneotherapy procedures, which are so traditional for the area, mud therapy is also actively used.  For him, natural material is delivered from Lake Tambukan.  At the same time, mud is used for various applications and wraps.  A small factory has been opened in Pyatigorsk.  Its products are cosmetics, which include Tambukan mud. </p><p>  With the active participation of the Pyatigorsk administration (Stavropol Territory), the improvement of mountain paths located on Mount Mashuk, which are intended for therapeutic walking, is currently supported. </p><h2>  Sanatoriums </h2><p>  Health organizations in Pyatigorsk host vacationers throughout the year.  At the same time, judging by the reviews of guests, sanatoriums and rest houses provide first-class service, creating a unique atmosphere of comfort.  Here are offered: </p><ul><li>  various gynecological procedures; </li><li>  electrotherapy; </li><li>  underwater horizontal and vertical extension of the spine; </li><li>  performing therapeutic exercises in the pool. </li></ul><p>  Pyatigorsk sanatoriums specialize in the treatment of the musculoskeletal system, organs of vision and gastrointestinal tract.  People come here who want to get rid of skin and ENT diseases, as well as those who suffer from diabetes, heart disease and metabolic disorders. </p><h2>  Administrative division </h2><p>  Pyatigorsk located in the Stavropol Territory is territorially divided into seven districts.  Among them: </p><ul><li><p>  Beshtau. </p></li><li><p>  White camomile. </p></li><li><p>  Center. </p></li><li><p>  Horapost. </p></li><li><p>  Novopyatigorsk. </p></li><li><p>  Power Engineer. </p></li><li><p>  Horse racing. </p></li></ul><p>  However, the residents themselves prefer to divide it into lower and upper parts.  The first of them (western) is a typical industrial zone.  On this site you can find only small areas where there is a residential building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãat the foot of the mountain" class="if uuid-2928389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2928389.jpg"></div><p>  The upper part is the famous resort city.  It is here that all the mud and hydropathic facilities, historical sights and sanatoriums are located.  Here are the main residential neighborhoods.  They borrowed their names (‚ÄúFailure‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlower Garden‚Äù) from the karst lake and the park, which are located on their territory. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the biggest excitement reigns in this part of the resort.  But for the removal of housing is best suited White Daisy.  The local streets of this area offer great views, and getting to other places of the resort from here is much easier. </p><p>  Pyatigorsk Index (Stavropol Territory) - 357500. </p><h2>  Interesting places of the resort </h2><p>  There are a lot of attractions in Pyatigorsk (a photo with a description of the most popular of them will be presented below).  Among such objects are not only museums and monuments familiar to many places, but also unusual territories and buildings.  So, in the city of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Territory) at the foot of Mashuk there is a cemetery.  It is sometimes called an open-air museum.  The fact is that in this Pyatigorsk necropolis there are a lot of historical monuments.  These are the graves of statesmen and warriors, scientists and writers.  In addition, the necropolis was the site of the initial burial of Lermontov.  As early as 1916, the cemetery was closed and began to serve only for historical and cultural purposes. </p><p>  Description of the attractions of Pyatigorsk should start with one of its main streets - Kirov Avenue, where the fountain "Tale", which is also called the "Dwarves" or "Grandfathers", is located.  The history of this building began in 1902. However, at that time it looked a bit different.  Yes, and was called the "Giant" because of its jet of water, which rose up to a huge height.  The first version of the fountain did not shine with beauty, because of which they decided to modify it.  So a construction appeared here from a picturesque pile of stones with grottoes, as well as with relief images of fairy-tale gnomes.  Nowadays, the fountain has been equipped with colored lights adorning it at night. </p><p>  Quite a few sights of Pyatigorsk (see the description for a photo below) are located in the oldest park of the city, which is called the Flower Garden.  He was defeated in the 20s of the 18th century.  in place of swamps.  Over the years, the park has grown.  New flowerbeds appeared on its territory, and trees were planted along the alleys.  In addition, a musical rotunda was built in the Flower Garden, a fountain was built and various buildings were erected. </p><p>  During the years of Soviet power, this park was combined with another, located on Mount Goryachaya.  To date, this territory, judging by the reviews, in Pyatigorsk is one of the most beautiful.  That is why the residents of the city and its guests love walking here so much. </p><p>  Right at the entrance to the park is one of the attractions of the city of Pyatigorsk - the Vernissage gallery.  Near her stands a monument to the hero of the immortal novel Ilf and Petrov - Kise Vorobyaninov.  This literary adventurer is depicted as begging.  Vorobyaninov is standing by the large bag, bowing his head and looking longingly at the inverted hat. </p><p>  Not far from the entrance to the park rises the original building.  This building is made of colored glass and openwork metal and decorated with pointed towers.  This architectural miracle is nothing but the Lermontov Gallery.  She was transported to Pyatigorsk at the beginning of the 20th century.  from Nizhny Novgorod, where the building was one of the exhibits of the art-industrial exhibition.  The main purpose of the gallery throughout all these years remains unchanged.  Within its walls is the State Philharmonic, concerts are held and various exhibitions display their exhibits. </p><p>  At the entrance to the gallery you can see the old fountain, which is called "Happy Catch."  For over 100 years, he has been giving vacationers his cool and interesting sculptural composition, presented by a boy holding fish of impressive size over his head. </p><p>  Behind the Lermontov Gallery is the building of the Ermolov baths.  It was built in 1880. Today there is a gynecological balneotherapy center. </p><p>  If you walk along the path to the right of the building of the Ermolov baths, then after 50 m you can see the "Diana's Grotto".  This is a decorative and rather original construction of the first half of the 19th century, which relates to landscape gardening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diana's grotto" class="if uuid-2929257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2929257.jpg"></div><p>  "Diana's Grotto" was erected in honor of the conquest of Elbrus by an expedition led by General Emanuel.  This building was named after the ancient Roman goddess of hunting, who preferred to rest in cool grottoes on hot days. </p><p> The project for a stone gazebo was created by the famous Italian architects brothers Bernardatsi.  On one of the slopes of Mount Goryachaya, a cave was carved, the arch vault of which was supported by prehistoric columns.  A semicircular stone bench was set against the wall of the grotto.  Near it is a table made of the same material.  It is believed that in this grotto Mikhail Lermontov loved to relax.  A week before the deadly duel, the poet even invited here to know, having arranged a magnificent ball for his guests.  At this event, many of the guests saw Lermontov alive for the last time. </p><p>  Not far from the "Diana's Grotto" is another one of the main attractions of Pyatigorsk (see photo below).  This is a sculpture of an eagle, spreading its wings and holding a snake in its claws. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle on top of the mountain" class="if uuid-2928347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2928347.jpg"></div><p>  The bird rises on a pedestal, which is built of stone blocks.  There is a legend that tells that a poisonous snake managed to sting an eagle.  The bird was saved only thanks to the water located in the source of the Goryachaya Mountain.  More than 100 years ago, this folk tradition was reflected in the sculpture.  Moreover, the stone eagle is currently a symbol of both Pyatigorsk and the entire region of the Caucasian mineral waters. </p><p>  Not far from this statue, the gazebo attracts the attention of travelers.  It is located on the top of Goryachaya Mountain and has an original roof architecture that resembles the roof of Buddhist temples.  That is why the arbor is called Chinese.  It was built in 1976. </p><p>  Returning from the Chinese gazebo to Kirov Avenue, you should go almost to its very end and see the Pushkin baths.  This ancient building is made of light brick, has curly masonry and is decorated with bizarre turrets and stucco figures.  It was built more than two centuries ago by General Sabaneyev, who at that time was the owner of this land, and were named in his honor.  In the 1920s, the bathtub was renamed Pushkin. </p><p>  The magnificent Academic Gallery is just a short walk from this building.  This building is popularly called the stone crown of the city.  Externally, the gallery is a light and elegant building.  And this despite the fact that it was built of stone.  With its construction, it resembles a bridge that connects the spurs of Mount Mashuk.  You can see the gallery from any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. </p><p>  Not far from this building is another of the main attractions of Pyatigorsk (photo provided below).  This is Lermontov‚Äôs Grotto, in which the poet spent a lot of time drawing inspiration to create new works. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lermontov Grotto" class="if uuid-2929310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2929310.jpg"></div><p>  Another attraction of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Territory) is the arbor of Eolov Harp.  In those years when these places were developed for the defense of the country, an observation post was located here.  In 1831, a gazebo was built in its place, resting on columns and having a hemispherical dome.  The construction fits perfectly into the mountain landscape.  Over its dome, the Aeolian harp was installed, emitting bewitching sounds at the slightest breeze. </p><div class="photo" data-original="howlingpixel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aeolian harp" class="if uuid-2929235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2929235.jpg"></div><p>  In the vicinity of the resort is another of its main attractions.  This is Proval Lake, in which the water has a bright blue color.  This color is given to it by special bacteria and hydrogen sulfide. </p><p>  The cone-shaped karst cave, in which the lake is located, was first examined in 1793. In the first half of the 19th century.  By order of Prince Golitsyn, a bridge was built over the hole in the cave.  Those who wanted to go down it in a basket in order to enjoy the outlandish pond. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="failure lake" class="if uuid-2929281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2929281.jpg"></div><p>  Today, near the entrance to the cave is a sculpture of Ostap Bender.  Indeed, it was in Pyatigorsk that the action of some chapters of the novel by Ilf and Petrov took place.  In one of them, Bender sold tickets to where tourists can get for free. </p>
