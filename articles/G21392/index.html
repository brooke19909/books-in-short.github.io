    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Previously, the Vinnovsky Grove Park in Ulyanovsk was a territory owned by a landowner named Kindyakov.  At one time, the estate was visited by the famous Russian writer Ivan Goncharov, who in his works sang the natural beauties of this picturesque manor.  It is believed that this particular grove was described by the author in one of his famous literary works, which is called "Cliff". </p><p>  The modern history of the Vinnovsky Grove park in Ulyanovsk began in the Soviet period, in 1966.  Then, a well-known natural monument was created on its territory. </p><h2>  Park Attractions </h2><p>  On the modern territory of the "Vinnovsky grove" (Ulyanovsk) there are several historical sights that attract the attention of tourists.  One of them is red brick crypts.  They were built at the beginning of the 20th century, but under the influence of time they collapsed a little, after which no one restored them.  Also, guests like to relax in the arbor of I. Goncharov, which is memorial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reliable sources indicate that a huge number of plants grow on the territory of the grove - more than 300 varieties.
