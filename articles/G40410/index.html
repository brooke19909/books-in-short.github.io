  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Krasnoyarsk - Abakan: features of a trip along the route</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the cities of Siberia, it is worth noting Krasnoyarsk and Abakan.  The first has a solid size and population, a number of museums and attractions, as well as the famous Pillars.  The second is smaller and quieter, it is a regional center where the national flavor is weakly expressed, it is better not to look for Khakass in the province.  A trip between cities can be organized in different ways, the route is not difficult. </p><h2>  A trip by rail or by air </h2><p>  A convenient night train runs from Krasnoyarsk to Abakan, which leaves at 19:10, takes only 11 hours, it arrives at its destination at 06:25.  The cars in it are not new.  The coupe is likely to be around 1991, the old type, without a dry closet.  In the summer, different promotions may apply, for example, 999 rubles for the top spot. </p><p>  On the way back, the train has a similar schedule, leaves at 19:00, and arrives in Krasnoyarsk at 06:40. </p><p>  Estimated prices: reserved seat is from 1200, and coupe - from 1800 rubles. </p><p>  Airplanes from Krasnoyarsk to Abakan run not every day, but on Wednesdays and Fridays.  Flights are operated by KrasAvia.  The liner departs from Emelyanovo at 15:10 and lands at 16:25, leaving 1 hour and 15 minutes in total.  The aircraft on this flight are small, twin-engine Let-410. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foto-planeta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-3118610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3118610.jpg"></div><h2>  Highway Drive </h2><p>  From Krasnoyarsk to Abakan, buses leave from Yemelyanovo airport (they go to Kyzyl or Minusinsk) and from the bus station.  There are many flights, they are made from 06:30 in the morning until one in the morning.  The trip takes 6-7 hours, there are several short stops along the way (Prigorsk, Chernogorsk and other settlements).  Ticket prices start at 900 rubles.  Return flights of the Abakan - Krasnoyarsk bus leave at 8 in the morning and run until midnight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those traveling by car, the following information will be helpful.  On the P-257 highway from Krasnoyarsk to Abakan, the distance is about 400 kilometers.  Estimated travel time is approximately four hours.  You need to leave through the Sverdlovsk district of Krasnoyarsk and from there through Divnogorsk follow to Khakassia.  Most of the way in this republic passes through sparsely populated areas to the west of the banks of the Yenisei. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.top10.cx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yenisei River" class="if uuid-3118617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3118617.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  You can move around Krasnoyarsk not only by bus and trolleybus, but also by tram, which travels through the industrial area on the east bank of the Yenisei. </p><p>  The most famous attraction of this region can be considered the Pillars Nature Reserve, adjacent to the city from the northeast.  To the west of Pillars is Divnogorsk and Ust-Mana, where you can stop looking at the wonderful view of the Yenisei.  It is better to get to them by cheap commuter train (19 rubles), and not by expensive bus (99 rubles). </p><p>  In the historical part of the city, several interesting objects are worth visiting: </p><ol><li>  Bridge and chapel with a 10-ruble note. </li><li>  The Museum of Local Lore, one of the largest in the Asian part of the country, the building was built in the Egyptian style. </li><li>  The children's railway in TsKPiO, it is small, but has been operating continuously for 80 years. </li><li>  Railway Museum.  Interesting exposition and cheap tickets. </li><li>  The literary museum in a beautiful wooden building and the whole museum complex dedicated to the writer Astafyev. </li><li>  The architecture of the 1950s, the Stalinist empire, for example, the building of the medical academy and residential buildings in the Leninsky district. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxpixel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillars in winter" class="if uuid-3118801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3118801.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Sights of Abakan</span> and surroundings </h2><p>  Abakan looks noticeably simpler.  Right at the station, you should visit the railway exhibition and from there go to the republican museum, where an exhibition on the theme of Khakass culture is presented. </p><p>  There is Samokhval park in the southern part of the city, and Preobrazhensky park in the northern part.  All interesting objects can really be seen in one summer day, if you move quickly. </p><p>  From Abakan it is worth organizing a trip to Minusinsk.  In this ancient city there are several museums (Local Lore, Decembrists, Retro cars) and beautiful examples of pre-revolutionary architecture. </p><p>  The provincial Khakassia is interesting for its nature: mounds, scribbles, mountains, lakes, including bitterly salty. </p>
