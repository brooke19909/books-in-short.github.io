Unfortunately, it happens that a person who decides to take the next series of shots is surprised to see that he was unable to connect to the camera.  What to do in this case, why such errors occur? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unable to connect to camera" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1163737.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The main problems that arise during the operation of the camera </h2><p>  The telephone camera can be safely classified as the most vulnerable and fragile elements of the device.  Therefore, any inadvertent movement of the user may result in the message ‚Äúunable to connect to the camera‚Äù appears on the display.  Most owners of modern smartphones must have encountered a problem in which a working camera suddenly starts to produce blurry pictures, which clearly show all kinds of defects in the form of incomprehensible stripes or spots.  Sometimes the phone responds with an ‚Äúapplication unavailable‚Äù message to attempts to activate the camera. </p><p>  Among the most common problems that owners of mobile phones had to deal with can be attributed to the fact that when you try to turn off a stably working camera, the phone itself also turns off or ‚Äúhangs‚Äù.  In addition, often attempts to take several photos end up completely blocking the application or the appearance of a black screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="failed to connect to camera" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1163800.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Most common causes </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the search for a solution to the problem, you need to figure out why it was not possible to connect to the camera.  The first and most common reason is updating the firmware.  This procedure automatically leads to the failure of the most important phone settings, which explains the incorrect operation of the camera.  The second no less popular reason is considered "infection" by viruses.  Very often, a phone on which an antivirus program is not installed writes ‚Äúcould not connect to the camera‚Äù.  In this case, you need to ‚Äúclean‚Äù it and be sure to download a reliable antivirus. </p><p>  Mechanical damage to the gadget can also lead to incorrect camera operation.  Due to the accidental fall of the smartphone, the module responsible for the operation of the camera may be damaged.  Most manufacturers place such modules on the outside of the instrument.  As a result of dust and dirt, the option may malfunction. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="writes failed to connect to camera" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1163747.jpg" width="440"></div></h2><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  Once you‚Äôre unable to connect to the camera, <strong> </strong>  don't despair.  It is possible that a solution to this problem will not require a visit to a service center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, you can try to reset all phone settings to factory settings.  To perform this operation, it is recommended to open the gadget settings and, having found the ‚Äúbackup‚Äù tab there, activate the ‚Äúreset to factory settings‚Äù function.  In most cases, these manipulations can <span>solve the problem,</span> due to which the user is unable to connect to the camera. <strong> </strong></p><p>  If this does not help, then it is possible that a virus has entered the system that interferes with the full operation of the device.  To get rid of it, you need to download an antivirus program and clean the phone. </p><p>  If you still cannot connect to the camera, <strong> </strong>  It is recommended to clean the module cache and thoroughly wipe the on-camera lens with a cloth moistened with a special solution. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="failed to connect to camera what to do" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1163754.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Recommendations of specialists </h2><p>  Having realized that the camera does not function as expected, you must try to restart the phone and activate the application again.  Before carrying the phone for repair, you should make sure that among the programs installed on it there are no ones that conflict with the camera.  If there are any, then they must be replaced with others that will not interfere with the correct operation of the application.  Some phone models do not allow the simultaneous use of the camera and playback of audio or video files.  Such actions may result in device overload.  Before you enable the application for working with the camera, you must disable other software.  If it is impossible to connect to the camera, you can try to recharge the phone. </p><h2>  How to prevent the appearance of such problems? </h2><p>  In order for your phone to work properly and never display the message ‚Äúfailed to connect to the camera‚Äù, you must follow the basic recommendations for the correct operation of the device.  First of all, you must not allow the slightest mechanical impact that could lead to damage to the fragile glass of the camera.  In order to avoid scratches, it is recommended to protect the gadget from getting small abrasive particles on its surface.  The shutter of an unused camera must be in a closed state.  Use only soft wipes to wipe the camera.  It is equally important to protect your phone from moisture.  The ingress of water is fraught with the formation of microcorrosion, which can damage not only the camera, but also the phone itself. </p>
