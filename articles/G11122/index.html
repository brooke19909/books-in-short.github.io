    <p>  In order to lower the lending rate, many people decide to go to another bank and get refinancing of an existing loan.  It can also save significant money.  Also, many are interested in banks with refinancing loans without proof of income.  Are there any such?  How is the re-lending process? </p><h2>  General scheme </h2><p>  The principle of refinancing is quite simple.  By and large, the client simply draws up a new consumer loan, thanks to which the old loan is repaid automatically.  This procedure is possible in the same financial institution in which the initial loan was issued, or in another bank.  However, taking the same amount of money is not always possible. </p><p>  In situations where the volume of a new loan exceeds the necessary amount to repay the old loan, the remaining part of the funds can be used by the client at his discretion.  By and large, in this procedure there is absolutely nothing complicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even under the condition that the loan was issued taking into account the use of collateral, collateral or in the presence of a principal, in any case it is possible to refinance.  The only problems that may arise are those with bad debt history or those who want to refinance loans from other banks without proof of income.  However, even in this case, not everything is lost. </p>

    <h2>  Why do I need a loan </h2><p>  Many are interested in why refinancing is generally necessary.  There are several reasons for this.  First of all, thanks to financing, it becomes possible to partially reduce the interest rate on the payment of the primary loan.  In addition, thanks to this procedure, the period that is provided to the borrower to repay the debt is significantly increased. </p><p>  However, before you begin to draw up such documents, you need to learn more about all the nuances of such a banking service. </p><h2>  The principle of refinancing loans without reference </h2><p>  Re-lending is the process of issuing credit funds to pay off previous debt.  This type of loan is considered targeted, accordingly, the client must definitely indicate exactly what the finances will go to. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about refinancing a loan without income, then this can be done, but not in all institutions.  Today you can find organizations in which customers are more loyal.  However, this does not mean that a citizen may even be unemployed. </p><p>  When it comes to refinancing a loan without proof of income, it means that the client simply does not have to provide a certificate in the form of 2-NDFL or any other documents that will confirm its permanent income. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, in most credit organizations, the fact of employment of the borrower will be checked in any case.  No additional papers are needed for this, just indicate the work phone number.  After that, a bank employee will call the organization and check with the employer if this or that person is officially registered with him.  However, no one will, and does not have the right to specify the amount of wages. </p><h2>  Requirements for refinancing a loan without income statement </h2><p>  In this case, the standard terms of most banks apply.  First of all, only a citizen of the Russian Federation at least 21 years old can apply for re-lending.  Moreover, he must be employed for a period of at least six months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is also worth considering that when considering an application, the bank manager will definitely clarify the credit history of a potential client.  If at any time he failed to repay the loan debt in time or refused to pay it at all, then in this case you will not have to rely on refinancing.  In such a situation, no bank will provide funds.  The only option in this case is to contact the microloan service. </p><h2>  What documents need to be provided </h2><p>  First of all, the borrower must bring his internal passport of the Russian Federation.  If a financial institution has such a requirement, then it must also prepare a statement of income for a period of 3 to 6 months. </p><p>  In addition, most serious banks require a copy of the work book.  It is also necessary to bring along a loan agreement with a description of the previous loan, for which the client wants to invest money.  Inquiries from banks will also be required, where relevant information will be indicated, that is, the amount of the loan issued, the balance of payments, debts, interest rates and other information.  In addition, details are required for which the funds received will be transferred. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the particular bank, this list of documents may be revised.  As mentioned earlier, in some organizations it is possible to obtain refinancing of a loan without proof of income.  It is worth saying that if a citizen cannot provide 2-personal income tax or confirm his place of work, or if he simply does not want his boss to be called, then he can check with a financial institution if it is possible to get a loan on bail.  In this case, he can confirm his solvency by laying his own car, housing or other values. </p><h2>  Does it make sense to agree to refinance a consumer loan without a fixed income </h2><p>  First of all, if a citizen does not have a permanent job or his salary does not exceed the subsistence level, then he should think about whether he can repay a new loan.  If, for one reason or another, the client cannot make monthly payments as specified in the contract, then in this case he may have problems not with one credit institution, but two at once.  It‚Äôs worth thinking again. </p><p>  If the funds were taken from a microcredit company, then in this case problems appear very quickly.  Ultimately, by a judicial decision, a financial institution even has the right to sell a client‚Äôs property through bailiffs.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to carefully study all the conditions of a potential transaction, contract and other documents before giving final consent.  Be sure to pay attention to the size of interest rates not only on the current loan, but also on a new loan. </p>

    <p>  Also, in some financial institutions, there are commissions for issuing and repaying a loan.  In most banks, borrower life and health insurance is mandatory.  If he refuses this procedure, the interest rate on the loan will increase.  In addition, it is worth paying attention to the possibility of early repayment of debt.  The fact is that, according to the law, banks are not entitled to establish moratoria on this operation.  However, most organizations force their customers to warn of such intentions no later than 30 days in advance. </p><h2>  Refinancing Stages </h2><p>  If a client who does not want to present income statements has full confidence that he will be able to pay off the debt, then we can proceed to direct processing of the newest loan.  This procedure takes place in several stages. </p><p>  First, the borrower prepares all the necessary documents, fills out the questionnaire and brings the paper to the bank branch.  An employee of a financial institution checks them and sends the application to the head office for consideration.  If the answer is yes, then the client comes back to the bank and signs a new loan agreement.  He also studies a new debt payment schedule and confirms his willingness to cooperate.  At the next stage, money is transferred to the details of the bank provided by the client, in which the loan was already taken. </p>

    <p>  Due to this, there is a full repayment of debt in another financial institution. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to those companies in which you can arrange refinancing of a loan without collateral or income statements. </p><h2>  MTS Bank </h2><p>  In this financial organization it is possible to apply for on-lending to those who are already clients of this bank.  In this case, no collateral is required from the citizens of the Russian Federation, and insurance is at the request of the client himself.  The most important advantage is that you do not need to provide any help.  Applications are considered within 3 days.  Moreover, the loan term can be 60 months, and the loan amount - 3 million rubles.  The interest rate on overpayment in this case will be 11.9%. </p><p>  Also, when refinancing a loan without proof of income, you can slightly reduce the overpayment - by 1.2%.  This becomes possible if the client is ready to join the financial protection program. </p>

    <h2>  Bank of Russia </h2><p>  In this financial organization, you can also arrange refinancing of loans without references and guarantors.

The loan amount can be up to 3 million rubles.  The interest rate will be 12%. </p><h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  The program from this financial institution is quite interesting.

A sum of money from 50 thousand rubles to 1 million can be obtained if you register your personal car as collateral.  The interest rate on overpayment will be 17%, and the loan term - from 1 year to 5 years.  However, at the same time, customers must work in one place for at least 4 months. </p>
