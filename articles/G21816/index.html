To be honest, sometimes it seems that the developers of the corresponding company always have at their disposal, say, in the bosom, a few more trump cards.  Yes, and we will not hide, the company's marketers have the same feature.  They know for sure how to properly present a new product to a wide audience of amateur users of the Lumiya series. </p><h2>  Market promotion </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, each time Nokia‚Äôs marketers use weapons unknown to us, which allows us to achieve almost the maximum effect from sales of smartphones of the corresponding model range.  The Windows mobile platform for handheld devices is slowly but inexorably spreading across the globe.  There are all reasons for this, and we cannot fail to note this in fairness. </p><p>  Not so long ago, the company was able to master a new series of devices with a screen diagonal of 5 inches.  Solely to complement the picture, we give a specific example of such a device.  You can even call it debut in the series.  This is ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 535‚Äù.  Again, if we look at the official data, sales were in full swing.  The device was not just in demand.  Many experts argued that the model was an excellent offer, taking place in the budget segment.  Nevertheless, the screen resolution for such a diagonal (and it was 960 by 540 pixels) did not correspond to the declared level.  That is why the company clearly saw the prospects that loomed on the horizon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Outline about the device </h2>

    <p>  The Microsoft Lumia 540 telephone, reviews of which the reader can read in this article, has become a logical continuation of the line.  The company's engineers wanted to make the screen even better, but they, unfortunately, did not succeed.  More specifically, the wrong choice of matrix should be noted.  Many experts, after testing the new product, agreed that it was better with the same 535th model. </p><p>  However, a tangible advantage (it can even be called competitive) was the HD-resolution of the screen.  Interestingly, the ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 640‚Äù and the <span>Lumia 540</span> cost the same after they were launched.  This is a rather rare phenomenon, and this time it is connected with the economic situation.  Nevertheless, in the latest model, the materials of which the body is made are much cheaper.  It should be noted and less powerful processor.  Performance is worse, and that's a fact.  Reduced battery life.  Retailers refused sales of Nokia Lumiya 540.  It can be purchased only in company stores. </p><p>  To be honest, there was no practical sense in acquiring Lumiya 540, no, and most likely will not.  It is better to take the corresponding analogue, which has already been mentioned above.  The fate of the object of our review today will probably be, you might say, unenviable.  In the opinion of many experts who know a lot about smartphones, only a reduction in its value can save the situation with the device.  Otherwise, no exits have yet been noticed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2>

    <p>  He is rather modest.  After buying a phone, you can find in the box only the device itself, as well as the accessories vital for it.  We are talking about a lithium-ion battery (capacity of 2,200 mAh), as well as a charger.  Of course, the owner of the device will be able to find the instruction manual in the package. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions of the device are quite averaged for a model with an appropriate screen size.  In all three planes they are 144 by 73.7 by 8.6 millimeters.  In this case, the mass of the smartphone is only 152 grams. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  The phone fits very well in the palm of your hand.  Even from wet hands, he is unlikely to fall out.  Therefore, there are no complaints to the device.  There are no restrictions on wearing.  The device will hide perfectly in all pockets without exception. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 540‚Äù.

    <p>  ‚ÄúIs it worth taking?‚Äù  - This question is of interest to many people who stare at the appropriate model.  And their doubt in this regard is fully supported by practical reasons.

    <p>  In general, the device was released on the smartphone market in several colors.  More specifically, in orange, blue, white and black.  But only the latest version can be found on the territory of the Russian Federation.  This is a matte coloring.  Perhaps this is done because black is the most non-winning look.  In other words, so that the 640th and 540th models do not compete with each other. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  The Microsoft Lumia 540 smartphone, reviews of which you can read in this article, has a built-in 3.5 mm standard connector.  It is designed to connect a wired stereo headset to the device. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here we have the most ordinary MicroUSB connector.  It is used to synchronize the device with a personal computer or laptop. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  On the right side is the volume rocker.  It must be used to increase or decrease the sound on the phone, as well as put it into silent or loud mode.  The power button of the device also settled down here. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  There is a speaker.  Nearby there is a main camera lens and LED flash. </p><h2>  Disassembling the device </h2><p>  Opening the phone will not be so difficult.  The case is pulled out quite simply.  There is a feeling that this is nothing more than a cover.  In general, such a design is very, very reliable.  Her company has already tested on a large number of individual models.  If you remove the back cover, then under it you can find a removable battery and connectors designed for installing a SIM card and memory drive.  Important: the slot is designed for MicroSIM cards. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  At first, the phone is happy in this regard.  However, then cracks appear on the faces.  Not so much time will pass when the body starts to stagger to the sides.  The lid in the groove will go worse and worse.  If you encounter such a problem, check the location of the battery.  It is possible that it is he who prevents the lid from slamming shut.  Although it is possible that this is not the case.  Interestingly, in fact, the battery moves away from the contact, squeezing the cover.  But at the same time, the phone continues to function successfully. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 540‚Äù.  Reviews  Is it worth taking? </h2><p>  The time has come to summarize the article and give the general feedback from the owners.  More precisely, their notes on the advantages and disadvantages of the model. </p><p>  The positive aspects include the sound quality in the device.  In general, many models of the Finnish mobile company have good speakers.  And not only making ‚Äúclear‚Äù sounds, but also making it quite loudly.  But as for vibration with an incoming voice call, then the engineers did not finalize it.  Not to notice - as easy as shelling pears. </p><p>  The 540th model has no more special advantages.  With its price, much more could have been expected.  As mentioned earlier, there is no practical sense in acquiring this smartphone.  The resolution of the front camera may make some adjustments, but they are so meager that they simply prefer not to notice them.  It is unlikely because of this that someone will make their choice in favor of the model. </p>
