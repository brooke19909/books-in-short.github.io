    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Mentally transported to those times ... The final victory over the Nazis is just around the corner, and on May 5, 1945, General Khrulev gave the task - for several days, sketches of the award for the victory over Germany should be prepared.  The task was very urgent, and more than one artist was involved in the work.  Among the creators of the sketches are the following names: I.A.  Ganfa, Kiselev, G.B.  Barkhin, but the victory was won by the project of artists Andrianova and Romanov. </p>

    <p>  The presentation was carried out by the commanders of the units to those who were in the military units, and the city and district military commissars at the place of residence of the awarded were handed over to the departed persons. </p><h2>  <strong>How much is a reward for winning</strong> </h2><p>  The moral component of the sale of orders makes us think about human conscience.  People who dare to sell merits to the fatherland of their fathers and grandfathers, decide to take this step for a reason.  Someone really needs money, someone sells regalia without hesitation, but it's worth considering.  The order "For victory over Germany" today can be sold somewhere for 1000 rubles, but remember, at what price did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers get them, do we have the right to trade in the memory of the victory that came from blood? </p>

    <p>  The average market price for a medal is from 1,000 to 3,000 rubles, depending on its options.  For collectors, the price may be higher; today there are special auction sites.  Each medal has an identification number, it can be used to find the owner, if you want to do a good deed and return it to the hands of the person to whom it was assigned.  In this case, the medal must be referred to law enforcement.  If there is no number, you can take the medal to the museum.  The order "For victory over Germany", whose price today is about $ 100, may increase ten-twenty years from now, such things will never depreciate, because the date of victory over fascism can never be erased from Russian history. </p><h2>  Responsibility for trading orders </h2><p>  If the medal does not belong to its owner by right, it is possible that it was once stolen, then in fact it is wanted, and any attempts to sell it can bring the seller to criminal liability.  <span>The Stalin Order</span> "For Victory over Germany", as well as other awards can now be found at many online auctions, both domestic and foreign. </p>
