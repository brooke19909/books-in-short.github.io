    <h2>  City name history </h2><p>  In the place where today Evpatoria (‚ÄúLittle Jerusalem‚Äù) is located, in ancient times there was a Greek settlement called Kerkinitida.  After its destruction for many centuries, there were no settlements in this territory. </p><p>  Only during the time of the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> was the city revived here, to which the Tatars gave the name Kezlev (Gezlev), and the Russians began to call it Kozlov.  When Crimea became part of the Russian Empire (1784), the city was renamed due to the inconsistency of the name.  Thus appeared Evpatoria (translated from Greek - "noble", "born of a noble father"). </p><h2>  Little Jerusalem </h2><p>  For many years, for many citizens of the former Soviet Union, Evpatoria has been and remains a favorite vacation spot.  "Little Jerusalem" is a restored and restored part, or rather the Old City (Kezlev), located on its territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the pedestrian tourist route, combining twelve magnificent monuments of history and architecture, is also named.  Some of the buildings of the Old Town, which has a layout typical for eastern cities, in which small winding streets are intertwined, have a very advanced age (more than five centuries). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yevpatoriya small jerusalem address" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360201.jpg" width="574"></div>

    <h2>  From the history of Kezlev </h2><p>  In this ancient city lived Cimmerians, Greeks, Taurus.  The Greeks called it Kerkinitida, and the Turks renamed it Kezlev.  In the XVI century, it became a large fortified city (trade).  Ships from Asia Minor came to the harbor, Russian merchants called in.  Since 1784, Kezlev became a county town as part of Russia. </p><h2>  Kezlevsky gate </h2><p>  One could get into the <span>medieval city</span> only through the fortress gates.  There were five of them, but only one survived to this day, which are today called Kezlevsky.  They were also destroyed in 1959, but in 2004, thanks to the efforts and means of patrons, they were restored to their original form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yevpatoriya small jerusalem address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360207.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cloister of dervishes </h2><p>  It is impossible not to say that Evpatoria (‚ÄúLittle Jerusalem‚Äù), the photo of which you can see in this article, amazes with its magnificent buildings.  This fully applies to the ancient monastery of Muslim wandering Dervish monks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yevpatoriya small jerusalem how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  They did not recognize luxury and wealth and were ascetics.  This unique architectural monument became one of the first places of worship in the Crimea.  The Muslim monastery is a Sufi movement in Islam.  It arose in about 800 AD.  e.  after the desire for wealth has increased in high society. </p><p>  Dervishes are Muslim monks.  They were wandering, or living in the cloisters under the guidance of the Sheikh.  The dervishes who lived in the cloisters often wandered around, ate alms, but regularly returned for prayers and fasts. </p><p>  Prayers took place in the prayer hall of the monastery in the evenings, accompanied by the sounds of a pipe and drums.  The dervishes circled and performed suras from the Koran.  Gradually, they began to move faster and soon fell into a trance, completely renouncing the world. </p><h2>  Keraim kenases </h2><p>  Today, for many tourists from our country, Evpatoria (‚ÄúLittle Jerusalem‚Äù) is not just a resort city, it is an opportunity to get acquainted with the history of the endangered ethnic groups of Crimea. </p><p>  The word ‚Äúkenasa‚Äù can be literally translated as ‚Äúassembly‚Äù.

Today there are less than two thousand people.  And, unfortunately, the process of the disappearance of this nation is irreversible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evpatoria Small Jerusalem" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360199.jpg" width="600"></div>
