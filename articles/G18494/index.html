    <p>  Non-current tangible assets are the monetary value of the property and liabilities of the organization.  All of them are fully or partially used in the process of creating products and transfer their value to the finished product. </p><p>  The materialization coefficient shows the degree of security of the OS organization: <br><br>  Kma = AI / A, where <br>  AI - the cost of MNA (low-value fixed assets) in the balance sheet; <br>  A - balance sheet total. <br><br>  The property of the organization is characterized by such parameters: <br><br>  1. The purpose of the acquisition. <br>  2. Duration of use. <br>  3. The form of assets. <br><br>  Its volume is affected by: </p><ul><li>  external factors: the situation in the country, market conditions, inflation, the level of state regulation of the economy, the legislative framework, the availability of loans; </li><li>  internal factors: commodity circulation, supply conditions, organization of work. </li></ul><p>  NMA: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Satisfy the enterprise's need for material resources. </li><li>  Used for timely settlements with counterparties in full. </li><li>  Provide efficient use of funds. </li></ul><h2>  Legislative regulation </h2><p>  At the state level, a number of NAPs have been developed that regulate the asset accounting process.  In particular, the Federal Law No. 208 describes in detail the structure of capital (Article 25), the minimum requirements for its size (Article 26), the process of changing the size of capital (Articles 26-30), as well as the protection of creditor rights and the issue of securities (vv. 31-33). </p><p>  The norms of this Federal Law apply only to OJSC.  CJSC and organizations of other forms of ownership have their own accounting rules.  In particular, Federal Law No. 402 describes in detail how to account for tangible non-current assets and liabilities of an organization. </p>

The abridged form consists of five lines of an asset and six liabilities.  It would seem that drawing up a balance will be very simple.  In practice, accountants have a number of difficulties. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The simplified balance sheet contains collapsed information about property and liabilities. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 622px; height: 526px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Line </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  The formula for calculating the balance sheet (account) </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="697"><p>  Assets </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Tangible fixed assets: fixed assets, capital investments. </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  01 + 03 + 07 + 08 - 02 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  <span>Financial assets:</span> intangible <span>assets</span> , investments, development results </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  NMA (04 - 05), investments (58 + 55), development (08 + 04) </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Stocks: raw materials, wage, products, goods </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  10 + 20 + 41 + 45 + 43 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Cash (DS) </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  50 + 52 + 55 + 57 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Other assets: short-term investments, VAT, receivables </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  58 + 19+ 62 + 69 + 68 + 70 ... 76 </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="697"><p>  Passive </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Capital: authorized, additional, reserve, retained earnings </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  80 + ... + 84 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Long term loans </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  67 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Other long-term loans </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  77 + 96 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Short-term loans </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  66 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Accounts payable </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  68 + ... + 71 + 76 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  Other current liabilities </p></td><td valign="top" width="349"><p>  96 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Each line corresponds to a specific code.  If you need to specify several indicators in one line, then the code of the article that has the largest specific weight is put. </p><p>  Example.  The LLC in the line "tangible fixed assets" includes fixed assets in the amount of 200 thousand rubles.  and capital investments in the amount of 80 thousand rubles.  The cost of equipment purchased is greater than the amount invested.  Therefore, the balance sheet will feature tangible non-current assets (line 1150) in the amount of 280 thousand rubles.  If the company has nothing to write in any line, then it simply does not lead to balance. </p><p>  Newly created organizations that have not yet been active cannot show an empty balance.  The report should at least reflect two operations: the source and the process of formation of the authorized capital (DT75 KT80).  Most often, shareholders contribute money (DT51 KT75) or provide OS as a treasure (DT01 KT75).  Then the record is made on the corresponding line ‚Äútangible fixed assets‚Äù in the balance sheet of a small enterprise. </p>

    <h2>  Example </h2><p>  LLC fills a simplified balance sheet at the end of the year.  As of December 31, the organization has the following assets: </p><ul><li>  purchased OS (account 01) - 100 thousand rubles.  - tangible non-current assets (line code 1110); </li><li>  funds (account 51) - 10 thousand rubles.  - line code 1250; </li><li>  customer debt - 15 thousand rubles.  - DZ (line code 1260). </li></ul><p>  Total assets: 125 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Liabilities: </p><ul><li>  UK + Profit: 115 thousand rubles.  - line code 1310. </li><li>  Accounts payable (payroll, to contractors, to the budget) - 10 thousand rubles.  - line code 1330. </li></ul><p>  Total liabilities: 45 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Cost estimate </h2><p>  Before selling an organization, its market value is calculated.  For this purpose, an indicator such as net assets is determined.  The basis is taken from the balance sheet.  All liabilities are deducted from the value of the assets.  The residual figure is the market value of the organization.  If the result of the calculations is a negative value, then the obligations of the organization are several times higher than the value of the property.  The calculation does not include the cost of shares that the company bought from the founders, and the value of stocks.  The fact of ownership does not guarantee profit. </p>

    <p>  Non-current fixed assets are usually valued using the excess profit method.  It is based on the assumption that part of the profit may exceed the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù profitability and be converted into an intangible asset - ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù.  Calculation Algorithm: </p><ul><li>  Determination of the value of assets and liabilities. </li><li>  Calculation of operating profit. </li><li>  Determining the OA income rate at which ‚Äúexcess profit‚Äù will then be calculated. </li><li>  Determination of the intangible asset income rate, which will then be used to calculate goodwill. </li></ul><p>  Before the calculations, the following items are adjusted: </p><ul><li>  Securities are translated at market value. </li><li>  Accounts receivable are cleared to identify debts that can still be received. </li><li>  It is better to calculate the cost of goods and materials at the real selling price. </li><li>  From the upfront costs, you should remove the part that does not go to the buyer, and add the costs that were not included in the assets. </li><li>  The cost of furniture and equipment is best determined by the replacement method, that is, taking into account wear and tear, or at a market price. </li><li>  From the balance sheet you need to remove the debt issued to secure real estate. </li></ul><p>  Of the liability items, only promissory notes and deferred tax payments in some situations will need to be adjusted. </p>
