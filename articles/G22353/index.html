  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find iPhone with Android: step-by-step instructions and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When developing modern gadgets, Apple developers focus on the security of user data and the security of the device.  Apple products are integrated with the latest features that make it possible to find an iPhone with Android. </p><h2>  Find My - Location Checker </h2><p>  One of the functions of detecting an Apple device is Find My, which allows you to track a lost gadget on a signal without connecting the police. </p><div class="photo" data-original="getlogdog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iPhone with Android" class="if uuid-2984123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2984123.jpg"></div><p>  Find My is an integrated proprietary service for finding phones, computers and other modern Apple models.  It is worth setting up and attaching your device in advance.  To configure Find My, you need to go to the iCloud cloud storage settings and specify the phone as a lost device, which can also be blocked.  This is one way to quickly find an iPhone.  Icloud from Android also provides help finding a missing device. </p><h2>  How to find iPhone using iCloud.com? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iPhone via Android" class="if uuid-2984128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2984128.jpg"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt know <span>how to find iPhone</span> through your Android device using iCloud, use the instructions below: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Go to icloud.com in a new tab on Android. </li><li>  The user will be redirected to the page with the button "Find" iPhone ", which will provide information about the attached Apple gadgets. </li><li>  No need to pay attention to the iOS iCloud page.  You must immediately go to the "Share" box. </li><li>  A window with new shortcuts should appear.  After that, select the button ‚ÄúFull version of the site‚Äù.  The familiar ‚Äúcloud‚Äù will appear on the new page when you log into iCloud. </li><li>  The system will ask for the ID and password of the lost iPhone. </li><li>  If the activation was successful, then the user will have full access to his phone and will be able to use the service ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù from ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  Full activation through iCloud takes two to five minutes.  This allows you to quickly find the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù from the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  It is important to take into account that the search is carried out only if the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù function is activated on the Apple device, and the device itself is turned on and an Internet connection is established. </p><h2>  Silent mode of the lost iPhone: what to do? </h2><p>  Users of branded smartphones have developed life hacks, with which it becomes possible to find an ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù from the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, even if the silent mode is set. </p><p>  You must complete the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Open "Find iPhone." </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúLast geoposition‚Äù so that the system gives the result as quickly as possible. </li><li>  Establish a connection with the desired device. </li><li>  Enter password and ID. </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúPlay Sound‚Äù.  After that, the lost phone offline will change the settings, then give a signal to the owner. </li></ul><p>  Be sure the user should connect all the necessary Apple devices to iCloud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Search for a disconnected phone via Android </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.unlockboot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iphone icloud from android" class="if uuid-2984131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2984131.jpg"></div><p>  IMEI is the base phone number that helps you track your iPhone under any circumstances.  In the factory settings, the iPhone has a 15- or 16-digit number, which can be found by the number: * # 06 #.  The function is active when GPS data is turned on on a lost phone.  The search is carried out via the operator‚Äôs network, which provides information about the location of the phone by satellite signal. </p><p>  This option is not available to individuals, so to find the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù via an Android phone, you need to be patient.  An application is submitted to the police station with a form and an explanation of the reason for the searches.  After its consideration, law enforcement agencies will connect the telecom operator and track the phone via GPS navigation.  It takes at least three days to process the request.  If the loss is valuable, then it is better to start the search in other ways. </p><h2>  Alternative program to find an Apple device </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iPhone from Android Phone" class="if uuid-2984137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2984137.jpg"></div><p>  Samsung‚Äôs remote search feature has gone far ahead of Apple‚Äôs brand name.  The program provides the following features: </p><ul><li>  Authorization without two-factor authentication from one device. </li><li>  Work with two geographical resources (maps).  This option is convenient for those regions that have little information about geolocation. </li><li>  Tips for new users.  If the user is looking for his ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù for the first time, then intuitive tips will help you perform all the actions correctly. </li><li>  Backup allows you to save the latest data.  To do this, it is necessary that the Internet is turned on on the lost iPhone. </li><li>  ‚ÄúAdding Trustees‚Äù is a new item that allows another user to track devices and transmit signals to them. </li><li>  To find iPhone from your Android phone, you need to authorize your device through the Samsung website in the same way as through iCloud. </li></ul><p>  In the near future, Apple plans to outperform its competitor with the new Apple-SIM security system.  The function will resemble a chip that will be built into the iPhone, and for any loss or theft, the owner will immediately find his gadget without setting up geolocation and the Internet.  Switching between operators will also be inside the phone and will not allow to open the cover to remove the SIM card.  The corporation developed a similar innovation back in 2014, but the system had certain errors and required improvement. </p><h2>  How to find iPhone through Android: application in the Play Market </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.leawo.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find iPhone via Android Phone" class="if uuid-2984139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2984139.jpg"></div><p>  You can find iPhone using the applications provided by the Play Market.  One such free application is Find iPhone.  To activate iOS, you will also need iCloud.  The application runs on the Android platform and can track any Apple device on Google Maps.  Findi Phone has the following features: </p><ul><li>  turning on and off the sound on the phone; </li><li>  work on multiple accounts; </li><li>  in street search, indicates the direction to the device with voice playback; </li><li>  The result is accurate to the street and home. </li></ul><p>  Working with the application is also possible in online mode.  During operation, you can check the attached devices on the Apple website and view their status at the moment. </p><p>  In the application, green indicates the exact location of the iPhone found, and gray indicates that the device is found, but the location cannot be established.  If the device on the Android platform does not play the application, then you need to double-check the possibility of establishing a connection with active geolocations and turn them on if there was no Internet connection.  It should be noted that the manufacturer is not an official representative of Apple. </p><p>  All applications are not ideal and various technical failures are possible.  In England, there were cases when an Apple user lost his gadget and tried to track it through alternative applications on Android.  Maps pointed to his own home, but the gadget was lost in a nearby cafe.  This can happen due to the fact that the system remembered the last synchronization of the phone and could not find a connection to a new place.  To exclude such cases, you need to include GPS data, the Internet and binding to iCloud on your iPhone in advance. </p>
