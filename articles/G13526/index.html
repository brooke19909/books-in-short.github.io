A year later, 4-core processing became available, making multitasking possible.  But who will use Skype while surfing the Internet, watching a movie and listening to streaming music at the same time?  Few, therefore, the new Samsung TVs, such as the UE40F6400AK, continue to be equipped with 2-core processors. </p><h2>  Functionality and Design </h2><p>  Despite its reputation as an outdated model, this 40-inch Samsung LED TV 6 Series LED TV offers voice interaction, an active 3D system and an excellent Wi-Fi-enabled Smart Hub with excellent design, as well as several HDMI and USB ports . </p><p>  You should forget about metal frames - such materials are not used in budget models.  Instead, you can enjoy a fairly thin panel with a thickness of 49.6 mm and a 16 mm rim of the screen.  It is shiny, slightly convex and black, with a rounded transparent edge 3 mm wide, which, capturing the surrounding light, glistens unusually.  The Micro Dimming LED technology used in high-quality televisions of the South Korean manufacturer is not applied here, which positively affects the price of the device.  At the full price of <span>Samsung UE40F6400AK,</span> equal to $ 1,200, the model is sold at a significant discount. </p>

    <h2>  Alternatives </h2><p>  F6400 series televisions are available in a variety of sizes - 32 ‚Äùfor $ 900, 46‚Äù ($ 1545), 50 ‚Äù($ 1845), 55‚Äù ($ 2175), 65 ‚Äù($ 3750) and 75‚Äù ($ 7500), but they all have the same set of features and specifications.  However, probably more important are the main differences between this model and others from Samsung LED TV‚Äôs vast arsenal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The UE40F7000 Series 7 TV costs less than $ 1900 and has a smaller width (34.4 mm), twice as powerful built-in speakers, a camera for Skype-type functions and an application for it, a Freesat HD tuner, a thinner frame, as well as a Smart kit Evolution. </p><p>  The other two 40-inch TVs are the Samsung UE40F6500 ($ 1,350) and the UE40F6800 ($ 1,500).  The latter already has a slightly different design with two separate legs attached to the rear panel.  Both higher-end televisions are equipped with a Freesat HD tuner. </p><p>  Although the size of the model seems impressive, according to users, the screen size of the Samsung UE40F6400AK is too large for most tables and tables, and it does not rotate, so you should definitely take measurements before purchasing. </p><p>  If Freeview HD is enough, but there is a desire to save money, then you can consider 2 other 40 ‚Äùoptions in the 6th series - UE40F6200 ($ 1095), which obviously lacks a refresh rate of 200 Hz and 3D functions, and UE40F6100 ($ 1000) with support 3D, but with only two HDMI inputs and a single USB port. </p>

    <h2>  Description Samsung UE40F6400AK </h2><p>  The 6th series is so replete with options, updates and exclusives that you can confidently talk about the choice of the most aggressively advertised function by most buyers.  And this is probably not bad, because this lineup has the best price-performance ratio. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A single <span>Scart connector</span> is located on the rear panel on the right side, along with wired Ethernet, one HDMI slot, a set of component video inputs, and analog audio inputs.  This is great news for those who have home theaters and amplifiers, although you should pay attention to the lack of a digital coaxial connection, as well as a slot for installing the Smart Evolution upgrade.  Nevertheless, on the right side panel is what outweighs the scales in favor of this model.  Along with three HDMI inputs (total and 4), there are 3 USB slots, one for a flash drive, a Skype camera and an external hard drive for recording.  The latter scenario is rather rudimentary, since the UE40F6400AK has only 1 Freeview HD tuner (so you have to watch everything that is recorded), but it is a system that is well integrated into the Smart Hub user interface.  Here is the RF input, which is quite unusual, although very convenient. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung UE40F6400AK</span> TV is <span>equipped</span> with two pairs of ultra-thin active 3D glasses that are designed for 150 hours of work on a single charge.  This is enough to watch the entire world library of 3D films twice. </p>

    <p>  An unusual feature of the TV, which increases its flexibility, is the presence of 2 separate remote controls.  One of them is equipped with a touch trackpad for navigating the screen and a built-in microphone.  The second is more traditional and has become noticeably better than the previous ones in terms of minimalism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most of all users are concerned about the availability of applications and the possibility of reception.  Fortunately, the <span>Samsung UE40F6400AK is</span> praised for its <span>excellent performance</span> .  In their opinion, there is no smart TV with more necessary programs and additions than this model.  Smart Hub supports everything you need to view and listen to online content.  IPTV applications are available for KnowHow Movies, Netflix, Lovefilm, as well as popular but rarely used on Facebook and Twitter TVs and more unusual ones - Curzon On Demand, photos from National Geographic magazine, plays from digital theater, TuneIn Internet radio, etc. . </p><h2>  Samsung UE40F6400AK: image specifications </h2><p>  The TV uses 3D HyperReal Engine graphics processing technology, and there is also a complete set of settings that can be applied to current or all sources.  Despite the fact that black levels, of course, do not correspond to higher-end models, which results in less detailed shadows, users are impressed by the colors, decent contrast and fine detail.  The quality of the LCD panel is enhanced by motion enhancement technology equivalent to a screen refresh rate of 200 Hz.  The TV uses MotionPlus frame interpolation.  Its most powerful Smooth mode adds stunning smoothness and much more detail with a rapidly changing image sequence.  Although strange flickering and torn edges around very fast-moving objects (for example, arms and legs, swords and rifles) are noticeable, the standard setting does not cure blurry panoramas so effectively. </p>

    <h2>  3D </h2><p>  After switching to 3D, the image instantly becomes more contrast thanks to active 3D specifications.  And MotionPlus really improves picture quality.  Some do not like this video-like effect, but when it is turned off, the actors become like two-dimensional cardboard figures, separated from the action around them.  If MotionPlus is not necessary to use for regular Blu-ray, then for 3D it is a necessity.  It is worth mentioning that although 3D glasses are comfortable, they reflect everything that is behind.  There is almost no crosstalk (noticeable in scenes with mixed brightness and high contrast). </p><h2>  Standard definition image </h2><p>  The TV screen itself does not reflect anything, although users are disappointed with the SD broadcasts.  The UE40F6400AK mitigates low-resolution broadcast problems with Digital Clean View.  This works for close-ups, but the panorama becomes too blurry and soft.  In addition, the MPEG noise reduction system adds a slight amount of defocus.  It is better to install it at a medium level, where it successfully smooths and cleans the edges.  Despite these minor issues with the Samsung UE40F6400AK, owner reviews praise it for picture quality above average TVs in this price range. </p>

    <h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The AllShare Play system, which used to be the link between Samsung devices and which is still referred to in the UE40F6400AK architecture, has been updated and renamed (at least on the mobile application side) to Samsung Link.  Integration works very well, although not flawlessly.  Users can display photos on the screen (and even zoom in real time), send music and files.  The system works, MP3, FLAC, WAV and WMA files are fully broadcast, as are JPEG, MKV, AVI, MP4 and WMV.  The same files are played from the connected USB flash drive. </p><p>  The user interface offers an interesting way to deal with the problem of multiple channels and the inability to find anything to watch.  He studies the habits of the viewer and offers something that will soon appear on the air, selects films that, in his opinion, should be liked (this requires a Samsung account). </p><p>  The TV offers on the central screen of the Smart Hub are in the form of an icon, and, as a rule, it is impossible to say what they are, because the small images of random TV presenters say nothing to most viewers.  In addition, according to user reviews, the proposed options do not meet their desires.  Perhaps all that is needed is time. </p><p>  The TV program timeline, which should present a chronological broadcast schedule, works periodically and is often empty.  The application screen is only half full, which slightly spoils the initial favorable impression. </p><p>  The user interface partially implements voice interaction technology, although it does not work very well.  For example, the question of the availability of recommendations provoked the television as the first option to offer a channel that has already been watched.  After the selection sequence number was called, the system asked to use the full sentence, and after repeating it launched the built-in web browser.  The assistant‚Äôs voice is rather robotic and fuzzily pronounces all the letters.  All these misunderstandings turn planning for the inclusion of the channel at a certain time into a nightmare.  On a Samsung UE40F6400AK TV, the remote control works much better. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Despite the fairly standard speakers, users are impressed by the sound of the Samsung UE40F6400AK.  Reviews highlight the Music setting, which provides clear vocals and background sound, although Amplify adds much-needed bass.  The ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù mode drowns out a little, but the general impression of 10 W speakers is an open, detailed sound landscape with a sufficient level of low frequencies. </p><p>  SoundShare mode allows you to establish a Bluetooth connection with one of the Samsung DA-E750 wireless audio devices. </p><h2>  Price and quality </h2><p>  As always, if a TV costs $ 1,200, then it should be something special.  In this case, the device provides reliable and universal display of content, except, possibly, SD-channels, in combination with the best intelligent television system. </p><p>  The price of Samsung UE40F6400AK is significantly lower than the quality of its assembly, given the presence of 2 pairs of 3D glasses and 2 remote controls.  The lack of a Freesat HD tuner (compared to the more expensive TVs of the South Korean manufacturer) is a wise move that made it possible to cheapen the device for those who do not need such functionality. </p><p>  There are enough applications, and the touch panel and voice interaction of the Samsung UE40F6400AK are called reviews very attractive, with claims to belong to higher-end models.  It performs all its basic functions, without effort providing impressive image and sound. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Users really liked the touch remote control and streaming capabilities in general.  The Smart Hub contains more third-party applications than third-party systems, and the company provides the ability to deliver its programs to all terrestrial broadcasters.  Sound quality is above average, color and contrast are impressive, and MotionPlus processing takes 3D to a completely different level. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Smart Hub seems perfect, the portal is not as reliable as it could be, and not as fast as in the more expensive Samsung TVs.  Standard definition channels do not scale very well, the 2-core processor sometimes stutters, as does integration with other products of the South Korean manufacturer during streaming.  Also, do not resort to voice interaction. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The TV is not doing its best to improve the clarity of standard-definition broadcasts, it is not the thinnest, and some will not like the use of MotionPlus for 2D and 3D.  However, the large number of available applications in the Smart Hub, sufficient contrast, vibrant colors and many details allow the device to compete with more expensive options.  The touch-sensitive remote control is admirable; integration with Samsung Galaxy gadgets is not bad, although delays do occur from time to time. </p><p>  However, in additional features, users are mostly disappointed.  It may seem strange, but the presence of voice interaction and a system of recommendations that work at random will most likely scare away potential buyers of an otherwise good TV.  Experimental technology has remained experimental and, until it has become more advanced, causes only a feeling of frustration. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  There are many alternatives in this competitive area, and not least of all from Samsung.  The Panasonic ET60 series offers savings on a passive 3D system.  It's also worth taking a look at the Panasonic TX-L42E6B, something from the slightly less intelligent Sony W805 line and the much less reasonable, albeit more beautiful Philips 42PFL6008. </p>
