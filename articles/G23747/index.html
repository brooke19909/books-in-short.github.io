  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a bow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For what a wooden bow is needed, many will probably answer, and how to make a bow, few will answer.  To begin with, bow is a sporting weapon.  It is used in various shooting competitions.  A modern bow has nothing to do with such a small arms weapon from the time of Robin Hood.  Of course, the foundation is the same.  A flexible rod, a bowstring and arrows stretched over it.  Here, in general, is all the similarities. </p><p>  And <span>how to make onions at home?</span>  First you need to pick up the material.  There is a feature.  In summer, spring, or autumn, that is, when there is no snow, we find a blank for the base.  It may be: birch, oak, ash, juniper.  We choose what we need and go to wait for the winter.  At a temperature within 15 degrees of frost, we cut off the intended workpiece.  At the same time, we draw attention to the fact that it does not have knots, paths from bark beetles, cracks, or any other damage.  Cut off the onion preparation longer than the onion itself will be.  Why, you ask.  Cracks may form during the drying process.  And this surplus will be useful.  We remove the damaged part, and the length of the bow will not suffer.  If, after drying, everything is normal, no damage was formed, just saw off the excess part of the workpiece. </p><p>  How to make a bow from a tree so that it lasts a long time?  Everything will depend on the correct selection of material and its drying.  Without removing the bark, installing vertically and lubricating each end of the workpiece with <span>oil paint,</span> we begin the drying process.  It is carried out at a temperature of 20-25 degrees.  Moreover, the temperature should be constant, and the room should be ventilated so that the air is not, completely dry.  If the temperature at the drying stage does not correspond to the declared, internal cracks may appear on the workpiece.  They will soon make themselves felt, and your bow will not last long.  The material dries for a long time.  This may take two months and five months.  Everything will depend on the drying conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now, after the workpiece has dried, we think how to make onions from it.  Our blank is a kind of shovel handle.  Here it is necessary to make a flat board out of it.  To do this, you can use an ax, a hacksaw or some other carpentry tool.  The thickness of the board should be approximately three centimeters. </p><p>  The workpiece begins to take on a different look.  We approach its markup.  Our material should be as even as possible.  After applying the markup, we begin to separate the excess from the future onion.  It should turn out the following: a straight board, the narrowed ends of which expand to the middle.  That is, it turned out an elongated long rhombus. </p><p>  Having figured out how to make a bow in the initial stage, we move on to a more complex process.  This is evaporation. </p><p>  This is the most crucial moment that will give the final shape to the bow.  Therefore, it must be treated responsibly.  Any shape can be shaped.  For example, you want only the shoulders to be bent at the bow.  To do this, we apply steam to both shoulders at once.  This must be done until the shoulders of the workpiece become elastic.  After that, our workpiece, placed in advance in a kind of slipway, begins to be fixed, or in another way - to be agitated.  Bars are used that fix the bow bend, both externally and internally. </p><p>  So, we almost figured out how to make the onion, it remains to remove it from the slipway, after drying, process and finish the job.  To pull the bowstring, it is necessary to make fasteners for the ends of the bow.  There are many options.  You can make metal fasteners or a bone tip.  But the easiest option is a step, which is done at the end of each shoulder, to secure the bowstring. </p><p>  In order to prevent moisture from affecting the onion, it must be treated with hot wax, and to a depth of no more than 3 mm, so that the onion remains elastic. </p>
