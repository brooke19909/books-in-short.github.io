    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Check-in of new arrivals starts after two in the afternoon.  According to our compatriots, in most cases, hotel employees do not depart from this rule, as there are a lot of people staying here.  However, if you arrive at the hotel in the morning and it turns out that the room intended for you has already been vacated by the previous guests and prepared by the maids, then the keys will be given to you almost immediately.  Otherwise, you can leave things in the left-luggage office at the reception and go for breakfast or lunch, walk around the territory or visit the pool or the beach right away.  Approaching the reception for about two hours, you can get the keys to your apartment and check in. </p><p>  As for the last day at the hotel, you should leave the room before 11 a.m.  If you would like to extend your stay, you should notify the administrator in advance at the reception, as it is likely that there may not be any free apartments. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  In general, travelers, they said, were satisfied with the employees of Sahara Beach.  So, it is noted that the staff here is attentive, friendly, helpful.  True, some tourists note that the employees have a lot of work, and they, as they say, literally sew up and do not have time to do something.  However, the staff is trying as quickly as possible to solve all the difficulties that arise, and there are practically no interruptions in work.  As for knowledge of foreign languages, many hotel workers speak, or at least understand, Russian.  So our compatriots should not worry about this.  Moreover, at the front desk there is always a Russian-speaking administrator, who can be contacted if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  As for food at Sahara Beach Hotel 4 *, guest reviews indicate that it is organized at a very decent level.  So, the hotel we are considering operates on an all-inclusive system.  This means that at almost any time of the day or night, his guests have the opportunity to eat or treat themselves to their favorite drinks. </p><p>  So, the main meals are held in the main restaurant, working in a buffet format.  When you check in, a certain table will be assigned to you.  As a rule, the same waiter will serve you throughout your stay.  So in a couple of days he will be aware of your preferences.  Many of our compatriots recommend giving a tip to the waiter.  In this case, he will be very attentive to you, and by your arrival at the restaurant a table will always be served, and you will be provided with your favorite drinks. </p><p>  Most non-tip tourists also did not complain about the service.  But still best to thank the waiters.  As for the restaurant‚Äôs overall performance, some travelers complained about long lines.  This is especially true when the hotel is almost 100% full.  A number of guests preferred to dine in a restaurant on the beach.  The menu there, they say, is almost the same as in the main restaurant, but there are much fewer people.  This option is great for those who do not want to leave the beach for lunch. </p><p>  However, you will still have to head to the main restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  As for the morning meals, a number of guests complained about the need to stand a long queue for scrambled eggs or omelettes.  Hotel guests hope that the administration will somehow be able to optimize the restaurant so that guests are more comfortable. </p><p>  As for the choice of dishes, it is very diverse.  So, some guests in their comments say that even after two weeks of vacation they were not able to try about a third of the dishes offered in the restaurant.  Since the hotel belongs to the budget category, then of course you should not count on any delicacies here.  However, all the food is very tasty, with quality products. </p>

The Sahara Beach Hotel 4 * considered by us, according to many guests, will not disappoint tourists in this regard.  So, the hotel has at its disposal a rather large sandy beach with a sufficient number of sunbeds and parasols for everyone.  There is also a bar and restaurant.  By the way, in the bar you can not only enjoy drinks, but also enjoy ice cream or a snack during the day. </p><p>  As for the beach, according to travelers, despite the fact that at almost every step there are bins, and hotel staff regularly clean it of garbage, in the sand there are still often, for example, cigarette butts.  Leave them, of course, the vacationers themselves.  Therefore, some tourists express in their reviews not so much dissatisfaction with the garbage as indignation at the behavior of a number of guests who are too lazy to go literally two steps to the ballot box to throw a cigarette butt. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, no one will be bored in Sahara Beach.
