To do this, they seek help from insurance companies.  Insurers can make hull payments in case of an accident, thereby the insurer will be able to protect themselves from unplanned costs. </p><h2>  Casco </h2><p>  Casco is a comprehensive voluntary car insurance.  Unlike CTP, there may be various risks.  Casco in different insurance companies also has significant differences.  Casco depending on the risks is divided into several types: </p><ul><li>  Complete.  It is characterized by high cost, the greatest number of risks. </li><li>  Partial  The cost of insurance is much lower, as there are several main risks in the policy. </li></ul><h2>  Policy registration </h2><p>  If the owner of the vehicle has come to the conclusion that it is necessary to purchase a voluntary insurance policy, then he should be familiarized with the steps for making a purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecreditpros.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payments after an accident" class="if uuid-2687340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687340.jpg"></div><p>  Before purchasing an insurance policy, you need to determine why you need hull insurance.  Perhaps the owner of the vehicle fears only theft or hesitates to drive a car, fears an accident.  After determining the priority, you need to familiarize yourself with what companies can offer in the financial market.  To do this, we need to highlight for ourselves several of the most reliable insurers who have been working in this area for a long time and making payments.  On their official website you can familiarize yourself with the types of insurance and make a comprehensive insurance calculation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Campaign in the company </h2><p>  Before traveling to the selected insurance company, you need to prepare the documents: TCP, passport, driver's license, diagnostic card.  At the insurer's office, the employee will carry out a preliminary calculation of comprehensive insurance, as well as an inspection of the car.  The inspection will indicate all the damage.  That is, payments for previously received damage will not be made. </p><h2>  Contract execution </h2><p>  After inspection, the employee will make a copy of the contract and show it to the policyholder.  It is necessary to carefully study all the details of the contract.  If there are contradictions and errors, then it is necessary to correct them at this stage.  It is also necessary to familiarize yourself with the list of risks, the application of the contract, payment rules, and ask questions of interest.  It must be remembered that Casco will not protect against everything, but only from what is prescribed in the policy.  If the conditions of the contract suit the policyholder, then you can sign and pay.  The insurance policy will begin its effect from the moment specified in the policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carcliq.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.carcliq.co.uk/car-guides/car-insurance-myths"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco in case of accident" class="if uuid-2687341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687341.jpg"></div><h2>  Important </h2><p>  The Casco policy must have a list of drivers.  If a person who is not on this list sits behind the wheel and a traffic accident occurs, there will be no payment.  Therefore, it is necessary to include all the drivers who will ride this car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Driver action </h2><p>  What to do in case of an accident?  Casco will help in paying if the accident is an insured event.  When a traffic accident occurs, you must adhere to a certain sequence of actions: </p><ul><li>  The driver must stop the vehicle, turn on the alarms, put a special sign. </li><li>  It is necessary to call the traffic police.  Do not move the car before it arrives. </li><li>  It is also necessary to report an accident to an insurance company employee.  You can call the consultant who has drawn up the contract, or call the hotline number (contact information is always in the policy).  The employee will tell you the list of necessary documents and certificates, as well as the timing of contacting the company. </li></ul><h2>  Accident clearance </h2><p>  Will hull help if I got into an accident?  In order to receive a payment, it is necessary to properly arrange a traffic accident.  The term of payment will depend on the correctness of filling out the documents. </p><ul><li>  You need to independently take photos from various angles, so that the terrain and damage are visible.  You can also make a video.  The policyholder may collect evidence from witnesses at the scene of the accident. </li><li>  You cannot negotiate with any participant in an accident bypassing the insurer. </li><li>  It is necessary to trace that the traffic police officer made an accurate inspection of the scene of the accident and the car. </li><li>  You must also carefully study all documents related to the accident.  All entries must be correct.  The payment will depend on this. </li><li>  You need to leave copies of all documents for yourself. </li><li>  Next, you need to go to the office of the insurance company, write a statement for payment.  An employee of the company will notify of the place and date of the inspection of the vehicle. </li><li>  After examining the specialist, you need to take a copy of the conclusion to yourself. </li><li>  The insurance company will be paid on time. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="oerpel.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traffic accident" class="if uuid-2687346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687346.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  You need to start collecting documents immediately at the scene of a traffic accident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  <span>A certificate of an accident</span> for Casco will be a confirmation of the fact of the accident.  When you receive this certificate, you must check the completed information.  If there is a mistake, it is better to ask to fill out a new sample, since when submitting a document with blots, a refusal from the insurance company may come.  This certificate is very important, as it contains information about all participants in a traffic accident.  Also, the form must necessarily indicate "possible hidden damage." </li><li>  Documents for hull insurance after an accident include a notice of an accident.  According to the rules, all participants in the incident must sign this document.  But not always the culprit agrees to put it, because he does not want to admit his guilt.  If the culprit disagrees, the witnesses can put an additional signature.  The notice, like the certificate, must be filled out clearly and without errors. </li><li>  After arriving at the scene, the traffic police must also draw up a protocol on this event.  This document describes in detail the accident: how the cars stand, where they were headed, the scene of the accident, which settlements are nearby (if this is a highway), the nearest traffic signs.  In order to receive payment under the hull insurance policyholder must provide a copy of this document to the insurer. </li><li>  The decision on the offense is issued to the culprit of the incident immediately on the spot.  But if the policyholder is the affected party, then he needs to additionally request a copy for himself. </li></ul><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  The term for hull insurance after an accident is voiced by an employee of the insurance company.  Also, this period can be indicated in the documents of the insurance policy.  Legislation has not set specific deadlines for hull insurance.  Insurance companies independently determine this period for their clients.  But you cannot delay writing a statement.  Usually, the period is indicated within three days, excluding weekends and holidays.  It is important to call the insurer on the hotline and notify about the accident.  Some companies call register a case and voice the number to the policyholder.  Thus, when the policyholder arrives at the company‚Äôs office, he will be able to indicate the number of his case in the application.  A registered case is dealt with faster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anytimeinsurance.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guilty of accident" class="if uuid-2687342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687342.jpg"></div><h2>  Compensation Period </h2><p>  The terms of payment of hull insurance in accidents are not specified in the legislation of the country.  In order to find out a specific date of receipt of funds, you must contact the office of the insurance company directly.  Also, the term should be spelled out in the agreement itself.  Usually, payment is made 14-30 days after the application is submitted. </p><h2>  The culprit in the accident </h2><p>  Does hull pay the culprit of the accident?  With compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, the injured person receives payment.  But Casco is a help for the person who bought the policy.  That is, if the driver was the culprit in the accident and he has a hull, then the payment will still be.  But there are a number of nuances.  If guilty of an accident, Casco will not be paid in such situations: </p><ul><li>  the driver was drunk; </li><li>  refused to undergo a medical examination; </li><li>  if the culprit did not wait for the traffic police and disappeared from the scene of the accident; </li><li>  if you used a faulty vehicle; </li><li>  if the driver was not on the list of policies. </li></ul><p>  Also, there will be no payment if the insurance policy did not have the risk of ‚ÄúDamage in case of an accident‚Äù.  Sometimes drivers forget that they wanted to buy a policy cheaper, and give up many risks, leaving only one.  In order to be sure of the hull payment in case of an accident, it is necessary to carefully study the insurance policy and all the attached documents.  They indicate all insured events and exceptions for payments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carbuyplus.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://carbuyplus.com/car-buy-plus"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco calculation" class="if uuid-2687343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687343.jpg"></div><h2>  Accident with injured </h2><p>  In Russia, there are many accidents causing harm to life, as well as human health.  Compensation for hull insurance for accidents with victims can be made under certain conditions.  To do this, the contract should provide for this risk - ‚ÄúPayment in the event of an accident in an accident‚Äù.  If such a risk exists in the contract, then the following actions must be taken: </p><ul><li>  immediately after the accident you need to contact the nearest medical institution; </li><li>  during treatment, you need to collect all checks that were associated with the purchase of medicines; </li><li>  after treatment, you must contact the insurance company with all the documents, checks, conclusion. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the complexity of the treatment, a payment will be made.  Each contract has a paytable with which you can determine the amount.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  arm fracture is estimated at 5% of the total insurance amount; </li><li>  spinal fracture is 45%; </li><li>  disability of the first group or death is 100%. </li></ul><p>  But in most cases, policyholders refuse to include additional services in the contract.  Therefore, hull payments in accidents are often made only for cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tudostenyek.blog.hu" data-author=": " data-source="https://tudostenyek.blog.hu/2018/02/19/fogyasztas-csokkentes-i-resz"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco payouts" class="if uuid-2687344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687344.jpg"></div><h2>  Fatal outcome </h2><p>  Sometimes traffic accidents are fatal.  If there was this risk in the comprehensive insurance policy, the company will pay the full insurance amount.  In order for the heir to receive the money, it is necessary to apply to the office of the company 6 months after the death.  You need to have a passport, comprehensive insurance, death certificate, as well as a document confirming the right of inheritance.  Usually transfers occur within two weeks.  Some insurance companies offer their clients amounts for life and health other than the amount for car insurance.  Thus, life and health insurance will be an additional condition to the main contract. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that in a car accident, a large number of people can be injured in life and health.  But the payment of insurance will be made only for those who were traveling in the car of the insured.  Different insurance companies have different conditions, therefore, when choosing additional services, it is necessary to clarify the list of insured persons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="americantapes.us" data-author=": " data-source="http://americantapes.us/omni-auto-insurance-pay-online/omni-auto-insurance-pay-online-awesome-car-insurance-quotes-florida-parison-beautiful-car-insurance/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco insurance" class="if uuid-2687345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2687345.jpg"></div><h2>  Repair after an accident </h2><p>  Repair after an accident in Casco is the performance of work to restore a vehicle after damage received in an accident.  Repair is made by an insurance company partner.  If the policyholder chooses a repair from the insurer, then who will determine the car service?  A car service will be selected depending on where the policyholder is registered.  Also, this clause may be spelled out in the contract itself.  Usually the place of repair is determined by the insurance company.  The algorithm for the direction of the car for repair: </p><ul><li>  The policyholder notifies the insurance company of an accident.  Fills out an application at the office, attaches all the necessary documents. </li><li>  The owner of the vehicle provides the car for inspection at a predetermined time. </li><li>  Further, the policyholder receives a referral for repairs to a certain car service, which is a partner of the insurance company. </li><li>  The car must be directed to the service station.  Further, the insurer and partner specify the terms of repair and their cost. </li><li>  The duration of the repair work is usually two weeks, but it can take up to forty-five days (if there are no replacement parts, etc.). </li><li>  The policyholder picks up the car. </li></ul><h2>  Repair at a service station or payout </h2><p>  After an accident, policyholders can think about what to choose: cash or repairs from a partner.  In order to determine the most profitable option for yourself, you need to understand the following.  During the calculation of payments, insurance companies use tariffs.  These tariffs are minimal.  If the policyholder can repair the car on their own and at a symbolic price, then the payment will be profitable. </p><p>  It is necessary to choose a car service (partner of an insurance company) if it is not possible to make repairs yourself.  But here the question is about the quality of the repair.  In order to be sure of a good repair, you must first ask the insurer what service the machine will be sent to.  And after the information received, determine for yourself the best option. </p>
