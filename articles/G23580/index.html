There was no single political center in the country that could lead the struggle against the Mongols.  This role fell to the <span>Moscow principality.</span>  Its rulers managed to defeat Tver in the rivalry. </p><h2>  Consolidation around Moscow </h2><p>  It was Moscow that directed the collection of tribute for the Golden Horde.  In 1374, after Mamai supported the Prince of Tver in the struggle for the throne of Vladimir, Dmitry Donskoy refused to pay him the gold collected from the population.  Subsequently, the conflict turned into an open war. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="sandpit battle short story" class="if uuid-1000832" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1000832.jpg?1568737459"></div><p>  Russian armies plundered the Tatars on the Middle Volga.  In 1377, they were defeated on the Pian River.  Moscow troops responded within a few months.  On <span>the Vozha River,</span> they managed to defeat the Bezich Murza.  However, these battles were only rehearsals of the upcoming battle. </p><h2>  The collection of troops and its construction </h2><p>  In August 1380, September 8, Dmitry Donskoy organized the gathering of all Russian troops.  Under his leadership came the army and other principalities.  These were mainly Suzdal and Smolensk.  Also came a small regiment from Tver, which was led by the nephew of the prince there.  There are still disputes over whether the Novgorodians had time to join. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One way or another, but Donskoy managed to gather up to 70 thousand warriors under his banners.  The army was divided into three parts.  The largest regiment in the center was led by Dmitry himself.  On the right stood the Yaroslavl people, headed by Vladimir Andreevich, the Serpukhov prince and Donskoy's cousin.  Left led Bryansk ruler Gleb.  A powerful blow came here when the battle on the <span>Kulikovo field began</span> in 1380. </p><p>  On the way to the lands of the Mongols, the Moscow army visited Sergius of Radonezh.  The founder of the <span>Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius</span> was known throughout the country.  He blessed the army and gave Dmitry two heroes, who before that were monks - Oslyablyu and Peresvet. </p><p>  Mamai believed that the Russian army would not dare to cross the Oka, but take a defensive position, as it had already done in previous battles.  However, Dmitry wanted to strike first so as not to allow the Tatars to unite with the allies.  This step was extremely risky - all reserves and resources were left behind.  In the event of a defeat, the army could completely die without ever reaching the house. </p><p>  While the Russian regiments were marching towards the Don, Lithuanian detachments joined them.  They were led by the sons of Olgerd - Dmitry and Andrey.  Under their banners were the residents of Pskov, Polotsk, etc. After the reinforcements arrived, it was decided that Vladimir Andreevich would lead the regiment in ambush, Andrei Olgerdovich would lead the soldiers to the right of Donskoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="battle on the sandpit in 1380" class="if uuid-1000830" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1000830.jpg?1568737459"></div><p>  Momai was preparing for battle in difficult conditions.  In the Golden Horde, civil war continued.  Momai was threatened by Tokhtamysh, who could attack the enemy directly from behind the Volga. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battle progress </h2><p>  When the Russian troops crossed the Don, they specially burned all the bridges.  This was done so that his allies from among other Lithuanian princes, as well as Ryazans, could not reach Mamaia.  On September 7, the army finally took its position, waiting for the enemy.  Vladimir Andreyevich, together with Dmitry Bobrok-Volynsky, was sent to the oak forest, from where he was to strike with fresh forces at the most crucial moment.  All evening and night Donskoy traveled around the troops and checked their condition.  Then the Tatars came across the first Russian scouts. </p><p>  Dmitry wanted to directly participate in the battle among ordinary warriors.  Therefore, he exchanged armor with one of his associates.  The Tatars, not knowing this trick, killed the man whom they mistook for the prince. </p><p>  The Battle of Kulikovo Field, a short story about which is present in many literary sources, began on September 8.  The troops were gathered before noon, awaiting the order of the prince. </p><p>  It is known that the battle on Kulikovo Field began with the duel between Peresvet and Chelubey.  A short story, or rather, a retelling of this episode - and he gives the impression of what to say about the full text in the annals!  It was an ancient custom when the two most powerful warriors - one from each of the warring parties - fought face-to-face.  Both riders died from the blows of spears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="sandpit battle year" class="if uuid-1001310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1001310.jpg?1568737459"></div><p>  Then both troops rushed towards each other.  The main blow fell on the center and the left flank of the Russian squad.  Part of the troops here was cut off from the bulk.  The fighters began to retreat to Nepryadva, which created a danger of breaking through the rear.  It was a hot battle on the Kulikovo field.  The Russian army suffered serious losses, it seemed that the enemy was about to overcome ... </p><h2>  Ambush Regiment Attack </h2><p>  At that time, in a nearby oak forest, there was a dispute between Vladimir Serpukhovskiy and Voivode Bobrok.  The prince wanted to hit the Tatars almost immediately after the start of the battle.  However, the governor dissuaded, and the squad was waiting for a convenient moment, while the battle continued on the Kulikovo field.  A short story about it, by the way, contains the literary work "Zadonshchina" written at the end of the 15th century. </p><p>  Finally, the Tatar cavalry approached Nepryadva, catching up with the fleeing left regiment.  It was at this moment that the soldiers who were in ambush hit the enemy.  The cavalry did not have time to retreat in time and was literally swept into the river.  At the same time, the offensive began under the leadership of Donskoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="historical events of the sandpit battle" class="if uuid-1000827" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1000827.jpg?1568737459"></div><p>  All this time, Mamai watched the battle from afar, surrounded by his retinue.  After the ambush detachment came out, he realized that he had lost the battle on the Kulikovo field.  A brief account of this episode cannot convey the atmosphere prevailing at the scene of the battle.  Cries, screams, indiscriminate retreat of the Tatars who fled in panic ... </p><h2>  The end of the battle </h2><p>  The fugitives were caught up with about 50 versts.  Only a tenth of the enemy army was saved.  The pursuit was led by Vladimir Serpukhovskiy.  Dmitry Donskoy was shell-shocked, and his associates could not find him among many corpses.  Finally, he was found under a felled birch.  He was knocked out of the saddle, and the prince managed to crawl to the forest.  When he came to, the winners began to congratulate him with tears in their eyes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Battle on the sandpit Russian army" class="if uuid-1000820" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1000820.jpg?1568737459"></div><p>  <span>The battle on the Kulikovo field</span> in 1380 began, in the same year and ended.  Survivors began to collect the wounded.  Carts stretched for several kilometers.  The Lithuanian prince Jagiello, who did not manage to come to the rescue of Mamaia, learning about the Russian victory, retreated back home.  However, some of its units went to rob and kill the stragglers.  The Ryazan prince also refused an alliance with Mamai and declared himself ‚Äúyounger‚Äù in relation to the ruler of Moscow. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The Battle of Kulikovo Field, the year of which was a holiday for Russia, led to the fact that Moscow finally established itself as a political leader.  The Golden Horde has entered a series of crises and civil wars.  Nevertheless, for exactly one hundred years, her khans claimed to demand a tribute from Russia.  The yoke was finally dropped under Ivan III, in 1480, after <span>standing on the Ugra.</span> </p><p>  This status was confirmed by further historical events.  Songs and traditions were composed about the Battle of Kulikovo Field among the people.  She became a symbol of the greatness of the country.  In modern Russia, September 21 (September 8 according to the old style) was recognized as the Day of Military Glory. </p>
