    <h2>  Address </h2><p>  This new format of high art exhibition space is located in the very center of the northern capital.  Not far from it there are two metro stations: Gostiny Dvor, Nevsky Prospekt.  The exact address of the Art Center: <span>Dumskaya Street,</span> Building 4. You can walk to the gallery on foot from the Gostiny Dvor metro station, turning right from the Duma Tower. </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2><p>  The Art Center in the Perinas was opened in 2010.  It is located on the ground floor of the <span>shopping center of the</span> same name <span>.</span>  The building, which houses the modern center, was located in the "golden trading triangle" of the city.  It was built at the end of the eighteenth century by the architect Quarenghi.  The origin of such an interesting name for the structure is interesting.  In the second half of the nineteenth century, the street on which the malls were located was called Surovskaya.  This line began to be called Perinnaya since 1880 - almost 100 years after the building itself was built.  The fact is that at that time in some shops they sold bird feathers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="art center spb" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1585983.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here everyone has the opportunity to purchase paintings by many already well-known masters working in both classical and avant-garde styles.  Here you can also choose baguettes for every taste. </p><p>  The gallery attaches great importance to the design of expositions, and all information that may be interesting is carefully selected and checked.

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The popular Art Center (St. Petersburg) located in the Perin Rows is the very first museum project that began to offer visitors daily temporary exhibitions of works by world-class masters.  Here they adhere to the thesis that ‚Äúattending exhibitions is fashionable today‚Äù, and therefore, following it, they try to create interesting and gaining popularity expositions. </p><p>  Gallery displays are primarily educational in nature.  Their main goal is not only the desire to attract culturally educated people, but also the desire to give them aesthetic pleasure.  A trip to the shows in the Art Center on the Perinnyaya Ryad ceases to become a rare event, I always want to come here, because it is not only pleasant, but also useful. </p><h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  Last year, the Art Center in the Perine Rows (Dumskaya Street, 4) held an exhibition of Japanese graphics on the theme "Pictures from an Elusive World."  It originates from the Edo era.  On the canvases one could see scenes from the life of citizens, portraits of geishas and artists of the Kabuki theater, images of birds and flowers.  The showroom at the time of the exhibition seemed to be turned into a <span>Japanese house,</span> decorated with ancient engravings, which still retain the warmth of the hands of their authors.  The atmosphere of the land of the rising sun was complemented by collection bonsai trees, as well as a decorative pond with koi and <span>a rock garden.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Center in the Perine Rows St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1585984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An exhibition dedicated to the history of the Titanic was also held at the art center.  She opened the veil of secrecy of the death of this largest and most luxurious liner of the twentieth century.  The exposition had more than 80 photographs, among which were both historical shots and photographs that were taken during underwater research. </p><p>  In November last year, the Art Center in the Perinny rows invited to the show "Vanguard - XX Century."  The art of this direction is considered a real maze of artistic styles.  The exposition, presented in the Perin rows, was a good opportunity for visitors to enhance their knowledge of the history of art of the twentieth century.  The exhibition traced the development of art throughout the past century.  The geography of this project was very wide: starting from Russia, France, the USA and right up to Greenland and Vietnam.  Visitors saw the works of not only such recognized authors as Salvador Dali and R. Magritte, Marc Chagall, Juan Miro, but also the works of not so well-known artists who, however, make it possible to trace the formation of this art direction throughout the planet.  The exhibition featured more than 50 lithographs, as well as <span>information stands</span> that reveal the features of all the main directions of avant-garde. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Center in the Periny Rows Duma street 4" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1585986.jpg" width="510"></div>

At a joint project with the Guild of Perfumers, you can feel the synthesis of perfumery and photo art. </p>
