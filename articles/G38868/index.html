    <p>  One of the most popular lending companies for on-lending today is Otkritie Bank PJSC.  Although this service appeared relatively recently in it, today it is very popular among borrowers.  Thanks to this program, citizens can reduce the interest rate, or significantly reduce the monthly payment, increasing the term of the loan itself.  It is worth considering all the nuances of this proposal. </p><h2>  Does Otkritie Bank PJSC have internal lending opportunities? </h2><p>  It is quite reasonable that customers do not want to run across several banks at once to get a loan.  Of course, it is much more profitable to apply to the same financial organization, in which it was already possible to get a loan before.  If we talk about Otkritie Bank, refinancing of mortgages or consumer loans in this organization is possible in the same department where the previous loan was taken.  It all depends on individual conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In some situations, the bank is really ready to make certain concessions for its customers.  This means that the borrower has the right to receive a different type of loan to repay the previous loan. </p><p>  However, there is a high probability that refinancing in the branch of the Bank "Discovery" will be denied.  This, first of all, concerns those cases when the borrowers do not adhere to the payment schedule or have not made a single payment against the debt at all.  Also, a refusal can be obtained for a number of other reasons. </p>

    <p>  In order to clarify whether it is possible to obtain this type of loan, you need to contact the branch of Otkritie Bank and talk with the manager.  You can also contact a specialist by phone.  He will provide all the necessary information on the possibility of receiving funds. </p><h2>  Mortgage refinancing at Otkritie Bank </h2><p>  In this case, citizens can count on loans that are provided for a period of 5 to 30 years.  The amount of payment can range from 500 thousand rubles to the maximum possible amount, depending on the specific region.  In Moscow and St. Petersburg, borrowers can count on the largest loans of up to 30 million rubles.  If a citizen of the Russian Federation lives in another region, then the maximum possible limit on refinancing mortgages of other banks to individuals at Otkritie Bank is 15 million rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is most advantageous to get a loan if the down payment was up to 70% of the final cost of the object.  However, there are also many nuances in this matter, since it all depends on the location of the chosen living space.  It is also worth considering that the amount of the second loan should not exceed the debt balance of the previous loan. </p>

    <p>  As a pledge for refinancing, Otkritie Bank indicates the housing itself.  If we talk about the interest rate, then today it is 12%.  It is also worth considering that citizens aged 18 to 65 years can apply for such a service.  In this case, it is necessary to provide documents confirming that a person has been working at one workplace for the past 3 months. </p><h2>  Consumer loan refinancing terms </h2><p>  If we talk about a loan of the type that is provided to individuals for the purchase of smaller products, then it is worth highlighting some conditions. </p><p>  The size of the loan that customers can receive by issuing refinancing of loans of other banks with Otkritie Bank ranges from 50 thousand rubles to 1.5 million. In this case, the borrower can pay off the debt for a period of 6 months to 5 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main advantage of this program is that it is not necessary to attract guarantors or co-borrowers.  However, if the client wants third parties to take part in the receipt of funds, he can arrange a similar transaction. </p><p>  An important condition for obtaining refinancing of a loan at Otkritie Bank is the fact that a line must be specified in the previous loan agreement stating that this type of loan involves early repayment without any fees. </p>

    <p>  Another important requirement is that money is issued exclusively in national currency.  If we talk about the interest rate, then it ranges from 14.5% to 24.5%.  To clarify the more exact amount of the overpayment, you need to contact one of the offices of Otkritie Bank.  The interest rate is calculated individually for each client.  In addition, the amount of overpayment directly depends on how long the loan was issued, as well as on the amount of debt under the previous contract and many other factors. </p><h2>  Refinancing Application </h2><p>  In order for clients not to spend a lot of time visiting the Otkritie Bank office, a very convenient system was developed.  To apply, just go to the official website of a financial institution and fill out the appropriate form. </p><p>  Thanks to a clear interface, the whole procedure takes a minimum of time.  After that, it is enough for the client to wait a few days until the bank makes a decision on its issue.  After this time, the manager calls him back and informs whether the client can receive a refinancing. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Borrowers who have already formalized refinancing at Otkritie Bank drew attention to the many advantages that are provided to customers of this bank.  First of all, they noted that citizens of the Russian Federation can significantly reduce the size of the overpayment on a previous loan if a commission in the amount of 2.5% of the total loan amount is paid in a single order.  However, the minimum payment should be from 20 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Also, the bank has the opportunity to confirm your income.  And in this case, the client can provide a certificate in the form of 2 personal income tax or on the form of the bank itself.  In this case, there is also a high probability that the interest rate will also be reduced.  In addition, many drew attention to the loyalty of the program, as citizens of the Russian Federation over the age of 18 can get a loan. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  However, the refinancing of Otkritie Bank was not without its drawbacks, which were drawn to the attention of borrowers who issued loans.  First of all, they noted that the interest rate fluctuates too much depending on whether the client has confirmed his income or not.  If he decides to provide a document on his financial condition in the form of a bank, then in this case the overpayment increases by 0.25%. </p><p>  In addition, many noted that the bank may refuse a reduced overpayment without explanation.  Private entrepreneurs also drew attention to rather unfavorable conditions, since for them, according to this program, the percentage of overpayment increases by 1%. </p><h2>  How to get refinancing? </h2><p>  This procedure is maximally simplified.  The process of processing refinancing at Otkritie Bank takes only a few minutes if a person contacts the department of a financial organization directly.  At least that's what the advertisement says.  However, in fact, it usually takes at least 2 days to approve a loan.  On the other hand, in similar organizations such a procedure can take from 1 week to 10 days. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about documents, it is enough to provide an internal passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and any document that can additionally confirm the identity of the borrower.  As already mentioned, it is not at all necessary to confirm your employment for employment, but it is recommended in order to lower the interest rate. </p><h2>  Refinancing cost </h2><p>  If we compare the Bank "Discovery" with its main competitors, then this financial institution wins thanks to a fairly wide range of interest rates.  The minimum cost of refinancing can be up to 17.9%, and the maximum reaches 33% per annum.  It is worth noting that it is impossible to specify the exact amount of the overpayment in advance using only the tools of the bank's website.  All applications are considered solely on an individual basis.  Therefore, you will have to visit a bank branch and personally speak with the manager of a financial organization. </p><h2>  Refinancing Features </h2><p>  Since this program appeared in the bank relatively recently, today in some regions of Russia it is not available or works in test mode.  In order to apply for a refinancing, you can go in 2 ways: lower the interest rate or reduce the amount of the monthly payment due to the increase in the loan repayment period.  The interest rate will be known to the borrower only after consideration of the application.  However, this does not oblige him to anything.  Funds are transferred to the borrower only after signing the corresponding loan agreement. </p><h2>  Why can they refuse to refinance? </h2><p>  Although this practice is not common, it still takes place.  If we talk about the most common reasons for refusing a bank, then it is worth highlighting some of the most common mistakes made by borrowers. </p>

    <p>  Some provide an incomplete list of documents, which is why the bank suspects that a potential client wants to hide something. </p><p>  Also, loans are rarely issued to those who have too low a solvency level or have delays in previous payments.  Also, rely on re-lending is not worth those who have too little time to repay a loan on a previous loan.  Of course, the owner of a bad credit history also makes no sense to contact this financial institution. </p><p>  In all other cases, this service at Otkritie Bank has favorable conditions. </p>
