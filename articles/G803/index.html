In 1945, the development of the territory between the rivers of the Angara and Kitoya began, and after 6 years, the small village received the status of a city.  They will not offer tourists a tour of ancient mansions and historical sights, but the modern significant places of Angarsk have no less cultural value and non-standard execution. </p><h2>  Petrochemists Park </h2><p>  There is a well-groomed beautiful park of Petrochemists in Angarsk.  It is notable for the fact that its lattice is an exact copy of the fencing of the famous St. Petersburg Summer Garden, the presence of an interesting alley of love filled with red benches, and a play town for children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="angarsk.go2all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrochemists Park" class="if uuid-2578376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2578376.jpg"></div><p>  Being in this city, you can not visit this wonderful place and not be inspired by the romantic atmosphere.  Here you can see the most beautiful sculpture - the "Book of Desires".  An amazing fountain decorated with majestic lions will complement the experience of visiting this attraction of Angarsk. </p><h2>  Arena "Ermak" </h2><p>  The Ermak ice sports complex was opened in the city on December 26, 2010.  At the moment, this attraction of Angarsk is the largest indoor sports arena in all of Eastern Siberia.  About 7000 fans can simultaneously enjoy watching a hockey match.  There is also a small arena, accommodating 1,000 people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Victory Museum in Angarsk </h2><p>  A place of honor among the museums of the city is the Victory Museum.  It began with a small exhibition dedicated to the young guard in the small hall of Battle Glory, but the collection was gradually replenished and already occupies 2 floors.  Every year, about 40 thousand people visit the Victory Museum in Angarsk.  Everything that was found in the city after the war and is related to it is collected here.  Every resident of the city at least once came here to feel this terrible atmosphere of war and to honor the memory of fallen heroes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Museum" class="if uuid-2578390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2578390.jpg"></div><h2>  Clock Museum </h2><p>  There is a unique museum in Angarsk where you can feel the passage of time.  He owed his appearance to the fascination of the whole life of collector Pavel Kurdyukov.  Ten exhibition halls occupy two floors of a permanent exhibition.  Here you can see instances from primitive sundials to ultra-modern electronic designs and massive tower chimes: unpretentious and luxurious, floor and wall, wrist and pocket, musical and cuckoo, wooden and gold, military and space. </p><p>  There are rare rarity chronometers from different eras from England, France, Japan and Russia in the collection.  And, most interestingly, everything is in working condition.

You can spend half a day watching time-measuring mechanisms and not a second regret the time spent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.triinochka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clock Museum" class="if uuid-2578382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2578382.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument to the Decembrists </h2><p>  In 1965, a monument to the revolutionaries was unveiled on the Moscow highway.  The initiative came from the local Komsomol cell.  Until recently, sculpture was the only architectural structure on its territory.  Now there is a square around it, where you can safely walk and breathe in fresh air. </p><h2>  Unusual Monuments </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.5155702" data-lng="103.91715999999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/1/1/4911.png"></div><p>  Angarsk has many interesting monuments and sculptural ensembles.  And each one can rightly be called a brilliant masterpiece.  Both adults and children adore and consider the monument to the wolf as a symbol of well-being from the animated film "Once upon a time there lived a dog", which is known to everyone with its catchphrase "Let me sing now." </p><p>  A steel figure (weighing 2 tons) is a gift to the city from local entrepreneurs.  And the version of the monument on the proposed sketches was chosen by the children of Angarsk.  The wolf looks full and very satisfied, and the local belief says: it‚Äôs worth stroking the well-fed belly, and he will share a piece of happiness.  The monument is also a secret: just press the button on the pedestal, and the famous wolf will sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bestmaps.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Wolf" class="if uuid-2578358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2578358.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument "Flower" </h2><p>  On December 30, 1972, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the USSR, this monument was erected.  V. Sokolov and V. Afanasyev were chosen as architects for it.  A twelve-meter-long blossoming flower with a bud from the flags of the republics of the Soviet Union.  At the base is a line from the hymn: ‚ÄúUnion of indestructible free republics‚Äù. </p><h2>  Mineralogical Museum </h2><p>  This Angarsk attraction includes over 1,500 different stones.  Some exhibits are more than 50 million years old.  Here is the wealth of the <span>Irkutsk region</span> - colored precious minerals: lapis lazuli, jade, charoite.  There is a map showing mineral deposits, as well as a ‚ÄúRock Garden‚Äù.  You can see the structure of planet Earth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bipbap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Baikal" class="if uuid-2578397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2578397.jpg"></div><h2>  Baikal </h2><p>  Just a hundred kilometers from the city lies a miracle of nature - Lake Baikal.  Its crystal clear surface and the surrounding natural landscape will lead to delighted amazement. </p><p>  If you are not passing through Angarsk, be sure to set aside a day to visit probably the most important attraction of all of Russia.  It is the largest fresh water storage in the world.  The shape of the lake resembles a crescent moon about 700 kilometers long.  It is surrounded by hills and a hilly ridge.  A variety of flora and fauna attracts tourists from all over the world. </p>
