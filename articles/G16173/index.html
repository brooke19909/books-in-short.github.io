    <h2>  The main milestones of his work </h2><p>  Jerry Gionis was born in 1974.  Sixteen years later, the young man graduates from high school and goes to college, where one of the subjects was photography.  Jerry first appeared in 1989.  After that, the young photographer did not let her out of her hands.  After studying for only a year, Gionis dropped out of college, and he got a job as a seller of a photographic equipment store.  Soon the young man got married.  His chosen one was the eighteen-year-old Dahlia. </p><p>  Photography so captivated Jerry that in 1994 he began giving classes for free in one of Melbourne's photo schools.  Things were moving so well that Gionis was soon appointed to the post of manager, and then he led a group of photographers.  This was the beginning of a brilliant career.  Already in 1997, the services of a photographer could be obtained in his own studio. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jerry Gionis photographer" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1261684.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Photographer Technique </h2><p>  The master willingly shares his secrets: </p><ol><li>  A good specialist should always have plenty of time to shoot.  And the bride and groom should prepare for wedding photos in advance so as not to do everything in a hurry.  First, the master takes pictures at the groom‚Äôs house, then spends several hours at the bride‚Äôs work. </li><li>  Each wedding is individual in its traditions, religious views, culture, social levels of the newlyweds, personal qualities of the bride and groom.  Gionis photographs both the ransom young, and the first dance, and other moments of the wedding.  The production in his pictures is present, but he brings notes of freshness and ease into it.  The photographer here should be a subtle psychologist and try to play on people's feelings so that they look as natural as possible in the pictures. </li><li>  Role-playing games are an important hobby of a wedding photographer.  The master poses a task for the newlyweds.  They must imagine this situation and fulfill his wishes.  Humor helps Jerry Gionis evoke real emotions in the newlyweds.  He jokes a lot. </li><li>  The bride is the most important link in wedding photography.  A true master should capture her beauty, distinct body lines, sexuality.  To do this, you need to contact her all the time, give her compliments, give advice.  Jerry Gionis even has cards in the form of photo miniatures, as tips for young people: gestures, position of hands, postures. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Technical features </h2><p>  The services of a photographer are appreciated today, so his work requires special skill.  As for technology, Gionis never uses an external flash, but shoots with video light (portable).  From any ordinary interior, the master can make a magical picture.  For a beautiful plot, he can use a variety of textures: guitar, mirror, cap, bouquet, candle, wreath, etc. </p><p>  Light is the most important thing for a good wedding photo.  The game of shadows and highlights is used by the photographer to the maximum.  Well, if it is complemented by a good idea and a thoughtful background.  Gionis uses either a wide-angle lens or a telephoto lens.  From his work, the photographer takes inspiration, energy, drive.  Today we can safely say that Jerry Gionis is a photographer from God. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jerry Gionis" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1261710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Little secrets </h2><p>  The photographer must speak less and show more, but without a camera in his hands.  Every professional should consider five key points: </p><ul><li>  shine; </li><li>  location </li><li>  pose </li><li>  exposure on the face; </li><li>  emotional condition. </li></ul><p>  Often, weddings are filmed indoors, so you need to maximize the use of light from windows for photos.  Lighting on the side gives texture.  The photographer needs to catch objects reflecting glare.  The body of the bride or groom is usually in a position from the light, and the face should be directed at him.  It is very good if the lighting will focus on the cheekbones.  Jerry Gionis leaves all sources open, does not close the windows. </p><p>  Not only the bride is the basis of the wedding photo.  The groom should not be shackled either.  For a man, the forward discharge of the body is very important in the photo.  The chest should be closer to the camera, the stomach is pulled in, the chin rises.  A good picture will be obtained near the window, if you select an open light source. </p>
