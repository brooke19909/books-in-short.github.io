Initially, this system was developed for the military, but in recent years, access to it has become open and free.  Only a special device is needed to receive signals from the satellite. </p><h2>  Benefits of Satellite Navigation </h2><p>  As known <noindex>  <span>GPS navigator</span> </noindex>  indispensable in any trip, and it has many advantages: </p><ul><li>  Free use. </li><li>  Highest accuracy (range of possible error 5 - 15 meters). </li><li>  No weather dependence. </li><li>  Regular system maintenance. </li><li>  The inclusion of the entire globe. </li></ul><h2>  Nuances when choosing satellite navigation </h2><p>  It is worth noting that a huge number of programs and related platforms have already been created for such devices.  Just the navigator software primarily depends on its choice and quality of work.  If the program is simple and legible, and the maps are as accurate as possible, then the road to the destination will be easy.  Often <noindex>  <span>travel compass</span> </noindex>  It works from the Internet, but there are many places where the World Wide Web has not yet reached, therefore it is more advisable to purchase devices from one of the following navigation programs: I Go, Garmin, Navitel. </p><p>  An important role during the selection belongs to the technical part of the device.  Volumetric and high-quality screen is more convenient for use, facilitates orientation, makes operation easy.  The road on it is drawn well, it can be seen in any light.  Pay attention to the functional features of the navigator, the amount of memory cards, processor specifications.  These parameters affect the speed and processing of paths. </p><p>  Before buying, think about how often the navigator will be used, whether one state map will be sufficient or if a whole set of different countries will be needed.  Also, the acquisition is affected by the cost of satellite navigation.  Not every traveler can afford expensive appliances; he has to be content with budget models. </p><p>  The choice depends on the type of device. </p><h2>  Types of Navigators </h2><ol><li>  Automotive systems. </li><li>  Devices for motorcycles. </li><li>  Portable devices. </li></ol><p>  Navigators for cars are popular, relevant, widespread in the markets.  They will help in determining the location, calculating the optimal route and in setting the speed. </p><p>  Motorcycle navigators are compact, high level of durability, weather resistance.  Since they are used primarily in motion, great navigation and ease of operation are important. </p><p>  Portable navigators are manual and informational.  The first category is small, comfortable to wear while walking and cycling.  The second group has additional functions: indicators of distance traveled and speed, pressure measurement and the number of calories burned. </p><p>  Taking into account the above features of the choice of satellite navigation, you will certainly make the most profitable and optimal purchase for you. </p></div></article>
