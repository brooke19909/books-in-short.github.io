Heliport is a somewhat remote, quiet and comfortable area, which will be an excellent choice for families with children.  Within walking distance of gardens and schools.  For many families, this will be a decisive factor. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov on Don new buildings" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2178378.jpg"></div>

These are three mid-rise houses, which represent a single architectural solution.  It becomes an excellent choice for those who choose the western housing estate of Rostov-on-Don - Heliport for living.  The construction was carried out according to the technology of frame-monolithic construction.  The walls are faced with dark brown and beige bricks.  All apartments in the houses are made for finishing, this is full glazing, floor screed and summing up all engineering systems.  Section A, B, C has already been commissioned. The number of sports facilities in the yard is gradually increasing. </p><h2>  Organization of the internal space of the LCD </h2><p>  The very nature of the picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHeliport in Rostov-on-Don has already done a lot.  The green massif is a source of fresh air and coolness in the summer.  But a lot of effort was made by developers to improve the territory.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe courtyard is 10254 m2, of which almost half is a green area. </p>

    <p>  Heliport Microdistrict is not located in the city center, so special attention was paid to the availability of a sufficient number of parking spaces so that residents did not have to worry about where to park the car.  Here, each member of the family will find what will be most valuable to him.  Children will enjoy playgrounds and sports grounds, while the older generation and young mothers will enjoy recreational areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  New buildings in Rostov-on-Don today are being built on the same principle.  Everything that is necessary for life should be within walking distance.  The large-scale development of the district provides residents with free access to all socially significant objects: kindergartens, schools, clinics and gyms, shopping and entertainment centers.  Convenient location due to good transport interchange allows you to get to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Many people choose housing next to work, here this is not particularly necessary.  You can easily get to your place of work on time. </p>

The first stage of the housing complex is sectional, in the form of the letter G. Today, the second stage is being prepared for delivery - an eight-section eight-story building with a basement and an attic.  The cost of apartments is in the range of 3.6-5.3 million rubles.  Using modern materials and technologies, the developers of the Heliport have transformed literally for several years, making it a modern and very attractive area for housing. </p><h2>  Information for future residents </h2><p>  The apartments are provided with everything necessary for life, and primarily central communications.  For the convenience of people, the territory of the complex is equipped with green spaces and playgrounds.

    <p>  The project provides for the construction of 16 residential buildings, as well as a school and a kindergarten.  To date, all residential buildings have been commissioned.  Judging by the reviews, people really like their area and apartments.  The cost of housing starts from 1 million 300 thousand rubles.  and ends 3 million 270 thousand rubles.  Many banks are readily engaged in housing loans in new buildings, so it will not be difficult to take a mortgage. </p><p>  The developer is LLC UK ‚ÄúRASSVET STROY INVEST‚Äù.  All apartments are rented turnkey.  The apartment is wired, there is an electric stove, plastic windows and interior doors, a laminate and wallpaper for painting.  The bathroom has plumbing and laid tiles. </p><h2>  LCD "Catherine" </h2><p>  We continue to consider new residential buildings in Rostov-on-Don.  Heliport today is one of the fastest growing areas of the city.  Here, one after another, new buildings are being erected.  LCD "Catherine" is a 2-section residential building.  There are three entrances to the site.  It is very convenient that the LCD is completely autonomous.  Heat supply is provided by an automated modular boiler room.  The basement has office space. </p>

    <p>  Today, the landscaping of the territory continues, playgrounds for games for young children, as well as for adults, have been designed.  The sale of apartments continues today, you can consider offers from 1 million 200 thousand rubles.  By the standards of Rostov-on-Don, this is the average price.  Therefore, apartments are sold out very quickly.  Moreover, there are very good lending programs that allow you to do with a minimum investment of cash. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  I would like to summarize and highlight the benefits that a person receives when buying an apartment in this area. </p><ul><li>  First of all, it is a convenient location.  Excellent transport interchange makes it easy to get to anywhere in the city without any problems. </li><li>  Great ecology.  The housing complex is remote from major highways and industrial zones.  Therefore, you can breathe clean air and enjoy the silence. </li><li>  Developed infrastructure.  There is everything that is necessary for life.  And both yours and the children. </li><li>  Reasonable prices.  These are not just words.  If you compare the cost of apartments in other areas, you will immediately understand the difference.  At the same time, quality remains at the highest level. </li></ul>
