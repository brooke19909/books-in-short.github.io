    <p>  There are not so many entertainments in the hotel itself - live music, billiards, darts, table tennis, day and evening animation.  There is luggage room. </p><p>  For tourists who come to relax with their children, there is everything you need - a children's room, <span>babysitting services</span> (for a fee) and a playground.  Chairs in the hotel restaurants with high backs, there is a children's menu.  A baby cot is available upon request. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Analyzing the opinions of tourists about the place to spend a vacation, we can conclude that many people choose trips to Cyprus.  Maria Apartments, reviews of which in most cases are only positive, are breaking records for the attendance of tourists from Russia. </p><p>  Vacationers note the high level of service, friendly and friendly staff who warmly welcome all travelers.  Many hotel workers speak good Russian. </p><p>  Tourists are satisfied with their stay at the hotel, the rooms correspond to the photos provided by tour operators. </p><p>  As for the kitchen, here, as they say, there are no comrades for the taste and color.  To some, the assortment of dishes seemed scarce, someone only had breakfast at the hotel, so the issue of nutrition did not arise so sharply. </p><p>  The proximity to the entertainment center of Ayia Napa for many tourists turned out to be an indisputable advantage when choosing a hotel, but there were also those vacationers who were not satisfied.  The reason for the negative impression was the constantly heard sounds of music from restaurants. </p><p>  In any case, everyone chooses a hotel based on their desires, tastes and preferences.  Maria Apartments is an option for young and energetic tourists who crave adventure and fun. </p>
