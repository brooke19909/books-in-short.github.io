    <p>  Rescuers are on duty around the clock on the beach.  The water in the sea is clean, without jellyfish and sea urchins. </p><h2>  Impressions of Venus Beach Hotel </h2><p>  The reviews left by those who are already lucky enough to relax in Cyprus help many tourists to navigate not only in choosing a hotel, but also in choosing a set of required services. </p><p>  ‚ÄúVenus Beach Hotel‚Äù on the <span>island of Paphos,</span> according to many, is a great place to spend a vacation with children and older people.  Young people here will be a little boring, because there is no animation and water activities on the beach. </p><p>  The food is varied and tasty.  True, some tourists are annoyed that they need to pour tea and coffee themselves. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are large and cleaned very well.  The staff is friendly, there are many workers from the countries of the former CIS, therefore, the Russians do not have a language barrier. </p><p>  Especially a lot of enthusiastic reviews about the sights, which in this city on the island of Crete abound. </p><p>  In general, opinions about the rest in this hotel are ambiguous: some like it, others believe that Venus Beach Hotel does not correspond to the declared category.  However, the hotel is always crowded, which means that positive reviews prevail over negative ones. </p>
