Alushta, Yevpatoriya, Koktebel, New World ... Each of the cities is surprisingly good and unique.  Each year hosts many guests.  But there are places on the coast that are not yet fully mastered by tourists.  They are distinguished by silence and calm.  This is their quiet charm.  One of such places on the Crimean peninsula is Novofedorovka.  This small village is located on the territory of the Saki region, 18 kilometers from Yevpatoriya. </p>

    <h2>  Village History </h2><p>  Judging by <span>archaeological excavations, an</span> ancient Greek settlement existed in the territory of a modern <span>urban-type settlement</span> five centuries BC.  Before the October Revolution, medicinal mud intended for the patient with hemophilia Tsarevich Alexei was delivered from the village to Livadia.  Until 1922, this place was not even indicated on maps, but already in 1926 it officially became part of the Tuzlynsky Village Council.  Since the 30s.  of the past century, the field airfield of the Kachinsky school of military pilots was based here.  In 1945, F. Roosevelt and W. Churchill arrived at the <span>Yalta Conference</span> ; their airplanes received this airdrome.  Also, after the war, they founded the "Saki-4" - an aviation garrison.  The military camp was closed and did not appear on any map.  Only in 1992, on the territory of the declassified garrison, was the settlement of urban settlement  Novofedorovka.  And in 1995, the Novofedorovsky Village Council appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location and climate </h2><p>  So, Crimea.

    <p>  The most famous attraction in the village of Novofedorovka (Crimea) is called NITKu - an aviation ground test training complex.  It has existed since the military past of the town of Saki-4.  It was the only such complex in the USSR.  Aviation and technical means were tested here, such as catapults, emergency barriers, optical and radio landing systems.  At its core, it is an airdrome in the form of a ship deck with a steel field.  By the way, pilot training takes place there in our time.  In August, performances by professionals. </p><p>  Also in the village is worth a visit to the Heroes Alley.  She perpetuates the memory of pilots - Heroes of the USSR.  Their bronze busts are also placed there.  In addition, it will seem interesting, especially to the boys, a monument to the Tu-22 crew, who died during a combat mission.  It is made just in the form of this bomber. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go on an excursion? </h2><p>  Since the city of Saki is not far away, it is worth visiting the excavations of the Evpatorion fortress.  Climbing the ruins is interesting for both children and adults.  There is an open-air museum Kara-Tobe.  On the basis of archaeological excavations, the manor of the first century BC was recreated, a Scythian village is being built.  There is an exposition of antiquities in the northwestern part of Crimea.  Here are ancient coins, household items, finds from the necropolises, ceramics, weapons. </p><h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Novofedorovka is almost surrounded by water.  Only the eastern part remains free.  And if in the west there are waters of the Kalamitsky Gulf, then in the north - Saki Lake, and in the south - Kyzyl-Yar.  Both of these reservoirs belong to salt lakes.  There are also a number of fresh ones.  High mineralization of water bodies makes the air in the village almost healing.  There are several curative mud deposits on the peninsula, but Sakskoye is perhaps the most famous.  Because Saki (Crimea), Novofedorovka and nearby villages so attract tourists who want to improve their body a little. </p>
