With it, you can create very beautiful things.  Women, and men, all over the world master this craft not only for crafts.  It soothes.  But in order to get things really not ordinary, many try to decorate them.  And for this reason they want to know how to crochet flowers.  At its core, these are small napkins.  Therefore, to make them is not difficult.  Now you will see this. </p><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  To master this needlework, you need to be able to read schemes and descriptions.  Crocheted flowers are no exception.  This craft is built on a specific alternation of air loops and posts. </p><p>  An air loop is a loop that does not touch the previous row of the product in any way.  She kind of hangs over him in the air.  In diagrams, it is indicated by a dot or oval, and in the descriptions - in.  P. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kettle with flowers" class="if uuid-2400791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2400791.jpg"></div><p>  Columns are loops that connect to the previous row.  The technique of their execution is as follows: hook with a.  The item is inserted into one loop near below and a working thread is stretched through it.  So on the instrument 2 loops are formed.  If you stretch the working thread immediately through the one that remained on the hook, you get a half-column.  If we separately knit them together, then we will just have a column (st. B / n. Or s. B / n.).  In the diagrams, it is indicated by a vertical bar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there is one or more stripes across it, this means that you need to knit a column with one or more yarn over (st. N.).  To do this, before you thread the tool into the previous row, you need to wind the working thread once or several times on it.  Then these loops are knitted in pairs, and the column itself is obtained the higher, the more yarn was crocheted. </p><h2>  Small and simple flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small flowers" class="if uuid-2403397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403397.jpg"></div><p>  So, a small flower crocheted, like most others, fits in a circle.  The work should begin with the ring, which is obtained from the first loop in the work.  Since the notation above is not quite typical, we will analyze it in more detail. </p><p>  In the first row you need to knit six single crochet, in the second - two of the same columns are made in each of them.  In the third row, you need to connect once or twice, then one column without a crochet.  This will form a dense core. </p><p>  Next, go to the petals.  This will be the last row in the work.  We make three air loops, three tbsp.  n  and a half-column.  Then another half-column and seven double crochets.  Repeat the last fragment four more times.  The last knit half-column and two tbsp.  n  at the same point as the first three with a chain of air loops.  Close the row with a half-column in the air loop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Do not be afraid of experiments </h2><p>  It's just that in a couple of minutes we figured out how to crochet flowers.  This scheme can be improved indefinitely by changing the number of columns and nakida in them in the petals.  You can make a pair of them, and in the center of the petal knit a chain of several in.  n. Also, these created flowers can be crocheted in two colors, and can remain monophonic.  It all depends on you and your imagination. </p><h2>  Openwork poppy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet poppy" class="if uuid-2400751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2400751.jpg"></div><p>  This flower will look quite airy, but no less attractive.  Its implementation requires some skills in this needlework, as a novice craftswoman can get confused in a large number of yarn.  But if you practice a little, then this scheme is easy to master. </p><p>  You need to start with a ring from the 6th century.  p. Next, you need to knit 3 tbsp.  n  with a common tip.  This is done in the same way as ordinary columns, but the last pair of loops does not knit before making the next crochet and introducing a hook into the previous row.  When all 3 columns are ready, there will be 4 working loops on the hook, which you need to knit together. </p><p>  After the columns you need to "put" on your side.  For this, a half-column is knitted at their base.  The third row is a chain of 5 century.  n., the fourth - Art.  2 n.  and 3 c.  n. After that, you can proceed to the creation of the petals.  The number of columns and yarn in them is indicated in the diagram.  The number 9 indicates the number in.  item in this section of the circuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You need to complete the flower by strapping it with two rows of single crochet columns. </p><h2>  Two large flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two circuits" class="if uuid-2400788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2400788.jpg"></div><p>  Now you already know how to read schemes.  Crochet flower descriptions presented in the photo above, we will do only in the most difficult moments. </p><p>  Both green and burgundy fit with the use of volume rows.  How to make them?  To insert a hook in order to knit a number of columns without a crochet, it is necessary not to the top of the finished part of the craft, but to the side on the front part.  It seems difficult only the first couple of loops, then you will adapt to do it pretty quickly.  In the diagrams, such rows are indicated by small arcs.  To keep the relief clear, the next row is knitted like this: the hook is threaded into the work surface from the wrong side.  In a green flower, this complex row is used to tie fans from 10 tbsp.  n., there are several of them in burgundy: two of them are in the pink circle in the diagram, the third is the penultimate one. </p><p>  The burgundy flower scheme is a bit more complicated, because it uses not typical notation for 3 double crochets with a common top, which are shown by an arc with the number 3. </p><p>  You need to start both jobs with a chain of 6 air loops. </p><h2>  Daisy flower </h2><p>  Crochet flowers can be knitted not only in a circle.  The next workshop will show how to make a camomile, which is obtained from braid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Workshop daisy" class="if uuid-2403456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403456.jpg"></div><p>  Since there is no graphic diagram of this flower in the photo, we will describe it in words.  You can choose the number of air loops for the petals yourself, because the size of the finished product will depend on this.  For example, take 12. </p><p>  In a chain of 12 century.  p. need to knit as much art.  n  When the first row is ready, continue to knit in a circle.  In the upper part of the petal you need to do 2-3 tbsp.  n at one point, so that it turns out to be semicircular in this place. </p><p>  When you return to the starting point of the product, dial another 12 in.  p. and repeat all the steps of knitting a petal.  So continue until you get the right amount of petals for the future flower.  Next, tie the inner edge near the single crochet and connect everything into a ring.  The camomile crown is ready.  The middle can be tied with crochets with their constant decrease to the center. </p><p>  Separately, make a core of yellow threads for the flower with simple single crochet.  Assemble both parts and your product is ready.  Now you have learned how to crochet flowers in a circle.  Consider another option for the example of a rose. </p><h2>  Volumetric rose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric rose" class="if uuid-2400747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2400747.jpg"></div><p>  The above photo shows a detailed and simple diagram for work.  We will try to describe the master class of the <span>volume flower crochet</span> further. </p><p>  It is immediately worth noting that the quantity in.  The item in this work depends on how magnificent you want to see the final result.  The left side of the diagram is the largest external petals.  They can be made 7-12.  Based on this, and calculate how many loops you need to dial for a start. </p><p>  This work is very simple, because on the basis of the initial chain you need to create several petals, which are then rolled up.  We describe the scheme from right to left - from smaller petals to large ones: </p><ul><li>  3 c.  item, 2 tbsp.  n., 2 in.  p., half-column; </li><li>  repeat the previous item; </li><li>  4 c.  item, 4 tbsp.  2 n., 3 in.  p., half-column; </li><li>  4 c.  item, 6 tbsp.  2 n., 3 in.  p., half-column; </li><li>  5 c.  item, 8 tbsp.  3 n., 4 in.  p., half-column; </li><li>  repeat the last element several times. </li></ul><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear that if you figure out how to crochet flowers, there‚Äôs nothing complicated.  Even the largest and most voluminous elements are made quite simply, without any tricks. </p><h2>  Where can i use </h2><p>  So you crocheted a beautiful small flower and think: what now to do with it?  They can decorate other products that you have already created: sweaters, dresses, sundresses, clothes for girls, tablecloths and pillowcases.  A variety of schemes allows you to create whole bouquets of interesting buds, which are then combined well in compositions with the help of applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Necklace with flowers" class="if uuid-2403526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403526.jpg"></div><p>  For example, a crochet flower for a hat will add a summer mood to this element of clothing, when all the buds have wilted and there are no bright colors in nature.  But even artificial flowers on hats, scarves or sweaters can significantly improve a person‚Äôs emotional background when gray, black and dirty shades of autumn or cold white in winter prevail around him. </p>
