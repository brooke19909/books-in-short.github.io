Illustrating a wonderful combination of modern trends and ancient traditions, the religious building is one of the main attractions of the United Arab Emirates.  Despite the fact that a vibrant work of architectural art has been erected today, its architectural value is very high. </p><h2>  Shrine open to the public </h2><p>  Jumeirah Mosque is considered one of the most beautiful.  Its appearance is regarded as a call for the development of cultural ties, the search for mutual understanding and the disclosure of the essence of Islam, as this is the only house of worship open to non-Muslims.  And the admission of Gentiles to the shrine is a big step on the road to strengthening relations between different countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jumeirah Mosque" class="if uuid-2554642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2554642.jpg"></div><p>  Muslim leaders claim that in this way many supporters can be attracted, revealing the essence of the religious movement.  It is no coincidence that numerous guides are happy to welcome tourists, take them to all halls, introduce them to the <span>basic commandments of Islam, and</span> talk about how to pray. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first stone of the future landmark was laid in 1975, and in November 1979 it was opened.  Built in the style of the medieval temples of the Fatimids (an Arab state that existed during the Middle Ages), the Jumeirah mosque is made of pink sandstone.  The luxurious complex, which modern technologies make it possible to look festive, consists of two seventy-meter minarets and a huge dome shining with golden color under the sun's rays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Luxurious decoration </h2><p>  According to the laws of the Koran, it is forbidden to decorate mosques with images of living beings, and you cannot find paintings inside a magnificent architectural masterpiece.  A fancy floral ornament and ornate Arabic letters were used as decoration.  On the floor is a huge carpet with floral patterns, hand-woven. </p><div class="photo" data-original="schwingeninswitzerland.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="luxurious decoration of a mosque" class="if uuid-2554648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2554648.jpg"></div><h2>  Religious and cultural monument </h2><p>  Now the Jumeirah Mosque in Dubai is not only a religious institution, but also a cultural one.  They explain the meaning of prayers to tourists, talk about the principles of communication with Allah, and Europeans who converted to Islam will gladly tell about life and life in the United Arab Emirates.  A fascinating excursion program lasts about an hour. </p><p>  In addition, everyone who wants to touch the local culture can enroll in courses where they teach the Arabic language and get acquainted with the ancient customs of the country. </p><h2>  Important tips for tourists </h2><p>  The operating Jumeirah mosque is a sacred place, and tourists need to adhere to certain rules.  For her visit, it is recommended to choose a closed form of clothing, knees and shoulders are forbidden to be exposed.  Women necessarily cover their heads with a scarf, and the servants of the house of worship can offer to wear abaya - a traditional Arabic dress with long sleeves.  Before entering, be sure to remove the shoes and put them in a special cabinet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All visitors, regardless of faith, undergo a ritual of water purification, which begins with washing the mouth and ends with washing the feet. </p><p>  Tourists are allowed to photograph the luxurious decoration of the building, but it is not recommended to aim the lens at worshipers.  It is forbidden to touch the holy books that stand on the shelves. </p><p>  In the evening, the mosque is especially beautiful: the special lighting installed on the snow-white walls makes the structure very attractive, emphasizing all the architectural elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="room5.trivago.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sacred place" class="if uuid-2554655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2554655.jpg"></div><p>  Small children are best left at home so as not to disturb the peace of worshipers. </p><p>  The Jumeirah Mosque, which can accommodate more than 1,300 believers, is open to Gentiles on Tuesday and Thursday, as well as on weekends.  However, during major Muslim holidays, visitor access is limited. </p><p>  Participants in a future excursion meet outside the meetinghouse, and prior reservations are not required.
